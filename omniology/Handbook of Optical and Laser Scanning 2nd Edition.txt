Preface
Optical and laser scanning is the controlled deflection of light, visible or invisible. The aim 
of Handbook of Optical and Laser Scanning, Second Edition, is to provide engineers, scientists, 
managerial technologists, and students with a resource to be used as a reference for under­
standing the fundamentals of optical scanning technology. This text has evolved from 
three previous books, Laser Beam Scanning (1985), Optical Scanning (1991), and Handbook of 
Optical and Laser Scanning (2004). Since their publication, many advances have occurred in 
optical scanning, requiring updating of previous material and introduction of additional 
scanning technologies. This new edition also adds a few chapters on scanning applica­
tions illustrating the practical use of scanning technology.
Optical and laser scanning is a topic that is extremely broad in scope. It encompasses the 
mechanisms that control the deflection of light, optical systems that work with these mech­
anisms to perform scanning functions, and factors that affect the fidelity of the images 
generated or obtained from the scanning systems. Each of these subtopics is addressed in 
this book from a variety of perspectives.
A scanning system can be an input or output system or a combination of both. Input 
systems acquire images in either two or three dimensions. These systems can operate at a 
fixed wavelength or over a broad spectrum. They can reacquire the original light source by 
gathering either the specular or diffuse reflection or by fluorescing the image and acquir­
ing the fluoresced light. Output systems direct light to produce images for applications 
such as marking, visual projection, and hard copy output. Ladar and many inspection sys­
tems use the same optical path to both illuminate the scene and acquire the image. A scan 
system requires not only optics but disciplines such as mechanics, electronics, magnetics, 
fluid dynamics, material science, acoustics, image analysis, firmware, software, and a host 
of others. This book brings together the knowledge and experience of 26 authors from 
England, Japan, and the United States.
The continuous and rapid changes in technological developments preclude the publi­
cation of a definitive book on optical and laser scanning. The contributors have accom­
plished their tasks painstakingly well, and each could have written a volume on his own 
particular subject. This book can be used as an introduction to the field and as a reference 
for persons involved in any aspect of optical and laser beam scanning.
Chapters 1 through 3 cover three basic scanning systems topics: Gaussian laser beam 
characterization, optical systems for laser scanners, and scanned image quality. Chapters 
4 through 7 cover aspects of monogonal (single mirror facet) and polygonal scanning sys­
tem design, including bearings. Chapters 8 and 9 discuss aspects of galvanometric and 
resonant scanning systems, including flexure pivots. Chapters 10 through 12 cover holo­
graphic, acousto-optical and electro-optical scanning systems. Chapters 13 and 14 cover 
piezoelectric scanners and scanning of optical disks. Chapters 15 and 16 cover two appli­
cations of optical scanning technology namely computer to plate (CTP), and underwater 
scanning. These chapters have been inserted to illustrate the significance of scanning in 
society today.

Preface to Laser Beam Scanning (1985)
To the memory of my parents Albert and Ethelena.
The aim of this volume is to provide engineers, scientists, and students with a guideline 
to the fundamentals of laser beam scanning. It brings together the knowledge and experi­
ence of seven specialists in the field, from England, Germany, Scotland, and the United 
States.
The book covers the recently developed holographic scanners, the well-established polyg­
onal scanners, and the galvanometric and resonant scanners. It includes complementary 
chapters on gas bearings for rotating scanning devices, the aerodynamic considerations of 
polygonal scanners, Gaussian laser beam diameters, and the optical design of components 
and systems relating to data storage on optical disks.

Preface to Optical Scanning (1991)
To Irene, my wife; children, Clare Margaret and Mark Peter; Guy Nicholas and Maria
Elizabeth, with love.
The aim of this volume is to provide application-oriented engineers and technologists, 
scientists, and students, with a guideline and a reference to the fundamentals of input and 
output optical scanning technology and engineering. It brings together the knowledge and 
experience of 16 international specialists from England, Japan, Scotland, and the United 
States. Brief biographies of the contributors are included. The Foreword and Afterword by 
Leo Beiser unify the selected topics of the 13 chapters, and give an overview evaluation of 
the technologies within the field of optical scanning engineering. Optical scanning tech­
nology is a comprehensive subject that encompasses not only the mechanics of controlling 
the deflection of a light beam but also all aspects that affect the imaging fidelity of the 
output data that may be displayed on a screen or recorded on paper.
A scanning system may be an input scanner, an output scanner, or a scanner that com­
bines both of these functional attributes. A system’s imaging fidelity depends on, and 
begins with, the reading of the input information and ends with the writing of the out­
put data. Optical scanning intimately involves a number of disciplines: optics, material 
science, magnetics, acoustics, mechanics, electronics, and image analysis, with a host of 
considerations.
The book covers Gaussian laser beam diameters and divergence, optical and lens design 
for scanning systems, and scanned image quality. It deals with rotary scanning devices 
and systems, namely, holographic scanners for bar code readers and graphic arts, polyg­
onal scanners, windage (i.e., the aerodynamic aspects), bearings, motors, and control 
systems associated with high-performance polygonal scanners. Optical Scanning treats 
oscillatory devices and systems; specifically, galvanometric and resonant low-inertia scan­
ners, acousto-optical, and electro-optical scanners, and modulators. It closes with optical 
disk scanning technology.
The dream is to produce a definitive book on optical scanning, but this is an impossi­
ble task to accomplish in this ever more rapidly changing era of technological develop­
ments. All the authors have done his best; each of them could have written a volume on 
his own special subject. The book is complete as an introduction to the field. With the 
common thread of the subject title, the disparate chapters are brought into perspective in 
the Afterword.
To assist the reader, measured quantities are expressed in dual units wherever possible 
and appropriate; the secondary units are in parentheses. The metric system takes prece­
dence over other systems of units, except where it just does not make good sense.
A strong effort has been made for a measure of uniformity in the book with respect 
to terminology, nomenclature, and symbology. However, with the variety of individual 
styles of the 16 contributing authors who are scattered across the Northern Hemisphere, 
I have placed greater importance on the unique contributions of the authors rather than 
on form.
I extend my thanks to the following persons: Brian J. Thompson, Provost of the University 
of Rochester, for his patient confidence in inviting me to produce this additional volume

Preface to Handbook of Optical 
and Laser Scanning (2004)
With gratitude to my wife, Irene, colleagues, and friends.
To the memory of my parents, Ethelena and Albert, brothers, Donald and Edward and sisters, 
Andrée and Kathleen.
Optical and laser beam scanning is the controlled deflection of a light beam, visible or 
invisible. The aim of Handbook of Optical and Laser Scanning is to provide application-
oriented engineers, managerial technologists, scientists, and students with a guideline 
and a reference to the fundamentals of input and output optical scanning technology and 
engineering. This text has its origin in two previous books, Laser Beam Scanning (1985) and 
Optical Scanning (1991). Since their publication, many advances have occurred, which has 
made it necessary to update and include the changes of the past decade. This book brings 
together the knowledge and experience of 27 international specialists from England, Japan, 
and the United States.
Optical and laser scanning technology is a comprehensive subject that encompasses not 
only the mechanics of controlling the deflection of a light beam, but also all aspects that 
affect the imaging fidelity of the output data that may be recorded on paper or film, dis­
played on a monitor, or projected onto a screen. A scanning system may be an input scan­
ner, an output scanner, or one that combines both of these functional attributes. A system’s 
imaging fidelity begins with, and depends on, the accurate reading and storage of the 
input information—the processing of the stored information—and ends with the presen­
tation of the output data. Optical scanning intimately involves a number of disciplines: 
optics, material science, magnetics, acoustics, mechanics, electronics, and image analysis, 
with a host of considerations.
The continuous and rapid changes in technological developments preclude the publica­
tion of a definite book on optical and laser scanning. The contributors have accomplished 
their tasks painstakingly well, and each could have written a volume on his own particu­
lar subject. This book can be used as an introduction to the field and as an invaluable ref­
erence for persons involved in any aspect of optical and laser beam scanning.
To assist the international scientific and engineering readership, measured quantities 
are expressed in dual units wherever possible and appropriate; the secondary units are 
in parentheses. The metric system takes precedence over other systems of units, except 
where it does not make good sense. A serious effort has been made for a measure of uni­
formity throughout the book with respect to terminology, nomenclature, and symbology. 
However, with the variety of individual styles from 27 contributing authors who are scat­
tered across the Northern Hemisphere, I have placed greater importance on the unique 
contributions of the authors than on form.
The chapters are arranged in a logical order beginning with the laser light source and 
ending with a glossary. Chapters 1 through 3 cover three basic scanning systems top­
ics: Gaussian laser beam characterization, optical systems for laser scanners, and scanned 
image quality. Chapters 4 through 7 cover aspects of monogonal (single mirror-facet) and 
polygonal scanning system design, including bearings. Chapters 8 and 9 discuss aspects

of galvanometric and resonant scanning systems, including flexure pivots. Chapters 10 
through 14 cover holographic, optical disk, acousto-optical, electro-optical scanning sys­
tems, and thermal printhead technology. A useful glossary of scanner terminology fol­
lows Chapter 14.

1.1  INTRODUCTION 
The M2 model is currently the preferred way of quantitatively describing a laser beam, 
including its propagation through free space and lenses; specifically, as ratios of its param­
eters with respect to the simplest theoretical gaussian laser beam. The present chapter 
describes the model and measuring techniques for reliably determining—in each of the 
two orthogonal propagation planes—the key spatial parameters of a laser beam; namely, 
the beam waist diameter 2W0, the Rayleigh range zR, the beam divergence Θ, and waist 
location z0.

1.2  HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF LASER-
BEAM CHARACTERIZATION
In 1966, six years after the first laser was demonstrated, a classic review paper1 by Kogelnik 
and Li of Bell Telephone Laboratories was published, which served as the standard reference 
on the description of laser beams for many years. Here the 1/e2 diameter definition1,2 for the 
width of the fundamental-mode gaussian beam was used. The more complex transverse 
irradiance patterns, or transverse modes, of laser beams were identified with sets of eigen­
function solutions to the wave equation, including diffraction, describing the electric fields 
of the beam modes. These solutions came in two forms: those with rectangular symmetry 
were described mathematically by Hermite–Gaussian functions, those with cylindrical sym­
metry by Laguerre–Gaussian functions. So with the appropriate basis set, any beam could 
be decomposed into a weighted sum of the electric fields of these modes, at least in principle. 
Mathematically, for this expansion to be unique the phases of the electric fields must be 
known. This is difficult at optical frequencies. Irradiance measurements alone, where the 
phase information is lost in squaring the E-fields, does not allow determination of the expan­
sion coefficients. This “in principle but not in practice” description of light beams was all that 
was available and seemed to be all that was needed for several succeeding years.
Workers often measured beam diameters by scanning an aperture across the beam to 
detect the transmitted power profile. Apertures used were pinholes, slits, or knife-edges, 
and the beam diameters were (and still are) defined based on the measurement effect that 
would be produced on a fundamental-mode beam. Commercial laser beams were speci­
fied as being pure fundamental mode, the lowest order or zero–zero transverse electro­
magnetic wave eigenfunction, “TEM00.”
In 1971, Marshall3 published a short note introducing the M2 factor, indicating M (=√M2) 
as the multiplying factor by which the diameter of a beam is larger than that of the funda­
mental mode of the same laser resonator. Marshall’s interest lay with the effects produced 
by industrial lasers and since they depend on focused spot size, he pointed out that they 
depend on M2. No discussion was given of how to measure M2 and the concept languished 
thereafter for several years.
From the late 1970s and into the 1980s, Bastiaans,4 Siegman,5,6 and others developed the­
ories of bundles of light rays at narrow angles to an axis based on the Fourier transform 
relationship between the irradiance and the spatial frequency (or ray-angle) distributions 
to account for the propagation of the bundle. Such a bundle of rays is a beam. The beam 
diameter was defined as the standard deviation of the irradiance distribution (now called 
the second-moment diameter, when multiplied by four), and the square of this diameter 
was shown to increase as the square of the propagation distance—an expansion law for 
the diameter of hyperbolic form. These theories could be tested by measuring just the 
beam’s irradiance profile along the propagation path.
In about 1987, one of us designed a telescope to locate a beam waist for an industrial CO2 
laser at a particular place in the external optical system. The design was based on measure­
ments showing where the input beam waist was located and on blind faith that the laser 
datasheet claim for a “TEM00” beam was correct. This telescope provided nothing like the 
expected result. Out of despair and disorientation came the energy to make more beam 
measurements and from these measurements came the realization that the factor that lim­
ited the maximum distance between the telescope and the beam waist it produced was 
exactly the same factor by which actual focus-spot diameter at the work surface exceeded

the calculated TEM00 spot diameter. That factor was M2 and when used in modified Kogelnik 
and Li equations, design of optical systems for multimode beams became possible.7 This 
ignited some interest in knowing more about laser beams than had previously been consid­
ered sufficient. Laser datasheets that claimed “TEM00” were no longer adequate.
In the 1980s, commercial profilers8 reporting a beam’s 1/e2 diameter became ubiquitous. 
By the end of the 1980s, experience with commercial profilers and these theories con­
verged with the development6 of the theoretical M2 model and a commercial instrument9 
to measure the beam quality based on it, which first became available in 1990. The time to 
determine a beam’s M2 value dropped from half a day to half a minute.
With high accuracy M2 measurements more readily available in the early 1990s, the report­
ing of a beam’s M2 value became commonplace, and commercial lasers with good beams 
were now specified10 as having M2 < 1.1. The International Organization for Standards 
began committee meetings to define standards for the spatial characterization of laser 
beams, ultimately deciding on the beam quality M2 value based on the second-moment 
diameter as the standard.11 This diameter definition has the best theoretical support, in 
the form of the Fourier transform theories of the 1980s, but suffers from being sensitive to 
noise on the profile signal, which often makes the measured diameters unreliable.12,13 That 
led to the development in 1993 of rules14 to convert diameters measured with the more for­
giving methods into second-moment diameters for a large class of beams.
The M2 model as commercially implemented does not cover beams that twist as they 
propagate in space, those with general astigmatism.15,16 The earlier Fourier transform the­
ories and their more recent extensions do, however, and allow for ten constants17 needed 
to fully characterize a beam (adding to the six used in the M2 model). Recently, in 2001, the 
first natural beam18 (as opposed to a test beam artificially constructed) was measured by 
Nemes et al. that required all ten constants for its complete description.
Several recommendations can be made for characterizing a beam. Model the beam only 
to the level of complexity appropriate to your needs: three constants suffice if the beam 
spot is round at all propagation distances; six constants cover beams with simple astig­
matism, divergence asymmetry, or waist asymmetry; ten constants are needed for beams 
with elliptical spots whose orientation twist in space (general astigmatism). Measure your 
beams with a reliable method, and when required, convert those values at the end into ISO 
standard units. Lastly, stay appraised of developments in instrumentation that may meet 
your need with more convenience, speed, and accuracy.
1.3  ORGANIZATION OF THIS CHAPTER
Section 1.2 provides an historical introduction to the field, outlining how the field devel­
oped to its present state.
The technical discussion begins in Section 1.4 by explaining the M2 model. This mathe­
matical model built around the quantity M2 (variously called the beam quality, times-
diffraction-limit number, or the beam propagation factor) describes the real, multimode beams 
that lasers produce and how their properties change when propagating in free space.
This discussion is continued in Section 1.5 covering the transformation of a beam through 
a lens. Section 1.6 explains the different methods used to define and measure beam diam­
eters, and how measurements made with one method can be converted into the values 
measured with one of the other methods. This includes the standard diameter definition

adopted by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO), the second-moment 
diameter, and the experimental difficulties encountered with this method.
The technical development continues in Section 1.7 where the logic and precautions 
needed in measuring the beam quality M2 are presented. Thoroughly discussed is the 
“four-cuts” method (a cut is a measurement of a beam diameter), the simplest way to obtain 
an accurate M2 value.
Section 1.8 discusses the common and possible types of beam asymmetry that may be 
encountered in three dimensions when the propagation constants for the two orthogonal 
(and usually independent) propagation planes are combined. The concept of the “equivalent 
cylindrical beam” is introduced to complete the technical development of the M2 model. 
Propagation plots for beams with combinations of asymmetries are illustrated. A short dis­
cussion follows of “twisted beams,” those with general astigmatism, which are not covered 
in the M2 model, and require a beam matrix of ten moments of second order for their com­
plete description. This second-order beam matrix theory is a part of the underpinnings of 
the ISO’s choice of the noise-sensitive second-moment diameter as the “standard.”
Section 1.9 applies the M2 model to an analysis of a stereolithography laser-scanning sys­
tem. Using results of earlier sections, by working backward from assumed perturbations 
or defects in the scanned beam at the work surface, the deviations in beam constants at the 
laser head that would produce them are found. An overview of the M2 model, in Section 
1.10, concludes the text.
A glossary follows explaining the technical terms used in the field, with the references 
ending the chapter.
1.4  THE M2 MODEL FOR MIXED-MODE BEAMS
In laser beam-scanning applications, the main concern is having knowledge of the beam 
spot-size—the transverse dimensions of the beam—at any point along the beam path. The 
mixed-mode (M2 > 1) propagation equations are derived as extensions of those for the funda­
mental mode, so pure modes and particularly the fundamental mode are the starting point.
1.4.1  Pure Transverse Modes: The Hermite–Gaussian 
and Laguerre–Gaussian Functions
Lasers emit beams in a variety of characteristic patterns or transverse modes that can occur 
as a pure single mode or more often, as a mixture of several superposed pure modes. The 
transverse irradiance distribution of a pure mode is the square of the electric field ampli­
tude versus the transverse distance from the beam axis, which when measured is termed a 
transverse profile. This amplitude is described mathematically by Hermite–Gaussian func­
tions if it has rectangular symmetry, or by a Laguerre–Gaussian function if it has circular 
symmetry.1,2,5,19 These functions when plotted reproduce the familiar spot patterns—the 
appearance of a beam on an inserted card—first photographed in Reference 20 and shown 
in References 1 and 19. Computed spot patterns are displayed here in Figure 1.1. The com­
putations were done in Mathematica for the first six cylindrically symmetric modes, in 
order of increasing diffraction loss for a circular limiting aperture. These modes are the 
solutions to the wave equation for a bundle of rays propagating at small angles (paraxial 
rays) to the z-axis, under the influence of diffraction and are of the general forms1,2,7

In Equation 1.1a, Hm(x/w)Hn(y/w) represents a pair of Hermite polynomials, one a function 
of x/w, the other of y/w, where x, y are orthogonal transverse coordinates and w is the radial 
scale parameter. In Equation 1.1b, Lpl(r/w, φ) represents a generalized Laguerre polynomial, 
a function of the r, φ transverse radial and angular coordinates. These polynomials have 
no dependence on the propagation distance z other than through the dependence w(z) in 
x/w, y/w, or r/w. The w(z) dependence describes the beam convergence or divergence. The 
other function u is the gaussian

Because the radial gaussian function splits into a product of two gaussians, one a function 
of x, the other of y, the Hermite–Gaussian function splits into the product of two functions, 
one in x/w only and the other in y/w only, each of which is independently a solution to the 
wave equation. This has the consequence that beams can have independent propagation 
parameters in the two orthogonal planes (x, z) and (y, z).
These functions of the transverse space coordinates consist of a damping gaussian fac­
tor, limiting the beam diameter, times a modulating polynomial that pushes light energy 
out radially as polynomial orders increase. The order numbers m, n of the Hermite poly­
nomials, or p, l of the Laguerre polynomial of the pure mode also determine the number 
of nodes in the spot pattern, for which the modes are named. They are designated as

transverse electromagnetic modes, or TEMm,n for a mode with m nodes in the horizontal 
direction and n nodes in the vertical direction, or TEMp,l for a mode with p nodes in a 
radial direction—not counting the null at the center if there is one—and l nodes in going 
angularly around half of a circumference. Figure 1.2a through f, show the theoretical beam 
irradiance profiles for the six pure modes from Figure 1.1. Because these are the six low­
est loss modes,21,22 they are commonly found in real laser beams. The modes as shown all 
originate in the same resonator—they all have the same radial scale parameter w(z). The 
addition of an asterisk to the mode designation—a “starred mode”—signifies a compos­
ite of two degenerate (same frequency) Hermite–Gaussian modes or as here, Laguerre–
Gaussian modes in space and phase quadrature to form a mode of radial symmetry. This 
is explained in Reference 20, discussed in Reference 5, p. 689, and shown in Figure 1.1 for 
a mode pattern with an azimuthal variation (l ≠ 0) as the addition of the mode with a copy 
of itself after a 90° rotation, to produce a smooth ring-shaped pattern.
The simplest mode is the TEM00 mode, also called the lowest order mode or fundamental 
mode of Figures 1.1 and 1.2a, and consists of a single spot with a gaussian profile (here Lpl

is unity). The next higher-order mode has a single node (Figures 1.1 and 1.2b) and is appro­
priately called the “donut” mode, symbol TEM*01. The next two “starred” mode spots look 
like a donut with larger holes, the spot pattern of the TEM10 mode looks like a target with a 
bright center, and the TEM*11  mode spot looks like a target with a dark center (Figures 1.1 
and 1.2). All higher-order modes have a larger beam diameter than the fundamental mode. 
The six pure modes of Figure 1.2 are shown with the vertical scale normalized such that 
when integrated over the transverse plane, each contains unit power.
The physical reason that Hermite–Gaussian and Laguerre–Gaussian functions describe 
the transverse modes of laser beams is straightforward. Laser beams are generated in reso­
nators by the constructive interference of waves multiply reflected back and forth along the 
beam axis. For this interference to be a maximum, permitting a large stored energy to satu­
rate the available gain, the returned wave after a round trip of the resonator should match 
the transverse profile of the initial wave. The functions that do this are the eigenfunctions 
of the Fresnel–Kirchhoff integral equation used to calculate the propagation of a paraxial 
rays with diffraction included.5,19 In other words, these are precisely the beam irradiance 
profiles that in propagating and diffracting maintain a self-similar profile, allowing after a 
round trip, maximum constructive interference and gain dominance.
1.4.2  Mixed Modes: The Incoherent Superposition of Pure Modes
While a laser may operate in a close approximation to a pure higher-order mode, for example, 
by a scratch or dust mote on a mirror forcing a node and suppressing a lower-order mode 
with an irradiance maximum at that location, actual lasers tend to operate with a mixture 
of several high-order modes oscillating simultaneously. The one major exception is lasing 
in the pure fundamental mode in a resonator with a circular limiting aperture, where the 
aperture diameter is critically adjusted to exclude the next higher-order (donut) mode. Each 
pure transverse mode has a unique frequency different from that for adjacent modes by tens 
or hundreds of MHz. This is usually beyond the response bandwidth of profile measuring 
instruments so any mode interference effects are invisible in such measurements.
Figure 1.2g shows a higher-order mode synthesized by mixing the five lowest order 
modes of Figure 1.2a through e in a sum with the weightings shown in the column labeled 
Σ. These weights—also called mode fractions—were chosen by a fitting program to match 
the result to the experimental pinhole profile (see Section 1.6.4.2) of Figure 1.2h. In the 
experiment14 the number of transverse modes oscillating and their orders were known (by 
detecting the radio-frequency transverse mode beat notes in a fast photodiode). This infor­
mation was used in the fitting procedure. The laser was a typical 1-m-long argon ion laser 
operating at a wavelength of 514 nm, except that a larger than normal intracavity limiting 
aperture diameter was used to produce this mode mixture.
Because the polynomials of Equation 1.1 have no explicit dependence on z, the profiles 
and widths of the modes in a mixture remain in the same ratio to each other and specifi­
cally to the fundamental mode as the beam propagates. This means that however the diam­
eter 2W of a mixed-mode beam is defined (several alternatives are discussed in Section 1.6), 
if this diameter is M times larger than the fundamental-mode diameter at one propagation 
distance, it will remain so at any distance:

1.4.3  Properties of the Fundamental Mode Related to the Beam Diameter
The attributes of the simplest beam, a fundamental mode with a round spot (a cylindrically 
symmetric or stigmatic beam) are reviewed in Figures 1.3 and 1.4. The beam profile varies as the 
transverse irradiance distribution and is given by the function of gaussian form1,2 (Figure 1.3a):

The symbol I denotes a detector signal proportional to irradiance (and by using I instead 
of E, the recommended symbol for irradiance, avoids confusion with the electric field 
of the beam). The peak irradiance is I0, and the radial scale parameter w introduced in 
Equation 1.1 can now be identified as the distance transverse to the beam axis at which the 
irradiance value falls to 1/e2 (13.5%) of the peak irradiance. This 1/e2 diameter definition, 
introduced1, 2 in the early 1960s, has been universally used since with one exception. (The 
one exception is in the field of biology where the fundamental-mode diameter is defined 
as the radial distance to drop to 1/e (36.8%) of the central peak value, making beams in 
biological references a diameter 2w′ = √2w instead of 2w.) Many different beam diameter 
definitions have been used subsequently for higher-order modes (these are discussed in 
Section 1.6) but they all share one common property: when applied to the fundamental-
mode, they reduce to the traditional 1/e2 diameter.
Tables of the gaussian function are usually listed under the heading of the normal dis­
tribution, normal curve of error, or Gauss distribution and are of the form (see p. 763 of 
Reference 23)

is easily remembered by noting that “the average irradiance is half the peak irradiance.” 
This is a handy, often-used simplification allowing the actual beam profile to be replaced 
by a round flat-topped profile of diameter 2w for back-of-the-envelope conceptualizations 
(see Figure 1.3b).
If the gaussian beam is centered on a circular aperture of diameter 2a the transmitted 
fraction T(a/w) of the total beam power is given by a similar integration5 over the cross-
sectional area as (see Figure 1.3c):

This gives a transmission fraction of 86.5% for an aperture of diameter 2w, and 98.9% for 
one of diameter 3w. In practice, a minimum diameter for an optic or other aperture to pass 
the beam and leave it unaffected is 4.6w to 5w to reduce the sharp edge diffraction ripples 
overlaid on the beam profile to an amplitude of <1%.5 It is interesting to note that for a low 
power, visible, fundamental-mode beam, the spot appears to be a diameter of about 4w to 
the human eye viewing the spot on a card.

The transmission of a fundamental-mode beam past a vertical knife-edge is also read­
ily computed. The knife-edge transmission function is T(x/w) = 0 for x′ < x, T = 1 for x′ > 
x, where x is the horizontal distance of the knife-edge from the beam axis and x′ is the 
horizontal integration variable. In Equation 1.4, the substitution r2 = x2 + y2 is made, the 
integration over y yields multiplication by a constant, and the final integration over x′ is 
expressed in terms of the error function as:

and is tabulated in many mathematical tables. The 1/e2 diameter of a fundamental-mode 
beam is measured with a translating knife-edge by noting the difference in translation dis­
tances of the edge (x1 − x2) that yield transmissions of 84.1% and 15.9%. By Equation 1.9 this 
separation equals w, and the beam diameter is twice this difference.*
1.4.4  Propagation Properties of the Fundamental-Mode Beam
The general properties expected for the propagation of a gaussian beam can be outlined 
from simple physical principles. As predicted by solving the wave equation with dif­
fraction, a bundle of focused paraxial rays converges to a finite minimum diameter 2w0, 
called the waist diameter. The full angular spread 𝜃 of the converging and, on the other 
side, diverging beam is proportional to the beam’s wavelength 𝜆 divided by the mini­
mum diameter,10 𝜃 ∝ 𝜆/2w0. A scale length zR for spread of the beam, is the propagation 
distance for the beam diameter to grow an amount comparable to the waist diameter, or 
zR𝜃 ~ w0, giving zR ∝ w0
2/𝜆. Because the rays of the bundle propagate perpendicularly to 
the wavefronts (surfaces of constant phase), at the minimum’s location the rays are parallel 
by symmetry and the wavefront there is planar. At large distances z − z0 from the waist 
diameter location at z0—the propagation axis is z—the wavefronts become Huygen’s wave­
lets diverging from z0 with wavefront radii of curvature R(z), and eventually become plane 
waves. Since the wavefronts are plane at the minimum diameter at the waist and at large 
distances on either side, but converge and diverge through the waist, there must be points 
of maximum wavefront curvature (minimum radius of curvature) to either side of z0.
The actual beam propagation equations describing the change in beam radius w(z) and 
radius of curvature R(z) with z, are derived1,2,5 as solutions to the wave equation in the com­
plex plane and show all of these features. They are (see Figure 1.4):

In these equations, the minimum beam diameter 2w0 (the waist diameter) is located at z0 
along the propagation axis z. A plot of w(z) versus z, beam radius versus propagation dis­
tance [Equation 1.11] is termed the axial profile or propagation plot and is a hyperbola. The 
scale length for beam expansion, zR, is termed the Rayleigh range [Equation 1.13] and has 
the expected dependence on 𝜆 and w0. The radius of curvature R(z) of the beam wavefront, 
as given by Equation 1.12, has the expected behavior. At large distances from the waist—
the region termed the “far-field”—and where |z − z0| >> zR the radius of curvature first 
becomes R → (z − z0) and then becomes plane when |R| → ∞ as |z − z0| → ∞, and also is 
plane at (z − z0) = 0. By differentiating Equation 1.12 and equating the result to zero the 
points of minimum absolute value of the radius of curvature are found to occur at z − z0 = 
±zR and have the values Rmin = ±2zR. The full divergence angle 𝜃 develops in the far-field, 
the beam envelope is asymptotic to two straight lines crossing the axis at the waist location 
(Figure 1.4). Finally, 𝜓(z) is the phase shift5,24 of the laser beam relative to that of an ideal 
plane wave. It is a consequence of the beam going through a focus (the waist), the gaussian 
beam version of the Gouy phase shift.24
By Equation 1.11, the diameter 2w(z) of the beam increases by the factor √2 (and for a round 
beam the cross-sectional area doubles) for a propagation distance ±zR away from the waist 
(Figure 1.4). This condition is often used to define the Rayleigh range zR,5,25 but another 
significant condition is that at these two propagation distances the wavefront radius of 
curvature goes through its extreme values (|R| = Rmin). The Rayleigh range can be defined 
as half the distance between these curvature extremes. The region within a Rayleigh range 
of the waist is defined as the “near-field” region. Within this region wavefronts flatten as 
the waist is approached and outside they flatten as they recede from the waist. A positive 
lens placed in a diverging beam and moved back towards the source waist will encounter 
ever-steeper wavefront curvatures so long as the lens remains out of the near-field. On 
the lens output side, the transformed waist moves away from the lens, moving qualita­
tively as a geometrical optics image would. When the lens enters the near-field region still 
approaching the source waist, ever-flatter wavefronts are encountered and then the trans­
formed waist also approaches the lens. The laser system designer who misunderstands 
this unusual property of beams will have unpleasant surprises. Many laser systems have 
undergone emergency redesign when prototype testing revealed this counter-intuitive 
focusing behavior! In many ways, Rayleigh range is the single most important quantity in 
characterizing a beam (notice that this is a factor in all of Equations 1.11 through 1.15). It 
will be shown in the next section that measurement of a beam’s Rayleigh range is the basis 
for measuring the beam quality M2 of a mixed-mode beam.
As the lowest order solution to the wave equation, the fundamental-mode with a gauss­
ian irradiance profile of a given waist diameter 2w0 is the beam of lowest divergence, at the 
limit set by diffraction,10 of any paraxial bundle with that minimum diameter. Confining 
a bundle to a smaller diameter proportionally increases—by diffraction—the divergence 
angle of the bundle, and the product 2w0𝜃 is an invariant for any mode. The smallest pos­
sible value, 4𝜆/𝜋, is achieved only by the fundamental mode. This is just the Uncertainty 
Principle for photons—laterally confining a photon in the bundle increases the spread of its 
transverse momentum and correspondingly the divergence angle of the bundle. This limit 
cannot be achieved by real-world lasers but sometimes it is closely approached. Helium–
neon lasers, especially the low-cost versions with internal mirrors (no Brewster windows),

are wonderful sources of beams within 1% or 2% of this limit. Aside from the wavelength, 
which must be known to specify any beam, the ideal, round, (stigmatic) fundamental-mode 
beam is specified by only two constants: the waist diameter 2w0 and its location z0 (or equiv­
alents such as zR and z0). This will no longer be true when mixed modes are considered.
As noted at the beginning of this section the propagation constants for the (x, z) and (y, z) 
planes are independent and can be different. In each plane, the rays obey equations exactly 
of the same form6 as Equations 1.11 through 1.15 with subscripts added indicating the x 
or y plane. For beams with pure (but different) gaussian profiles in each plane, two more 
constants are introduced for a total of four required to specify the beam. If z0x ≠ z0y (dif­
ferent waist locations in the two principal propagation planes) the beam exhibits simple 
astigmatism; if 2w0x ≠ 2w0y (different waist diameters) the beam has asymmetric waists.*
1.4.5  Propagation Properties of the Mixed-Mode Beam: 
The Embedded Gaussian and the M2 Model
In Section 1.4.2 a mixed mode was defined as the power-weighted superposition of sev­
eral higher-order modes originating in the same resonator, each with the same underlying 
gaussian waist radius w0 determining the radial scale length w(z) in their mode functions 
[Equations 1.1 and 1.2]. This underlying fundamental mode, with w0 fixed5 by the radii of 
curvature and spacing of the resonator mirrors, is called the embedded gaussian for that 
resonator regardless of whether or not the mixed mode actually contains some fundamental- 
mode power. To treat the mixed-mode case, use is made7 of the fact that its diameter is every­
where (for all z) proportional to the embedded gaussian diameter. From Equation 1.3 the 
­substitution w(z) = W(z)/M in Equations 1.11 through 1.15 yields the mixed-mode propaga­
tion equations:

The mixed mode, a sum of transverse modes with different optical frequencies, no longer 
has a simple expression for the Gouy phase shift analogous to Equation 1.15. The conven­
tion followed here is that upper case quantities refer to the mixed mode and lower case 
quantities refer to the embedded gaussian.
Also useful are the inverse forms of Equation 1.16a and Equation 1.17a expressing the 
waist radius W0 and waist location z0 in terms of the beam radius W(z) and wavefront cur­
vature R(z) at propagation distance z:

These forms are obtained from Reference 1, with the substitution w = W/M in their 
Equations 24 and 25.
Many of the properties of the fundamental-mode beam carry over to the mixed-mode one 
(Figure 1.5). Since W0 = Mw0, substitution of this in the middle part of Equation 1.19 yields the 
last part, the mixed-mode divergence is M times that of the embedded gaussian. Similarly, 
the beam propagation profile W(z) also has the form of a hyperbola (one M times larger) with 
asymptotes crossing at the waist location. The Rayleigh ranges are the same for both mixed 
and embedded gaussian modes as substituting W0 = Mw0 in the middle of Equation 1.18 
shows, so the radii of curvature and the limits of the near-field region are the same for both. 
The mixed-mode beam diameter still expands by a factor of √2 in a propagation distance of 
zR away from the waist location z0, the starting diameter W0 is just M times larger.
In considering propagation in the independent (x, z) and (y, z) planes, there are now two 
new constants needed to specify the beam, Mx
2 and My
2, for a total of six required con­
stants. In making up the mixed mode, the Hermite–Gaussian functions summed in the 
two planes need not be the same or have the same distribution of weights, making Mx
2 ≠ 
My
2 a possibility. In this case the beam is said to have divergence asymmetry since Θ ∝ M2 
by the first part of Equation 1.19.
It might be asked, why are these Equations 1.16 through 1.19 termed the “M2 model” 
(and not the “M model”)? There are two reasons. The first is that the embedded gauss­
ian is buried in the mixed-mode profile, and cannot be measured independently, mak­
ing it difficult to directly determine M. The mixed-mode diameter still grows by √2 in a

This is how M2 is in fact measured, the practical aspects of which will be discussed in 
Section 1.7. (As an aside, notice that Equation 1.20 shows that M2 scales as the square of 
the beam diameter; this is used later in the discussion of conversions between different 
diameter definitions in Section 1.6.4.)
The second reason is the more important one: M2 is an invariant of the beam, and is con­
served26 as the beam propagates through ordinary nonaberrating optical elements. Like 
the fundamental-mode beam whose waist diameter-divergence product was conserved, 
the same product for the mixed-mode beam is

Here 𝜃n = 2𝜆/𝜋W0 is recognized as the divergence of a fundamental-mode beam with a waist 
diameter 2W0, the same as the mixed-mode beam. This is called the normalizing gaussian; 
it has an M times larger scale constant W0 = Mw0 in its exponential term than the embedded 
gaussian and it would not be generated in the resonator of the mixed-mode beam. It does 
represent the diffraction-limited minimum divergence for a ray bundle constricted to the 
diameter 2W0. Thus by Equation 1.22 the invariant factor M2 can be seen to be the “times-
diffraction-limit” number referred to in the literature.5 This also identifies M2 as the inverse 
beam quality number, the highest quality beam being an idealized diffraction-limited one 
with M2 = 1, while all real beams are at least slightly imperfect and have M2 > 1.
The value of the M2 model is twofold. Once the six constants of the beam are accurately 
determined (by fitting propagation plot data for each of the two independent propagation 
planes) they can be applied by the system designer to accurately predict the behavior of the 
beam throughout the optical system before it is built. The spot diameters, aperture trans­
missions, focus locations, depths of field, and so forth can all be found for the vast majority 
of existing commercial lasers. The second value is that there are commercial instruments 
available that efficiently measure and document a beam’s constants in the M2 model. This 
permits quality control inspection of the lasers at final test, or whenever there is a system 
problem and the laser is the suspected cause. Defective optics can introduce aberrations 
in the beam wavefronts. If inside the laser, they increase M2 by forcing larger amounts of 
high-divergence, high-order modes in the mixed-mode sum. If outside the resonator, they 
also adversely affect M2. Measurement of the beam quality during system assembly, after 
each optic is added to detect a downstream increase in M2, can aid in quality control of the 
overall optical system.
Beams excluded from the model as described are those whose orthogonal axes rotate 
or twist about the propagation axis (called beams with general astigmatism15,16,27) such 
as might come from lasers with nonplanar ring or out-of-plane folded resonators. The 

16 
Handbook of Optical and Laser Scanning
symmetry of the beam is determined by the symmetry of the resonator. Fortunately, few 
commercial lasers produce beams having these characteristics. An overview of the full 
range of symmetry possibilities for laser beams is discussed in Section 1.8.3.
The fact that M2 is not unique, that is, that a given value of M2 can be arrived at by a 
variety of different higher-order modes or mode weights in the mixed mode is sometimes 
stated to be a deficiency of the M2 model. This is also its strength. It is a simple predictive 
model that does not require measurement and analysis to determine the mode content in a 
beam. In the evolution of beam models, the original discussion1,2 pointed out that as eigen­
functions of the wave equation, the full (infinite) set of Hermite–Gaussian or Laguerre–
Gaussian functions (Equation 1.1) describing the electric field of the beam modes form 
an orthonormal set. As such they could model an arbitrary paraxial light bundle with a 
weighted sum. This is true only if the phases of the E-fields are kept in the sum, and mea­
suring the phase of an optical wave generally is a difficult matter. Summing the irradiances 
(the square of the E-fields) breaks the orthonormality condition and for years it was not 
obvious that a simple model relying only on irradiance measurements was possible. Then 
in the 1980s, methods based on Fourier transforms of irradiance and ray angular distribu­
tions of light bundles were introduced,4,6 which showed that as far as predictions of beam 
diameters in an optical system were concerned, irradiance profile measurements would 
(usually) suffice. The M2 model was born, and commercial instruments10 for its application 
soon followed. Later we realized that modes “turn on” in a characteristic sequence as dif­
fraction losses are reduced in the generating resonator. This makes a given M2 correspond 
to a unique mode mix in many common cases after all (see Section 1.6.4).
1.5  TRANSFORMATION BY A LENS OF FUNDAMENTAL 
AND MIXED-MODE BEAMS
Knowledge of how a beam is transformed by a lens is not only useful in general, but in 
particular, a lens is used to gain an accessible region around the waist for the measure­
ments of diameters that are analyzed to produce M2 (see Section 1.7). This transformation 
is discussed next.
In geometrical optics a point source at a distance s1 from a thin lens produces a spheri­
cal wave whose radius of curvature is R1 at the lens (and whose curvature is 1/R1), where 
R1 = s1. In traversing the lens, this curvature is reduced by the power 1/f of the lens (f is the 
effective focal length of the lens) to produce an exiting spherical wave of curvature 1/R2 
according to the thin lens formula:

(1.23)
An image of the source point forms at the distance R2 from the lens from convergence of 
this spherical wave. Note that the conventions used in Equation 1.23 are the same as in 
Equation 1.17, namely, the beam always travels from left to right, converging wavefronts 
with center of curvature to the right have negative radii, and diverging wavefronts with 
centers to the left have positive radii. [The usual convention in geometrical optics28 is that 
converging wavefronts leaving the lens are assigned positive radii, which would put a 
minus sign on the term 1/R2 of Equation 1.23.]

Characterization of Laser Beams: The M2 Model 
17
The quantities used in the beam-lens transform are defined in Figure 1.6. Following 
Kogelnik1 the beam parameters on the input side of the lens are designated with a subscript 
1 (for “1-space”) and on the output side with a subscript 2 (for “2-space”). The principal plane 
description28 of a real (thick) lens is used, in which the thick lens is replaced by a thin one 
acting at the lens principal planes H1, H2. Rays between H1 and H2 are drawn parallel to the 
axis by convention, and waist locations z01 and z02 are measured from H1 and H2 respectively 
(with distances to the right as positive for z02 and distances to the left as positive for z01).
A lens inserted in a beam makes the same change in wavefront curvature as it did in 
geometrical optics [Equation 1.23], but the wavefront R2 converges to a waist of finite diam­
eter 2W02 at a distance z02 given by Equation 1.17b. For each of the two independent propa­
gation planes, there are three constants required to specify the transformed beam, and 
three constraints needed to determine them. The lens should be aberration-free (typically, 
used at f/20 or smaller aperture) and, if so, the beam quality is not changed in passing 
through it, giving the first condition M

. The second constraint is that the wavefront 
curvatures match, between the input curvature modified by the lens [Equation 1.23], and 
the transformed beam at the same location as specified by the transformed beam constants 
through Equation 1.17a. A beam actually has two points with the same magnitude and 
sign of the curvature, one inside the near-field region of that sign and one outside, which 
differ in beam diameters. The ambiguity as to which point is matched is removed by the 
third constraint, that the beam diameter is unchanged in traversing the (thin) lens.
These three constraints define three equations that next are solved for the transformed 
waist diameter and location. This is facilitated by Equations 1.16b and 1.17b for W0 and z0 as 
functions of W(z) and R(z). The solution1,29–31 is written in terms of the transformation constant

Handbook of Optical and Laser Scanning
The transform equations [Equations 1.24 through 1.28] are not as simple as in geometri­
cal optics because of the complexity of the way the beam wavefront curvatures change 
with propagation distance, Equation 1.17a. Like the image and object distances in geomet­
rical optics, the transformed beam waist location depends on the input waist location—
but also depends, as does the wavefront curvature, on the Rayleigh range of the input 
beam. The most peculiar behavior as the waist-to-lens distance varies is when the input 
focal plane of the lens moves within the near-field of the incident beam, |z01 − f| < zR1. 
Then the slope of the z02 versus z01 curve turns from negative to positive (in geometrical 
optics the slope of the object to image distance curve is always negative). This sign change 
can be demonstrated by substituting Equation 1.24 into Equation 1.28 and differentiating 
the result with respect to z01. As the lens continues to move closer to the input waist, the 
transformed waist location also moves closer to the lens, exactly opposite to what hap­
pens in geometrical optics. In the beam-lens transform, the input and transformed waists 
are not images of each other (in the geometrical optics sense). Despite the intransigence 
of beam waists, the object–image relationship of beam diameters at conjugate planes on 
each side of the lens does apply just as in geometrical optics. A good modern discus­
sion of the beam-lens transform is presented in O’Shea’s textbook32 (where his parameter 
𝛼2 = Γ here).
A pictorial description of the beam-lens transform is given by a figure in Reference 30, 
redrawn here as Figure 1.7. Variables normalized to the lens focal length f are used to show 
how the transformed waist location z02/f varies with the input waist location z01/f. The 
input Rayleigh range zR1/f (also normalized) is used as a parameter and several curves are 
plotted for different values. The anomalous slope regions of the plot are evident. The geo­
metrical optics thin lens result, Equation 1.23, is recovered when the input Rayleigh range 
becomes negligible, zR1/f = 0 (the condition for a point source), and the slopes of both wings 
of the curve are then always negative.
1.5.1  Application of the Beam-Lens Transform to the Measurement of Divergence

gence of the input beam Θl in 1-space of Figure 1.6 can be determined by measuring the

which is Equation 1.29. In Figure 3b of Reference 25 there is an illustration showing 
how the transform equations operate to keep the output beam diameter one focal length 
from the lens fixed at the value Θ1 f despite variations in the input waist location, z01. The 
measurement method implied by Equation 1.29 is the simplest way to get a good value 
for the beam divergence Θ1. Care should be taken to pick a long enough focal length lens 
that the beam diameter is large enough for the precision of the diameter-measurement 
method in use.
1.5.2  Applications of the Beam-Lens Transform: The Limit of Tight Focusing
When the aperture of a short focal length lens is filled on the input side, the smallest possi­
ble diameter output waist is reached and this is called the limit of tight focusing. This limit 
is characterized by (1) the beam diameter at the lens being given by 2Wlens = Θ2f; (2) the out­
put waist being near the focal plane z02 = f; and (3) there being a short depth of field at the 
focus, zR2/f ≪ 1. Applying Equation 1.29 in the reverse direction gives the 2-space diver­
gence as the ratio of the beam diameter 2W1f at f to the left of the lens, to the focal length, 
Θ2 f = 2W1f. By condition (1) this means 2W1f = 2Wlens or that there is little change in the input 
beam diameter over a propagation distance f. That makes the first condition characterizing 
the tight focusing case equivalent to zR1/f ≫ 1. Then from Equation 1.19,

for the tight focusing limit. Here Siegman’s definition5 is used that a lens of diameter Dlens 
is filled for a fundamental-mode beam of diameter 𝜋Wlens (this degree of aperture filling 
produces <1% clipping of the beam). Thus f/𝜋Wlens = f/Dlens = (f/#). The depth of field of the 
focus is zR2 =  𝜋W02
2/M2𝜆 = 𝜋M2𝜆(f/#)2. This generalizes a familiar result5 for a fundamen­
tal-mode beam to the M2 ≠ 1 case.

Marshall’s point3 (from 1971) is made by Equation 1.30, that a higher-order mode beam 
focuses to a larger spot by a factor of M2, with less depth of field, and therefore cuts and 
welds less well than a fundamental-mode beam.

1.6  BEAM DIAMETER DEFINITIONS FOR 
FUNDAMENTAL AND MIXED-MODE BEAMS
It has been said that the problem of measuring the cross-sectional diameter of a laser beam 
is like trying to measure the diameter of a cotton ball with a pair of calipers. The difficulty 
is not in the precision of the measuring instrument, but in deciding what is an acceptable 
definition of the edges.
Unlike the fundamental-mode beam where the 1/e2 diameter definition is universally 
understood and applied, for mixed modes a number of different diameter definitions7 
have been employed. The different definitions have in common that they all reduce to the 
1/e2 diameter when applied to an M2 = 1 fundamental-mode beam, but when applied to 
a mixed mode with higher-order-mode content they in general give different numerical 
values. As M2 always depends on a product of two measured diameters, its numerical 
value changes also as the square of that for diameters. It is all the same beam, but different 
methods provide results in different currencies; one has to specify what currency is in use 
and know the exchange rate.
Since the adoption11 by the ISO committee on beam widths of the second-moment diam­
eter as the standard definition for beam diameters, there has been increasing effort among 
laser users to put this into practice. This definition, discussed in Section 1.6.3.5, has the 
best analytical and theoretical support but is difficult experimentally to measure repro­
ducibly because of sensitivity to small amounts of noise in the data. The older methods 
therefore persist and the best strategy25 at present is to use the more forgiving methods for 
the multiple diameter measurements needed to determine M2. Then at one propagation 
distance, do a careful diameter measurement by the second-moment definition to provide 
a conversion factor. This conversion factor can then be applied to obtain standardized 
diameters at any distance z in the beam. This strategy will likely evolve in the future if and 
when instrument makers respond to the ISO Committee’s choice and devise algorithms 
and direct methods for ready and accurate computations of second-moment diameters.
1.6.1  Determining Beam Diameters from Irradiance Profiles
Beam diameters are determined from irradiance profiles, the record of the power trans­
mitted through a mask as a function of the mask’s translation coordinate transverse to

the beam. A sufficiently large linear power detector is inserted in the beam, with a uni­
formly sensitive area to capture the total power of the beam. Detection sensitivity should 
be adequate to measure ~1% of the total power, and response speed should allow faithful 
reproduction of the time-varying transmitted power. The mask is mounted on a transla­
tion stage, placed in front of the detector, and moved or scanned perpendicularly to the 
beam axis to record a profile. An instrument that performs these functions is called a 
beam profiler. In a useful version based on a charge-coupled-device (CCD) camera, the 
masking is done on electronic pixel data under software control.
The beam propagation direction defines the z-axis. The scan direction is usually along 
one of the principal diameters of the beam spot and commercial profilers are mounted to 
provide rotation about the beam axis to facilitate alignment of the scan in these directions. 
The principal diameters for an elliptical spot are the major and minor axes of the ellipse 
(or the rectangular axes for a Hermite–Gaussian mode). The principal propagation planes 
(x, z) and (y, z) are defined as those containing the principal spot diameters. The beam 
orientation is arbitrary and in general may require rotation of coordinates to tie it to the 
laboratory reference frame. It is assumed this rotation is known, and without loss of gen­
erality to give simple descriptive terminology in this discussion, here the z-axis is taken 
to be horizontal, the principal propagation planes as the horizontal and vertical planes 
in the laboratory, with the scan along the x-axis. If the mask requires centering in the 
beam (e.g., a pinhole) to find the principal diameter, it is mounted on a y-axis stage as well 
and x-scans at different y-heights taken to determine the widest one at the beam center. 
Alternatively, a mirror directs the beam onto the profiler and the spot is put at different 
heights to find the beam center by tipping the mirror about a horizontal rotation axis. If 
the beam is repetitively pulsed and detected with an energy meter, the stage is moved in 
increments between pulses. If a CCD camera is the detector, a scan line is the readout of 
sequential pixels and no external mask is required in front of the camera. A CCD camera 
generally requires a variable attenuator33 inserted before the camera to set the peak irra­
diance level just below the saturation level of the camera for optimum resolution of the 
irradiance value on the ordinate axis of the profile.
The results of this process are irradiance profiles such as shown in Figure 1.8 for two 
pure modes, the fundamental mode in the first row and the donut mode in the second, 
where three scans are calculated for each, one for a pinhole (first column), a slit (second col­
umn), and a knife-edge (third column) as masks. The traditional definitions used to extract 
diameters from these profiles are the same for the pinhole and slit. This is to normalize the 
scan to the highest peak as 100%, then to come down on the scan to an ordinate level at 1/e2 
(13.5%) and measure the diameter—or clip width—as the scan width between these cross­
ing points (called clip levels or clip points and shown as dots in Figure 1.8). The symbols 
Dpin and Dslit are used for these two diameters. For the knife-edge diameter (symbol Dke) 
the definition is to take the scan width between the 15.9% and 84.1% clip points and double 
it, as this rule produces the 1/e2 diameter when applied to the fundamental mode.
As shown in Figure 1.8 the diameter results for the donut mode (TEM*01) are all larger 
than the 2w diameter of the fundamental mode, as expected. However, the answers for the 
three different methods for the donut mode—and in general, for all higher-order modes—
are all different! The ratio of the donut mode to fundamental-mode diameter is 1.51, 1.42, 
and 1.53 by the pinhole, slit, and knife-edge methods, respectively. The reason, obviously, is 
that traces of different shapes are produced by the different methods. The pinhole cuts the 
donut right across the hole and records a null at the center; the slit extends vertically across 
the whole spot and records a transmission dip in crossing the hole but never reaches zero 
due to the contribution of the light above and below the hole. Even higher transmission

results with the knife-edge and here the donut profile differs from the fundamental one 
only in being less steeply sloped (the spot is wider) and having slight inflections of the 
slope around the hole at the 50% clip point, the beam center.
There are two other two common definitions. The first is the diameter of a circular 
aperture giving 86.5% transmission when centered on the beam. It is variously called the 
variable-aperture diameter, the encircled power diameter, or the “power-in-the-bucket” 
method, and designated by the symbol D86. The last is the second-moment diameter, 
defined as four times the standard deviation of the radial irradiance distribution recorded 
by a pinhole scan, and designated by the symbol D4𝜎. For the ratio of donut mode to fun­
damental-mode diameters, these definitions give 1.32 and 1.41 respectively, also different 
from the three other values above.
After the discussion of some common considerations (Section 1.6.2), these five diameter 
definitions are evaluated in Section 1.6.3 leading to the summary given in Table 1.1.
1.6.2  General Considerations in Obtaining Useable Beam Profiles
Five questions are important in evaluating what beam diameter method is best for a given 
application:
	
1.	How important is it to resolve the full range of irradiance variations? Only a pinhole scan 
(or its near equivalent, a CCD camera snapshot read out pixel by pixel) shows 
the full range, but this is not of significance in some applications, for example, 
where the total dose of light delivered is integrated in an absorber.
	
2.	How important is it to use a method that is insensitive to the alignment of the beam 
into the profiler? If the test technician cannot be relied on to carefully center the 
beam on the profiler, the slit or knife-edge methods still give reliable results,

but not the other methods. With a CCD camera there is a trade-off between 
alignment sensitivity and accuracy. For best accuracy, a magnifying lens—of 
known magnification—can be placed in front of the camera to fill the max­
imum number of pixels, but then the camera becomes somewhat alignment 
sensitive.
	
3.	With what accuracy and repeatability is the diameter determined? The amount of light 
transmitted by the mask determines the signal-to-noise ratio of the profile and 
ultimately answers the question. The methods based on a pinhole scan (Dpin, D4𝜎, 
and CCD cameras) suffer from low light levels in this regard. On the other hand, a 
laser beam is generated in a resonator subject to microphonic perturbations, mak­
ing the beam jitter in position and the profile distort typically by about 1% of the 
beam diameter, so that a greater instrument measurement accuracy is usually not 
significant.
	
4.	Is the convolution error associated with the method significant? The convolution error 
is the contribution to the measured diameter due to the finite dimensions of 
the scan aperture, either the diameter H of a pinhole or width S of a slit. A 
10-micron focused spot cannot be accurately measured with a pinhole of 50-mi­
cron diameter. The distortion of a pinhole profile of a fundamental mode is shown 
in Figure 1.9a as a function of the ratio of hole diameter to the mode width H/2w. 
The peak amplitude drops and a slight broadening occurs as H/2w increases. The 
central 100% peak amplitude point is “washed out” or averaged to a lower value 
in the profile by the sampling of lower amplitude regions nearby as the finite 
diameter pinhole scans across the center as Figure 1.9b indicates. The reduction 
in peak amplitude of the convoluted profile is like lowering the clip level below 
13.5% on the original profile: the measured diameter becomes larger. Very simi­
lar profile distortions occur with a slit scan as a function of S/2w; here S is the silt 
width. The ratio of the measured width including this convolution error to the 
correct width is plotted in Figure 1.9c for the pinhole (H) and slit (S). This gives 
the rule of thumb for pinhole scans: to keep the error in the measured diameter to 
1% or less, keep the pinhole diameter H to one-sixth or less of 2w, that is, H < w/3. 
The corresponding rule34 for slits is the measured diameter is in error by <1% if 
the width S is 1/8 or less of 2w. For modes like TEM10 of Figure 1.2d with a fea­
ture (the central peak) narrower than that of the fundamental mode, the aperture 
widths H or S should be no bigger than these same fractions of the narrow fea­
ture’s width. (Note, McCally34 uses the biologist’s definition of 1/e clip points for 
the fundamental-mode diameter, a factor 1/√2 smaller than our 1/e2 diameter; his 
results require conversion.)
Distortion of the profile can be a more subtle effect and can give misleading results. When 
measuring a predominantly TEM*01 focused beam through the waist region, for exam­
ple, a pinhole profiler will at first show the expected trace, with a dip in the middle like 
Figure 1.8d or e. This will change to one with a central peak as in Figure 1.8a at the propa­
gation distance along the beam where the pinhole is no longer small compared to the beam 
diameter. The donut hole can fall through the pinhole!
Convolution errors are a concern normally only when working with focused beams, as 
when measuring divergence by the method of Section 1.5.1. Generally, however, it is desirable 
to go to the far-field, reached by working in 2-space at the focal plane behind an inserted lens, 
to obtain a true (undistorted) profile. The beam coming out of the laser often has “diffractive 

Characterization of Laser Beams: The M2 Model 
25
overlay,” low-amplitude high-divergence light diffracted from the mode-limiting internal 
aperture, overlaid on the main beam. The resulting interference can significantly distort the 
profile, even at <1% amplitude of the diffracted light. It is the E-fields that interfere; for an 
irradiance I = E2 overlaid by a 0.01 E2 distorting component, the E-fields add and subtract 
as E ± 0.1 E at the interference peaks and valleys. The resulting fringe contrast ratio, Ipeak/
Ivalley = [(1.1)/(0.9)]2 = 1.49 is a significant distortion to the profile even though the power in the 
diffractive overlay is insignificant. Moving the profiler some distance away from the output 
end of the laser spreads the diffractive overlay rapidly compared to the beam expansion, but 
often several meters additional distance is required. This leaves the use of a lens to reach the 
far-field as the answer, and convolution distortion then must be dealt with.
Aligning a small-diameter (e.g., 10 micron) pinhole to a small (e.g., 100 micron)-focused 
spot is another problem. The search time to achieve overlap and some transmitted signal 
for peaking alignment can be very long if done manually, so having a fast update rate— 
10 scans a second is good—provided by commercial instruments can be a major aide. 
Some instruments9 have electronic alignment systems to facilitate finding the overlap of 
small pinhole and small beam.
Knife-edges have no convolution error to the extent that they are straight (razor blades 
are straight8 to <2 microns deviation over 1000 microns length). The circular aperture of 
the encircled power method is usually a precision drilled hole and has no convolution

error so long as it is accurately round and made in a material much thinner than the hole 
diameter (to avoid occultation error).
	
5.	Are the diameter measurements along the propagation path free of discontinuities and 
abrupt changes? Consider making many diameter measurements along the propa­
gation axis, and fitting the data to a hyperbola to find the beam’s Rayleigh range 
and beam quality. Discontinuities in the data will make a poor fit and final result. 
Such discontinuities can arise35 with the 1/e2 clip-level diameter definitions with 
mixed modes with low peaks on the edges, as in Figure 1.2g, only lower. As the 
mode mixture changes to bring the outer peaks near the clip level, the measured 
diameter can jump from the separation of the outer peaks of the profile to the width 
of the central peak as amplitude noise perturbs the profile. Similarly, for a mixed 
mode with rectangular symmetry, as azimuth is continuously changed from the 
major principal plane direction towards the minor one, the relative amplitude of 
the outermost peaks of the profile can drop.35 The clip point then can jump discon­
tinuously with perturbing noise when the height is near the clip level. Only Dpin 
and Dslit are subject to this difficulty.
This last question can be rephrased to ask, is the diameter definition readable by a machine? 
A human observer will notice an outer peak of height near the clip level causing the pro­
filer readout to fluctuate, and correct the situation by adjusting the mode mixture, the 
azimuth, or the clip level. A machine will take the bad data in, and produce unreliable 
results. When a lot of diameter data needs to be gathered, as in measuring a propagation 
plot to determine M2, automated machine data acquisition is desirable. In this regard, the 
knife-edge diameter is best, as it always produces an unambiguous monotonic trace for all 
higher-order and mixed modes.
1.6.2.1  How Commercial Scanning Aperture Profilers Work
Commercial profilers8 typically use the 1/e2 diameter definition with pinhole and slit 
masks, and occasionally will report an incorrect diameter due to the “not entirely machine 
readable” defect of these definitions. These profilers use a rotating drum to carry a slit 
or pinhole mask smoothly and rapidly (typically at a 10 Hz repetition rate) in front of a 
large area detector inserted into the drum. On the first pass through the laser spot, the 
electronics remembers the 100% signal level, and on the second pass when the 13.5% clip 
level is crossed as the signal rises, a counter is started. This counts the angular increments 
of drum motion from an angular encoder, which when multiplied by the known drum 
radius, provides the mask translation in spatial increments of 0.2 microns. (In newer, high 
precision designs discussed in the next paragraph this increment has been reduced to 0.01 
microns.) When the clip level is passed as the signal falls, the counter is stopped and the 
value of the beam diameter—total counts times spatial increment—is reported. Actually, 
what is reported on the digital readout is an average selected by the user of the last two to 
20 measurements, to slow the report rate down to what can be read visually. If a pure donut 
mode is scanned with the pinhole version of this instrument [the profile of Figure 1.8d], the 
counter starts at the clip-level dot on the left (x/w = −1.51) but stops as the falling clip level 
is met at the left edge of the donut hole (x/w = −0.16). The scan continues and the counter 
turns on again as the clip level is passed with the rising signal at the right edge of the donut 
hole (x/w = +0.16), because the drum has not completed a revolution to reset the counter 
for a new measurement. Finally, the counter turns off again at the rightmost ­clip-level dot 

Characterization of Laser Beams: The M2 Model 
27
(x/w = +1.51), and the diameter reported is the actual diameter minus the width of the hole 
at the clip-level height, an error of about −11%. This possible error usually goes unnoticed 
because the dips in mixed-mode profiles do not often go as low as 13.5%.
In recent years scanning aperture profilers have been mechanically upgraded to pro­
vide more precision (0.01 micron spatial resolution) and interfaced with PC controllers 
to provide more features in addition to beam diameter: full 12-bit digitized profiles and 
the D4𝜎 diameters calculated from them (not just clip widths and analog traces), profile 
peak position, centroid position, spot ellipticity (with slit or knife-edge profilers carrying 
two orthogonal apertures), and even absolute power (when so calibrated). With micron-
sized apertures and submicron sampling, beam diameters of 5 microns can be measured 
to 2% accuracy. As before, different detector types (silicon, germanium, or pyroelectric) 
cover wavelengths from UV to Far IR. Beams pulsed at repetition frequencies down to 
1 kHz can be measured with profilers having user-controlled variable scan speed (drum 
speeds are slowed to intercept enough pulses to build up the profile). In addition they can 
measure beams without attenuation, as compared to camera-based systems that typically 
require six to nine orders of magnitude attenuation. Infrared beams at power levels of 
3 kW focused to diameters of 175 µm have been directly measured with cooled profilers 
fitted with copper apertures.
Commercial profilers, because of their speed and accuracy, are a major improvement for 
frequent beam diameter measurements over the traditional practice of a manually driven 
translation stage carrying a razor blade (or slit) across the beam. Focused beams in par­
ticular need high instrument accuracy to resolve the small spot and provide the real time 
update rate to acquire a signal by overlapping the aperture with the beam. With a signal lin­
earity range of 104 and a spatial resolution (if convolution error is neglected) of 0.01 microns 
over a 9-mm scan range (106 spatial resolution elements) one of these small, new profilers 
brings an impressive potential of 1010 information bits to the problem of measuring a beam 
diameter. Compare this to a modern CCD camera of 9-mm sensor width, 5-micron pixel 
spacing (2 × 103 spatial resolution elements), and 12-bit (4 × 103) linearity range, for a total of 
107 information bits. It is understandable why in measuring beam quality M2, profiler-based 
instruments surpass camera-based ones in speed and accuracy. The camera, of course, has 
its own advantages of giving a two-dimensional map of all the irradiance peaks in the laser 
spot and its ability to measure beams from low repetition rate pulsed lasers.
1.6.3  Comparing the Five Common Methods for Defining 
and Measuring Beam Diameters
The discussion that follows and Table 1.1 summarize the properties of the five diameter 
definitions.
1.6.3.1  Dpin, Separation of 1/e2 Clip Points of a Pinhole Profile
The pinhole scan reveals the structure of the irradiance variations across the beam spot 
with the greatest accuracy and detail, but does so working with a low light signal level 
and it is subject to convolution error with focused spots. To minimize convolution error, 
several pinholes of diameters H (10-micron and 50-micron pinholes are common) are used 
to keep H < w/3 where w here is the fundamental-mode radius or smallest feature size for 
a higher-order mode beam. The pinhole method requires accurate centering of the beam 
on the scan line of the pinhole and this makes it less adaptable to a machine measurement. 
This diameter definition also can give ambiguous results if the profile contains secondary 

28 
Handbook of Optical and Laser Scanning
peaks of a height close to the clip level. The pinhole profile provides the basic data from 
which the second-moment diameter is calculated. Be sure the rule for the profile to be free 
of convolution error is met first!
1.6.3.2  Dslit, Separation of 1/e2 Clip Points of a Slit Profile
The slit scan does not require centering of the beam spot and works at a medium light 
signal level, but does not reveal as much detail of the irradiance variations [compare 
Figure 1.8d and e]. This method is subject to convolution error with focused spots; the 
slit width S should satisfy S/2w < 1/8 with 2w as the smallest feature size of the profile. It 
too can give ambiguous results on profiles with secondary peaks near the clip level. This 
diameter definition produces a direct result (that is, without applying the conversion rules 
explained in Section 1.6.4.3) closest to the ISO standard second-moment diameter of the 
three other methods.
1.6.3.3  Dke, Twice the Separation of the 15.9% 
and 84.1% Clip Points of a Knife-Edge Scan
The knife-edge does not require centering of the beam spot and works at a high light signal 
level, but reveals almost no detail of the irradiance variations [compare Figure 1.8d and f], 
only the slight inflection points in the slope of the knife-edge profile show that there are any 
irradiance peaks at all. All modes give a simple slanted S-shaped profile. There generally is no 
convolution error with this method, and there are no diameter ambiguities when secondary 
peaks are present. Experimentally, it is the most robust diameter measurement and is least 
affected by beam-pointing jitter and power fluctuations, making this method fully machine 
readable. This diameter is the basic one measured in the most common commercial instru­
ment9 designed to automatically measure propagation plots and all six beam parameters.
1.6.3.4  D86, Diameter of a Centered Circular Aperture 
Passing 86.5% of the Total Beam Power
Unlike the other diameter measurements, the variable-aperture diameter passes light in 
both the x- and y-transverse planes simultaneously and cannot be used to separately mea­
sure the two principal diameters; it works best with round beams. It must also be centered 
in the beam for accurate results. While an iris or variable aperture can be used, more fre­
quently sets of precision fixed apertures are used instead. A metal plate drill gauge, with 
some of the plate milled away on the back side of the gauge to reduce its thickness to less 
than the smallest aperture size to eliminate occultation error, is a convenient tool. The 
two diameters bracketing the 86.5% transmission point are first found, and the final result 
computed by interpolation. Alternatively, if there is a long propagation length available, 
an aperture with a transmission near 86.5% may be moved along the beam to locate the 
distance where that diameter produces precisely this transmission. This diameter defini­
tion is used mainly for two reasons. For high power lasers—for instance CO2 lasers in the 
kilowatt range—little diagnostic analytical instrumentation is available that can absorb 
this power. A water-cooled copper aperture, however, can still be safely inserted in front of 
a power meter to give some quantification of the beam diameter. The second reason is that 
this diameter is readily computed from the output of a CCD camera and is available on 
camera instrumentation, with the computation locating the beam centroid, making physi­
cal centering of the camera unnecessary.

1.6.3.5  D4𝜎, Four Times the Standard Deviation of the Pinhole Irradiance Profile
This diameter is computed from a pinhole irradiance profile, which for accuracy should 
be free of convolution error and diffractive overlay. For a beam with a rectangular cross-
sectional symmetry described by a weighted sum of Hermite–Gaussian modes the calcu­
lation proceeds by finding the rectangular moments of the profile treated as a distribution 
function. The zeroth moment gives the total power P of the beam, the first moment the 
centroid, and the second moment leads to the variance 𝜎2 of the distribution:

This last equation comes from the requirement that the second-moment diameter reduce

A similar set of moment equations defines a radial second-moment diameter, applicable 
to beams with cylindrical symmetry described by a weighted sum of Laguerre–Gaussian 
functions. Here the pinhole x-scan profile is split in half at the centroid point 〈x〉, and the 
half profile is taken as the radial variation of the cylindrically symmetric beam. In the 
transverse radial coordinate plane (r, 𝜃), the origin is the center of the beam spot defined by 
the centroid (〈x〉, 〈y〉) given by the rectangular first moments, Equation 1.33.

Then for a cylindrically symmetric mode 𝜎x = 𝜎y, yielding 2𝜎x
2 = 𝜎r
2 or 𝜎x = (1/√2)𝜎r. Since 
for a fundamental-mode beam 2w = 4𝜎x, from the radial mode description of that beam, 
there results6 2w = 4(1/√2)𝜎r = 2√2 𝜎r, which is Equation 1.41. By mixing modes, combina­
tions of Hermite–Gaussian modes can be made to have the same irradiance profiles as 
Laguerre–Gaussian modes, and vice versa. Therefore, for compactness the symbols D4𝜎 
or M4
2
s  will be used for either linear or radial second-moment quantities unless there is a 
need to specifically distinguish a quantity as a radial moment.
1.6.3.6  Sensitivity of D4𝜎 to the Signal-to-Noise Ratio of the Profile
The experimental difficulties in evaluating these integrals with noise on the profile 
signal come from the weighting by a high power of the transverse coordinate in the 
second-moment calculation, by the square in the linear case [Equation 1.34], and by 
the cube in the radial case [Equation 1.39]. Take as an example a measurement of a 
fundamental-mode spot with a CCD camera, using 256 counts to digitize the irradiance 
values, and 128 counts used to digitize half the integration range of the transverse coor­
dinate. In the linear case, one noise count (0.4% noise) at the edge of the range—at the 
128th transverse count—is weighted by the factor 1 × (128)2 = 16,384 in the integration, 
versus 256 × 1 counts for the central peak. The contribution of this single noise count 
is 64 times that of the pixel at the central peak in the integration. In the radial case, the 
one noise count at the limiting transverse pixel makes a contribution (128)3/256 = 8192 
times that of the pixel at the central peak. A discussion of the high sensitivity of the 
second-moment diameter to noise on the wings of the profile is given in Reference 12. 
There the second-moment and knife-edge methods are compared for five simulated 
modes, and the knife-edge found to be considerably more forgiving and in agreement 
with common expectations.
To manage this sensitivity to noise, it is essential that both some measure of the detector’s 
background illumination and noise be subtracted from the signal, and that the integration 
from the beam centroid outward be truncated at the edges of the illuminated region. Both 
means reduce the effect of noise on the wings of the profile.
A distinction is made between subtraction of background, the detector’s readout with 
the beam blocked, and subtraction of the baseline, the noise floor of the dark detector. 
Because of the high directionality of laser beams, typically the background can (and 
should) be reduced to insignificance by inserting an aperture near the laser (blocking 
concomitant light) and adding a light-shielding tube to the detector (blocking ambient 
light).
There are differences of opinion as to the best method for subtracting the noise floor 
with CCD cameras, but recommended here is what is termed “thresholding.” From either 
a dark camera frame or preferably, from the nonilluminated corners of the signal frame, 
a standard deviation is computed for this measured noise, and three times this value sub­
tracted uniformly from the signal frame before data analysis. This avoids taking the dif­
ference between one random noise frame (the background frame) from another (the noise 
on the signal frame), which often just adds noise.
To set the integration truncation limit, the beam radius is estimated (typically by a diam­
eter-measurement method less sensitive to noise) and the integration is carried out over 
the range of from three to four (estimated) beam radii. The constancy of the computed 
second-moment diameter is observed over this range. Then integration limits are set just 
wide enough to yield a stable second-moment value. When the width setting is judged to 
be correct, the measurement should be repeated to check reproducibility.

Characterization of Laser Beams: The M2 Model 
31
Other problems with CCD cameras that can look like noise are that they are subject to 
drift, response nonlinearity and nonuniformity, “bleeding” of signal to adjacent pixels, 
and low damage threshold requiring attenuation not only to prevent signal saturation but 
to protect them as well. For these reasons, coupled with the need for analysis software to 
read them out, cameras are best purchased from dealers who have assessed these prob­
lems and will stand behind their instrument’s measurement accuracy.
In one commercial instrument9 two additional checks are provided to assess the effect of 
noise on the radial second-moment calculation done on a pinhole single line scan. The first 
check compares the second-moment diameter calculated from the right half profile, to that 
from the left half profile. If the beam is indeed cylindrically symmetric and the contribution 
from noise on the profile is negligible, the ratio of these two results should be near unity. 
The second check is an option in the calculation called “noise-clip ON/OFF.” In the wings 
of the 256 count wide profile where the signal is near zero, noise counts vary the trace above 
and below the average dark level, and the lowest noise pixels acquire a negative sign when 
the linear baseline (between the means of the 20 points on either end of the scan line) is 
subtracted. This is desirable, these negative noise pixels help cancel positive ones, but it is 
straightforward for the processor in the instrument to clip these pixels to a zero value with 
the “noise-clip” option turned ON. The size of the resulting change in the calculated second-
moment diameter provides a test of how large the contribution is from noise in the wings.
It is also recommended when measuring a second-moment diameter to vary the sources 
of noise on the laser beam. Check that the resonator alignment is peaked, the sources of 
microphonics impinging on the laser are minimized, the laser is warmed up and bolted 
down to the stable table, and so forth, and watch for variations in the second-moment 
diameter. A more complete analysis9 of the effect of noise on diameter measurements 
showed that the standard deviation over the mean of ten repeated second-moment diam­
eter measurements was five to ten times larger than that for knife-edge measurements of 
the same beam at (low) signal-to-noise levels from 50 down to ten. With these precautions 
required in interpreting D4𝜎 results, it is fair to say that the second moment as currently 
implemented is not a “machine readable” diameter definition.
1.6.3.7 Reasons for D4𝜎 Being the ISO Choice of Standard Diameter
Since there is considerable experimental difficulty in measuring second-moment diameters, 
why is this definition the one adopted11 as the standard by the International Organization 
for Standards? The primary answer is that this definition is the one best supported by the­
ory. The general theories of the propagation of ray bundles4,6,19 are based on the Fourier 
transform relationship6 between the irradiance distribution and angular spatial-frequency 
distribution. These show two essential requirements are met if the beam width is defined 
by the second-moment diameter [Equation 1.36]. The beam width is rigorously defined6 
for all realizable beams [excluding only those with discontinuous edges,6 for which the 
integration Equation 1.34 may not converge] and the square of this width (the variance) 
increases as a quadratic function of the free space propagation distance away from the 
waist. That is, D4𝜎(z) increases with z according to the hyperbolic form (Equation 1.16a). 
All other diameter definitions gain legitimacy in propagation theory by being shown to be 
proportional to the second-moment diameter.
Another important feature of the second-moment diameter is that the beam quality (M2 
values) calculated using it turn out to be integers for either the pure, rectangular-sym­
metry Hermite–Gaussian modes, or the pure, cylindrical-symmetry Laguerre–Gaussian 
modes. Thus not only for the fundamental mode is M4

s =

but for the next higher-order mode, the donut mode, M4
2

s =
, and so on counting up by 
unity each time the mode order increases. In general6 the formulas are:

where m, n are the order numbers of the Hermite polynomials, and p, l the order numbers 
for the generalized Laguerre polynomials associated with the modes as before (Equation 
1.1). For the six modes shown in Figure 1.2, of increasing order from (a) to (f), the values are 
M4𝜎
2  = 1, 2, 3, 3, 4, 4 respectively. The integers (m + n + 1) or (2p + l + 1) are termed the mode 
order numbers, and they determine as well the mode’s optical oscillating frequency. Modes 
with the same frequency are termed degenerate. As the mode order number increases, the 
degree of degeneracy increases, there being three degenerate pure modes each for (2p + 
l + 1) = M2 = 5 or 6, four for M2 = 7 or 8, five for M2 = 9 or 10, and so on. The diameters of the 
pure modes in second-moment units are just the square root of the mode order numbers 
times the fundamental-mode diameter (by Equation 1.3):

Another consequence of the pure modes having integer values of beam quality is that for 
mixed modes, the M4
2
s  value is a simple power-weighted sum of the integer M4
2
svalues of 
the component modes. Finding integers like this in a physical theory is strong indication 
that the quantities have been defined and measured “the way nature intended.”
Another reason for the ISO Committee’s choice of D4𝜎 as the diameter standard is that 
the committee members were aware that conversion formulae were available to permit 
diameters measured according to the other definitions to be put in standard form. These 
formulae are discussed in the next section.
The last line of Table 1.1 refers to CCD camera properties. A CCD camera together 
with frame-grabber electronics and appropriate software can be a universal instrument 
capable of providing diameter measurements according to any or all of the definitions. 
Affordable cameras do not provide as large a dynamic range for irradiance levels (useful 
range ~1000:1) compared to that for a silicon detector (~104) but good variable attenuators 
are readily available33 to allow camera operation just below saturation to make the most of 
the range that exists. Spatial resolution of 5 micron per pixel may be inadequate for direct 
measurement of focused beams but flexibility, ease of use, and quick access to colorful 2-D 
irradiance maps make it an attractive choice for beam diameters large enough to fill an 
adequate number of pixels. Imaging optics can be used if necessary to measure smaller 
beams. If improvements in CCD cameras continue at their recent pace, they are likely to 
become superior to all the older methods of measuring beam diameters.
1.6.3.8  Diameter Definitions: Final Note
It is important to emphasize that the M2 model can be applied using any reasonable defini­
tion of beam diameter as long as the definition is used consistently both in making measure­
ments and interpreting calculated values. Results will then be meaningful and reliable.

Characterization of Laser Beams: The M2 Model 
33
In fact, there can be cases where it is important to use a “nonstandard” diameter defini­
tion. For example, there is a trend toward steeper sides and flattened tops as M2 increases. 
The effect becomes pronounced for M2 values above ten and at 50 or more, profiles can be 
aptly described5 as a “top hat” shape. The diameter of such a beam becomes unambiguous 
and it makes sense to abandon the standard definitions (D4𝜎, D86, etc.) and just measure the 
diameter of the “top hat” cylinder. The good news is that for such beams, pinhole scans 
would show the diameter at half-maximum irradiance to be insignificantly different from 
that at the 1/e2 level. The aperture size that passes 86.5% of the total power will not provide 
as meaningful a result in this situation as the aperture that transmits 95% of the power. 
The latter would likely be little different in size from the one that passes 98%. Curve fitting 
to a series of D95 measurements will yield a set of valid parameters describing the beam but 
this defines a new “currency” and one must stay consistent and not mix these diameters 
with those arrived at by a different method or definition.
1.6.4  Conversions between Diameter Definitions
For a diameter conversion algorithm to be widely applied, it must be normalized, with the 
natural normalization being the diameter of the fundamental mode generated in the same 
resonator as the measured beam, the embedded gaussian. Using Equation 1.3, this essen­
tially changes the problem of converting diameters into one of converting M2 values.
The conversion rules that are now part of the ISO beam widths document11 were first 
derived empirically and later found to have theoretical support. They apply to cylindri­
cally symmetric modes generated in a resonator with a circular limiting aperture and an 
approximately uniform gain medium. In this case, if M2
2
2s is known, then the mixture 
and relative amplitudes of the modes oscillating can also be reasonably estimated.
1.6.4.1  Is M2 Unique?
Determining the fractions of the pure modes in a mixture for a cylindrically symmetric 
beam from the beam quality alone seems unlikely at first, because the beam quality M2 is 
not unique in the mathematical sense. Consider the case of a beam with M2 = 1.1 in second-
moment units. An experienced laser engineer might guess the likely composition is 90% 
fundamental mode (M2 = 1) and 10% donut mode (M2 = 2) to give M2 = (0.9) + 2(0.1) = 1.1 for 
the mixed mode, and she/he would be right. For a beam of M2 = 5 however, the problem 
is much harder. The number of possible modes above threshold makes for a large range of 
possible mix fractions within the M2 = 5 constraint.
Our empirical results showed, however, that for the class of lasers with round beams 
described just, M2 was unique at least up to values of M4
2
3 2
s = . .14 In these resonators, 
diffraction losses and spatial mode competition in saturating the gain determine the 
mixed-mode composition. As the circular limiting aperture is opened—as the Fresnel 
number of the resonator is increased—some modes grow and others decrease in a predict­
able and reproducible way, such that for each M2 there is a unique known mode mixture. 
Furthermore, this knowledge has allowed us to establish mathematical rules for intercon­
version of beam diameters between the various measurement definitions.
1.6.4.2 Emprical Basis for the Conversion Rules
We acquired the empirical data14 by using an argon ion laser set up to give beams with 
a large range of M2 values as a function of the diameter of the circular mode-limiting

aperture. By varying this aperture diameter and the gain—the latter by adjusting the laser 
tube’s current—values of M2
2
2s from 1 to 2.5 were covered with the green line at 514 nm; 
the upper limit was increased to 3.2 by changing to the higher gain of the 488 nm blue line. 
As the blue line was generated in the same resonator, the blue beam diameters here could 
be scaled by multiplying the square root of the ratio of the wavelengths, a factor of 1.027, 
for comparison to the green line diameters. The beam from this laser was split to feed an 
array of monitoring equipment. A radio frequency photodiode and rf spectrum analyzer 
gave how many modes and what mode orders were oscillating. Profiles were recorded 
with a commercial slit and pinhole profiler8 and a commercial beam propagation analyzer9 
to obtain knife-edge diameters, Mke
2 , and radial second-moment diameters. A CCD cam­
era and software computed the variable aperture diameter. In front of the camera, a lens 
provided a known (1.47 times) magnification to fill an adequate number of pixels, and a 
variable attenuator set the light level.
As the laser’s internal aperture was opened and the beam diameter enlarged, the mode 
spot alternated from one with a peak in the center to one with a dip at the center in over one-
and-a-half cycles as shown in the profiles of Figure 1.10b. Seven aperture settings were chosen 
spanning the range of M2 values, two giving the highest central peaks (A and E), two at the 
deepest dips (C and F), and three transitional ones (AP, named the “perturbed A-mode”, B, 
and D). The full set of diagnostic data at these settings was recorded. Knowing the number of 
modes oscillating and the mode orders at each setting from the rf spectrum, trial mode mix­
tures were assumed. The resulting theoretical profiles were adjusted14 to match the experi­
mental pinhole profiles. An example is Figure 1.2, where the theoretical mixed-mode profile, 
(g), is matched to experimental profile, (h), which is the same as Mode E in Figure 1.10b.
Once the TEM*0n modes were included14 in the mode mix, good matches of profiles were 
found. These modes are like the donut mode, for which n = 1, but with increasingly larger 
holes in the center as their order (n + 1) increases. Because they have p = 0 they are “all null” 
(nearly zero in amplitude) in the middle. They make the most of the r3 weighting factor in 
the second-moment integral to reach a given second-moment diameter Mw = √(2p + l +1) w at 
the smallest radius, resulting in the lowest tails14 to their profiles of all modes of the same-
­order number. They thus have the lowest diffraction loss for a limiting circular aperture 
and always oscillate first among pure modes of the same order as the Fresnel number of the 
resonator is increased. It was noted in Reference 20 that in this aperture-opening process 
there was a gradual extinction of a mode of lower order soon after a mode of next higher 
order reached threshold. This is clearly a gain competition effect won by the higher-order 
mode. A possible physical reason of general applicability discussed in Reference 20 was 
that the larger spatial extent of the higher-order mode provided access to a region of gain 
not addressed by the competing lower-order mode.
The final mode fractions for the seven mixed modes were determined using a Mathematica 
function called SimpleFit made available by Wolfram Research. These fractions are plotted 
in Figure 1.10a as a function of the resultant beam quality M4
2
s  for the mixed modes. The 
modes turn on in the order of decreasing diffraction loss as shown by McCumber21 and 
then gradually extinguish, as predicted in the preceding paragraph. At each value of M4
2
s 
for this argon ion laser there is a characteristic set of oscillating modes, mode fractions, and 
mode profiles (Figure 1.10). Here for every M2 value there is a unique mixture of modes. 
From all the data gathered, simple conversion rules given in the next section between 
diameter definitions were derived. Over the range measured of M4
2
1
s =  to 3.2, the error to 
convert knife-edge, slit, and variable aperture diameters to second-moment diameters was 
±2% (one standard deviation). This is a ±4% error in converting M2. The error was ±4% for 
conversion of pinhole diameters to second-moment diameters.

Characterization of Laser Beams: The M2 Model 
35
We then tested the rules on other lasers14 within this M2 range and found that knife-edge 
diameter measurements converted to second-moment diameters agreed with directly 
measured second-moment diameters within ±2%. The conversion error is defined as 
the fraction in excess of unity of the D4𝜎 diameter obtained by the conversion rule, over 
that obtained directly from the variance of the irradiance profile, expressed in percent. 
The knife-edge diameter conversion subsequently was tested on three other gas lasers 
at M4
2
s = 4.2, 7.5, and 7.7 and found to remain valid to ±2%. However, a test25 on a pulsed 
Ho:YAG laser at M4
2

s =
.  gave a conversion error of −9%; this is thought to be due to 
the strong transient thermal lensing in this medium affecting the spatial gain saturation. 
This consistency in the face of an extrapolation by a factor of two indicates that these 
conversion rules are fairly robust, valid to the stated accuracy, and that the mixed modes 
on which they are based exist in this large class of lasers. Apparently, for many lasers, M2 
is unique.

of the beam quality obtained by method “i” and i can signify any of the other definitions. 
Since all the diameter definitions give the same result for the fundamental-mode beam

In the same resonator, the fundamental-mode diameter is given by the ratio of the

This gives the conversion constants between any two methods in Table 1.1, by taking the

The values for the ci𝜎 constants in Table 1.1 are an improvement over our earlier results14 
that were incorporated in the ISO beam-test document.11 More experimental data later 
became available, but also it was realized once the mode fractions were determined 
experimentally that the conversion constants could then be calculated from theory alone.

theoretical diameters Di for the different methods was calculated. By Equation 1.3, these 
were converted to Mi’s. Then plots of M4𝜎 − 1 versus Mi − 1 were least-squares curve fit to 
determine by Equation 1.47 the values of ci𝜎 listed in Table 1.1. The fit for the slope ci𝜎, was 
for one parameter only with the intercept forced to be zero. This gives an internally con­
sistent set of ci𝜎’s so that Equation 1.50 is valid.
1.7  PRACTICAL ASPECTS OF BEAM QUALITY M2 
MEASUREMENT: THE FOUR-CUTS METHOD
The four-cuts method means measuring the beam diameter at four judicious axial 
positions, the minimum number—as explained in this section—to permit an accurate 
determination of M2. To execute this method well, several subtleties should first be 
understood.
The simplest way to measure M would be to take the ratio of the mixed-mode beam 
diameter to that of the embedded gaussian as by Equation 1.3, M = W/w, except that the 
embedded gaussian is inaccessible by being enclosed inside the mixed mode. However, 
both beams have the same Rayleigh range. By measuring zR and the waist diameter 2W0 for 
the accessible mixed mode, the beam quality is determined through Equation 1.20:

(1.20)
The general approach is to measure beam diameters 2Wi at multiple locations zi along the 
propagation path and least-squares curve fit this data to a hyperbolic form to determine 
zR and 2W0. But even by taking this computer-intensive approach, unreliable values will 
sometimes result unless a number of subtle pitfalls25 (often ignored) are avoided on the 
way to good (±5%) M2 values. The pitfalls are highlighted in italics as they are encountered 
in this discussion.
Well-designed commercial instruments9 avoid these pitfalls, and a button push yields a 
good answer. For the engineer performing the measurement on his or her own, and who 
can start by roughly estimating the beam’s waist diameter and location (using burn paper, 
a card inserted in the beam, or a profiler slid along the propagation axis) a minimum 
effort, logical, quick method exists, which circumvents the subtle difficulties. This is the 
method25 of “four cuts,” the subject of this section.
The first pitfall is avoided by realizing that in the M2 model the beam divergence is no 
longer determined by the inverse of the waist diameter alone (as it is for a fundamental 
mode) but has the additional proportionality factor M2:
	
Θ = 2

0
M
W
l
p
. 	
(1.19)
The first implication of this additional degree of freedom is that the beam waist must be measured 
directly, not inferred from a divergence measurement. Consider the propagation plots shown 
in Figure 1.11a. Several beams are plotted, all with the same values of the ratio M2/W0
 
and therefore the same divergence, but with different M2 [accomplished by having the 
Rayleigh range proportional to W0, see the second form of Equation 1.19 in Section 1.4]. 
From measurements all far from the waist it would be impossible to distinguish between 

38

these curves to determine M2. On the other hand, in Figure 1.11b are propagation plots for 
several beams with the same waist diameters but different M2 and therefore divergences. 
Here Θ ∝ M2 and by Equation 1.18, zR ∝ 1/M2. Measurements all near the waist could not 
distinguish these curves to determine the divergences. Both near- and far-field diameter 
measurements are needed to measure M2.
Any of the diameter-measurement methods can be used to define an M2 value, and 
the next pitfall is avoided by staying in one currency, and do not mix, for instance, the knife-
edge divergence measurement with the laser manufacturer’s quoted D4𝜎 (second-mo­
ment) waist value. Consistently use the most reliable diameter-measurement method 
you have available, and in the end convert your results to values in the standard D4𝜎 
currency.

1.7.1  The Logic of the Four-Cuts Method
The four-cuts method starts with the error estimate for your best method for measuring 
diameters, and uses that to set the tolerances on all other measurements. Let diameters be 
determined to a fractional error g,

where 2Wmeas is the measured diameter, and 2W the correct diameter. It is assumed g is small, 
usually 1%–2%. This will yield a fractional precision h for the beam quality of h = 3%–5% 
since M2 varies as the product of two diameters, with a small error added for a required lens 
transform (discussed in Section 1.7.1.1). The term “cut” is used for a diameter measurement, 
after the common use of a knife-edge scan cutting across the beam to determine a diameter. 
Let us define the normalized or fractional propagation distance from the waist as:

Let the fractional error in locating the waist be 𝜂0. For this miss in cut placement in mea­

for g ≪ 1. If g = 0.01, then 𝜂0 < √(0.02) ≅ 1/7. The tolerable error in locating z0 is one-seventh of a 
Rayleigh range for a 1% precision in diameter measurements.
To locate the waist to this precision, beam cuts must be taken far enough away from 
the waist to detect the growth in beam diameter with distance. At the waist location the 
diameter change with propagation is nil; to precisely locate a waist requires observations 
far from it where the diameter variation can be reliably detected. On both sides away from 
the waist, cuts must be made at distances of a sizeable fraction of the Rayleigh range.
To find the optimum cut distances, look at the fractional change Q in beam diameter 
versus normalized propagation distance:

Figure 1.12 is a plot of this function, Equation 1.54, in which it is easy to see that the maxi­
mum fractional change of Q occurs at 𝜂 = ±1. By making cuts within −2 to −0.5 and +0.5 
to +2.0 Rayleigh ranges from the waist corresponding to 𝜂 within these numerical values, 
80% of the maximum fractional change is available. This will significantly enhance the 
reliability of the position determination over that made using diameters from less than 
0.5 zR away from the waist. An accessible span of at least a Rayleigh range centered on the waist 
is needed for diameter measurements.
Note that Figure 1.12 highlights the physical significance of the propagation locations 
one Rayleigh range to either side of the waist. The wavefront curvature is largest in abso­
lute magnitude there, resulting in the fractional change in diameter Q with propagation 
coordinate z reaching extremes of ±0.5 there as well.
1.7.1.1  Requirement of an Auxiliary Lens to Make an Accessible Waist
Most lasers have their beam waists located internally where they are inaccessible. Therefore, 
an accessible auxiliary waist related to the inaccessible one is achieved by inserting a lens 

40 
Handbook of Optical and Laser Scanning
or concave mirror into the beam, and making the M2 measurement on the new beam. Then 
the constants found are transformed back through the lens to determine the constants for 
the original beam. This requirement to insert a lens, and then transform through the lens back to 
the original beam constants, is an often-ignored pitfall in making accurate beam measurements.
The temptation is to use what is available, and just measure the beam on the output side 
of the output coupler. Usually this means the data is all on the diverging side of the waist. 
The problem is that nothing in this data constrains the waist location very well. In the 
curve fit, small errors in the measured diameters will send the waist location skittering 
back and forth to the detriment of the extrapolation to find the waist diameter. Inserting a 
lens and making a beam that is accessible on both sides of its waist is a significantly more 
reliable procedure.
There are three constants (z02, 2W02, M2) needed to fix the 2-space beam shown in Figure 1.6 
for one of the principal propagation planes, so, in principle, only three cuts should suffice, 
but then one of them would have to be within the range |𝜂0| < 1/7. The location of this nar­
row range z02 ± zR2/7 is at this point unknown. Therefore four cuts are used, the first an esti­
mated Rayleigh range zR2 to one side of the estimated waist location z02, the second and third 
at about 0.9 and 1.1 times this estimated Rayleigh range to the other side (see Figure 1.13). 
These cut locations and the diameters determined there are labeled by their cut numbers i = 
1, 2, 3. Between z2 and z3 there is a diameter that matches 2W1 and the location zmatch of this is 
determined by interpolation:

Characterization of Laser Beams: The M2 Model 
41
The waist is located exactly halfway between z1 and zmatch, and the fourth cut is made there 
at z4 to directly measure the waist diameter 2W02 = 2W4 of the 2-space beam and complete 
the minimum data to determine M.2
1.7.1.2  Accuracy of the Location Found for the Waist
If the locating cuts (1, 2, and 3 of Figure 1.13) are within the ranges specified from |Q| > 0.4 
and the diameters are measured to the fractional error g, then the error in the normalized 
waist location 𝜂0 is no worse than g/Q = 2.5%. This is much less (since g is small) than 
the tolerance 2g = 14.1% = 1/7 determined from inequality Equation 1.53. The measured 
waist diameter is then correct to the fractional error g.
The fractional error in measurement of diameters g when divided by the fractional 
change in diameter with normalized propagation Q, yields the fractional error in normal­
ized waist location 𝜂0 = g/Q. The plot of Figure 1.12 is thus actually a quantitative version 
of the statement “to precisely locate a null requires observations far from the null” when 
locating the waist. Diameter measurements inside the range z02 ± zR/2 quickly lose any 
ability to contribute precision in locating the waist as here Q drops to zero.
There is much value in locating the waist as accurately as the diameter-measurement 
tolerance will allow in that it reduces the number of unknown constants to be determined 
by curve fitting from three to two. The number of terms in the curve fit drops by a factor of 
four, and the remaining terms are made more accurate. Some of these terms depend on the 
distance from the waist to the ith-cut location, zi − z02, either squared or raised to the fourth 
power. It is often useful to take a fifth cut at z5 = f as shown by the vertical dashed line in 
Figure 1.13. This cross checks the input beam divergence by Equation 1.29 and balances the 
number of points on either side of the auxiliary waist at z02 to improve the curve fit.
1.7.2  Graphical Analysis of the Data
The data, which consists of a table of four- or five-cut locations and their beam diameters 
for each of the two independent principal propagation planes, is next plotted. A sample plot 
for the 𝜆 = 2.1 micron Ho:YAG laser beam analyzed in Reference 25 is shown in Figure 1.14.

Handbook of Optical and Laser Scanning
with the initial waist location and Rayleigh range estimates close to the final values (within 
~10%), a simple and quick graphical analysis is as accurate as a curve fit.
Generally, with more points as in commercial instrumentation, a weighted least-squares 
curve fit of the data to a hyperbolic form is required,25 discussed in Section 1.7.3. The curve 
fit also generates a sum of residuals for a statistical measure of the goodness of fit.
In the graphical analysis after the points are plotted, smooth curves of approximately 
hyperbolic form are laid in symmetrically about the known waist locations for each princi­
pal propagation plane, here in Figure 1.14 with a French curve. Next, horizontal chords are 
marked off at heights √2 times the waist diameters 2W4 to intersect the smooth curves. The 
distance between these intersection points on each curve are twice the Rayleigh ranges 
2zRx, 2zRy respectively, and these lengths are measured off the plot for use in Equation 1.20 
with 2W0x = 2W4x (and 2W0y = 2W4y) to determine Mx
2 (and My
2) for the auxiliary 2-space 
beam. For the data of Figure 1.14 the results were zRx = 17.6 cm and zRy = 17.8 cm, resulting 
in knife-edge beam qualities Mx

These results are termed the initial graphical solution and can be improved to give the 
corrected graphical solution by using the fact that a better estimate of the waist diameter 
is available than just the closest measured point. By the propagation law, Equation 1.16, if 
the miss distance of the closest point (Cut 4) is 𝜂0 then the best estimate of the corrected 
waist diameter is:

The corrected solution uses the Rayleigh range and waist values from the initial graphical 
solution in Equation 1.57 to obtain a corrected waist diameter, and plots a chord at a height 
of √2 times this diameter to determine a corrected length 2zR and M2 from Equation 1.20. 
In the example of Figure 1.14, the chords shown are the corrected chords; only the y-axis 
data changed slightly to zRy = 17.3 cm and My

. . After curve fitting the same data, the 
fractional rms error (goodness of fit) for the five diameter points were the same at <1.9%.
This good accuracy is a consequence of the four-cuts strategy. The waist diameter is 
directly measured and if the initial estimate for the Rayleigh range is close, the other cuts 
give data points near the intersection points of the chords fixing the 2zR values on the plot. 
The graphical analysis then amounts to an analog interpolation to find the best positions 
for the intersection points.
There are two last steps. The first is to transform the 2-space data back to 1-space to get 
the constants for the original beam, using Equations 1.24 through 1.28. This adds a small 
fractional error to the end result due to the uncertainties in z02 and zR2, which contribute 
a slight uncertainty to the transformation constant 𝛤 of Equation 1.24 (in the example of 
Reference 25, a 2% error in 𝛤, 1% additional error in transformed diameters).
The second step is to convert these knife-edge measurements of Figure 1.14 to standard 
second-moment units as done in Table 3 of Reference 25. The beam of Reference 25 is the 
one that did not work well with the conversion rules of Section 1.1.5. Instead the conversion 
of Mke

of the auxiliary lens, of the knife-edge diameter to the second-moment diameter calcu­
lated from a pinhole scan. This gave the ratio Dke/D4𝜎 = 1.055 or a factor of 1/(1.055)2 = 0.897 
for the M2 conversion.
1.7.3  Discussion of Curve-Fit Analysis of the Data
A complete numerical example of a full weighted least-squares curve fit to analyze the 
four-cuts data, or a larger data set, is given in Reference 25 and need not be repeated. There 
are some subtle pitfalls to avoid in using curve fits on beam propagation data and these 
are briefly discussed.
A least-squares curve fit is the only general way to account for all the data properly. 
A common mistake is to use the wrong function for the curve fit, which necessitates a discus­
sion of what is the correct one. The fit should be to a hyperbolic form, Equation 1.16, but that 
is not all. It also should be a weighted curve fit, with the weight of the ith squared residual 
in the least-squares sum being the inverse square power of the measured diameter 2Wi.
There are three reasons for this choice of weighting. The first is that in general in a weighted 
curve fit, the weights36 should be the inverse squares of the uncertainties in the original mea­
surements. For many lasers, the fractional error in the measured diameter is observed to 
increase with the diameter; this is probably due to the longer time it takes to scan a larger 
diameter. The spectrum of both amplitude noise and pointing jitter on a beam tends to increase 
towards lower frequencies and longer measurement times give this noise a greater influence.
The second reason arises from an empirical study25 of different weightings one of us 
did during the development of a commercial M2 measuring instrument.9 Amplitude noise 
was impressed on the beam of a fundamental-mode ion laser with a known M4s
2
1 03

, 
by rapid manual dithering of the tube current while the instrument’s data gathering 
run9 was underway. (Note, the ModeMaster9 collects 260 knife-edge cuts in each of two 
orthogonal planes in a 30-s “focus” run, generating the beam propagation plots.) The 
same data was then fitted to a hyperbola five times, with five different weighting factors. 

44 
Handbook of Optical and Laser Scanning
The weights were the measured diameter raised to the nth power, (2Wi)n, with n = −1, 
−0.5, 0, +0.5, or +1. The weight with n = 0 is unity or equal weight for all data points. Data 
runs were repeated many times with increasing noise amplitude, and the resulting M2 
values for all five weighting schemes were compared each time. The equal or negative 
power weightings gave stable M2 values within 3% of the correct value up to 5% peak-
to-peak amplitude noise. The positive power weightings n = +0.5 gave 4%–5% and n = +1 
gave 12%–19% errors in M2 respectively at this noise level. With larger noise amplitudes, 
the positive power weightings gave errors that grew rapidly and nonlinearly.
A common curve-fitting technique is to use a polynomial fit for the square of the beam diameter 
versus propagation distance. This may be convenient but it could give an unsatisfactory result. 
This technique takes advantage of the wide availability of polynomial curve-fit software, 
and the fact that the square of Equation 1.16 gives a quadratic for W(z)2 as a function of z. 
However, look at what this does. Let 2Wi be the measured ith diameter, and 2Wi′ be the 
exact diameter with the small deviation between them 2𝛿i = 2Wi − 2Wi′. In the W2 polyno­
mial curve fit, the ith term is

The residual from the exact polynomial curve is weighted in the fit by 2Wi′, a positive 
power (+1) of Wi′, and so will give unstable results if there is more than a few percent 
amplitude noise on the beam. At the time of completion of the 1995 ISO document on 
beam-test procedures, this difficulty with a polynomial curve fit was unrecognized, and 
a polynomial fit was (incorrectly) recommended there; the 2004 version correctly recom­
mends fitting to a hyperbolic form.11
The third reason for an inverse-power weighting is that mathematically the least fractional 
error results for a ratio quantity like M2 =  Θ/𝜃n in Equation 1.22 if the fractional errors from 
the denominator and numerator roughly balance. The residuals from the more numerous 
cuts far from the waist—the points giving the measurement of divergence Θ, or numerator—
would swamp with equal weighting the fewer (or single) cut at the waist—the point(s) giving 
the divergence of the normalizing gaussian, or denominator. An inverse square weighting 
approximately halves the influence of the three or four far points, compared to the unity 
weighting at the waist in the four-cuts method, giving the desired rough balance.
1.7.4  Commercial Instruments and Software Packages
There are three main commercial instruments for measuring beam quality and a host of less 
well developed others. The first is the original9,35 system designed as a beam propagation 
analyzer and believed at this time to be the most fully developed, the ModeMaster™ from 
Coherent, Inc. The cylindrical scan head (10 cm diameter by 31 cm length) mounts through 
angle and translation alignment stages to a heavy stable-table post. The basic diameter mea­
surements are achieved with two orthogonal knife-edge cuts. Both principal propagation 
planes are measured nearly simultaneously on a drum spinning at 10 Hz behind an auxil­
iary lens. Measurements are restricted to continuous-wave laser beams or high repetition 
rate (>100 kHz) pulsed lasers. The lens moves to carry the auxiliary beam through the plane 
of the knife-edges to assemble 260 cuts in each principal propagation plane making up a 

Characterization of Laser Beams: The M2 Model

pair of propagation plots for the auxiliary beam in a 30-s “focus” pass. A curve fit, with an 
inverse-diameter weighting, to a hyperbola is done and the fitted parameters are trans­
formed through the lens by the on-board processor to present a data report for the original 
beam.* The M2 measurement accuracy is specified at 5% and the waist diameter accuracy at 
2%, with a minimum of 100 sample points taken across the profile. The drum also carries 
two pinholes, each of different diameters, giving pinhole profiles that are processed to give 
direct second-moment diameters. The instrument also measures beam-pointing stability. 
Electronic alignment aids are included. In the original instrument operation was controlled 
through a dedicated electronics console; the current version is driven by a laptop PC.
The second is the ModeScan™ family of instruments from Photon, Inc. Originally 
intended as an upgrade of a user’s existing 10 Hz rotating drum profiler to a beam propa­
gation analyzer, the simplest version is a modular package consisting of a 0.5 m rail to 
manually translate the profiler in the beam behind a fixed input lens, with software for the 
user’s PC computer that prompts the user for input of position data. When the data fields 
are filled, the software calculates the M2 of this auxiliary beam (the same as the input 
beam’s) and transforms the data through the lens for the other input beam constants. Later 
versions automate the stage drive and data acquisition, expand the software features, and 
include a new profiler with a selection of five rotation speeds to measure pulsed beams. 
The latest instrument, the ModeScan™ 1780 model, is a new design in a 26 cm × 18 cm × 
8 cm housing gimbal mounted to a 1/2" diameter stable-table post. It incorporates beam 
splitters behind a fixed input lens to pick off ten sample beams, and direct them to a CCD 
array camera. The diameters at these ten different throw distances are measured simulta­
neously and this data fit to a hyperbola to generate the beam constants. Placing ten spots at 
once on the camera sensor reduces the number of illuminated pixels per spot (a minimum 
of 15 pixels per diameter measurement is recommended), but enough are lit that the M2 
measurement accuracy of this and the rest of these systems is listed as 4%–5%. This latest 
model is the only commercial instrument capable of determining beam constants from a 
single pulse, and therefore of showing pulse-to-pulse beam variations.
The third instrument is the CCD camera-based M2–200 Beam Propagation Analyzer from 
Ophir Spiricon, Inc., operating with pulsed or cw laser beams. The original instrument with 
a 500-mm focal length input lens occupied a 28 cm × 82 cm footprint on the stable table; a 
new model, the M2-200s, uses a 300-mm lens and is a half-size version fitting into 26 cm × 44 
cm. Here a stepper motor and translation stage on a rail moves an optical delay line behind 
the fixed input lens to effectively scan the detector surface through the auxiliary beam. The 
PC computer attached to the system automatically adjusts filter wheel attenuation, subtracts 
background, sets spot truncation, and calculates the second-moment diameters37 directly 
from the CCD profiles. A curve fit to a hyperbola is done37 with the results transformed back 
through the input lens to present the constants of the original beam. The M2 measurement 
accuracy is given as 5%. This product, with its long focal length input lenses, is positioned 
to measure the large beams of industrial lasers for process monitoring and control.
1.8  TYPES OF BEAM ASYMMETRY
In the previous sections, the means for the spatial characterization of laser beams were 
established. This section looks at commonly found beam shapes and others that are

possible. The three common types of beam asymmetry are depicted in Figure 1.15. These 
are the pure forms but mixtures of all three are common in real beams.
1.8.1  Common Types of Beam Asymmetry
The first is simple astigmatism (Figure 1.15a), where the waist locations for the two orthogo­
nal principal propagation planes do not coincide, z0x ≠ z0y, but W0x = W0y, and Mx
2 = My
2. 
Because here the waist diameters and beam qualities are the same for the principal propa­
gation planes, so are the divergences, Θx ∝ Mx
2/W0x = My
2/W0y ∝ Θy [see Equation 1.19]. 
This makes the beams round in the converging and diverging far-fields. At the two waist 
planes the beam cross sections are elliptical, one oriented in the vertical and the other the

horizontal plane, with the minor diameters equal. Midway between the waists, the beam 
becomes round like the “circle of least confusion” point in the treatment of astigmatism28 
in geometrical optics. The simple astigmatic beam is characterized by three round cross 
sections, at the distant ends and midpoint, with orthogonally oriented elliptical cross sec­
tions in between.
The window frame insets of Figure 1.15 show the wavefront curvatures, which are spher­
ical in the far-field, cylindrical at the waist planes with one cylindrical axis horizontal, the 
other vertical, and saddle-shaped at the midpoint between the waists. The wavefront 
curvatures determine the nature of the focus when a lens is inserted.
Simple astigmatic beams can be generated in resonators with three spherical mirrors, 
with one used off-axis to give an internal focus,38 unless there is astigmatic compensation 
built in as with a Brewster plate of the correct thickness38 added to the focusing arm. Many 
diode lasers are astigmatic but with the other two types of asymmetry as well because the 
channeling effects in the plane parallel to the junction differ from those in the plane per­
pendicular to it, giving two different effective source points for the parallel and perpen­
dicular wavefronts. Beams formed using angle-matched second harmonic generation can 
be astigmatic due to walk-off in the phase matching plane of the beam in the birefringent 
doubling crystal. The diode lasers in laser pointers frequently have a large astigmatism, as 
large as the Rayleigh range for the high-divergence axis.
The next is asymmetric waists (Figure 1.15b), where the waist diameters are unequal. 
Because of the different waist diameters but with equal beam qualities, in the far-fields 
where divergence dominates, the cross sections are elliptical with the long axes of the 
ellipses (shown as horizontal) perpendicular to the long axis of the waist ellipse (here 
vertical). In between there are round cross sections at planes symmetrically placed 
around the waist location—the same geometry as in Figure 1.15a, with the ellipses and 
circles interchanged. The wavefronts are plane at the waist, and ellipsoidal everywhere 
else, with curvatures at the round cross sections in the ratio of the square of the waist 
diameters.
Lasers having an out-of-round gain medium are likely to produce beams with asym­
metric waists. A solid-state laser pumped from the end by an elliptical beam from a diode 
laser is an example. Mode selection is by the combined effects of gain aperturing and 
absorption in the unpumped regions. The resonant beam shape will mimic the geometry 
of the pumped region. Beam walk-off from angle-matched nonlinear processes can also 
produce asymmetric waists.
The third type is asymmetric divergence (Figure 1.15) where the beam qualities differ in the 
principal propagation planes to give proportionally different divergence angles, Θx ∝ Mx
2 ≠ 
My
2 ∝ Θy, but W0x = W0y, and z0x = z0y. The simplest description of this beam is that the mode 
in one principal propagation plane is of higher order than in the other. In the far-field, 
cross sections are elliptical as in case (b), but the beam is round only at the waist plane. The 
wavefronts are plane at the waist and ellipsoidal everywhere else and the Rayleigh ranges 
are different in the two principal propagation planes.
A CW dye laser using a high-viscosity dye jet provides an example of pure asymmetric 
divergence.39 The pump-beam spot was round, but the heat it deposited in the dye stream 
was cooled differentially by the flow. In the flow direction the temperature gradient was 
smoothed by the forced convection but in the other direction a more severe thermal gra­
dient existed, causing an aberration that resulted in M

 for the plane parallel to the flow with negligible aberration. Because of the 
round pump beam, waist asymmetry was only 2W0y/2W0x = 1.06.

1.8.2  The Equivalent Cylindrical Beam Concept
Beams with combinations of these asymmetries can be depicted with superposed (x, z) 
plane and (y, z) plane propagation plots as shown in Figure 1.16a. More generally there is a 
propagation plot W(𝛼, z) for each azimuth angle 𝛼 around the propagation axis z. The angle 
𝛼 is measured from the x-axis and W(𝛼, z) lies in the plane containing 𝛼 and the z-axis. The 
three-dimensional beam envelope shown in Figure 1.15a, b, or c is called the beam caustic

both astigmatism and waist asymmetry. The percentage variation of the constants of the equivalent cylindrical 
beam, computed from the plots for each instrument azimuth, is listed in the right-hand columns. The small 
variations demonstrate the constants are independent of the azimuth of the two orthogonal cutting planes 
intersecting the beam caustic surface. The constants of the equivalent cylindrical beam, in the box, correspond 
to the cuts at an instrument azimuth of 90°. (b) Diagram showing how a half-Brewster prism introduces both

surface, and is swept out by W(𝛼, z) as the azimuth angle 𝛼 rotates through a full circle 
from 0 to 2𝜋.
For beams with combinations of moderate asymmetries, it is convenient to define an 
equivalent cylindrical beam. This is a beam with cylindrical symmetry—with a round 
spot for all z—and the real-beam asymmetries are treated as deviations from this round 
beam. The constants defining this equivalent cylindrical beam are the best average of the 
beam constants for the two independent principal propagation planes. Many problems 
can be treated with just this simpler equivalent beam. In particular, it has been predicted 
theoretically (A.E. Siegman, personal communication, 1990) and demonstrated experi­
mentally40 that the centered circular aperture computed to give 86% transmission for the 
equivalent cylindrical beam, has this same transmission for the out-of-round real beam. 
The minimum aperture sizes for the real beam after propagation in free space can be 
computed using just the three equivalent cylindrical beam constants. Because the equiva­
lent cylindrical beam is round for all z like the radial modes discussed in Section 1.4, the 
subscript r is used to denote its constants, and the beam is sometimes called the equivalent 
radial mode.
The equivalent cylindrical beam is best understood by considering the plots of Figure 
1.16a. These were measured with the ModeMaster beam propagation analyzer.9 The profiler 
built into this instrument uses two knife-edge masks at right angles to each other. They are 
mounted on a rotating drum at 45° to the scan direction of the drum. This arrangement is 
equivalent to a vertical and a horizontal knife-edge, each scanned at 1/√2 times the actual 
scan speed of the drum, when the analyzer head’s azimuth angle is set to 45° to align one 
knife-edge with the horizontal. Each run to measure beam diameters versus propagation 
distance produces two propagation plots for the diameters at right angles to the two edges. 
Normally the analyzer head’s azimuth angle is adjusted to record the propagation plots in 
the two principal planes of the beam. For Figure 1.16a, the analyzer head’s azimuth angle 
was incremented in 15° steps through 90° and new sets of propagation plots recorded for 
each increment, generating the seven plots shown.
The asymmetric beam of Figure 1.16a was formed by inserting a Brewster-angle half 
prism41 in the cylindrically symmetric beam Mode E of Figure 1.10b and Figures 1.2g 
and h. The prism was oriented as in Figure 1.16b to produce a compression of the beam 
diameter in one dimension in the (x, z) plane. The prism thus introduces astigmatism and 
waist asymmetry to the beam. From Figure 1.16b the incoming wavefront of radius of cur­
vature R has a sagitta of the arc, d = W2/2R, which remains unchanged upon the transit of 
the prism while the beam diameter is compressed. For the Brewster-angle prism, it can be 
shown41 that the exiting beam diameter is smaller by the factor 1/n, where n is the index of 
refraction of the prism material, here silica with n = 1.46. The radius of curvature exiting 
the prism is thus R/n2. The M2 of the beam is unchanged in traversing the prism. From 
these three conditions both the reduced waist diameter in the x-direction and the astig­
matic distance introduced in the exiting beam can be determined [using Equations 1.16b 
and 1.17b and a little algebra] to be 2W0/n and As = (z0y − z0x) = −(1 − 1/n2)z0, where z0 is the 
propagation distance from the input waist location to the prism.
The propagation plots of Figure 1.16a are for the directly measured internal beam, behind 
the lens of the beam propagation analyzer. These were used because the beam diameter 
and propagation distance scales of the internal plots remain the same as the instrument 
azimuth is varied and this facilitates comparison of the plots. Notice in the top plot [45° 
instrument azimuth], because the internal propagation plots are shown, the axis with the 
n-times larger divergence and 1/n-times smaller waist is the y-axis, interchanged with the 
compressed x-axis of the external beam in the beam-lens transform of Section 1.5.

50 
Handbook of Optical and Laser Scanning
As the instrument azimuth angle moves around from the initial 45° value (which 
measures the principal propagation planes for this beam) to 90°, the plots from the two 
orthogonal edges coalesce into a single “average” curve, then separate with continuing 
azimuth increments. The plots at 135° are identical to the 45° plots with the x-edge and 
y-edge curves interchanged. The dashed and dotted vertical lines on each plot locate 
the waists for the x-edge and y-edge curves, respectively. The beam constants for the sym­
metric, 90°-azimuth plots are those for the equivalent cylindrical beam.
To visualize this process of cutting the beam caustic surface with two orthogonal planes, 
then rotating the azimuth of the cutting planes, look at Figure 1.15c. The initially vertical 
(y-edge) plane is cutting the caustic in its highest divergence plane, and moves towards 
a lower divergence W(𝛼, z) plot as the azimuth is incremented. The initially horizontal 
(x-edge) plane is cutting the caustic in its lowest divergence plane, and moves toward a 
higher divergence W(𝛼, z) plot as the azimuth is incremented. When the cutting planes 
reach 45° azimuth to the principal planes of the beam, the orthogonal propagation plots 
match as they would for a round beam with no asymmetries.
Siegman42 gives the following expressions for the beam constants of the equivalent cylin­
drical beam in terms of the six constants of the real beam:

The columns of numbers in Figure 1.16a demonstrate that the beam constants of the equiv­
alent cylindrical beam are the same when computed from plots for any azimuth, a neces­
sary condition for the equivalent cylindrical beam concept to be useful. The equivalent 
cylindrical beam quality, waist location, and waist diameter were computed for each azi­
muth increment from the plots shown, and normalized to the constants measured for the 
90° azimuth shown in the box. The percentage errors for these measurements are given in 
the three columns; the magnitudes of all errors are no larger than 2.5% and are within the 
instrument measurement tolerances.
From Equations 1.58 and 1.59 for an astigmatic beam the equivalent cylindrical waist 
lies between the two astigmatic waists, and the square of the cylindrical waist diameter 
exceeds the sum of the squares of the two astigmatic waist diameters. For a beam with no 
astigmatism (z0x = z0y) the equivalent cylindrical constants become:

2  and My
2 will have a round spot at the waist 
plane, but not in the far-field as illustrated in Figure 1.15c.
1.8.3  Other Beam Asymmetries: Twisted Beams, General Astigmatism
The shape of a beam caustic surface is determined by the straight-line paths of rays where 
they emerge at the margin of the particular beam. Such shapes are all examples of ruled 
surfaces and those depicted in Figure 1.15 are hyperboloids. In principle, any paraxial 
ensemble of light rays (i.e., a beam) will be enclosed by a ruled surface. Another example 
is a taut ribbon, and these surfaces can be twisted. Imagine the shapes of Figure 1.15 as 
taut, flexible membranes. Start with a shape similar to Figure 1.15b except with all of the 
cross sections being horizontally elongated ellipses (a beam with both asymmetric waists 
and divergence). Mentally rotate the far-field ellipses to vertical, the distant one by +90° 
and the foreground one by −90° azimuth, while keeping the waist ellipse horizontal. In 
propagating from z = −∞ to +∞ the elliptical cross sections of this beam twist through 180° 
of azimuth. Such a twisted beam can be physically realized and is said to have general 
astigmatism.15,16 Here all spots can be ellipses,15 a waist location is defined by a cross section 
having a uniform phasefront,16 and the Rayleigh range is defined as the distance of propa­
gation away from the waist that increments16 the Gouy phase by 𝜋/4.
Such beams are produced by nonorthogonal5 optical systems, for example, two astig­
matic elements in cascade with azimuth angles that differ by something other than 0° 
or 90°. Rays in the (x, z) and the (y, z) planes are coupled and cannot be independently 
analyzed. The general theory for spatial characterization of such beams uses ray matrices 
weighted by the Wigner density function4,17 averaged over a four-dimensional geometrical 
optics “phase space.” Rays are described by 4 × 1 column vectors; each vector gives the 
position x, y and slope u (= 𝜃x), v (= 𝜃y) of the ray at the location z along the propagation 
axis. There are 16 possible second-order moments of these variables; they propagate in 
free space with a quadratic expansion law.6,26 The square of the second-moment diameter 
D4
2
s is such a second-order moment and this is theoretical support this diameter definition 
enjoys. The beam matrix P, the 4 × 4 array of these 16 second-order moments, then fully 
characterizes the beam with general astigmatism.
The 16 possible second moments can be listed as

However, by symmetry 〈xy〉 = 〈yx〉, and so on; so that only ten of these are independent 
and in the list those in single quotes are redundant. The moments containing only spatial 
variables 〈x2〉, 〈xy〉, 〈y2〉 can be evaluated as the variances of irradiance pinhole profiles in 
the proper direction; the 〈xy〉 profile is at 45° to the x- or y-axes. The moments contain­
ing the angular variables cannot be evaluated directly, but are found by inserting optics 
(usually a cylindrical lens) and measuring downstream irradiance moments at appropri­
ate propagation distances.

52 
Handbook of Optical and Laser Scanning
From these moments, beam constants are calculated. The first six are the familiar set 2W0x, 
2W0y, z0x, z0y, M0x
2  , M0y
2   . The other four address the rate of twist of the phasefront and spot 
pattern with propagation distance, the generalized radii of curvature of the wavefronts 
and the orbital angular momentum43 carried per photon by the beam. Beam class­es are 
defined44 by values of invariants calculated from the ten second-order moments. A simple 
association of the resultant shapes for the beam caustic envelopes with each class is not 
immediately available from these definitions.
Twisted-phase beams have been generated by inserting an appropriate computer 
designed diffractive optical element into an ordinary beam.45,46 The first report of a beam 
from an “ordinary” laser (not one deliberately perturbed to produce a twisted phase) that 
required all ten matrix elements for its characterization, appeared in 2001.18 Nonorthogonal 
beams can arise in nonorthogonal resonators,5 such as in twisted-ring resonators. Until 
instruments are developed17 to measure all elements of the beam matrix P and then are 
applied to characterize beams from many of lasers, the fraction of laser beams with gen­
eral astigmatism will not be clear. The techniques discussed in previous sections are the 
methods that can be used together with various auxiliary optics to measure these second-
order moments.
1.9  APPLICATIONS OF THE M2 MODEL TO LASER BEAM SCANNERS
This section applies previous concepts and results to determine appropriate specifications 
for a laser used in an industrial scanning system, by working backward from the beam 
properties needed at the work surface. This example shows how parts of the M2 model 
interact in the design of a system and how the model can be applied to solve simpler indi­
vidual problems.
1.9.1 A Stereolithography Scanner
The example analyzes an actual stereolithography scanning system, shown in Figure 1.17. 
A multimode ultraviolet beam (of 325 nm wavelength) writes on a liquid photopolymer 
surface under computer control, selectively hardening tiny volume elements of plastic to 
build up a three-dimensional part. After a 1/4-mm thick slice (cross section) of the part 
is completed, a jack supporting the growing part inside the vat of liquid lowers the part 
and brings it back up to 1/4 mm below the surface for the next slice to be written. Parts of 
great complexity can be formed overnight directly from their CAD-file specifications. This 
process is called stereolithography and has created what is termed the “rapid-prototyping” 
industry.
Beam characteristics for the laser are shown in the data report of Figure 1.17. Much of the 
scanning system design elements used in this analysis are available in the literature.47–50 
The beam from the laser is expanded in an adjustable telescope that also focuses the spot 
on the liquid surface at the optimum beam spot size47 for the solidification process, 2W02 = 
0.25 mm ± 10%, measured with a slit profiler.
Notice first that the system geometry defines a maximum M2 for the laser beam in this 
application. The rapidly moving y-scan mirror benefits from a low moment of inertia and 
has a small diameter A. This is the minimum diameter needed to just pass the expanded 
beam incident on the mirror, making the beam diameter at the mirror 2WA be smaller than 
A only by some safety factor 𝛾 or 2WA = A/𝛾. From this mirror, the beam is focused on the 

Characterization of Laser Beams: The M2 Model 
53
liquid surface below at the throw distance T shown in Figure 1.17. The maximum con­
vergence angle of the beam focused on the vat surface is therefore Θ2|max = A/𝛾T (a larger 
angle would overfill the y-scan mirror). The focused beam waist diameter, given in the 
previous paragraph is 2W02; a diffraction-limited beam of that waist diameter—a normal­
izing gaussian—has a divergence angle of 𝜃n = 2𝜆/𝜋W02. This defines a maximum M2 for 
this application by Equation 1.22 of M2|max = Θ2|max/𝜃n = 𝜋W02A/2𝜆𝛾T.
This may be evaluated in two different ways. From scaling a photograph of the system,49 
an estimate for T can be made as between 0.6 m and 0.7 m, or a reasonable value is

T = 0.65 m. The y-scan mirror diameter A is likely that of a small standard substrate, such 
as A ~ 7.75 mm, and a likely safety factor is about 𝛾 ~ 1.5, yielding 2WA ~ 5.2 mm and Mslit
2 
~ 4.8. This rough estimate is refined in Section 1.9.5. This beam quality is given in slit units 
because this is the currency for the focal diameter at the vat; the assumption being made 
that the value of 2WA used is also in slit units for this estimate.
Alternatively, the beam diameter A/𝛾 can be determined working back from the vat to 
the y-scan mirror since it is known that the laser of Figure 1.17 is designed for this appli­
cation and that the measured data (given in Figure 1.17) are within the nominal beam 
specifications. Those measurements are in knife-edge currency9 (see Section 1.9.4). Once 
the knife-edge waist diameter at the vat is found, so is 𝜃n = 2𝜆/𝜋W02 and 2WA = TΘ = TM2𝜃n, 
all in knife-edge units. A diameter conversion is thus required to bring the diameter at the 
waist into knife-edge units for a consistent currency.
1.9.2  Conversion to a Consistent Knife-Edge Currency
By Equation 1.48, for any diameter definition i, the ratio Di/Mi equals the embedded gauss­
ian diameter 2w and therefore the conversion from slit to knife-edge diameters at the vat is 
just Dke = Dslit(Mke/Mslit). The square root of the beam quality Mke is known from the report 
(Figure 1.17), Mke = √(5.24) = 2.289. Here the R or “round beam” column value was used, the 
equivalent cylindrical beam constants as discussed in Section 1.9.4. To determine Mslit, use is 
made of the expression just above Equation 1.50 relating any Mi to any Mj for different diam­
eter definitions i and j. This conversion formula requires knowledge of the M2 of the starting 
currency j; M2 is known here only for knife-edge units, so j = knife-edge. The desired ending 
currency is in slit units, i = slit. Then Equation 1.50 gives the required conversion constant, in 
terms of the conversion constants to second-moment diameters from Table 1.1, as:

This gives (Mslit − 1) = 0.856(Mke − 1) = 1.103, thus Mslit = 2.103 and Mslit
2 = 4.423.
Then Equation 1.48 yields the focal diameter at the vat in knife-edge units, 2W02 ke = 0.272 
mm, a knife edge to slit diameter ratio of 1.088 for this beam. The “normalizing gaussian” 
divergence angle above is then evaluated as 𝜃n = 1.521 mr, the maximum convergence 
angle is larger than 𝜃n by M2 = 5.24, making the beam diameter at the y-scan mirror be 2WA 
= TM2𝜃n = 5.180 mm, all in knife-edge units.
For comparison, using the knife-edge to second-moment conversion constant from 
Table 1.1 and Equation 1.47 gives the second-moment beam quality and beam diameter at 
the vat of M2
4𝜎 = 4.19 and 2W02|4𝜎 = 0.243 mm. The irradiance profile in Figure 1.17 shows 
the relative size of the second-moment diameter to the knife-edge diameter. It is evident 
that the former would require a larger safety factor 𝛾 than the latter if used in estimating 
a safe minimum mirror aperture.
For the remainder of this section, diameters are all in knife-edge units and for simplicity 
the subscripts indicating this are suppressed.
1.9.3  Why Use a Multimode Laser?
What is the advantage of a multimode laser in this application? First, the critical optic, 
the scan mirror of diameter A, required for the larger multimode beam diameter is 

Characterization of Laser Beams: The M2 Model 
55
of reasonable size, so it is possible to use such a larger beam here. The significant 
advantage is seen from the product data sheet for this laser (CVI-Melles Griot Model 
74 Helium–Cadmium laser): with single isotope cadmium used in the laser (the X 
models on the data sheet) the multimode power is 55 mW, the fundamental-mode 
power is 13 mW, a ratio of 4.2 times. With natural isotopic mix cadmium, the num­
bers are 40 mW and 8 mW, a ratio of 5 times. Thus the laser’s output power is roughly 
proportional to its M2, making the multimode laser considerably smaller and less 
expensive than a fundamental-mode laser would be at the power level required for 
this application.
1.9.4 How to Read the Laser Test Report
Notice that the beam quality number used in Section 1.9.2 was from the “R” column (for 
radial or round mode) of the REPORT shown in Figure 1.17. These are the beam con­
stants for the equivalent cylindrical beam discussed in Section 1.8.2, the best theoretical 
average6,40,42 of the X and Y column constants for the two principal propagation planes 
on the report. Since there is less than 4% difference between Mx
2 and My
2, it is appro­
priate to use the average values in the R column and treat the beam as round for this 
exercise. The fact that the report is all in knife-edge units is signified by the “clip-levels” 
line reading 16%/84% (adjust: times 2.00) as explained in Reference 9. The EXTERNAL 
label means these constants are for the original beam external to the instrument, after the 
lens transform has been done from the constants measured for the INTERNAL auxiliary 
beam inside. Next, listed for the two principal propagation planes in the X and Y columns, 
and the equivalent cylindrical beam in the R column, are: the external beam waist diam­
eter 2W0; the beam diameter 2We at the instrument’s reference surface (the beam entrance 
plane at the front bezel, designated plane B); the waist location z0 measured from plane 
B (the zero point of the beam propagation axis) with negative values being back towards 
the laser;9 the Rayleigh range zR; and the beam divergence. Lastly, the significant beam 
asymmetry ratios are listed, with the astigmatism normalized to the equivalent cylindri­
cal beam’s Rayleigh range.
The whole report is readily converted into a different currency with a diameter a factor 
of 𝜏 larger, if desired, by multiplying the M2 values by 𝜏2, the diameters and the divergence 
by 𝜏, and leaving the z0, zR, values and the asymmetry ratios unchanged.
1.9.5  Replacing the Focusing Beam Expander with an Equivalent Lens
The beam expander of Figure 1.17, when left at a fixed focus setting, can be replaced with 
an equivalent thin lens placed at the y-scan mirror location, with the laser moved back 
a distance z01 from the lens, as shown in Figure 1.18b. The propagation over z01 expands 
the beam to match the spot size at this mirror. To find z01, Equation 1.16a is used to find 
the propagation distance for the required beam expansion of 𝜌 = 2WA/2W01 = (5.180 mm)/
(1.471 mm) = 3.521. Here 2W01 is the laser’s waist diameter in 1-space, on the input side of 
the equivalent lens, from the report of Figure 1.17. From Equation 1.16a, 𝜌 = √[1 + (z01/zR1)2], 
yielding z01/zR1 = √[𝜌2 − 1], and with the 1-space Rayleigh range zR1 = 0.995 m taken from 
the report, there results z01 = 3.359 m, also shown in Figure 1.18b.
The equivalent lens focal length fequiv ≡ f is next properly chosen to bring this beam to a 
focus at the vat. Since the waist diameters on either side of the equivalent lens are known, 
by Equation 1.26 the required transformation constant 𝛤 is also known. This then gives by

consistent with the quantities used in the lens transform z01 and fequiv above. This is given 
by Equation 1.28, now that 𝛤, z01, and fequiv are known, as z02 = 0.6472 m. This also shows that 
the original estimate of T was reasonable. The nominal values for the quantities involved 
in the equivalent lens transform are shown in Figure 1.18b. The effects of perturbing the 
nominal values are studied in Section 1.9.7.
1.9.6  Depth of Field and Spot-Size Variation at the Scanned Surface
With the equivalent lens transform defined, questions relating the input beam to the 
scanned beam can be answered. First, what is the amount of defocus over the scanned 
field? From Equation 1.27, the Rayleigh range in 2-space at the vat is zR2 = Γ zR1 = 3.404 cm. 
The longest radial scan distance is to the corner of the square vat of side length L = 250 mm, 
Figure 1.17, a distance of √2L/2 = L/√2. The variation in distance from the y-scan mirror to 
the corner of the square vat’s working surface is √[T2 + (L/√2)2] − T = 2.371 cm, or 0.696 times 
the vat side Rayleigh range. By Equation 1.16a, from the center of the vat to the far corner, 
the spot size of the beam will grow by a factor of √[1 + (0.696)2] = 1.219. The simplest way 
to reduce this range is to focus the beam at the middle of a side edge of the vat, at a radial 
distance of L/2 [see Figures 1.17 and 18a]. This splits the defocus amount 2𝛿 equally among 
the corners and the middle, to 11% maximum change in spot diameter on the liquid sur­
face over the scanned field. Equivalently, the liquid level could be raised by 𝛿. However, for 
simplicity the focal distance will be left at T here for the remainder of this analysis.
1.9.7  Laser Specifications to Limit Spot Out-of-Roundness on the Scanned Surface
Next, the inverse lens transform, from the vat side back to the laser side, is applied to 
transfer scanning beam specifications into laser-beam specifications. From Equation 1.31, 
for the transform equations going from 2-space to 1-space, use the inverse transformation 
constant Γ21 = 1/Γ12.
Since the lens transformation constant depends on both the input waist location and the 
Rayleigh range, in general beams without astigmatism but with some other asymmetry 
when transformed become astigmatic as the results in the remainder of this section show. 
The plan, starting from the nominal, round, equivalent cylindrical beam of Figure 1.17 
transformed to a round beam at the vat, is to perturb the beam at the vat to have a ~10% 
out-of-round spot. This beam is then transformed back to the laser to see which 1-space 
variables change and by how much, to account for the perturbation on the scanned side of 
the lens. The 10% out-of-roundness of the scanned spot is deemed acceptable because that 
amount of growth in spot diameter over the field was found acceptable above.
The perturbations are made as equal changes of opposite sign in the two independent 
propagation planes. For example, 10% out-of-roundness due to waist asymmetry is accom­
plished with a +5% change in W02y and a −5% change in W02x. The resulting changes in 
the 1-space beam constants are not completely symmetrical, due to the nonlinearity of the 
beam-lens transform. The effect of perturbing a constant in only one principal propagation 
plane is given directly in the tables by the percentage changes, the column in parentheses, 
for 1-space shown for that plane. Because the propagation planes are independent, so are 
the percentage changes in each plane.
1.9.7.1  Case A: 10% Waist Asymmetry
Assume 2W02x is reduced 5% (to 0.259 mm), and 2W02y is raised 5% (to 0.286 mm) to give a 
waist asymmetry different from unity by 10%. To calculate the effect on the input beam, first 

58 
Handbook of Optical and Laser Scanning
the new Rayleigh ranges for the beam at the vat are found as zR2x = 3.088 cm (reduced 10%) 
and zR2y = 3.753 cm (increased 10%). For each of these a new 1/𝛤 for the inverse transform 
is computed from Equation 1.24, followed by the remaining constants through Equations 
1.26 through 1.28. The results for the 1-space beam constants, and their percentage change 
shown in parentheses are summarized in Table 1.2. The initial value of 1/𝛤 is 29.2259. In 
the table As/zRr stands for the normalized astigmatism As/zRr = (z01y − z02x)/zR1r, where zR1r is 
the Rayleigh range in 1-space of the equivalent cylindrical beam.
The +10% pure waist asymmetry at the vat (i.e., accompanied by no astigmatism or 
divergence asymmetry) for the most part transforms through the lens to a correspond­
ing +8% waist asymmetry at the laser. The same is true for the divergence asymmetry. 
The different waist diameters at the vat, generate different Rayleigh ranges there and 
in the lens transform produce a −12% normalized astigmatism at the laser. Specify the 
laser to have less than these asymmetries to keep the scanned beam out-of-roundness 
below 10%.
1.9.7.2  Case B: 10% Divergence Asymmetry
Here it is assumed Mx
2 is reduced 5% and My
2 is increased by 5% to give a +10% change in 
the 2-space divergence asymmetry without changing the waist asymmetry W02y / W02x = 1. By 
Equation 1.18 or 1.19 the Rayleigh ranges on the vat side of the lens change inversely with 
their M2 to make them zR2x = 3.088 cm, zR2y = 3.753 cm. Applying Equations 1.24 through 
1.28 to each principal plane produces Table 1.3, the results for the 1-space beam constants 
and their percentage change.
The divergence asymmetry of the beam at the vat carries through the lens to the laser, 
and implies some astigmatism is necessary at the laser (but half as much as Case A) to get 
pure divergence asymmetry at the vat.

1.9.7.3  Case C: 12% Out-of-Roundness across the Scanned Surface Due to Astigmatism
A little discussion is required to define an out-of-roundness parameter for the focal region 
of an astigmatic beam in general before applying the concept to the focus at the vat. It 
has already been shown (Section 1.9.6) that the path length to the liquid surface changes 
over the scanned field by 2.37 cm. This path change causes a spot-size variation of 21.9% 
if the spot is focused at the center of the vat, and 11% if focused at the middle of a vat 
edge to reduce the variation across the scanned surface. On top of this, there is an out-of-
round change in the spot, if the beam is astigmatic. The fastest change of shape with z of 
the elliptical spots in a beam with pure astigmatism, Figure 1.16a, takes place between the 
two astigmatic waists in the focal region, which is the working region for the beam in the 
stereolithography system. Suppose the astigmatic distance z02y − z02x is matched to the path 
length change of 2.37 cm but the edge focus is used to split this distance (see Figure 1.18a). 
This makes the largest path between an astigmatic waist and the liquid working surface 
anywhere in the field be 1.19 cm. Then from Equation 1.16a and Figure 1.18c

where z02r is the equivalent cylindrical beam waist location halfway between the x and y 
waist locations. The spot at the vat only goes to 5.9% out-of-round, but the orientation of 
the out-of-round ellipse is along the y-axis in the corners where the liquid is below z02r and 
along the x-axis in the middle of the field where the liquid is above z02r. This can have an 
unpleasant effect on the part, because the textures of the x- and y-formed surfaces differ. 
Therefore, an adequate out-of-round parameter for the focal region of an astigmatic beam 
can be defined (Figure 1.18c) as 𝛽 ≡ (quadratic ratio of astigmatic diameters), where the 
product of the x-direction and y-direction out-of-round diameter ratios is

The ratios are evaluated at the two astigmatic waist locations as indicated in Equation 1.66. 
From the above, 𝛽 = (1.059)2 = 1.12 for an astigmatic distance equal to the scanned depth of 
field; this is taken here as “12% out-of-roundness due to astigmatism” for the final example.
The calculations proceed in this example with z02x = (0.6472 − 0.0119) m = 0.6353 m and 
z02y = (0.6472 + 0.0119) m = 0.6591 m, with the other 2-space beam parameters left at their 
unperturbed values of Figure 1.18b. Table 1.4 gives the results for the 1-space beam.

Handbook of Optical and Laser Scanning
This type of asymmetry, transformed back to the laser side of the equivalent lens, is 
devastating to the 1-space beam constants. More correctly, it would take devastating input 
beam characteristics to produce this large a “quadratic-ratio-of-astigmatic-diameters” 
parameter. There are large percentage changes in 1-space waist asymmetry, astigmatism, 
and divergence asymmetry. Actual lasers with asymmetries this large would be rejected 
by the laser manufacturer, and the scanner manufacturer would not have to deal with 
them. Lasers with sufficient beam asymmetry to give 𝛽 = 1.12 at the scanned surface would 
not make it into the field.
In conclusion, the strictest specifications found for the laser to meet upon incoming test­
ing were from Case A, yielding 10% waist asymmetry at the vat surface. To stay below this 
out-of-roundness at the vat, the analysis gave bounds at the laser of less than 12% normal­
ized astigmatism and less than 8% waist and divergence asymmetry. These values were 
easily met by the laser tested and reported in Figure 1.17. In an actual situation of setting 
laser specifications, several more examples should be run, including cases starting on the 
laser side and calculating the asymmetries that result in the scanning beam. Readers jour­
neying this far into this applications section should now have sufficient analytical tools 
provided by the M2 model to complete those calculations themselves.
1.10  CONCLUSION: OVERVIEW OF THE M2 MODEL
The M2 model provides description of real beams by generalizing the equations for the 
ideal fundamental-mode beam. Any real beam, whether made up of modes from a stable 
laser resonator or not, is larger in diameter by the factor M—for all propagation distances 
z—than the embedded gaussian beam implicit within it. Thus the change in equations 
takes the form of replacing the 1/e2 radius w of the embedded gaussian beam by W/M, 
where W is the radius of the real beam. This replacement generalizes both the beam propa­
gation and beam-lens transform equations.
The real beam, with waist diameter 2W0 being larger than the embedded gaussian by 
the factor M for all z, diverges at an M times larger rate. All diffraction-limited beams have 
a gaussian irradiance profile, and one of waist diameter 2W0, being M times larger than 
the embedded gaussian diverges at a rate 1/M as fast as the embedded gaussian. Hence 
the real beam divergence is M2 times larger than the diffraction limit. This identifies M2 
as a beam invariant unchanging in free space propagation or transmission through lenses, 
and as a measure of the beam quality. An M2 of unity is the highest quality, a diffraction-
limited beam, and real beams with larger values have increasing degrees of higher-order 
mode content and wavefront aberration (and hence are also called mixed-mode beams).
To apply this analytical description of a mixed-mode beam, its M2 must first be mea­
sured, and here the simplicity of the ideas becomes more complex. The measurement 
requires finding the scale length for expansion of the beam diameter with propagation, zR, 
the Rayleigh range. Several diameters at well-chosen z locations on both sides of the waist 
are determined and this data is fit to the correct hyperbolic form. The fit gives three beam 
constants—the beam quality, the waist diameter, and the waist location—for each inde­
pendent and orthogonal principal propagation plane.
The first additional complexity is that different definitions give different numerical val­
ues for the diameters for the mixed mode and the higher-order modes it contains. Beam 
diameters are still measured from beam irradiance profiles, but different profiling masks 

Characterization of Laser Beams: The M2 Model 
61
(pinholes, slits, knife-edges, or centered circular apertures) all give different shaped pro­
files for higher-order modes and hence different diameters. Care is required to keep track 
of which measurement “currency” is in use and to not mix different currencies. A standard 
diameter definition—the second-moment diameter, four times the standard deviation of 
a pinhole irradiance distribution of the beam—has been adopted by the ISO. However, 
this diameter is computation intensive and difficult to measure reliably because of sen­
sitivity to noise on the wings of the profile. Therefore, conversion rules have been devel­
oped applicable to cylindrically symmetric mixed-mode beams permitting measurements 
done in one diameter currency to be changed into another. The basis of these rules is our 
observation that higher-order modes turn on and off in a characteristic sequence as the 
diameter of the circular limiting aperture in the resonator is opened. This associates with 
the increasing second-moment M2 a unique set of mode fractions, allowing accurate con­
version rules to be derived.
The second additional complexity is that the diameter measurements and curve fits done 
to determine M2 may give unreliable answers unless several pitfalls in the process are 
avoided. Chief among these is that the mixed-mode waist must be accurately located and 
its diameter physically measured and not inferred or assumed. Since the waists of most 
lasers are buried inside the resonator, this requires the use of an auxiliary lens to form an 
auxiliary beam with an accessible waist. The constants determined for this auxiliary beam 
then are transformed back to those for the original beam by means of the beam-lens trans­
form equations. Commercial instruments that do this automatically are available.
Beams with pure forms of the classic asymmetries have been illustrated, those with only 
astigmatism, or waist asymmetry, or divergence asymmetry. Beams with combinations 
of asymmetries may be represented by pairs of propagation plots, one for each principal 
propagation plane. Beam asymmetries can also be interpreted as deviations from a theo­
retical “best weighted average” round beam, the equivalent cylindrical beam. There are 
also beams not directly covered in the M2 model whose principal propagation planes twist 
in space like a twisted ribbon—beams with “general astigmatism.”
Lastly, the M2 model was demonstrated by analyzing an actual laser-beam scanning sys­
tem used in stereolithography. Asymmetries causing out-of-round spots on the scanned 
surface were analytically projected back through the delivery system to determine the size 
of the corresponding asymmetries at the laser source.
There are many applications of the M2 model. It quantifies the mode specifications for 
commercial lasers, with the means to test to these specifications. Its use permits design 
of multimode lasers and their beam delivery systems. The beam transformations occur­
ring in nonlinear optics can be analyzed. The divergence of a high M2 laser beam can be 
matched into the acceptance angle a high numerical aperture fiber, to take advantage of 
the lower cost per unit of output power of a multimode laser. These are just a few of many 
other applications, all with the backup of commercial instrumentation to make the beam 
measurement process easy and efficient. This chapter has provided the analytical tools to 
make these applications realities.

GLOSSARY
Astigmatism, general: The property of beams having elliptical cross sections for all z, 
with the principal axes of the ellipses rotating with propagation along the beam 
axis (nonorthogonal beams; “twisted” beams).
Astigmatism, normalized: The difference in waist locations for the two independent prin­
cipal propagation planes divided by the Rayleigh range of the equivalent cylindri­
cal beam, As/zRr = (z0y − z0x)/zRr, usually expressed in percent.
Astigmatism, simple: Having different waist locations in the two principal propagation 
planes, z0x ≠ z0y.
Asymmetric divergence: Having different divergence angles Θx ≠ Θy in the two principal 
propagation planes.
Asymmetric waists: Having different waist diameters in the two principal propagation 
planes, 2W0x ≠ 2W0y.
Beam caustic surface: The envelope of the beam swept out by rotating the curve of the 
beam radius W(z) versus propagation distance about the propagation axis z. When 
a plane containing the z-axis and at an angle 𝛼 to the x-axis cuts the caustic sur­
face the intersection gives the propagation plot for azimuth 𝛼. See the discussion 
of Figure 1.16a.
Beam, equivalent cylindrical: A cylindrically symmetric beam constructed mathemati­
cally in the M2 model from the beam constants measured in the two principal 
propagation planes of an asymmetric beam, see the explanation of Figure 1.16a. 
The propagation plot for the equivalent cylindrical beam is obtained from the 
beams of Figure 1.15 by slicing their caustic surfaces along the z-axis at a 45° incli­
nation to the x- or y-axes. This is the best cylindrically symmetric average beam 
for a beam with asymmetry. The subscript r is used to denote the constants for this 
beam, for round or radial symmetry.
Beam, gaussian: A uniphase beam with spherical wavefronts whose transverse irradiance 
profiles everywhere have the form of a gaussian function. Such an idealized beam 
is diffraction limited with M2 = 1, a condition that can only be approached by real 
beams.
Beam, idealized: The abstract mathematical description of a beam (which can have M2 = 1).
Beam propagation analyzer: An instrument that measures beam diameters as a function 
of propagation distance, displays the 2W(z) versus z propagation plot, and curve 
fits this data to a hyperbola to determine beam quality M2, waist location z0, and 
waist diameter 2W0.
Beam propagation constant M2: So called because replacing the fundamental-mode radius 
w(z) in its propagation equation by w(z) = W(z)/M predicts the propagation of the 
mixed mode, of radius W(z).

Characterization of Laser Beams: The M2 Model 
63
Beam quality: The quantity M2, so called because a real beam has M2 times the divergence 
of a diffraction-limited beam of the same waist diameter; see also “normalizing 
gaussian.”
Beam, real: An actual beam; all have at least slight imperfections and thus an M2 greater 
than one.
Clip width: Distance (on the mask translation axis) between the points on an irradiance 
profile at a specified fraction (such as 13.5%) of the height of the highest peak.
Conversions, beam diameter: Empirical rules derived for beams of cylindrical symmetry, 
to convert diameters measured by one method to those measured by another, such 
as slit diameters to knife-edge diameters.
Convolution error: Contribution to the measured diameter from the finite size of the scan­
ning aperture; minimizing this is an important consideration for pinhole and slit 
measurements.
Cut: A beam diameter measurement, from the cutting action of a profiler’s scanning 
aperture.
Diameter, 1/e2: Beam diameter defined by the aperture translation distance between clip 
points on an irradiance profile at a height of 13.5% = 1/e2 relative to the highest 
peak at 100%.
Diffractive overlay: Interference from high angle rays overlapping the beam, diffracted 
from the limiting aperture in the resonator. This can distort profiles taken close to 
the laser output coupler (within a Rayleigh range).
Eigenfunctions: A set of functions fn associated with a linear operator Q satisfying 
Qfn = cnfn, where the cn are scalar constants (the eigenvalues). Because of this self-
replicating property these functions occur in many physical problems, for example, 
the laser mode functions that also describe the harmonic oscillator and hydrogen 
wave functions in quantum mechanics.
Embedded gaussian: The fundamental mode of the resonator that generates a mixed-
mode beam. The mixed-mode beam diameter is M times larger than the embed­
ded gaussian beam diameter at all propagation distances z.
Far-field: The propagation region(s) of a beam many Rayleigh ranges away from the waist 
locations. In the far-field, the transverse extent of the beam grows linearly with 
increasing distance from the waist.
Four-cuts method: The simplest method for determining M2, requiring only four well-
chosen diameter measurements both straddling the waist location and at the waist 
location.
Fresnel number: The square of the radius of the limiting aperture in a resonator, divided 
by the mirror separation and the wavelength. As the aperture is opened and this 
number increases, modes of higher order oscillate and join the mix of modes.
Gaussian: A mathematical function of the form exp(−x2); see also “beam, gaussian.”
Hermite–Gaussian function: An eigenfunction of the wave equation including diffrac­
tion, which describes beams of rectangular symmetry, of the form of a gaussian 
function times a pair of Hermite polynomials of orders (m, n).
Invariant, beam: A quantity that is unchanged by propagation in free space or trans­
mission through ordinary, nonaberrating, optical elements (lenses, Brewster win­
dows, etc.).
Irradiance: The power per unit cross-sectional area of the beam.
Laguerre–Gaussian function: An eigenfunction of the wave equation including diffrac­
tion, that describes beams of cylindrical symmetry of the form of a gaussian func­
tion times a generalized Laguerre polynomial of order (p, l).

Handbook of Optical and Laser Scanning
M2: The ratio of the waist diameter-divergence angle product of the mixed-mode beam, to 
that for the embedded gaussian of that beam. A beam invariant, this is also called 
the “times-diffraction-limit” number, the beam quality, and the beam propagation 
factor.
Mode: The characteristic frequencies and transverse irradiance patterns of beams formed 
in laser oscillators, described by Hermite–Gaussian and Laguerre–Gaussian func­
tions, denoted by the symbols TEMm,n, TEMp,l with m, n or p, l the order numbers 
of the function’s polynomials.
Mode, degenerate: Two modes with the same optical frequency, and therefore, order 
numbers.
Mode, donut: A starred mode, TEM*01, with the second-lowest diffraction loss through a 
circular limiting aperture, and an irradiance profile with a hole (null) in the center 
(see Figure 1.1).
Mode, fundamental: The TEM00 mode, with a gaussian irradiance distribution, a single-
spot peaked profile, the lowest mode order and smallest beam diameter from a 
given resonator, and with M2 = 1 in the limit of perfection. Thus this mode has the 
lowest diffraction loss through a centered circular limiting aperture.
Mode, higher order: Any mode of order number greater than that of the fundamental 
mode.
Mode, longitudinal: A mode of frequency q(c/2L), where c is the speed of light and q is a 
large integer equal to the number of beam wavelengths that fit in the round trip 
path 2L of the resonator. The (q + 1)th longitudinal mode has a frequency (c/2L) 
higher than the qth; each longitudinal mode is associated with a given transverse 
mode.
Mode, lowest order: The fundamental mode, of order number one.
Mode, mixed: An incoherent superposition of pure modes, all from the same resonator, 
with a diameter 2W that is M times larger for all z than 2w, the fundamental-mode 
diameter from the set. Also called a real beam as only idealized beams have M2 = 
1 (indicating zero higher-order mode content).
Mode order number: For Hermite–Gaussian modes, (m + n + 1); for Laguerre–Gaussian 
modes, (2p + l +1); the order numbers determine the mode frequencies and phase 
shifts, and give the mode’s beam quality M4
2
s  measured in second-moment units.
Mode or spot pattern: The two-dimensional pattern of the irradiance distribution as 
would be viewed on a flat surface inserted normally in the beam.
Mode, pure: Any transverse mode that is not a mixture of modes of different orders.
Mode, starred: A circularly symmetric mode that is a composite of two degenerate modes 
combined in space and phase quadrature, that is, superposed with a copy of itself 
after a 90° rotation (see Figure 1.1).
Mode, transverse: A mode, designated by the symbols TEMm,n, TEMp,l, whose transverse 
irradiance distribution is described by the Hermite–Gaussian or Laguerre–
Gaussian functions of m, n or p, l order numbers.
Near-field: The beam propagation region(s) within a Rayleigh range from the waist location.
Noise-clip option: A test of the sensitivity to noise of the second-moment diameter com­
puted from a pinhole profile, consisting of discarding any profile data with nega­
tive values after subtraction of the background to see the change this makes in the 
computed diameter.
Normalizing Gaussian: A diffraction-limited, idealized gaussian beam of the same waist 
diameter as a mixed-mode real beam, whose divergence is used as the denomina­
tor in a ratio with the real beam’s divergence to compute the real beam’s M.2

Characterization of Laser Beams: The M2 Model 
65
Paraxial: Meaning close to the beam axis, this refers to a ray (or bundle of rays) propagat­
ing at an angle small enough with respect to the central axis that this angle and its 
tangent are essentially equal.
Power-in-the-bucket: Alternate term for D86, the variable-aperture beam diameter 
definition.
Principal diameters (of an elliptical spot): The diameters along the major and minor axes 
of the ellipse.
Principal propagation planes, independent: The two perpendicular planes containing 
the major and minor axes of an elliptical beam spot (x- and y-axes) and the prop­
agation axis (z). In the M2 model the three propagation constants for each of these 
two planes are independent.
Profile: The record of transmitted power versus translation distance of a small aperture or 
other mask scanned across the beam.
Profile, knife-edge: A profile taken with a knife edge mask, yielding a tilted S-shaped 
curve.
Profile, pinhole: A profile taken with a pinhole aperture and capable of showing all the 
irradiance highs and lows but requiring careful centering of the beam to the 
scanned track of the pinhole. Signal-to-noise ratio and convolution error are 
inversely dependent on the pinhole diameter making the hole diameter an impor­
tant consideration.
Profiler: An instrument for measuring beam diameters, that scans a mask (pinhole, slit, or 
knife-edge) through the beam, displays the resulting profile, and (usually) reports 
the beam diameter on a digital readout as the scan distance—or clip width— 
between preset clip points on the profile.
Profile, slit: A profile taken with a slit aperture, showing something of the irradiance 
highs and lows and not requiring centering of the beam to the scanned track. 
Signal-to-noise ratio and convolution error are counterdependent on the slit width, 
making it an important consideration.
Propagation constants: The set of parameters: waist diameter 2W0, waist location z0, and 
beam quality M2, in each of the two principal propagation planes that define how 
the transverse extent of a beam changes as it propagates.
Propagation plot: The plot of beam diameter versus propagation distance, 2W(z) versus z. 
For the beams covered in the M2 model, the form of this plot is a hyperbola.
Rayleigh range: In the M2 model, the propagation distance zR from the waist location 
to where the wavefront reaches maximum curvature, also the distance from the 
waist to where the beam diameter has increased by √2, and the scale length for 
beam expansion with propagation, zR = 𝜋W0
2/M2𝜆.
Resonator: The aligned set of mirrors providing light feedback in a closed path through the 
gain medium in a laser. Since the wavefront curvatures and surface curvatures must 
match at the mirrors, the resonator determines the mode properties of the beam.
Scan: Movement of a mask or aperture transversely across a beam while recording the 
transmitted power; see “cut.”
Second-moment diameter: D4𝜎, equal to four times the standard deviation, 𝜎, of the trans­
verse irradiance distribution obtained from a pinhole profile.
Second-moment, linear: The integral over the transverse plane of the square of the linear 
coordinate times the irradiance distribution, for example, 〈x2〉, used in calculating 
the variance of the distribution 𝜎2 = 〈x2〉 − 〈x〉2.
Second-moment, radial: The integral over the transverse plane of the irradiance distri­
bution times the square of the radial coordinate measured outwardly from the 

66 
Handbook of Optical and Laser Scanning
centroid of the spot, for example 〈r2〉, used in calculating the variance of the distri­
bution 𝜎r
2 = 〈r2〉. In the integration the distribution is weighted by r3 since the area 
element is dA = rdr d𝜃.
Spot:	
The two-dimensional irradiance distribution or cross section of a beam as seen on 
a flat surface normal to the beam axis.
Stigmatic: Describes a beam that maintains a round cross section as it propagates, or more 
formally, a beam that maintains a rotationally symmetric irradiance distribution 
in free space. (The opposite term is astigmatic, where cross sections are elliptical at 
some propagation distances z.)
TDL, times-diffraction-limit number: The number of times the divergence of a real beam 
is larger than that of a diffraction-limited beam (called the normalizing gaussian) 
of the same waist diameter; TDL = Θ/𝜃n = M2. Also the factor by which a real-beam 
waist diameter is larger than that for a gaussian beam (M2 = 1) converging at the 
same numerical aperture (NA).
TEMmn: (For Transverse ElectroMagnetic wave). A symbol used to designate a transverse 
mode of rectangular symmetry described by a Hermite–Gaussian function with 
polynomial orders m, n.
TEMpl: (For Transverse ElectroMagnetic wave). A symbol used to designate a transverse 
mode of cylindrical symmetry described by a Laguerre–Gaussian function with 
polynomial orders p, l.
Thresholding: A method for noise reduction in the readout of a CCD camera frame by 
measuring the noise level in nonilluminated portions of the frame (such as the 
corners) from which a standard deviation 𝜎 is calculated, then subtracting a uni­
form noise floor level (typically of 3𝜎 amplitude) from the entire frame before pro­
cessing the signal.
Variable-aperture diameter: D86, (or Dxx) the diameter of a centered circular aperture pass­
ing 86.5% (or xx%) of the total power in the beam.
Waist, beam: The location on the beam propagation plot where the beam diameter is at a 
minimum; also used for the value of this minimum diameter.
Waist diameters: 2W0x, 2W0y, the minimum diameters in each principal propagation 
plane.
Waist locations: z0x, z0y, the points along the propagation axis where the minimum (waist) 
diameter(s) of the beam in each of the independent principal propagation planes 
are located.
Wave equation: Propagation of paraxial rays including the effect of diffraction are 
described by either the Fresnel–Kirchhoff diffraction integral equation of Boyd 
and Gordon2 or the simple scalar wave equation used by Kogelnik and Li;1 both 
have the Hermite–Gaussian and Laguerre–Gaussian functions as eigenfunction 
solutions.

2.1  INTRODUCTION
This chapter builds on the original work of Robert E. Hopkins and David Stephenson on 
optical systems for laser scanners1 to provide yet another perspective. The goal of this 
chapter is to provide the background knowledge that will help develop an insight and 
intuition for optical designs in general and scanning systems in particular. Combined 
with a familiarity with optical design tools, these insights will help lead to optical designs 
with higher performance and fewer components. Design issues and considerations for 
holographic scanning systems are discussed in detail.
The interactions between optical requirements and constraints imposed on optical sys­
tems for laser scanners are explored. The optical components that many applications of 
laser scanning depend on to direct and focus the laser beam are discussed, including 
lenses, mirrors, and prisms.

Optical Systems for Laser Scanners 
71
The optical invariant, first-order issues, and third-order lens design theory as they relate 
to scanning systems are presented as a foundation to the layout and design of the optical 
systems. Representative optical systems, with their characteristics, are listed along with 
drawings showing the lenses and ray trajectories. Some of the optical systems used for 
scanning that require special methods for testing and quality control are reviewed.
2.2  LASER SCANNER CONFIGURATIONS
Optical system configurations for laser scanners can vary in complexity from a simple col­
limated laser source and scanner to one including beam conditioning optical components, 
modulators, cylinders, anamorphic optical relays, laser beam expanders, multiple scan­
ners, and anamorphic optical components for projecting the scanned beam.
The scanned laser beam can be converging, diverging, or collimated. Figure 2.1 illus­
trates the three basic scanning configurations: objective, post-objective, and pre-objective 
scanning.2
2.2.1  Objective Scanning
The objective scanning configuration, where the objective, laser source, image plane, or a 
combination of these is moved, is the least common method of optical scanning. Objective

Handbook of Optical and Laser Scanning
scanning is accomplished by rotating about a remote axis as illustrated in Figure 2.1 (or 
translating in a linear fashion) a focusing objective across the collimated beam. The mov­
ing objective can be a reflective mirror, refractive lens, or diffractive element (such as a 
holographic disc). The fundamentals of holographic scanning will be described beginning 
in Section 2.11.
2.2.2  Post-objective Scanning
The post-objective scanning configuration requires one of the simplest optical systems 
because it works on-axis. The rotation axis of the scanner can be orthogonal to the opti­
cal axis as with a galvanometer (as illustrated in Figure 2.1) or coaxial, as in the case of a 
monogon scanner.
For many low-resolution applications (barcode scanners, for instance), simple lenses are 
sufficient to expand or begin focusing the beam prior to being scanned. As system resolu­
tion requirements increase, larger numerical apertures and better optical correction will 
require additional lens elements and element complexity (such as doublets for spherical 
and color correction). The disadvantage of post-objective scanning is that the focal plane is 
curved, requiring an internal drum surface.
From an optical viewpoint, internal drum scanning offers high resolution over large 
formats with relatively simple optics. The laser beam, lens elements, and monogon scanner 
can be mounted coaxially into a carriage, with the scanner rotated about the optical axis of 
the incident laser beam. In such a system, the scanned spot would trace a complete circle 
on the inside of a cylinder. Translating either the carriage (scanning optical subsystem) or 
the drum will generate a complete two-dimensional raster. This type of system is ideal 
for inspecting the inside surface of a tube or writing documents inserted on the inside of 
a drum.
2.2.3  Pre-objective Scanning
In a pre-objective scanning configuration the beam is first scanned into an angular 
field and then usually imaged onto a flat surface. The entrance pupil of the scan lens is 
located at or near the scanning element. The clearance from the scanner to the scan lens 
is dependent on the entrance pupil diameter, the input beam geometry, and the angle 
of the scanned field. The complexity of the scan lens is dependent on the optical correc­
tion required over a finite scanned field, that is, spot size, scan linearity, astigmatism, and 
depth of focus (DOF).
Pre-objective scanners are the most commonly seen systems; these systems often require 
multielement flat-field lenses. The special conditions described in the next few sections 
must be considered during the design of these lenses.
2.3  OPTICAL DESIGN AND OPTIMIZATION: OVERVIEW
Computers and software packages available to the optical designer for the layout, design/
optimization, and analysis of optical systems (including developments in global optimi­
zation and synthesis algorithms) can be very powerful tools. Despite these advances, the 
most important tools available to the optical designer are simply a calculator, pen and

paper, and a keen understanding of the first- and third-order fundamentals. These fun­
damentals provide key tools for back-of-the-envelope assessment of the issues and limita­
tions in the preliminary phases of an optical design.
A successful design begins with an appropriate starting point including: (1) a list of 
the system specifications to scope the design problem, assess its feasibility, and guide the 
design process (see example list given in Table 2.1); (2) a first-order layout of the system 
configuration—the position of optical component groups, the aperture stop, and interme­
diate pupils and images; and (3) the selection of candidate design forms for the design of 
the optical component groups. Parameters that are entirely dependent on other specifica­
tions (in other words redundant) can be listed as reference parameters to provide further 
clarity.
The important fundamentals in the design of an optical system are as follows:
	
1.	First-order parameters, particularly the optical invariant
	
2.	First-order diffraction theory
	
3.	Third-order aberrations
and then the rest.
Understanding the fundamentals can often mean the difference between achieving a 
simple “relaxed” design (with fewer optical components and a reduced sensitivity to fabri­
cation and alignment errors), and a complicated “stressed” design, which meets the nomi­
nal performance goals but is difficult to assemble to meet as-built specifications.
A relaxed design will have low net third-order aberrations with reduced and distributed 
individual surface contributions to minimize induced higher order aberrations that can 
affect the performance of the as-built system. Lens elements in a relaxed design will gener­
ally bend with the marginal or chief ray, based on the intermediate speed and field of view 
demands of the system. Figure 2.2 shows a microscope objective where most air/glass 
surfaces are bent to minimize marginal ray angles of incidence and therefore minimize

individual surface aperture-dependent aberrations and a wide field of view fisheye objec­
tive where most surfaces are bent to minimize chief ray angles of incidence, minimiz­
ing individual surface field dependent aberrations. The ability to recognize which design 
forms work better over the field and which work better over the aperture will help in 
developing relaxed design forms.
Spherical surfaces are naturally easier to fabricate and test. However, aspheric sur­
faces (as a design variable) can be used to gain insight into what is holding back a 
design, or help find a new design form. Their moderate use can save weight and space, 
or they can often be replaced later in the design process with additional spherical ele­
ments. Aspheric surfaces can also be over used, with surfaces competing for correc­
tion during the optimization process, leading to overly complex and tolerance-sensitive 
design solutions.
Design variables such as surface curvatures, the airspace or glass thickness between sur­
faces, and glass types, and optimization constraints appropriate to the design should be 
used. Too many variables and/or constraints, particularly conflicting ones, will limit the 
optimization convergence and performance of the design. Glass type and element thick­
ness are often weak design variables. When glass variables are important, parameters such 
as cost, availability, production schedule, weight, and transmission, in addition to baseline 
performance must be considered in their final selection. Changing the glass map boundar­
ies during the optimization process (allowing a wider range early in the design) can lend 
insight into possible alternative solutions. Vendor glass maps and catalogs are useful ref­
erence tools during the selection of glass types.
Anamorphic optical systems using combinations of cylindrical, toroidal, and anamor­
phic surfaces (with different radii in X and Y directions) can add more degrees of freedom 
and lens complexity, but are substantially more difficult to fabricate and test.
2.4  OPTICAL INVARIANTS
The optical invariant is defined at any arbitrary plane in a medium with refractive index 
n as a function of the paraxial marginal ray height and angle (ym and num) and parax­
ial chief ray height and angle (yc and nuc), as illustrated in Figure 2.3 and given by the 
relationship

The optical invariant, as the name implies, is a constant throughout the optical system, 
provided it is not modified by discontinuities in the optical system such as diffusers, grat­
ings, or other discontinuities such as vignetting apertures. The optical invariant is typi­
cally calculated at the object, aperture stop, or final image of the system, conveniently 
defined by the product of the object (or image) height times marginal ray angle or pupil 
height times chief ray angle. At the aperture stop or a pupil plane the chief ray height yc is 
equal to zero, and the optical invariant reduces to

where the chief ray angle term (nuc) is the paraxial half-field or scan angle. At the object 
or an image plane the marginal ray height ym is equal to zero, and the optical invariant 
reduces to

(2.3)
where the marginal ray angle term (num) is the paraxial equivalent of the sine of the 
cone half angle in air of the light focused on the image plane, known as the numer­
ical  aperture (NA). These reduced invariant equations are very useful when dealing 
with  the optical properties at intermediate images or pupil conjugates within the 
system.
The f-number of a lens, defined as the lens focal length F divided by the design entrance 
aperture diameter (DL), is also used to describe the image cone angle, with the relationship 
between NA and f-number (F/#) for infinite conjugates given by

2.4.1  The Diffraction Limit
Most scanning systems are required to perform at or very near the diffraction limit. The 
fundamental limit of performance for an imaging system of focal length F, illuminated 
by a uniform plane wave of wavelength λ and truncated by an aperture of diameter D is 
defined by the Airy disk first diffraction ring diameter

gence angle, the waist-invariant becomes

2.4.2  Real Gaussian Beams
Laser scanning systems typically use a near-Gaussian input beam. The degree to which 
the beam is Gaussian (TEM00) depends on the type of laser and the quality of the beam. 
Siegman3 has shown that real laser beams (irregular or multimode) can be described ana­
lytically by simply knowing the near-field beamwidth radius W0 and far-field half diver­
gence angle Θ1/2, defined for each as the standard deviations measured in two orthogonal 
planes coincident with the axis of propagation. The product of these parameters defines 
the real beam waist-invariant and is proportional to the Gaussian beam diffraction limit 
given by

(2.9)
where the factor M2 defines the “times-diffraction-limit.” When comparing beams of equal 
waist or divergence, the real beam divergence or waist, respectively, will be greater than 
the diffraction limit by a factor M2, as illustrated in Figure 2.4. The waist-invariant of a real 
beam will always be greater than the Gaussian diffraction limit.
Engineers developing scanning systems often use the concept of spot diameter. The 
specifications will call for a spot diameter measured at a specified intensity level, typi­
cally the 1/e2 and the 50% intensity levels. The maximum allowable growth of spot size 
across the length of the scan line is also included in the specification. Measurements by 

Optical Systems for Laser Scanners 
77
commercially available instruments that measure spot profile with a scanning slit will dif­
fer from the calculated point-spread function of the point image because the spot profile 
is determined by integrating the irradiance as the slit passes over the point image. This 
line-spread function measurement of the Airy disc does not have zeros in the irradiance 
distribution and is a more appropriate measure of integrated exposure when the spot is 
constantly moving during the exposure.
2.4.3  Truncation Ratio
Laser scanning systems typically use a near-Gaussian input beam with some truncation. 
Truncation means that a hard aperture restricts the diameter extent of the Gaussian beam, 
usually located in the input collimator. The truncation ratio (W) is the ratio of the diameter 
of the Gaussian beam DB (usually defined at the 1/e2 irradiance level), to the diameter of 
the truncating aperture DL, defined as

(2.10)
Figure 2.5 shows how the image of a diffraction-limited beam is affected by different trun­
cation ratios.
It is important to remember that a scan lens does not have a fixed aperture stop and that 
the lens diameters are actually much larger than the design aperture to pass the oblique ray 
bundles of the scanned beam. The prescan collimated beam, often called the feed beam, 
usually determines the aperture. The diameter of the beam should be no larger than the 
diameter of the largest beam for which the lens can provide the required image quality, 
which is usually diffraction-limited. This is called the design aperture and is the value to 
use for DL, when calculating truncation ratio W, but does not refer to the actual physical 
diameter of the scan lens.
Extending the definition of the diffraction limit to include the effect of the truncation 
ratio leads to the definition

The value of kx depends on the truncation ratio W and the level of irradiance in the image 
spot used to measure the diameter of the image. Figure 2.6 shows how the value of kx and 
consequently the diameter of the image of a point source is affected by different amounts 
of the truncation ratio W. Figure 2.6 also shows two criteria for the image diameter d, one

There are several points to consider when deciding what truncation ratio to use. It would 
appear that the Gaussian beam spot with a 1.83λ diameter dependence is smaller than the 
uniform beam Airy disc with a 2.44λ diameter dependence. However, the Gaussian beam 
diameter formula refers to the 13.5% irradiance level in the image, while the Airy disc 
formula relates to the diameter of the first zero in irradiance. Figure 2.5 illustrates this 
with the irradiance distributions of the near-uniform illumination of the W = 10 curve 
approaching that of an Airy disc pattern that is narrower than the truncated Gaussian 
illumination beam of the W = 1. On the other hand, the Airy disc image has more energy 
out in the wings of the image than does the Gaussian beam.
It is clear that the heavier truncation ratios (W ≫ 1, e.g. where a given fixed aperture is 
overfilled by a Gaussian beam to a nearly uniform illumination) yield smaller spot sizes, 
but they also suffer the flare or side lobes from the diffraction rings formed by the trun­
cated beam. For this reason, many designers believe that lower values of W (in the 0.5–1.0 
range) are a better compromise, providing more light with less danger of image flare.
2.5  PERFORMANCE ISSUES
This section describes the terminology and unique image requirements of laser scan-lens 
design that are not typical factors in the design for most photographic objectives.
2.5.1  Image Irradiance
There are subtle differences to be considered in the calculation of image irradiance pro­
duced by a scan lens, compared to that of a normal camera lens. In galvanometer and poly­
gon laser beam scanners, while the design aperture stop of scan lenses should be located 
on or near the deflecting mirror surface, these turning mirrors do not alter the circular 
diameter of the incoming beam as the deflection changes. This is different from a camera 
lens, which has a fixed aperture stop perpendicular to the lens optical axis. The oblique 
beam in a camera lens is foreshortened by the cosine of the angle of obliquity on the aper­
ture stop. Designing the scan lens with a slightly larger entrance pupil (by the inverse 
cosine of the field angle) will provide a good first-order solution.
Most lens design programs do not automatically take this aperture effect into account, 
so at some point in the design process it will be necessary to use the proper tilts in the 
design program to maintain the beam diameter at each field angle to be optimized. This 
can be done in the multiconfiguration (or zoomed) setup available in most of the commer­
cial design programs. The design program then optimizes several versions of the design 
simultaneously. Section 2.8.4 discusses in greater detail how multiconfiguration design 
procedures can be used in scan-lens design.
2.5.2  Image Quality
Addressability is an important term widely used in laser scanning. It refers to the least 
resolvable separation between two independent addressable points on a scan line. When 

80 
Handbook of Optical and Laser Scanning
the concept of spot diameter is used to describe optical performance, it is difficult to know 
how close the two spots can be to recognize them as separate points. Electrical engineers 
tend to think in terms of Fourier analysis, suggesting the concept of the modulation trans­
fer function (MTF).21
The MTF specification can offer advantages in describing the optical performance of 
laser scanners. Figure 2.7 shows MTF plots for diffraction-limited images formed with 
truncation ratios W of 10 (near Airy disc), 2, 1, and 0.5. It is clear that the lower values of 
truncation have higher MTF for the low frequencies. The best value for W is close to 1. At 
this truncation ratio the MTF is highest, up to 43% of the design aperture theoretical cutoff 
frequency. This suggests that the principle of design to follow is to use a value of W close 
to 1 and design to as small an F/# as possible, consistent with the performance and cost 
considerations.
The foregoing rule is based on a perfect image. In attempting to increase the MTF at 
frequencies below 43% of the cutoff frequency, problems with aberration eventually occur 
in the large design apertures required. Fortunately, the small values of W mean that the 
intensity of the rays near the edge of the aperture is reduced, so the acceptable tolerance on 
the wavefront aberrations can be relaxed. It is not as easy to give a rule-of-thumb tolerance 
on the wavefront errors because it depends on the type of aberration. The higher-order 
aberrations near the edges of the pupil will have less effect than will lower-order aberra­
tions, such as out-of-focus or astigmatism errors.
Specifying the performance of the optical system of a laser scanner and the appropri­
ate measure, be it point-spread or line-spread function-based spot size or MTF, can be 
a point of confusion. In terms of writing an image with independent image points, the 
point-spread function is a convenient concept. The lens point-spread function would be 
evaluated at several points along the scan, and the written spot sizes determined by the 
exposure profile defined by the point spread; that is, as the exposure level increases or 
decreases, the observable spot size determined by the irradiance level in the point-spread 
function also increases or decreases. The effect of exposure on spot size depends on the 
type of image being written—analog gray scale or digital half tone—and the response 
of the medium being written on. Often the choice of intensity level used to define the 
design spot size is 1/e 2 because it draws more attention to energy pushed into side lobes

mance. The specification of full-width half maximum (FWHM) most often relates to the 
final written product.
A real lens with aberrations will spread the energy of an imaged spot beyond the Airy 
disc. This redistribution of energy reduces the irradiance in the center of the point-spread 
function. A measure of that redistribution is the Strehl ratio, the ratio of the spot peak 
intensity relative to the diffraction limit. The Strehl ratio is a convenient measure of the 
lens image quality during the design process (along with RMS wavefront error) and it 
is useful in calibrating normalized point-spread function calculations when evaluating a 
lens over several field angles.
The problem with the above concept is that the laser beam is constantly moving as it 
writes, smearing the imaged spot along the scan line. As the spot moves, the beam irradi­
ance level is also being modulated to write the information required. This as-used writing 
process would point to the MTF as an appropriate measure of performance. However, the 
use of MTF assumes that the recording medium records irradiance level linearly over the 
complete range of exposures. This may or may not be true, depending on the recording 
medium. It is important for the lens designer to discuss these differences with the system 
designer to ensure that all parties understand the issues and trade-offs. It may be easier to 
correlate a specified spot size variation through focus and across field with the Strehl ratio 
rather than the MTF.
It usually pays to be conservative and over design by at least 10% on initial ventures into 
laser scanning system development. The time to be most critical of a new design is in the 
first prototype and in the testing of the first complete system.

where n = number of pixels, L = length of scan, d = spot diameter, DL = diameter of lens

for spot diameter will largely depend on the media sensitivity and its response to the 1/e2 
or the 50% irradiance level.
2.5.4  Depth of Focus Considerations

for a perfectly spherical wavefront is given by

This widely used criterion is based on a one-quarter wave departure from a perfect spheri­
cal wavefront. A similar criterion defined for a Gaussian beam as the optimum balance

Each of these generalized criteria (Equations 2.17 and 2.18] serve their particular purpose, 
but many system specifications state that the spot size diameter must be constant within 
10% (or even less) across the entire scan line. Additionally, manufacturers of scanning sys­
tems often impose a lower limit to the tolerable DOF. There is no simple formula to relate 
DOF to this requirement, but spot size or MTF calculations made for several focal plane 
positions can provide the pertinent data. Figure 2.8 shows the MTF curves of an F/5 parab­
ola under the following conditions:
	
1.	The perfect image with uniform 632.8 nm wavelength irradiance across the entire 
design aperture (W = 1000).
	
2.	The perfect image with W = 0.85.
	
3.	The same image as A, but with a focal shift of 0.063 mm. This corresponds to a 
wavefront error of half of a wave at the maximum design aperture.
	
4.	The same image and truncation as B, but with a focal shift of 0.063 mm.

The truncation value of W = 0.85 was used for this example instead of 1.0 in order to 
help reduce the influence of aberrated rays near the edge of the design aperture. These 
curves show that the DOF is slightly improved by truncating at this value. They also show 
that one half-wave of spherical aberration does not have as serious an effect on the DOF 
as does an equivalent amount of focus error. Therefore it is most important to reduce the 
Petzval curvature and astigmatism in a scan lens, because these aberrations cause focal 
shift errors.
2.5.5  The F–Θ Condition
In order to maintain uniform exposure on the material being scanned, the constant power 
image spot must move at a constant velocity. As the scanner rotates through an angle θ/2, 
the reflected beam is deflected through an angle θ, where the angle θ is measured from 
the optical axis of the scan lens. Because polygon scanners rotate at a constant velocity, 
the reflected beam will rotate at a constant angular velocity. The scanning spot will move 
along the scan line at a constant velocity if the displacement of the spot is linearly propor­
tional to the angle θ. The displacement H of the spot from the optical axis should follow 
the equation
	
H

=
q 	
(2.20)
where the constant F is the approximate focal length of the scan lens. Figure 2.9 is the dis­
tortion in an F–θ lens relative to that of a normal lens corrected for linear distortion (F-tan θ) 
plotted over scan angle. The curve’s departure from the straight line represents the dis­
tortion required of an F–θ lens for a constant scan velocity. As the field angle increases, 
a classical distortion-free lens image points too far out on the scan line, causing the spot 
to move too fast near the end of the scan line. Fortunately, typical scan lenses begin with 
negative (barrel) third-order distortion—the image height curve laying below the F–tan θ 
curve. The distortion can be designed to match the F–θ image height at the edge of the field

or balanced over the image. For a given distortion profile, the plus and minus departures 
from the ideal F–θ height over the scanned image can be balanced for minimum plus and 
minus departures by scaling the value of F used in defining the data rate. Scaling the data 
rate effectively scales the pixel spatial frequency written at the image plane. The focal 
length that minimizes the departures from linearity is called the calibrated focal length.
When the field angle is as large as π/6 radians (30°), the residual departures from linear­
ity may still be too large for many applications. Balancing negative third-order distortion 
against positive fifth-order distortion can further reduce the departures. Lens designers 
will recognize this technique as similar to the method of reducing zonal spherical aberra­
tion by using strongly collective and dispersive surfaces, properly spaced. In this case the 
zonal spherical aberration of the chief ray must be reduced. Figure 2.10 shows an example 
of this correction.
This high-order correction should not be carried too far, since the velocity of the spot 
begins to change rapidly near the end of the scan and may result in unacceptable changes 
in exposure or pixel placement. It may also begin to distort the spot profile, turning a cir­
cular spot into an elliptical one. This local distortion results in a change in the resolution or 
spatial frequencies near the end of the scan line. A standard observer can resolve frequen­
cies of 10 line pairs/mm (254 lines/in), but is even more sensitive to variations of frequency 
in a repetitive pattern. Variations of frequency as small as 10% may be detected by critical 
viewing. The linearity specification is often expressed as a percent error (the spot position 
error divided by the required image height). For example, the specification often reads that 
the F–θ error must be less than 0.1%. This means that the deviations must be smaller and 
smaller near the center of the scan line. It is not reasonable to specify such a small error for 
points near the center of the scan. The proper specification should state rate of change of 
the scan velocity and the allowable deviation from the ideal of Figure 2.9. More detail on 
this subject may be found in Reference 4.

any aberration correction is attempted. Most of the optical systems to be discussed in this 
section will first be described as groups of thin lenses. The convention used for thin lenses 
is described in most elementary books on optics.6, 7
The graphical method shown in Figure 2.11 is useful for a discussion of determining 
individual and total system focal lengths. The diagram shows an axial ray that is parallel to 
the optical axis. This represents a collimated beam entering the lens. The negative lens “a” 
refracts the axial beam upward to the positive lens “b.” The positive lens “b” then refracts 
the ray to the axis at the focal plane at F2ab, which is the writing plane for the laser beam.
The second focal point of the negative lens is at F2a. This point is located by extending 
the refracted axial ray backward from the negative lens until it meets the optical axis. The 
second focal point of the positive lens (F2b) may be determined by drawing a construction 
line through the center of the positive lens parallel to the axial ray as it passes between the 
positive and negative lenses. Because the two lines are parallel, they must come to focus in 
the focal plane of the positive lens. The focal lengths of the two lenses are now determined. 
The front and back focal lengths of each lens are equal because the lenses are in air. The 
focal points F1a, F2a and F1b, F2b are now located. The diagram also shows the construction 
for finding the second principal point P2. The distance P2 to F2ab is the focal length F of the 
negative–positive lens combination.
The chief ray is next traced through the two-element system. This is done using the con­
cept that two rays that are parallel on one side of a lens must diverge or converge to the 
second focal plane of the lens. The chief ray enters the lens system after it passes through 
the entrance pupil (or aperture stop) of the system. For scan lenses, the entrance pupil is 
usually located at the scanning element. Note that the entrance pupil is located in front of 
the lens, which is in contrast to a photographic lens where the entrance pupil is usually 
virtual (located on the image side of the front lens) and the aperture stop is usually located 
between the lens elements. This is the primary reason why a photographic lens should not 
be used as a scan lens. It is also one of the reasons why scan lenses are limited in the field 
angles they can cover.
The completed diagram labels the lens focal lengths. The system focal length is 80.79, 
Fa = −55.42, and Fb = 48.63. The Petzval curvature is given by the sum of the power of each 
lens element divided by its index of refraction as

Handbook of Optical and Laser Scanning
The Petzval radius (1/P) is 3.3 times the focal length and it is curved towards the lens. 
This is not flat enough for an F/20 system when the lens has to cover a long scan line. 
Equation 2.22 described in Section 2.6.4 provides a formula for estimating the required 
Petzval radius for a given system. When the Petzval radius is too short, the field has to 
be flattened by introducing positive astigmatism, which will cause an elliptically shaped 
writing spot. The Petzval radius is a fundamental consideration in laser scan lenses and 
becomes a major factor that must be reckoned with in systems requiring small spot sizes. 
Small spots require a large NA or a small F/#. Observations to be made from this layout 
include:
	
1.	The distance from the entrance pupil to the lens is 23.24% or 29% of the focal 
length of the scan lens.
	
2.	If the entrance pupil is moved out toward F1ab, the chief ray will emerge parallel 
to the optical axis and the system will be telecentric. This condition has several 
advantages, but lens “b” must be larger than the scan length and the large amount 
of refraction in lens “b” will introduce negative distortion, making it difficult to 
also meet the F–θ condition.
	
3.	Reducing the power of the negative lens or decreasing the spacing between the 
lenses will allow for a longer distance between the lens and the entrance pupil, but 
this will introduce more inward-curving Petzval curvature.
This brief discussion illustrates some of the considerations involved in establishing an 
initial layout of lenses for a scanner. One must decide, on the basis of the required spot 
diameter and the length of scan, what the Petzval radius has to be in order to achieve a 
uniform spot size across the scan length. When field flattening is required, it is neces­
sary to introduce more negative power in the system. The most effective way to do this is 
to insert a negative lens at the first, second, or both focal points of a positive-focal-length 
scan lens. In these positions they do not detract from the focal length of the positive lens, 
so the Petzval curvature can be made to be near zero when the negative lens has approx­
imately the same power as the positive lens. The negative lens at the second focal point, 
however, must have a diameter equal to the scan length, and it will introduce positive 
distortion if it is displaced from the focal plane. This distortion will make it difficult 
to meet the F–θ condition. A negative lens located at the first focal point of the lens is 
impractical, since there would be no distance between the lens and the position of the 
scanning element.
The next best thing to do is to place a single negative lens between the positive lens 
and the image plane. When the negative lens and the positive lens have equal but oppo­
site focal lengths and the spaces between the lenses are half the focal length of the 
original single lens, then the focal lengths of two lenses are +0.707F and −0.707F. The 
system with the positive lens in front is a telephoto lens, and the one with a negative 
lens in front is an inverted telephoto. The telephoto lens has a long working distance 
from the first focal point to the lens, while the inverted telephoto has a long distance 
from the rear lens to the image plane. The question now is, “Which is the better form to 
use for a scan lens?”
It is well known that a telephoto lens has positive distortion, while the inverted tele­
photo lens has negative distortion. Scan lenses that have to be designed to follow the F–θ 
condition must have negative distortion. This suggests that the preferred solution is with 
the negative lens first, even though it makes a much longer system from the last lens to 

Optical Systems for Laser Scanners

the focal plane and the entrance pupil distance is considerably shorter. Most of the scan 
lenses in use are a derivative of this form of inverted telephoto lens, employing a negative 
element on the scanner side of the lens.
Often the clearance required for the scanning element causes aberration correction prob­
lems. A telecentric design provides more clearance. Strict telecentricity may introduce too 
much negative distortion because the positive lens has to bend the chief ray through a 
large angle. When there is a tight tolerance on the F–θ condition it is better to move the 
scanner (aperture stop) closer to the first lens. Experience has shown that it is difficult to 
achieve an overall length of the system (from the scan element to the image plane) of less 
than 1.6 times the lens focal length. The characteristics of several scan lenses are described 
in Reference 4; few have a smaller ratio. In cases where the distance from scanning ele­
ment to the first lens surface has to be longer than the focal length, it is advantageous to 
use the telephoto configuration. However, it will be difficult to make the lens meet the F–θ 
condition. Systems like this have been used for galvanometer scanning. It is particularly 
useful for XY scanning systems where more space is needed between the aperture stop 
and the lens.
The lenses used in the above example are extreme lenses to illustrate the two cases. In 
most designs the Petzval radius is not set to infinity. A Petzval radius of 10 to 50 times 
the focal length is usually all that is needed. The two lenses are also usually made of dif­
ferent glass types in order to follow the Petzval rule: to increase the Petzval radius, the 
negative lenses should work at low aperture and have a low index of refraction and the 
positive lenses should work at high aperture and have a high index of refraction. It has 
been pointed out8 that if the incoming beam is slightly diverging, instead of collimated, 
it increases the radius of the Petzval surface. The diverging beam in effect adds positive 
field curvature. The idea has occasionally been used in systems, but the focus of the col­
limator lens has to be set at the correct divergence—not as convenient to set as strictly 
collimated.
Some lenses that are required to image small spot diameters (2–4 μm) use negative lenses 
on both sides of the positive lens to correct the Petzval curvature. Examples are shown in 
Section 2.12.9.
2.6.1  Correction of First-Order Chromatic Aberrations
The correction of axial and lateral chromatic aberrations illustrated in Figure 2.12a and b, 
respectively, is usually a challenge with scan lenses because the aperture stop is remote 
from the scan lens. Some system specifications call for simultaneous scanning of two or 
more wavelengths. These lenses have to be color-corrected at multiple wavelengths for no 
change in focus or focal length—that is, designed to be achromatic. Axial (or longitudinal) 
color, a marginal ray aberration, is a variation of focus with wavelength and is directly pro­
portional to the relative aperture and is independent of field. Lateral (or transverse) color, 
a chief ray aberration, is a variation of lens magnification or scale with wavelength and is 
directly proportional to the field.
The simplest way to correct axial and lateral color is to make each element into an ach­
romatic cemented doublet. To make a positive lens achromatic it is necessary to have a 
positive and negative lens with glass of different dispersions. The positive lens should 
have low-dispersion glass and the negative lens should have high-dispersion glass. The 
negative focal length lens reduces the positive power, so the positive lens power must be 
approximately double what it would be if not achromatized.

88 
Handbook of Optical and Laser Scanning
This procedure halves the radii so the thickness must be increased in order to main­
tain the lens diameter. In scan lenses, the lens diameters are determined by the height of 
the chief ray, so the lenses are much larger in diameter than indicated by the axial beam. 
As thickness is increased to reach the diameters needed, the angles of incidence on the 
cemented surfaces increase, resulting in higher-order chromatic aberrations. When the 
angles of incidence in an achromatic doublet become too large, the doublet has to be split 
up and made into two achromatic doublets. It is safe to say that asking for simultaneous 
chromatic correction can more than double the number of lens elements.
Materials used for the lenses, mirrors, and mounting can be affected by environmental 
parameters such as temperature and pressure. For broadband systems or systems where 
wavelength can vary over time and/or temperature, the chromatic variation in the third-
order aberrations is often the most challenging aberrations to correct. While achromats 
corrected for primary color use glasses with dissimilar chromatic dispersion, achromats 
also corrected for secondary color in addition use glasses with similar partial dispersion 
(i.e., glasses with similar rate of change in dispersion with wavelength). Where glasses 
with similar dispersion are impractical or not available, an additional element to form 
a triplet is used to synthesize the glass relationships needed to correct the higher-order 
chromatic aberrations.
Some specifications ask for good correction for a small band of wavelengths where small 
differences due to color can be corrected by refocus or by moving the elements. These 
systems do not need full color correction, and they can be designed to meet other more 
demanding requirements. The highest performance scan lenses are usually used with 
strictly monochromatic laser beams.
2.6.2  Properties of Third-Order Aberrations
The ultimate performance of any unconstrained optical design is almost always limited 
by a specific aberration that is an intrinsic characteristic of the design form. Familiarity 
with the aberrations and lens forms is still an important ingredient in a successful design 
optimization. Understanding of the aberrations helps designers to recognize lenses that 
are incapable of further optimization, and gives guidance in what direction to push a lens

that has strayed from the optimal configuration. Table 2.2 summarizes the dependence of 
third- and selected fifth-order aberrations on aperture (F/#) and field (𝜃).
An understanding of the source of aberrations and their elimination comes from third-
order theory. A detailed description of the theory is beyond the scope of this chapter, but 
can be found in References 6, 9–11. The following discussion will touch on these aberra­
tions with the intent to provide a familiarity and some rules of thumb as guidelines for the 
design of scan lenses.
Third-order theory describes the lowest-order monochromatic aberrations in an 
optical system. Any real system will usually have some balance of third-order and 
higher-order aberrations, but the basic third-order surface-by-surface contributions are 
important to understand. These aberrations are illustrated in Figure 2.13 and briefly 
described below.
2.6.2.1  Spherical Aberration
This aberration is a result of a lens with different focal lengths for different zones of the 
aperture, a consequence of greater deviations of the sine of the angle and paraxial angle. 
It is an aperture-dependent aberration (varying with the cube of the aperture diameter) 
that causes a rotationally symmetrical blurred image of a point object on the optical axis. 
In rotationally symmetric optical systems it is the only aberration that occurs on the opti­
cal axis, but, if present, it will also appear at every object point in the field—in addition to 
other field aberrations.
2.6.2.2  Coma
This aberration is the first asymmetrical aberration that appears for points close to the 
optical axis. It is a result of different magnifications for different zones of the aperture. 
Coma gets its name from the shape of the image of a point source—the image blur is in the 
form of a comet. The coma aberration blur varies linearly with the field angle and with the 
square of the aperture diameter.
2.6.2.3  Astigmatism
When this aberration is present, the meridional fan of rays (the rays shown in a cross-
sectional view of the lens) focuses at the tangential focus as a line perpendicular to

the meridional plane. The sagittal rays (rays in a plane perpendicular to the meridi­
onal plane) come to a different line focus perpendicular to the tangential line image. 
This focus position is called the sagittal focus. Midway between the two focal positions, 
the image is a circular blur with a diameter proportional to the NA of the lens and 
the distance between the focal lines. The third-order theory shows that the tangential 
focus position is three times as far from the Petzval surface as the sagittal focus. This 
is what makes the Petzval field curvature so important. If there is Petzval curvature, 
the image plane cannot be flat without some astigmatism. The astigmatism and the 
Petzval field sags both increase proportional to the square of the field. They increase 
faster than coma and become the most troublesome aberrations as the field (length of 
scan) is increased.
2.6.2.4  Distortion
Distortion is a measure of the displacement of the real chief ray from its correspond­
ing paraxial reference point (image height Y = F * tan 𝜃) and is independent of f-number. 
Distortion does not result in a blurred image and does not cause a reduction in any

measure of image quality (such as MTF). In an aberration-free design, the center of the 
energy concentration is on the chief ray. The third-order displacement of the chief ray from 
the paraxial image height varies with the cube of the image height. The percent distortion 
varies as the square of the image height.
Earlier it was noted that the distortion has to be negative in order to meet the F–𝜃 con­
dition. Third-order distortion refers to the displacement of the chief ray. If the image has 
any order of coma, it is not rotationally symmetric. The position of the chief ray may not 
represent the best concentration of energy in the image; there may be a displacement. Here 
the specification for linearity of scan becomes difficult. If there is a lack of symmetry in 
the image, then how does one define the error? If MTF is used as a criterion, this error is a 
phase shift in the tangential MTF. If an encircled energy criterion is used, then what level 
of energy should be used? When a design curve of the departure from the F–θ condition 
is provided, it usually refers to the distortion of the chief ray. The designer must therefore 
attempt to reduce the coma to a level that is consistent with the specification of the F–θ 
condition, or use an appropriate centroid criterion.
2.6.3  Third-Order Rules of Thumb
Collective surfaces7 almost always introduce negative spherical aberration. A collective sur­
face bends a ray above the optical axis in a clockwise direction as shown in Figure 2.14. There 
is a region where a collective surface introduces positive spherical aberration. This occurs 
when the axial ray is converging to a position between the center of curvature of the surface 
and its aplanatic point. When a converging ray is directed at the aplanatic point the angles 
of the incident and refracted rays, with respect to the optical axis, satisfy the sine condition 
U/U2 = sinU/sinU2, and no spherical or coma aberrations are introduced. Unfortunately 
this condition is usually not accessible in a scan lens. Surfaces with positive spherical aber­
ration are important because they are the only sources of positive astigmatism.
Dispersive surfaces always introduce positive spherical aberration. A dispersive surface 
bends rays above the axis in a counterclockwise direction. In order to correct spherical 
aberration it is necessary to have dispersive surfaces that can cancel out the under correc­
tion from the collective surfaces.
Coma can be either positive or negative, depending on the angle of incidence of the chief 
ray. This makes it appear that the coma should be relatively easy to correct, but in the 
case of scan lenses it is difficult to correct the coma to zero. The primary reason is that the 
aperture stop of the lens is located in front of the lens. This makes it more difficult to find 
surfaces that balance the positive and negative coma contributions.

Handbook of Optical and Laser Scanning
As the field increases, astigmatism dominates the correction problem. The astigmatism 
introduced by a surface always has the same sign as the spherical aberration. When the 
lenses are all on one side of the aperture stop, this makes it difficult to control astigmatism 
and coma. A lens with a positive focal length usually has an inward-curving field so the 
astigmatism has to be positive. This is the reason that a designer must have surfaces that 
introduce positive spherical aberration. Because distortion is an aberration of the chief 
ray, surfaces that are collective to the chief ray will add negative distortion and dispersive 
surfaces will add positive distortion.
2.6.4  Importance of the Petzval Radius
Even though the Petzval curvature is a first-order aberration, it is closely related to the 
third-order because of the 3:1 relation with the tangential and sagittal astigmatism. It is not 
possible to eliminate Petzval curvature by merely setting up the lens powers so that the 
Petzval sum is zero. By doing this, the lens curves become so strong that higher-order aber­
rations are introduced, causing further correction problems. For this reason it is important 
to set up the initial design configuration with a reasonable Petzval field radius, and the 
designer should continually note the ratio of the Petzval radius to the focal length.
An estimate of the desired Petzval radius for a flatbed scan lens can be derived based 
on third-order astigmatism and DOF. Eliminating third-order astigmatism, the tangential 
and sagittal fields will coincide with the Petzval surface. The maximum departure of this 
Petzval surface from a flat image plane defined over a total scan line length L is given by

Section 2.9 describing some typical scan lenses lists this ratio in Table 2.6 as a guideline for 
each application. The ratio is only an approximation. Lenses operating at large field angles 
or small F/# values will have high-order aberrations not accounted for in the equation. 
Depending on the type of correction, the final designed ratio may be higher or lower than 
given by the above equation. Furthermore, negative lenses working at low aperture and 
positive lenses working at large aperture reduce the Petzval field curvature. The negative 
lenses should have a low index of refraction, and the positive lenses should have a high 
index of refraction, atypical for an achromatized optical system.
In most monochromatic scan lenses, the negative lens will have a lower index of 
refraction than the positive lenses. The positive lenses will usually have an index of 
refraction above 1.7, while the negative lenses will usually have values around 1.5. 
Lens design programs can vary the index of refraction during the optimization. 
Occasionally in a lens with three or more elements, the optimized design violates this 

Optical Systems for Laser Scanners 
93
rule and one of the positive lenses turns out to have a lower index of refraction than 
the others. This may mean the design has more than enough Petzval correction, so the 
index of one of the elements is reduced in order to correct other aberrations, or it may 
mean that one of the positive lenses is no longer necessary. To remove such an element 
during the optimization process, distribute its net power (by adding or subtracting 
curvature to one or both neighboring surfaces) and optimize for a few iterations using 
curvatures and a few constraints to reinitialize the design before proceeding with the 
full optimization.
2.7  SPECIAL DESIGN REQUIREMENTS
This section discusses specific optical design requirements for different types of laser 
scanners.
2.7.1  Galvanometer Scanners
Galvanometer scanners are used extensively in laser scanning. Their principal disadvan­
tage is that they are limited in writing velocity. Their many advantages from an optical 
perspective are:
•	 The scanning mirror can rotate about an axis in the plane of the mirror. The mir­
ror can then be located at the entrance pupil of the lens system and its position 
does not move as the mirror rotates.
•	 The F–𝜃 condition is often not required, for the shaft angular velocity of the mirror 
can be controlled electronically to provide uniform spot velocity.
•	 The galvanometer systems are suitable for X and Y scanning.
Galvanometer scanners provide the easiest way to design an XY scanning system. The 
two mirrors, however, have to be separated from each other, and this means the opti­
cal system has to work with two separated entrance pupils, with considerable distance 
between them. This in effect requires that the lens system be aberration corrected for a 
much larger aperture than the laser beam diameter. A system demanding both a large 
aperture and large field angle will have different degrees of distortion correction for the 
two directions of scan. In principle the distortions can be corrected electronically, but this 
adds considerable complexity to the equipment.
An alternate approach is to use a telescope (afocal) relay system with one scanner placed 
at the entrance pupil and the other placed at the exit pupil of the telescope relay. The tele­
scope adds complexity and field curvature to the design, but also an intermediate image 
that can be useful in dealing with the field curvature. Systems requiring high resolution 
(a large number of image points over a given length) should avoid extra relay lenses that 
add Petzval field curvature, the aberration that often limits optical performance in scan­
ning systems.
For precision scanning, any wobble the galvanometer mirror may have can be corrected 
with cylindrical optics, as described in the next section on polygon scanning.

2.7.2  Polygon Scanning
Some precision scanning system require extreme uniformity of scanning velocity, some­
times as low as 0.1%, with the addressability of a few microns. These requirements of 
high-speed scanning velocities force systems into high-speed rotating elements that scan 
at high-uniform velocity. Polygon and holographic scanners are most commonly used in 
these applications.
Special design requirements that must be considered in the design of lens systems for poly­
gons that affect optical quality are scan line bow, beam displacement, and cross-scan errors.
2.7.2.1  Bow
The incoming and exiting beams must be located in a single plane that is perpendicular 
to the polygon rotation axis. Error in achieving this condition will displace the spot in the 
cross-scan direction by an amount that varies with the field angle. This results in a curved 
scan line, which is said to have bow. The spot displacement as a function of field angle is 
given by the equation

(2.23)
where F is the focal length of the lens, θ is the field angle, and α is the angle between the 
incoming beam and the plane that is perpendicular to the rotation axis.
The optical axis of the focusing lens should be coincident with the center of the input 
laser beam, hereafter referred to as the feed beam. Any error will introduce bow. The bow 
introduced by the input beam not being in the plane perpendicular to the rotation can be 
compensated for, to some extent, by tilting the lens axis. Some system designers have sug­
gested using an array of laser diodes to simultaneously print multiple rasters. Only one of 
the diodes can be exactly on the central axis, so all other diode beams will enter and exit 
the scanner out of the plane normal to the rotation axis, so bow will be introduced. The 
amount will increase for diodes farther away from the central beam. There is no simple 
remedy to this problem.
2.7.2.2  Beam Displacement
A second peculiarity of the polygon is that the facet rotation occurs around the polygon 
center rather than the facet face. This causes a facet displacement and a displacement of 
the collimated beam as the polygon rotates, as illustrated in Figure 2.15. This displacement 
of the incoming beam means that the lens must be well corrected over a larger aperture 
than the laser beam diameter. A comprehensive treatment of the center-of-scan locus for a 
rotating prismatic polygonal scanner is given in Reference 13.
2.7.2.3  Cross-Scan Errors
Polygons usually have pyramidal errors in the facets as well as some axis wobble. These 
errors cause cross-scan errors in the scan line. These errors must be corrected to a fraction 
of a line width, typically on the order of a one-fourth to a one-tenth of a line width. When 
designing a 2400 DPI (dots per inch) high-resolution system, the tolerable error can be less 
than 1 μm. A system with no cross-scan error correction using a 700-mm focal length lens 
would require pyramid errors no greater than 1.4 μ radians.

Optical Systems for Laser Scanners 
95
Correction methods for cross-scan errors due to polygon pyramidal errors can include 
deviation of the feed beam, the use of cylindrical and anamorphic lenses to focus on the 
polygon, an anamorphic collimated beam at the polygon, or use of a retro-reflecting prism 
to autocorrect.
Deviating the feed beam to anticipate the cross-scan errors at the polygon that are pre­
dictable and measurable can be accomplished by tilting a mirror, moving lens, or steering 
with an acousto-optic deflector (AOD). This method cannot correct for the random errors 
caused by polygon bearing wobble and is therefore limited in its application.
The diagram in Figure 2.16 shows how the use of cylindrical lenses can reduce the effects 
of wobble in the facet of a polygon. The top figure illustrates the in-scan plane, showing 
the length of the scan line. The lower section shows the cross-scan plane, where the laser 
beam is focused on the facet of the mirror by a cylindrical lens in the collimated beam. It 
then diverges as it enters the focusing lens. The scan lens with rotational symmetry can­
not focus the cross-scan beam to the image plane without the addition of a cylindrical 
lens. The focal length and position of the cylindrical lens depend on the distance from the 
polygon facet to the all-spherical scan lens and the NA of the cylindrical lens that focuses 
a line image on the facet.
In order to form a round image in the scan plane, the beam in the cross-scan plane must 
focus with the same NA as in the in-scan plane. The ratio of the cross-scan NA at the

facet to the cross-scan NA at the scanned image defines the cross-scan magnification of 
the lens. The selection of cylinder powers before the scan, between the scanner and scan 
lens, and/or between the scan lens and image plane will affect the sensitivity to wobble 
errors at the edges of the depth of field. Generally a cross-scan magnification of near 1:1 
optimizes the correction in the presence of this polygon facet displacement from the line 
focus.
When the facet rotates to direct the light to the edge of the scan, the distance to the spher­
ical lens increases. In the cross-scan plane the optical system is focusing the beam from 
a finite object distance. When the facet rotates to direct the light to the edge of the scan, 
the object distance increases so there is a conjugate change. As the scan spot moves from 
the center of scan, the object distance in the cross-scan plane also increases. The image 
conjugate distance is therefore shortened. The consequence of this is that astigmatism is 
introduced in the final image with the sagittal focal surface made inward curving. To com­
pensate for this, the all-spherical focusing lens must be able to introduce enough positive 
astigmatism to eliminate the total astigmatism.
It has been shown5 that placing a toroidal lens between the facet and the all-spherical 
lens may reduce this induced astigmatism. The toroidal surface in-scan radius of curva­
ture should be located near the facet. In the cross-scan plane the curve should be adjusted 
to collimate the light. However, this solution bears with it the cost of special tooling, and 
imposes severe procurement, testing, and alignment challenges.
An anamorphic collimated beam at the polygon combined with a scan lens having a 
short cross-scan focal length and long in-scan focal length, as illustrated in Figure 2.17, 
can be used to reduce the effects of facet wobble. The reduction in sensitivity relative to 
no correction is simply the ratio of cross-scan to in-scan focal lengths, accomplished by 
adding cross-scan cylindrical lenses to modify the all-spherical in-scan lens to an inverse

telephoto cross-scan configuration. The feed beam is likewise compressed in the cross-
scan plane to provide the necessary round beam converging on the image plane. The dia­
grams show the two focal lengths of the scan lens as Fyz and Fxz. In its simplest terms, the 
feed beam is compressed with an inverted cylinder beam expander and a comparable 
cylinder beam expander is placed before, distributed across, or after the scan lens. This 
system does introduce some conjugate shift astigmatism, but it eliminates the bow error, 
because collimated light is incident on the facet.
Placing the negative cylinder close to the all-spherical focusing lens and placing the pos­
itive cylinder as close to the image plane as is practical reduce the cylindrical lens powers. 
The position of the positive cylindrical lens, however, must consider such things as bub­
bles or defects on the surfaces of the lens. The beam size is extremely small when the lens 
is placed close to the focal plane and the entire beam can be blocked with a dust particle.
Systems using a retro-reflective prism (with 90° roof edge) that reflects the scanning 
beam back onto the facet face before it passes to the scan lens have been built to correct 
for facet wobble. The optical error introduced by the pyramidal or wobble error in the 
polygon is canceled on the second pass. Unfortunately the facet face has to be more than 
twice the aperture required to reflect the beam in a single reflection system to keep the 
retro-reflective beam on the facet. Consequently this configuration has low scan efficiency 
and limited uses.
2.7.2.4  Summary
Axis wobble and pyramidal error cause serious problems by introducing cross-scan 
errors. There are ways to reduce the cross-scan errors, but many other challenges are intro­
duced. The use of cylinders results in procurement and alignment issues. The conjugate 
shift is difficult to visualize because the entire line image on the facet is not in focus and 
the analysis can be complex. The only way to determine accurately the combination of all 
the effects—pyramidal error in the facets, translation of the facet during its rotation, bow

tie effect, and the conjugate shift—is to raytrace the system and simulate the precise loca­
tions of the facet as it turns through the scanning positions. This can be done using the 
multiconfiguration modes available in most optical design programs. The multiconfiguration 
technique of design is discussed in more detail in the following sections.
2.7.3  Polygon Scan Efficiency
Figure 2.18 shows one facet of a polygon with feed beam for scanning. The parameters and 
relationships that determine the limits of scan efficiency and minimum size for a polygon 
scanner (assuming no facet tracking) are D = beam diameter, β = nominal feed beam offset 
angle at center of scan, ε = facet edge roll zone, α = 2π/(nο. of facets N) = angular extent of 
facet, and δ ~ [D/cos(®) + ∑]/r = angular extent of beam plus roll zone, where the scan effi­
ciency limit for a given polygon is

A sample polygon and scan lens design might have the following specifications: 2000 
DPI with a 12.7 μm 1/e2 spot diameter; a wavelength of 0.6328 μm; a scan length L of 18 in 
(457.2 mm); an eight-sided polygon with a facet angle α of 0.7854 radians, a scan efficiency 
ηs of 60%, and a feed beam angle β of 30°.
The derived system parameters are: F/# of the lens for this spot diameter is F/11 (given 
by Equation 2.14); scan lens focal length F is 485.1 mm [given by L/(2α*ηs)]; and beam 
diameter D is 44.1 mm. The required circumscribed radius of the polygon is greater than 
162 mm, with a facet face width of 2.8 times the diameter of the incoming beam.
To achieve a certain resolution (scan a given number of image points on a single scan 
line), there is a trade-off between the scan angle θ and the diameter of the feed beam 
(Equation 2.16). To achieve compactness with a smaller polygon, a smaller feed beam 
would be required along with a greater scan angle. The search for system compactness 
drives the field angle to larger and larger values. Scan angles above 20° increase the diffi­
culty in correcting the F/#. The conflict can be somewhat resolved by using a smaller angle 
of incidence ®, but then there may be interference between the incident beam and the lens 
mount. A compromise between these variables requires close cooperation between the 
optical and mechanical engineering effort.
Figure 2.19 illustrates the relationship between the number of polygon facets, polygon 
diameter, and scan efficiency. The previous example is illustrated in the eight facet plots. 
Polygons typically work at around 50% scan efficiency because of the feed beam diameter 
required by the resolution coupled with the rotating polygon scanners size limitations and 
cost considerations. A comprehensive treatment of the relationship between the incident 
beam, the scan axis, and the rotation axis of a prismatic polygonal scanner is given in 
Reference 14.
Note: Care should be taken in the specification of the scan angle. Without a clear defini­
tion it can be interpreted as the mechanical scan angle, the optical scan angle, or even the 
optical half scan angle.
2.7.4  Internal Drum Systems
As stated before, internal drum scanning systems are least demanding on the optical sys­
tem, because the lenses do not have to cover a wide field. Most of the burden is shifted

to the accurate mechanical alignment of the turning mirror. The concept of the internal 
drum scanner can be applied to a flatbed scanner by using a flat-field lens. The system then 
becomes the equivalent of a pyramidal scanner with only one facet. All of these systems 
have common alignment requirements.
The nominal position of the turning mirror is usually set at 45° (0.785 radians) with 
respect to the axis of rotation. It does not have to be exactly 45° as long as the collimated 
feed optical beam enters parallel to the axis of the rotation. The latter condition is needed 
to eliminate bow in the scan line. In a perfectly aligned system the ray that passes through 
the nodal points of the lens must meet the deflecting mirror on the axis of rotation. When 
the lens is placed in front of the turning mirror, the second nodal point of the lens must be 
on the rotation axis of the mirror. When the lens is placed after the turning mirror, its first 
nodal point must be on the ray that intersects the mirror on the rotation axis. There is some 
advantage in placing the lens between the mirror and the recording plane. In this position 
the lens has a shorter focal length, and the bow resulting from any error in the nodal point 
placement of the lens is reduced.
2.7.5  Holographic Scanning Systems
From an optical designer’s perspective, holographic scanning systems have an advantage, 
as the need for wobble correction can be reduced significantly without resorting to cylin­
drical components. Conversely, they usually require some bow correction, and if used with 
laser diodes (which exhibit wavelength shifts), they require significant color correction. 
Line bow correction can be achieved by using a prism (or grating) component after the 
holographic scanning element and/or adding complex holograms, reflective and refractive 
optical components to the lens system. The prism component introduces bow to balance 
out the bow in the same way that a spectrographic prism adds curvature to the spectral 
lines. The lens can be tilted and decentered as an alternative method for reducing the bow. 
Holographic scanning systems are discussed in greater detail in Section 2.11.
2.8  LENS DESIGN MODELS
Regardless of the ultimate complexity of a scanning system, a simple model is often the best 
starting point for the design of a scan lens, and sometimes all that is needed. The excep­
tion is when adapting or tweaking a previous complex design model for minor changes 
in wavelength, scan length, or resolution. In a simple model, the actual method by which 
the beam deflection is introduced is not included in the lens design; the beam deflection 
method is assumed to introduce only angular motion; and it neglects any beam displace­
ment that may occur due to the deflection method. The lens is modeled and optimized to 
perform at several field angles, in much the same way a standard photographic objective is 
optimized. The main differences are in the external placement of the aperture stop where 
the chief ray for each field passes through its center as if scanning and the optimization 
with distortion constraints for F–θ linearity. A detailed example demonstrating the simple 
model is developed in Section 2.8.1 with additional examples provided in Sections 2.9.1 
through 2.9.7.

Optical Systems for Laser Scanners 
101
In practice, the reason that all parallel bundles in Figure 2.20a appear to pivot about 
the center of this external aperture stop surface is that a fixed beam is incident on a beam 
deflector rotating in proximity to the stop. If the mechanical rotation axis of this deflector 
intersects the plane of the mirror facet and the optical axis of the scan lens, then the simple 
model is accurate. This is the case for galvanometer-based systems, where the mechanical 
rotation axis is close enough to the plane of the mirror facet that the deviation from the 
simple model is negligible.
At some point in the design process it must be decided how rigorously the geometry of 
the moving deflector needs to be modeled. At the very least, the design should be analyzed 
for the actual angular motion with the rotation of the pupil and the displacement of the 
beam to determine as-built performance of a design and validate the effectiveness of the 
simple model. This can sometimes be accomplished without modeling the actual scanner, 
as described below.
Multifaceted holographic deflectors do not suffer from beam displacement, even though 
their mechanical rotation axis is some distance from the active region of the facets. Where 
dispersion from the hologon is not an issue, a simple model can suffice for the design of a 
lens for a hologon-based scan system, although complex truncation and multifacet illumi­
nation effects are ignored.
2.8.1  Anatomy of a Simple Scan Lens Design
The following is a description of a scan lens design, which begins with the design specifi­
cations outlined in Table 2.3 and describes the evolution of a design to meet these specifi­
cations.15 The first five numbered specifications (scan line length, wavelength, resolution, 
image quality, and scan linearity) are the very minimum required to begin the optical 
design. The laser source for this exercise is a diode operating near-Gaussian TEM00 with 
a wavelength that can drift with temperature and power, and emit over a bandwidth of 
25 nm. Parameters listed with no numbers are provided as reference or potential addi­
tional specifications.
Beginning with the resolution requirement of 300 DPI based on 1/e2 and a nominal 
wavelength of 780 nm, the ideal Gaussian waist size (pixel size) is

Experience has shown that the focal length arrived at in this first pass would likely result 
in a system that is too long (when considering scanner to lens clearance, the thickness 
of real lenses, and the image distance). To shorten the length of the optical system the

The simple two-lens configuration shown in Figure 2.20a comprises a concave-plano flint 
(Schott® F2) element and plano-convex crown (Schott SKI6) element (both by Schott Glass 
Technologies Inc., Duryea, PA) with powers appropriate for axial color correction selected 
as a starting point. Scaled for focal length and focused, the composite RMS wavefront 
error (weighted average over the field) is 0.038 waves. While at first glance this wavefront 
error appears to meet the requirements, further examination of the ray aberration and field 
performance plots illustrated in Figures 2.20(b) and (c) indicates substantial astigmatism 
limiting performance at the edge of the field and distortion that is far from F–θ.
The horizontal plot axis in Figure 2.20b is relative aperture and the vertical plot axis is 
the transverse ray error at the image plane. The slope of the shallow curve is a measure of 
focus shift and a change in slope over the relative field and between the sagittal and tan­

plots clearly show astigmatism (indicated by the slope difference between sagittal and tan­
gential curves at 15 and 20° field angles) and lateral color (indicated by the displacement of

the tangential curves, a change in image height, for the extreme wavelengths at the 15 and 
20° field angles).
The field performance plots in Figure 2.20c also indicate a very small amount of axial 
color and spherical aberration (displaced longitudinal curves for each wavelength of the 
left plot), substantial astigmatism (indicated by the departure of the sagittal field curve 
from the nearly flat tangential curve of the center plot), and the distortion that is closer to 
F–tan Θ than F–Θ (seen in the distortion curve on the right).
Optimizing this starting design with surface curvatures as variables for best spot perfor­
mance while maintaining scan length with a constraint (but no distortion controls) yields 
the biconvex biconcave configuration illustrated in Figure 2.21. The RMS wavefront error 
improved after the first round of computer optimization iterations by a less than desirable 
balance of the astigmatism with higher-order aberrations (center field plots). The air inter­
face between elements was deleted, leaving the three surfaces of a doublet for a second 
round of optimization (to test the design for a simpler solution), resulting in performance 
slightly better than the starting design for RMS wavefront error and astigmatism.
Adding glass variables such as index of refraction and dispersion and adding F–θ con­
straints, weighted rather than absolute for a more stable convergence, results in no significant 
change in performance, as illustrated in Figure 2.22. Splitting the power of the positive crown 
element between the doublet and an additional plano-convex lens provides more design 
variables for the next round of optimization iterations. The result is much better correction 
of both the astigmatism and F–θ distortion with an RMS wavefront error of 0.005 waves, but 
at the sacrifice of some axial color correction (a shift in focus with wavelength). This trade-off 
is acceptable if most of the wavelength variation is from diode to diode, where focus can be 
used to accommodate the different laser wavelengths, and the wavelength variations from 
changes in junction temperature due to power and ambient temperature are controlled to 
a few degrees. Selecting real glasses for the final design iterations results in the design and 
performance as illustrated in Figure 2.23, with no noticeable change in performance.

aperture, illustrated in Figure 2.24. The performance after these first iterations deterio­
rated to a wavefront error of 0.037 waves RMS, predominantly from spherical aberration 
(the tangential S-shaped curve) with a bit of coma at the edge of the field (indicated by the 
asymmetry in the full field tangential curve).
The performance target is raised yet again with an increase in the scan angle specifica­
tion to ±30° from ±20°. The design for this exercise starts with the previous lens, scaled by 
the ratio of scan angles (20/30) from pupil to image including the design diameter. The 
performance after several more iterations and the selection of real glass types, illustrated 
in Figure 2.25, is improved to a 0.028 RMS wavefront error, by improving spherical aberra­
tion, axial color and astigmatism (with the help of the 2/3 scaling of the design aperture), 
and more linear distortion resulting in better F–θ correction. The final design prescription 
for the scan lens example is listed in Table 2.4 with performance specifications listed in 
Table 2.5. The calibrated F–θ scan distortion is plotted in Figure 2.26. It shows a linear­
ity better than 0.1% over scan and better than 1% locally. The selection of LAFN23 in this 
latest design is not ideal for its availability or glass properties. Later iterations to finalize 
this preliminary design should explore glass types that optimize the availability, cost, and 
transmission along with image quality performance.
2.8.2  Multiconfiguration Using Tilted Surfaces
There is often no substitute for the introduction of a mirror surface in the lens design 
model to simulate the scan, where the mirror surface is tilted from one configuration (or 
“zoom position”) to another to generate the angular scanning of the beam prior to the scan 
lens. Modeled in this way, there is no object field angle in the usual sense. The beam prior 
to the rotating mirror is stationary. When a beam of circular cross section reflects off the 
plane mirror, the reflected beam will have the same cross section.
That is not the case in a simple model involving object field angles and a fixed exter­
nal circular stop, where bundles from off-axis field angles will be foreshortened in the

scan direction to an ellipse by the cosine of the field angle. As the field angle approaches 
30° this effect becomes increasingly significant. At some stage in the design process the 
software can be tricked into enlarging the bundle in the scan direction to compensate 
for this foreshortening, but not all analyses may run using this work around. In par­
ticular, diffraction calculations typically rely on tracing a grid of rays that are limited 
by defined apertures in the optical system, which would defeat the intended effect of 
simple tricks.
A constant beam cross section at all scan angles can also be maintained by simply bend­
ing the optical axis at the entrance pupil in a multiconfiguration. This is often a good com­
promise in modeling complexity that does not require the use of reflective surfaces, but 
maintains the integrity of the scanned beam optical properties.

Holographic deflectors may not faithfully emulate a tilted mirror. In such systems the 
beam cross section does change as a function of angle, where a circular input beam results 
in an elliptical output whose orientation changes with scan angle.
2.8.3  Multiconfiguration Reflective Polygon Model
A polygon in a lens design model is simply a mirror at the end of an arm. All rotation is 
performed about the end of the arm opposite the mirror. The length of the arm defined by 
the inscribed radius of the polygon, the location of the arm’s rotation axis relative to the 
scan lens, and the amount of rotation about the pivot can all be (with care) optimized dur­
ing the design. The facet shape is defined by an appropriate clear aperture specification on 
the mirror surface.
Because the mechanical rotation axis rarely intersects the optical axis of the scan lens 
and the mirror facet is far from the rotation axis, it is best just to apply a rigorous model 
that automatically accounts for the complicated mirror surface tilts, displacements, and 
aperture effects of the polygon scan complex geometry.

Specific pupil shifts and aperture effects could be computed and specified for each con­
figuration, but this does not exploit the full potential of a multiconfiguration optical design 
program. When the model is defined in a general fashion, the actual constructional param­
eters of the polygon or parameters governing its interface with the feed beam and scan 
lens may be optimized simultaneously as the scan lens is being designed, particularly in 
the final stages of design. This often leads to better system solutions than simply combin­
ing devices in some preconceived way.
If the location of the entrance pupil is defined as where the chief ray intersects the opti­
cal axis of the scan lens, then the axial position of the pupil shifts with polygon rotation 
angle (and scan angle). This axial pupil shift requires the lens to be well corrected over 
an aperture larger than just the feed beam diameter. The effect is greater for systems 
with polygons having fewer facets, larger optical scan angles, and/or larger feed beam 
offset angles. High-aperture (large NA) scan lenses are especially susceptible to this 
effect.
Determining where the real entrance pupil is for each configuration, or how much 
larger of a beam diameter the lens should really be designed to accommodate, is dif­
ficult. It is especially difficult if the polygon is to be designed at the same time as the 
scan lens! When this pupil shift is included in the lens design model by rigorously 
modeling the polygon geometry, the effect on lens performance can be accurately 
assessed. More importantly, the lens being designed may be desensitized to expected 
pupil shifts and, if the polygon is being designed, the pupil shifts may be minimized. 
As maximum scan angle is approached, the facet size may be insufficient to reflect the 
entire beam. Asymmetrical truncation or vignetting occurs, which can modify the 
shape of spot at the image plane. Accurate aperture modeling is especially important 
for accurate diffraction-based spot profile calculations. In a rigorous polygon model, 
by putting aperture specifications on the surface that represents the reflective facet 
surface, all vignetting by the facet as a function of polygon rotation will be automati­
cally accounted for.
By having a rigorous polygon model implemented, it is also possible to further evalu­
ate what actually happens to the section of the beam that misses the facet. Classifying the 
rays that miss the facet as vignetted is really an oversimplification. In reality these rays 
will likely reflect off the tip and adjacent facet. This stray light beam may enter the lens 
and find its way to the image surface. Stray light problems can ruin a system. Double-pass 
systems are especially susceptible to this design flaw. The multiconfiguration setup can be 
used to evaluate stray light problems and suggest baffle designs.
2.8.4  Example Single-Pass Polygon Setup
The key to exploiting the multiconfiguration design method is to include the rotation axis 
when modeling the polygon. A brief overview of such a model begins with the definition 
of the expanded laser beam, followed by a first fold mirror, the defined polygon with its 
rotation axis, and finally the scan lens.
The following CODE V* sequence file (*CODE V is a trademark of Optical Research 
Associates, Pasadena, CA) for the lens illustrated in Figure 2.27, shows one way to set up 
a polygon and lens in a commercial lens design program. Standard catalog components 
were chosen: the six-sided polygon is Lincoln Laser’s PO06-16-037, and the two-element 
sectioned scan lens is Melles Griot’s LLS-090. The combination will create 300 DPI output 
using a laser diode source.

2.8.4.2  Lens Prescription Model
Start with a collimated, expanded laser beam of the required diameter and fold its path 
with a −31.5° mirror tilt to obtain the desired feed angle of 63° with respect to the planned 
optical axis of the scan lens. The aperture stop should be defined prior to the polygon 
(preferably on surface 1). Any truncation of the Gaussian input beam should be done at 
the aperture stop. Do not flag the polygon surface as the aperture stop, because some 
software will automatically ray-aim each bundle to pass through the center of the stop 
surface.
Define a reference point that will be on the optical axis of the scan lens. It is convenient 
to have its location where the facet would intersect the axis when the polygon is rotated 
for on-axis evaluation. The surface should be tilted 63° so that any subsequent thickness 
would be along the optical axis.
Go to the polygon rotation center and tilt so that any subsequent thickness would be 
radial from the polygon center toward the facet surface. To get to the polygon center from 
the reference point, use a combination of surface axial and transverse decenters (traveling 
in right angles for simplicity). It is convenient to choose a tilt that will cause the polygon 
to be rotated into position for on-axis evaluation. Here, we must translate −16.9 mm away 
from the lens along the optical axis and then decenter up along Y with YDE = 10.4 mm. 
Tilting about X in the YZ-plane with ADE = −31.50° (63°/2) points the surface normal to 
the facet.
Before going to the polygon facet, any additional tilt about X (ADE) is specified. This is 
a multiconfiguration parameter: each configuration will have a different value specified 
for this additional tilt. Here, ADE 15.50 is specified to cause the polygon to rotate into 
position for maximum scan on the negative side. This is really the polygon shaft rotation 
angle; for nonpyramidal polygons the reflection angle (scan angle) changes at twice the 
rate of the shaft angle. Once the image surface is defined, the system will be defined to 
have seven configurations, and a different ADE value for this surface will be specified for 
each (step “H”). Translate to the facet using the polygon inscribed radius for thickness (19.8 
mm). Now reflect. This reflection occurs at the first real surface that the beam encounters 
since the fold mirror. All other surfaces have been “dummy” surfaces where no reflection 
or refraction takes place. It is on this reflective surface that aperture restrictions may be 
defined to describe the shape of the facet. Use a thickness specification on this surface to 
25.00    MM

go back to the polygon center following the reflection (−19.8 mm), to maintain the integrity 
of the first-order optical path lengths.
Some commercial software programs (such as CODE V) have a “return” surface that one 
could now use to get back to the reference point defined in step B, prior to defining the 
scan lens. Here, a more conservative approach is taken that can be used with any software 
package. Undo the additional polygon shaft rotation that was done in step D. The REV flag 
in CODE V internally negates the angle.
Continuing to move back to the reference point defined in step B, undo the polygon shaft 
tilt that sets it for on-axis evaluation (ADE = 31.5°), decenter down along Y, back to the scan 
lens axis (YDE = −10.4 mm), and translate toward the lens along its axis to the reference. 
This places the mechanical axis back to the same location that it was in step B, before the 
reflection off the polygon. Here, the REV flag changes the signs of the tilt and decenter 
specifications and performs the tilt before the decenter.
Define the scan lens. The reference surface defined in step B, and returned to in steps Ε 
and F, is approximately the location of the entrance pupil. The thickness at the image sur­
face is the focus shift from the paraxial image plane.
Having now specified a valid single-configuration system to the software, the system is 
redefined to have seven configurations (ZOOM 7) and the parameters that change from 
one configuration to another are listed. Owing to the way that the polygon was modeled, 
rotating it to a different position is simply a matter of changing the parameter that repre­
sents the shaft rotation angle. ADE is on surfaces 6 and 8.
Since these are catalog components, the clear apertures are available and are spec­
ified here. The rectangular aperture specifications for the polygon facet are given for 
surface 7.
2.8.5  Dual-Axis Scanning
When more than one galvanometer is used to generate a two-dimensional scan at the 
image plane it is usually necessary to use a multiconfiguration setup. Each galvanometer 
defines an apparent pupil and net effect of their physical separation creates a very astig­
matic pupil, where X-scan and the Y-scan do not originate at the same location on the opti­
cal axis. In modeling these scanners, the optical axis or reflective surfaces representing 
the galvanometer mirrors may be tilted. The latter approach is usually worth the effort in 
order to visualize the problem and avoid mechanical interferences.
2.9  SELECTED LASER SCAN LENS DESIGNS
Scan lenses with laser beams have been considered almost from the time of the devel­
opment of the first laser. Laboratory models for printing data transmitted from satellites 
were underway in the late 1960s. Commercial applications began coming out in the early 
1970s, and laser printers became popular in the early 1980s. The range of applications is 
steadily increasing. With the development of new laser sources (including violet and UV) 
and high-precision manufacturing processes for complex surfaces (including plastics), the 
field of lens design offers new challenges and opportunities with room for new design 
concepts.

Optical Systems for Laser Scanners 
113
The lenses presented in this section were selected to show what appears to be the trend 
in development. The spot diameters are getting smaller, the scan lengths longer, and the 
speed of scanning higher. Some of the lenses near the bottom of the list are beginning to 
exhaust our present design and manufacturing capabilities. The newest requirements are 
reaching practical limits on the size of the optics and the cost of the fabrication and mount­
ing of the optics. It appears that the future designs will have to incorporate mirrors and 
lenses with large diameters, and new methods for manufacturing segmented elements 
will be needed.
The lenses shown in this section start with some modest designs for the early scanners 
and progress to some of the latest designs. Two of the designs were obtained from patents. 
This does not mean that they are fully engineered designs. The rest of the designs are sim­
ilar paper designs. This means that the designer has the problem “boxed in”—where all 
the aberrations are in tolerance and under control. The next phase begins the engineering 
task of preparing the lenses for manufacture, making sure that all the clear apertures will 
pass the rays and that the lenses are not too thick or too thin, checking availability and 
cost of the selected glass types as well as the experience of the shop working with those 
glasses. The design has to be reviewed to consider how the lenses are to be mounted. Some 
of the lenses may require precision bevels on the glass or a redesign may avoid this costly 
step. This section also includes a few comments about the designs with regard to practical­
ity. Table 2.6 contains a summary of attributes for the selected lenses.
In the following lens descriptions all the spot diameters refer to the diameter of the spot 
at the 1/e2 irradiance level. The number of spots on the line is calculated assuming contig­
uous spots packed adjacent to each other at the 1/e2 irradiance level.
2.9.1  A 300 DPI Office Printer Lens (λ = 633 nm)
Figure 2.28 presents a patent (U.S. Patent 4,179,183, Tateoka, Minoura; December 18, 1979) 
assigned to Canon Kabushiki Kaisha. The patent contains a lengthy description of the 
design concepts used in developing a whole series of lenses. Fifteen designs are offered 
with the design data along with plots of spherical aberration, field curves, and the linear­
ity of scan. The design shown is example 6 of the patent. The design data were set up and

evaluated, and the results agree well with the patent. The focal length is given as 300 mm. 
The aberration curves appear to be given for the paraxial focal plane, and the linearity is 
shown to be within 0.6% over the scan. However, if one selects a calibrated focal length 
of 301.8 mm (11.8 in) and shifts the focus 2 mm (0.079 in) in back of the paraxial focus, it 
appears that the lens is well corrected to within λ/4 OPD (optical path difference) and 
linear to within 0.2%. A similar lens may have been used in early Canon laser printer 
engines. This lens has an exceedingly wide angle for a scan lens. It has a great advantage 
in the design of a compact scanner. This printer meets the needs of 300 DPI, which is quite 
satisfactory for high-quality typewriter printing of its time. The secret of the good per­
formance of this lens is the airspace between the positive and negative lenses. There are 
strong refractions on the two inner surfaces of the lens, which means the airspace has to 
be held accurately and the lenses must be well centered.
2.9.2  Wide-Angle Scan Lens (λ = 633 nm)
The lens in Figure 2.29 has a 32° half-field angle. It has a careful balance of third-, fifth-, 
and seventh-order distortion, so that at the calibrated focal length it is corrected to be F–θ 
to within 0.2%. To do this the lens uses strong refraction on the fourth lens surface and 
refraction on the fifth surface to achieve the balance of the distortion curve. The airspace 
between these two surfaces controls the balance between the third- and fifth-order dis­
tortion. This would also be a relatively expensive lens to manufacture. The design may be 
found in U.S. Patent 4,269,478; it was designed by Haru Maeda and Yuko Kobayashi and 
assigned to Olympus Optical Co., Japan.
2.9.3  Semiwide Angle Scan Lens (λ = 633 nm)
The lens in Figure 2.30 shows how lowering the F/# to 20 and increasing the scan length 
increases the sizes of the lenses. This lens is a Melles Griot product designed by David 
Stephenson. It is capable of writing 1096 DPI and is linear to better than 25 μm. The large 
front element is 128 mm in diameter. It will transmit 2.8 times as many information points 
as the first lens (9.1). This lens requires modest manufacturing techniques, but, as shown 
in the diagram, the negative lens may be in contact with the adjacent positive lens. Either 
the airspace should be increased, or careful mounting has to be considered.

2.9.4  Moderate Field Angle Lens with Long Scan Line (λ = 633 nm)
The lens in Figure 2.31 was designed by Robert E. Hopkins for a holographic scanner. It 
has a half scan angle of 18°, covers a 20 in scan length, and can write a total of 23,100 image 
points (about 1100 dpi). It has a short working distance between the holographic scan ele­
ment and the first surface of the lens. This makes it more difficult to force the F–θ condi­
tion to remain within 0.1%. The working distance was kept short in order to keep the lens 
diameters as small as possible. The largest lens diameter is 110 mm. Lens performance 
could not be improved without making the elements considerably larger. Adding more 
lense elements does not help. The lens performs well in the design phase, but, since it is 
relatively fast for a scan lens, the small DOF makes the lens sensitive to manufacture and 
mounting. The only way to make the lens easier to build is to improve the Petzval field cur­
vature, and this requires more separation between the positive and negative lenses. The

result is that the lens becomes longer and larger in diameter. Another way is to increase 
the distance between the scanner and the lens. This will also increase the lens size. We 
believe that this lens is close to the boundary of what can be done with a purely refracting 
lens for scanning a large number of image points. To extend the requirements will require 
larger lenses. It may be possible to combine small lenses with a large mirror close to the 
focal plane, but costs would have to be carefully considered. Photographic-quality shops 
can build this lens with attention to mounting.
2.9.5  Scan Lens for Light-Emitting Diode (λ = 800 nm)
In Figure 2.32 is another lens designed by Robert E. Hopkins to perform over the range of 
wavelengths from 770 to 830 nm. It was designed to meet a telecentricity tolerance of ±2°. 
The lens could not accommodate the full wavelength range without a slight focal shift. If 
the focal shift is provided for, the diodes may vary their wavelength from diode to diode 
over this wavelength region, and the lens will perform satisfactorily. This lens was not 
fully engineered for manufacture. It would be necessary to consider carefully how the 
negative–positive glass-to-glass contact combination would be mounted.
2.9.6  High-Precision Scan Lens Corrected for Two 
Wavelengths (λ = 1064 and 950 nm)
The Melles Griot lens in Figure 2.33 was designed for a galvanometer XY scanner system. 
It is capable of positioning a 4-μm spot anywhere within a 20-mm diameter circle. The spot 
is addressed with 1064-nm energy with simultaneous viewing of the object at 910–990 nm. 
The complexity of the design is primarily due to the need for the two-wavelength opera­
tion, especially the broad band around 946 nm. The thick cemented lenses require glass 
types with different dispersions. This lens requires precision fabrication and assembly to 
realize the full design potential.

2.9.7  High-Resolution Telecentric Scan Lens (λ = 408 nm)
The lens in Figure 2.34 was designed for a violet laser diode to image 1200 DPI over a small 
telecentric field. The design comprises three spherical elements and two cross cylinders to 
provide optical cross-scan correction and a precise telecentric field well corrected for F–Θ 
distortion. This lens form resembles Lens 9.5 in Figure 2.32, before the addition of the cross-
scan correction. The careful selection of optical glasses for the violet and UV is particularly 
important for transmission and dispersion. Many of the new eco-friendly glasses can have 
significant absorption around 400 nm and below. For example, the internal transmittance

at 400 nm for a 10-mm thick Schott SF4 element is 0.954, while the new glass, N-SF4 inter­
nal transmittance is 0.79.
2.10  SCAN LENS MANUFACTURING, QUALITY 
CONTROL, AND FINAL TESTING
The first two designs shown in the previous section require tolerances that are similar to 
quality photographic lenses. Compared to the lens diameters, the beam sizes are small, 
and so surface quality is generally not difficult to meet unless scan linearity and distortion 
are critical performance parameters. Designs 2 and 3 do not require the highest quality 
precision lenses, but will require an acceptable level of assembly precision. Because the 
scan line uses only one cross-sectional sweep across the lenses, the yield of acceptable 
lenses can be improved by rotating the lenses in their cell, avoiding defects in the indi­
vidual elements by finding the best line of scan. However, this requires that each lens be 
appropriately mounted into the scanning system, highlighting the need for good commu­
nications between the assemblers and the lens builders.
Lenses 9.5, 9.6, and 9.7 require lens fabricators capable of a precision build to achieve the 
expected performance of design. Surfaces need better than quarter-wave surface quality, 
and must be precision centered and mounted. Precision equipment will be required to 
maintain quality control through the many steps to fabricate and mount such lenses.
Precision lenses need special equipment for testing the performance of the finished lens 
assembly, using appropriate null tests and/or scanning of the image with a detector to mea­
sure the spot diameter in the focal plane, but the challenge is finding that plane. Attention 
must also be paid to the straightness of the detector measurement plane and motion rela­
tive to the lens axis. Typically the collimated beam should be directed into the lens exactly 
the way it will be introduced into the final scanning system. If the image beam intersects 
the image plane at an angle, the entire beam should pass through the scanner and to the 
detector. If the detector needs to be rotated relative to the image plane, a correction of the 
as-measured spot size to an as-used spot size has to be made. If the image is relayed with a 
microscope objective, the NA should be large enough to collect all the image cone angles.
Because scan lenses are usually designed to form diffraction-limited images, it is rec­
ommended that the lenses be tested using a laser beam with uniform intensity across the 
design aperture of the lens. The image of the point source should be diffraction-limited 
and its expected dimensions predictable. The image can be viewed visually or measured 
for profile and diameters via scanning spot or slit. Departures from a spherical wavefront 
as small as a one-tenth of a wavelength are easily detected. It is also possible to detect the 
effects of excessive scattered light.
2.11  HOLOGRAPHIC LASER SCANNING SYSTEMS
Holographic scanning systems were first developed in the late 1960s, in part through 
government-sponsored research for image scanning (reading) of high-resolution aerial 
photographs. Its application to image scanning and printing for high-resolution business

graphics followed in the 1970s with efforts dominated by IBM and Xerox.16 Subsequent 
developments in both the holographic process (design and fabrication) and laser tech­
nology (from commercializing of the HeNe laser to low-cost diode lasers) have helped 
broaden its application into commercial and industrial systems.
Applications include: low-resolution point-of-sale barcode scanners; precision noncon­
tact dimensional measurement, inspection and control of the production of high-tech 
optical fibers, medical extrusions and electrical cables; medium resolution (300–600 DPI) 
desk-top printers; and high-resolution (1200 DPI and up) direct-to-press marking engines.
Advantages of holographic scanners over traditional polygon mirror scanners include 
lower mass, less windage, and reduced sensitivity to scan disc errors such as jitter and 
wobble. Advancements in replication methods to fabricate scanning discs with surface 
holograms have also helped lower cost.
Disadvantages of holographic scanners include limited operating spectral bandwidth, 
deviation from classical optical design methods, and the introduction of cross-scan errors 
in simple design configurations (using a simple grating at compound angles). These issues 
must be managed during the design process through the configuration of the optical 
design and its ability to balance the image aberrations.
This section deals with the optical design of holographic scanning systems, beginning 
with the basics of a rotating holographic scanner and then developing its use with other 
components into more complex systems.17
2.11.1  Scanning with a Plane Linear Grating
A simple scanning system in terms of both the complexity of the holographic optical ele­
ment (HOE) and its configuration is illustrated in Figure 2.35.18 This system comprises a 
collimated laser beam incident on a hologram (nonplane grating the product of the inter­
ference of beams in a two-point construction). The performance characteristics of such 
a rudimentary scanner (line straightness, length, scan linearity, etc.) will depend on the 
angle of incidence at the hologram and the deviation by the hologram. These performance

characteristics can be best understood through modeling of a simple plane linear diffrac­
tion grating (PLDG) rotated to generate the scan, the PLDG being equivalent to a hologram 
constructed from two collimated beams.
Deviation of the beam by the grating (for a grating perpendicular to a plane containing 
the incident beam and scan disc rotation axis) is the sum of the input incidence angle θi 
and output exit angle θ0, as illustrated in Figure 2.36. These angles are derived from the 
grating equation23 for a given grating or hologram fringe spacing d, the wavelength of the 
light λ0, and the diffraction order m,

As with other types of scanning systems, errors such as line bow, scan disc wobble, eccen­
tricity, axis longitudinal vibration, and disc tilt and wedge can affect scanned image 
position.
2.11.2 Line Bow and Scan Linearity
The typical purpose of a laser scanning system is to generate a straight line of points by 
moving a focused beam across a focal plane at a linear rate relative to the scanner rotation. 
A method for deriving a nearly straight line scan from a PLDG in a disc-like configuration 
was developed independently by C. J. Kramer in the United States and M. V. Antipin and 
N. G. Kiselev in the former Soviet Union.16
The scanning configurations they developed operate at the Bragg condition where the 
nominal input angle θi and output angle θ0 are nearly 45°. The Bragg condition is where 
the input beam and diffracted output beam are at equal angles relative to the diffracting 
surface. Operating near this Bragg condition minimizes the effects of scan disc wobble and 
operating near 45° minimizes line bow (cross-scan departure from straightness). For the 
first diffraction order m = 1, the grating or hologram fringe spacing d would be given by 
the reduced equation
	
d = l0
2 .	
(2.28)
The actual optimum angle will depend on the scan length and the degree of line bow cor­
rection desired. The dependence of the scan line bow and scan linearity (in-scan position

error relative to the scan angle) on the Bragg angle is illustrated in Figures 2.37a and b for 
a design wavelength of 786 nm. In a 45° monochromatic corrected configuration, the chro­
matic variation of the line bow and scan length for a ±1-nm change in wavelength results 
in the departures illustrated in Figures 2.38a and b, respectively. These errors (line bow, 
scan linearity, and their chromatic variation) are significant compared to the resolution of 
the printer system and must be balanced in the designs to allow the use of cost-effective 
laser diodes with diffractive optical components.
2.11.3  Effect of Scan Disc Wobble
In general, HOEs are best designed to operate in the Bragg regime to minimize the effects 
of scan disc wobble. Wobble is the random tilt of the scan disc rotation axis due to bearing 
errors. The error in the diffraction angle ε resulting from a wobble angle δ indicated in

This angular error produces a cross-scan displacement in the scanned beam, affecting the 
position of a measurement being made or the position of a point being written. That dis­
placement error is a product of the angle error and the focal length of the projection optics. 
In systems with traditional reflective scanners (such as a polygon), this angular error is 
twice the wobble tilt error unless it is optically compensated using anamorphic optical 
methods, which greatly increases complexity and cost. Scan jitter in the scanner rotation 
will likewise generate twice the in-scan position errors. The precision of the scan degrades 
as the motor bearings wear and mirror wobble increases.
In a holographic scanning system, the cross-scan image error can be minimized to 
hundredths or even thousandths of the disc wobble error and the in-scan image error is 
approximately equal to the disc rotation (jitter) error. In a classical polygon scanning sys­
tem the image errors are twice the wobble and jitter errors. The effect on output angle error 
of a tilt in the scan disc rotation axis is shown in the curves of Figure 2.40 derived from 
the modified grating Equation 2.29. Two Bragg angle and two near-Bragg angle design 
configurations operating near the minimum line bow condition of 45° and arbitrary angle 
of 22° are plotted.
2.12  NONCONTACT DIMENSIONAL MEASUREMENT 
SYSTEM USING HOLOGRAPHIC SCANNING
Optoelectronic systems for noncontact dimensional measurements have been available to 
industry since the early 1970s. Major applications include the production and precision 
inspection of linear products like wire, cable, hose, tubing, optical fiber, and metal, plastic 
and rubber extruded shapes.

Linear measurement instruments have used two basic technologies to perform the mea­
surement. The first systems used a linearly scanned laser beam and a collection system 
with a single photodetector. As the telecentric beam moves across the measuring zone, 
the object to be measured blocks the laser beam from the collection system for a period of 
time. By knowing the speed of the scan and the time the beam is blocked, the dimension 
of the object can be calculated by a microprocessor and then displayed. Later, as video 
array technology developed, systems using a collimated light source and a linear charge 
coupled device (CCD) or photodiode array were introduced. These systems use an incan­
descent lamp or an LED with a collimating lens to produce a highly collimated beam of 
light that shines across the measuring zone. The object to be measured creates a shadow 
that is cast on a linear array of light-sensing elements. The count of dark elements is scaled 
and then displayed.
In most scanning systems, a laser beam is scanned by reflecting the beam off a motor-
driven polygon mirror. The precision of the scan degrades as the motor bearings wear, 
increasing mirror wobble and scan jitter. Otherwise, the overall accuracy of a laser scan­
ning system can be quite good, because resolution is based on a measurement of time, 
which can be made very precisely.
The electronic interface to a scanning dimensional measurement system is well under­
stood and has been used in various applications for years. Assuming that the scanning 
beam travels through the measuring zone at a constant, nonvarying speed, improvements 
in system performance are limited to (1) maximizing the reference clock speed; (2) further 
dividing the reference clock speed by delay lines, capacitive charging, or other electronic 
techniques; and (3) minimizing the beam on/off detection error.
Video array systems that use incandescent lamps drive the lamp very hard, which pro­
duces substantial heat and reduces the lamp life. Systems that use a solid-state source, 
such as an LED, are very efficient and require much less power. The quality of the shadow 
image depends on the entire optical system. Relatively large apertures are required to col­
lect a sufficient number of photons to achieve the needed signal-to-noise ratio. The phys­
ical dimensions and element size in the video array limit the resolution and achievable 
accuracy of the system. System reliability, however, is typically high, and the mean time 
between failures can be long if a solid-state light source is used. An LED/video array sys­
tem is all solid state and has no moving parts to wear out.

Handbook of Optical and Laser Scanning
The application of holographic scanning to noncontact dimensional measuring systems 
provides the opportunity to take advantage of the positive points in scanning systems and 
the high reliability of the all-solid-state video array systems, while avoiding some of the 
problems found in each.
A polygon mirror is manufactured one facet at a time, but a holographic disc can be rep­
licated, like a compact disc or CD-ROM. A holographic disc can be produced with 20 to 30 
facets at a fraction of the cost of producing a comparably high-precision polygon mirror 
with as many facets. Furthermore, other holographic components that might be used in 
the system, such as a prescan hologram, can also be replicated.
2.12.1  Speed, Accuracy, and Reliability Issues
As line speeds have increased and tolerances have narrowed, the need to provide not only 
diameter measurements but also flaw detection has grown dramatically. To provide fast 
response in process control and surface flaw detection, a measurement system must make 
many scans per second. The number of scans per second that can be made by a measure­
ment system is determined by the number of facets, the speed of the motor, and the data rate 
capability of the analog to digital (A/D) converter. With the high-speed electronics that are 
available today, the motor speed and thus motor lifetime and cost are the limiting factors 
when designing high-speed measurement devices. Typically, polygon mirror scanners have 
one-third the number of facets (or fewer) than a holographic disc, so the motor must run 
three times faster (or more) to produce the same number of scans per second as the holo­
graphic scanner. Consequently, the trade-off between speed and lifetime/cost of the motor 
for holographic disc scanners is considerably more attractive than polygon mirror scanners.
Traditional laser-based systems scan from 200–600 times/s/axis and provide limited 
single-scan information. The holographic disc in the Holix® Gage by Target Systems Inc., 
Salt Lake City, UT, has 22 segments as compared to 2–8 sides on a typical polygon mirror, 
with single-scan-based flaw detection possible at 2833 scans per second per axis.19
The ability to scan faster means more diameter measurements can be made over a given 
length of the test object in a given time interval. With this resolution increase, the system 
is more likely to detect surface flaws, as illustrated in Figure 2.41. In these holographic 
scanning systems there is no need to average groups of scans to compensate for the sur­
face irregularities in a manufactured polygon mirror. This is a major advancement in the 
ability to detect small surface flaws that can be missed by traditional gages.
In reflective scanners, any tilt error in the mirror can cause twice the error in the output 
beam. In transmission holographic scanners, the beam is diffracted rather than reflected, 
and the beam error on output is much smaller than the tilt of the disc axis.

As the number of facets increase on a polygon mirror, another problem can develop. 
Because of the finite size of the laser beam and the required scan angle, there is a mini­
mum size for each facet on the mirror. As the size of each facet is increased, the distance 
from the center of rotation to the facet surface increases (the polygon mirror gets larger 
in diameter). As the facet surface moves farther from the center of rotation, the virtual 
location of the scan center point shifts during the scan (pupil shift). This means the scan 
center point is not maintained at the focal point of the scan lens (which is designed to gen­
erate a telecentric scan) for the entire duration of the scan. The telecentricity errors from 
this shift in the pupil reduce the measurement accuracy or the depth of the measurement 
zone. Holographic disc scanners have no pupil shift, and therefore, are not limited by these 
errors.
2.12.2  Optical System Configuration
The optical system illustrated in Figure 2.42 offers scan and laser spot size performance in 
the measurement zone that, together with a proprietary processing algorithm, can provide 
repeatable measurements to within one micro-inch. The optical design comprises only the 
basic components required to scan a line: a laser diode, a collimating lens, a prescan HOE, 
a scanning HOE, a parabolic mirror (the scan lens in this system), a collecting lens, and 
fold mirrors to provide the desired packaging.
The laser diode is mounted in a metal block that is thermally isolated from the instru­
ment frame. A thermoelectric cooler (TEC) or heater and temperature controller are used 
to maintain the operating temperature of the laser diode over a narrow range of ~0.5 °C. 
Temperature control is required to prevent “mode hops” in the laser diode as the temper­
ature changes. The wavelength shift of a mode hop can be 0.5–1 nm with temperature 
change, as illustrated in Figure 2.43. The temperature control setpoint is selected to cen­
ter the laser diode between mode hops and prevent the diode from changing modes and 
abruptly shifting the emission wavelength. This is a critical feature of the system because 
diffractive elements are very sensitive to changes in wavelength. Although corrected for a 
wavelength drift in the ±0.1-nm class, like many other HOE-based optical systems, it can­
not accommodate mode hops.
The diverging beam emitted from the laser diode is apertured and quasi-collimated by a 
typical laser diode collimator. The ratio of the collimator focal length to the parabolic mirror

focal length sets the magnification for the projected laser spot width in the measurement 
zone. The beam is then diffracted by a stationary prescan HOE and diffracted again by 
a rotating scan disc HOE. The first-order diffracted beam exits the scan HOE at an angle 
about 22° off normal. As the disc rotates, the orientation of the diffractive structure in the 
scan HOE changes, causing the beam to scan from side to side. The ratio between disc rota­
tion angle and scan angle is approximately 1:1. The zero-order beam is not diffracted by the 
HOE and continues straight to a photodiode that is used to monitor disc orientation.
The use of replication to manufacture production holographic discs shown in Figure 
2.44 provides an economical way to reproduce discs with other features in addition to a 
large number of facets. Disc sectors are two-point construction or multiterm (x, y, . . . , xn 
ym) phase HOEs. All of the HOE component or surfaces can be produced by photo resist on 
glass substrates, embossing (replication) using polymers, or injection/compression mold­
ing in plastics.
The discs are designed with a gap between two adjacent facets that is much narrower 
than a holographic facet, and that has no grating on it. When the gap rotates over the laser 
beam, the beam is not diffracted and continues straight to a photodiode. This signal is 
used to identify the orientation of the disc. The data processor can use this synchroniza­
tion pulse to associate a unique set of calibration coefficients with each facet. This allows 
variations in optical parameters from one facet to another to be calibrated out.
The diffracted first-order beam is folded by two mirrors, reflected by the scan mirror, and 
then continues out through a window to the measurement zone. The parabolic mirror serves 
two purposes. First, it provides a nearly telecentric scan. Secondly, it focuses the beam so that 
the minimum in-scan waist is in the center of the measurement zone. After the measure­
ment zone, the beam passes through a second window and is collected by a condenser lens 
that focuses it onto a single photodetector. The collecting lens is an off-the-shelf condenser 
lens with an aspheric surface to minimize the spherical aberration generated by the nearly 
F/1 operating condition. The ratio of the condenser to scan lens focal length determines the 
size of the beam (an image of the beam at the scan disc) on the photodetector.

The inherent chromatic variations of scan length and scan bow in a holographic scan­
ner are corrected to acceptable levels by the Holographix patented configuration of 
Figure 2.45.20 The HOE scan disc introduces both line bow and chromatic aberrations 
(in- and cross-scan). The prescan HOE is used to introduce additional cross-scan chro­
matic error, which, when coupled with the bow correction provided by the tilted curved 
mirror (a rotationally symmetric parabola for the noncontact dimensional measurement 
system), produces a chromatically corrected in-scan beam. The cross-scan corrector 
hologram in the noncontact dimensional measurement system can be eliminated at the 
expense of cross-scan chromatic correction, illustrated in Figure 2.46. However, the mag­
nitude of the cross-scan error is less than 100 microns, and does not affect the diameter 
measurement.
The foregoing description is of a single measurement axis instrument. For many applica­
tions a single instrument with two measurement axes is used. This configuration includes 
two lasers and collimating systems that use a single scan disc at separate locations (at 90°) 
on the radius. The resulting two scanning beams continue and pass through separate mir­
rors and optics to produce two orthogonal telecentric scans. Separate collection lenses and 
photodetectors complete the optical paths. This system, with two measuring axes, is used 
to measure the nonroundness of round objects, two dimensions of nonround objects, and 
to view the object’s surface from more directions for more complete surface flaw detection. 
The discs are designed with facets of a specific size, so systems that use a single disc to 
produce multiple scan axes will be compatible with the orientation of the optical paths.
2.12.3  Optical Performance
The single measurement axis instrument can be optimized to provide a relatively large 
measurement zone while maintaining telecentricity and a consistent beam size in the scan 
direction. The profile and consistency of the in-scan beam width are shown in Figure 2.47 
for a 50-mm gage system over a ±20-mm measurement zone. A key to providing this per­
formance is orientation of the laser diode astigmatism with the slow axis parallel to the 
scan, also optimizing scan efficiency. The 1/e2 in-scan beam width over the measurement 
zone is approximately 210 microns, with centroid stability better than one micron and a

monochromatic telecentricity better than 0.04 mrad (as-designed). The profile of the ellip­
tical spot is Gaussian with small diffraction side lobes that are the result of truncation by 
the collimating lens aperture. The cross-scan spot size is typically much smaller, but is not 
controlled except by the first-order configuration. The design is optimized for an oper­
ating wavelength of 675 ± 0.1 nm anywhere within a setpoint of 670–680 nm. The subtle 
variations in the spot width are static for each system. Also static is the scan nonlinearity 
(distortion). These static variations are calibrated over the inspection zone to provide mea­
surement repeatability of 30 micro-inches for the 50 mm and 3 micro-inches for the 7 mm 
Holix gages.
2.13  HOLOGRAPHIC LASER PRINTING SYSTEMS
The configuration of a lower performance scanning system based on the Holographix pat­
ent is shown in Figure 2.48. This design is for a 300 DPI system comprising a laser diode 
source, a collimating lens, a prescan HOE, a holographic scan disc, a tilted concave cylin­
drical mirror, a postscan HOE, and assorted fold mirrors for packaging. This configuration 
provides a method for balancing errors of line bow, scan linearity, and their significant 
chromatic variations to the resolution requirements of the printer system, allowing the use 
of cost-effective laser diodes coupled with diffractive optical components.
This configuration uses a scan disc HOE at other than the minimum line bow con­
dition (to introduce a prescribed amount of line bow) that both focuses and scans the 
beam. A prescan HOE is used to introduce additional chromatic cross-scan error that, 
coupled with the bow correction provided by a tilted curved mirror, produces a corrected 
in-scan beam. The postscan HOE completes the correction by balancing the cross-scan 
compounded errors and focusing the beam. The unique configuration yields a system 
with significantly and acceptably reduced sensitivity to changes in laser wavelength (due 
to mode hops during scan, wavelength drift over temperature, and variation from diode 
to diode).
Typical system performance specifications (beam size, line bow, scan linearity, and 
change in line bow and scan linearity over wavelength and scan) are listed in Table 2.7. As 
the system’s performance requirements increase, tighter control of the system aberrations 
(particularly field curvature and astigmatism) is required. Additional design variables

such as higher-order terms on the scan disc and postscan HOEs provide the degrees of 
freedom necessary to achieve the line bow, linearity, beam quality, and chromatic varia­
tions specifications. These laser scanning system designs are nearly telecentric in image 
space to avoid position errors over the in-use DOF.
Since the original 300 DPI systems were developed, these designs have been continually 
refined and improved. The latest 600 DPI designs actually have a larger DOF, smaller pack­
age, reduced material cost, increased ease of assembly and alignment, and better chromatic

correction. These benefits have been obtained using an optimization process that increases 
the complexity of the recording parameters of the HOEs while decreasing the complexity 
of the rest of the system.
Over the years, Holographix has developed proprietary alignment and recording 
techniques to fabricate complex HOEs for both transmission and reflection. As com­
plexity has increased, so has the cost of recording of the “master” HOE. However, with 
the development of HOE mastering and replication techniques in which several thou­
sand replicas can be made from one master, the increased cost of the masters becomes 
insignificant. Development of holographic scanning systems has included refinement 
of production/replication processes to achieve higher diffraction efficiencies at lower 
cost. Diffraction efficiencies of replicated HOEs averaging 80% provide for high system 
throughput.
The optical design and tolerancing of systems with HOEs is nontrivial. Optimization 
of the optical system requires controlling (and sometimes limiting) the HOE degrees of 
freedom to minimize a feedback interaction between HOEs. The tolerancing of the optical 
designs for as-built performance requires the tolerancing of each HOE construction setup 
and then introducing the as-built HOEs into the tolerancing of the optical design. This 
multiple configuration/layer tolerancing can be modeled in Code V to predict the as-built 
performance of these complicated systems.
2.14  CLOSING COMMENTS
The significant trends in refinement of laser scanning systems are ever-increasing scan 
lengths and larger number of spots per inch. The design examples show present-day prac­
tical boundaries for scan lenses. These boundaries continue to slowly expand with new 
concepts and ever-increasing precision, using more combinations of refractive lenses, 
diffractive elements, and mirrors with anamorphic power—both nearer the scanner and 
closer to the image plane. Methods for economically manufacturing these elements con­
tinue to be developed, allowing for larger diameter refracting lenses and reduced cost lens 
segments and mirrors.
If not limited by the optical invariant, optical systems are generally limited by the preci­
sion of lens fabrication, assembly, alignment, and testing. Availability of fabrication houses 
with special equipment for unconventional surface types such as cylinders and toroids, in 
combination with spherical and aspheric surfaces, is limited. As usual, the market to pay 
for the special equipment and tooling has to be large enough to support the investment.

3.1  INTRODUCTION
3.1.1  Imaging Science for Scanned Imaging Systems
This chapter presents some of the basic concepts of image quality and their application to 
scanned imaging systems. In this revised edition, we have added more on tonal rendition 
including system plots and halftones, new approximations to MTF’s and revised pointers 
to the current industry standards in image quality, as well as more reference data and 
charts while reducing content on binary imaging and overall quality. New references and 
other technical details have been added throughout.
The emphasis in this chapter will be on the input scanner. Output scanners will be dealt 
with mainly by inference since many input scanner considerations and metrics are directly 
applicable to the rest of a complete electronic scanned imaging system. Expanded discus­
sions of halftone methods, tone reproduction, and nonuniformity are examples of output 
scanners and systems implications. The chapter is organized as 10 major sections moving 
from the basic concepts and phenomena of image scanning and color, through practical 
aspects of image quality, to performance of input scanners that produce multilevel (gray) 
signals and then the special but common case of binary scanned images. This is followed 
by sections on very specific topics: various summary measures of imaging performance 
and specialized image processing. To assist the reader, psychophysical measurement meth­
ods used to evaluate image quality and some reference data and charts have been added.
3.1.1.1  Scope
We, like so many others, follow in the path pioneered over a half century ago by the classic 
1934 paper of Mertz and Gray.1 Without going into the full mathematical detail of that paper 
and many of its successors, we attempt to bring to bear some of the modern approaches 
that have been developed both in image quality assessment and in scanned image char­
acterization. Many diverse technologies used in scanned imaging systems are addressed 
throughout the rest of this book. We cannot address the explicit effects of any of these on 
quality because they provide an enormous array of choices and trade-offs. Building on a 
more general foundation of imaging science, we shall attempt to provide a framework in 
which to sort out the many image quality engineering and technology issues that depend 
on these choices.
It is our intent not to show that one scanner or technique is better than another, but to 
describe the methods by which a scanning system can be evaluated to compare to other 
systems and to assess the technologies used in them. This chapter therefore deals primar­
ily with such matters as the sharpness or graininess of an image and not with such hard­
ware issues as the surface finish of an aluminum mirror, uniformity of a drive motor, or 
the efficiency of charge transfer in a charge-coupled device (CCD) imager.
Scanning is considered here in the general context of electronic imaging. An electronic 
imaging system can be considered as composed of 10 basic parts2 illustrated in Figure 3.1 
as a flow chart of fairly self explanatory terms. Both digital photography and scanning 
use the same type of CCD or CMOS sensors, that is, detectors. Both create images in two-
dimensional pixel format. For both, the processor is on the sensor, in hardware resident on 
the system and also off-line in computers. Both systems generate two-dimensional prints 
or displays of images using one-dimensional output applying them to one-dimensionally 
electronic/computer stored bit streams. Both systems use optical systems and input radia­
tion to create the captured image including arrays of color filters to create colored images.

Handbook of Optical and Laser Scanning
Some input scanners use reduction optics much as a camera in macromode but some use 
selfoc lens arrays which nearly contact the reflection original.
The primary difference between digital photography and input scanning is that the sensor 
in most photography is a fixed two-dimensional array of photosites (i.e., one-pixel sensors), 
while in scanning the array is synthesized by moving a long line of photosites one-pixel 
wide (i.e., a one-dimensional array or possibly three lines one for each color) over as much of 
a document as is needed. This has an effect in the scanning electronics—speed of the real-
time circuits and optomechanical structures—that might create errors in positioning the 
line of sensors. This creates a difference from two-dimensional arrays making it appear as 
if the synthesized array was nonuniform . . . Similar nonuniformities from one-dimensional 
moving arrays also occur in the printers which serve both scanners and other digital imag­
ing devices. The nonuniformities are described in Sections 3.3.2 and 3.3.3 (pp. 167–174). Much 
of the chapter, therefore, applies equally well to digital photography and scanning.
3.1.1.2  The Literature
Considerable research, development, and engineering have occurred over the last two 
decades and only a very small portion could be referenced in the following pages. A few 
general references of note are provided as References 2–18 and elementary tutorials in 
References 19–23. Other more specific work of importance that may interest the reader 
includes: the vast technology of image processing,17 many papers focused on specific prob­
lems in scanner image quality (see titles),24–26 digital halftoning,27,28 color imaging,29–32 and 
various forms of image quality assessment.33–39
While the focus here is on imaging modules and imaging systems, scanners may, of 
course, be used for purposes other than imaging, such as digital data recording, from 
Bar Codes for example. We believe that the imaging science principles used here are suf­
ficiently general to enable the reader with a different application of a scanning system to 
infer appropriate knowledge and techniques for these other applications.
3.1.1.3  Types of Scanners
All input scanners convert one- or (usually) two-dimensional image irradiance patterns 
into time-varying electrical signals. Image integrating and sampling systems, such as 
those found in many forms of electronic cameras and electronic copying devices, have 
sensors such as a CCD array. The signals produced by these scanners can be in one of two

general forms, either (a) binary output (a string of on and off pulses), or (b) gray-scale out­
put (a series of electrical signals whose magnitude varies continuously).
The term digital here refers to a system in which each picture element (pixel) must 
occupy a discrete spatial location; an analog system is one in which a signal level var­
ies continuously with time, without distinguishable boundaries between individual pic­
ture elements. A two-dimensional analog system is usually only analog in the more rapid 
direction of scanning and is discrete or “digital” in the slower direction, which is made up 
of individual raster lines. Television typically works in this fashion. In one form of solid-
state scanner, the array of sensors is actually two-dimensional with no moving parts. Each 
individual detector is read out in a time sequence, progressing one raster line at a time 
within the two-dimensional matrix of sensors.
In other systems a solid-state device, arranged as a single row of photosites or sensors, 
is used to detect information one raster line at a time. In these systems either the original 
image is moved past the stationary sensor array, or the sensor array is scanned across the 
image to obtain information in the slow scan direction.
Cameras in digital photography employ totally digital solid-state two-dimensional sam­
pling arrays. In some sense they represent commonly encountered forms of input scan­
ners. The reader should be able to infer many things about the other forms of scanners and 
digital cameras from examples discussed in this chapter.
3.1.2  The Context for Scanned Image Quality Evaluation
Building blocks for developing a basic understanding of image quality in scanning sys­
tems are shown in Figure 3.2. The major elements of a generalized scanning system are on 
the left, with the evaluation and analysis components on the right. This chapter will deal 
with all of these elements and it is therefore necessary to see how they all interact.
The general configuration of scanning systems often requires two separate scanning ele­
ments. One is an input scanner to capture, as an electronic digital image, an input analog 
optical signal from an original scene (object), shown here as a hard copy input, such as a 
photograph. The second scanning element is an output scanner that converts a digital sig­
nal, either from the input scanner or from computer-generated or stored image data, into 
analog optical signals. These signals are rendered suitable for writing or recording on some 
radiation-sensitive medium to create a visible image, shown here as hard copy output. The 
properties of this visible image are the immediate focus of image quality analysis. It may 
be photographic, electrophotographic, or something created by a variety of unconventional 
imaging processes. The output scanner and recording process may also be replaced by a 
direct marking device, such as a thermal, electrographic, or ink jet printer, which contains no 
optical scanning technology and therefore lies outside the scope of this volume. Nonetheless, 
its final image is also subject to the same quality considerations that we treat here.
It is to be noted that the quality of the output image is affected by several intermediate 
steps of image processing. Some of these are associated with correcting for the input scan­
ner or the input original, while others are associated with the output scanner and output 
writing process. These are mentioned briefly throughout, with the digital halftoning pro­
cess, described in Section 3.2.2.3, cited as a major example of a correction for the output 
writing. Losses or improvements associated with some forms of data communication, and 
compression are very important in a practical sense, especially for color. These are briefly 
reviewed in Section 3.7.1. Additional processing to meet user preferences or to enable some 
particular application of the image must also be considered a part of the image quality 
evaluation. A few examples are given throughout. A comprehensive treatment of image

processing is beyond the scope of this chapter but several references are given at the end of 
this chapter to help the reader learn more about this critical area of scanned imaging.
The assessment of quality in the output image may take the form of evaluation by the 
human visual system (HVS) and the use of psychometric scaling (see Section 3.8) or by mea­
surement with instruments as described in parts of Sections 3.3–3.5. One can also evaluate 
measured characteristics of the scanners and integrated systems or model them to try to 
predict, on average, the quality of images produced by these system elements. (Both of these 
hardware characterizations are also described in parts of Sections 3.3–3.5.) The description 
of overall image quality (Section 3.6) tends to focus on the models of systems and their 
elements, not the images themselves. For some purposes, for example, judging the quality 
of a copier, the comparison between the input and output images is the most important 
way of looking at image quality, whether it be by visual or measurement means. For other 
applications it is only the output image that counts. In some cases, the most common visual 
comparison is between the partially processed image, as can only be seen on the display, 
and either the input original or the hard copy output. In most cases, the evaluation criteria 
depend on the intended use of the image. A display of the scanned image in a binary (black 
or white) imaging mode reveals some interesting effects that carry through the system and 
often surprise the unsuspecting observer. These are covered in Section 3.5. Physical and 
visual measurements evaluate output and input images, hence the arrows in Figure 3.1 
flow from hard copy toward these evaluation blocks. Models, however, are used mostly to 
synthesize imaging systems and components and may be used to predict or simulate per­
formance and output. Hence the “model” arrows flow toward the system components.
The nonscanner components for electronic image processing and the analog writing pro­
cess play a major role in determining quality and hence will be unavoidably included in

any realistic HVS or measurement evaluation of the quality of a scanned image or imaging 
system. Models of systems and components, on the other hand, often ignore the effects of 
these components and the reader is cautioned to be aware of this distinction when design­
ing, analyzing, or selecting systems from the literature.
A model has been described by P. Engeldrum12,40–42 called the Image Quality Circle, 
which ties all of these evaluations together and expands them into a logical framework 
to evaluate any imaging system. This is shown in Figure 3.3 as the circular path con­
necting the oval and box shapes, along with the three major assessment categories from 
Figure 3.2, namely the HVS, Measurements, and Models. In his model, the HVS category 
above is expanded to show a type of model he calls “visual algorithms,” which predict 
human perceived attributes of images from physical image parameters. Examples of per­
ceptions would include such visual subjective sensations as darkness, sharpness, or grain­
iness (i.e.,  “nesses”). These are connected to physical measurements of densities, edge 
profiles, or halftone noise, respectively, made on the images used to evoke these subjective 
responses. In Engeldrum’s analysis, the rest of what we call the HVS and brain combina­
tion includes “image quality models,” which predict customer preferences based on rela­
tionships among the perceived attributes. This purely subjective dimension of individuals 
is often not included in the “brain” functions normally associated with HVS, therefore it is

ments of Figure 3.2 are indicated by the labels and heavy dashed lines that surround the figure.

mentioned explicitly here. The methodologies to enable these types of analysis generally 
fall into the realm of psychometrics (quantifying human psychological or subjective reac­
tions). They will be reviewed in Section 3.8.
Many authors (Section 3.6) have attempted to short-circuit this framework, following the 
dashed “spokes” we have added to the circle in Figure 3.3. These create regression mod­
els using psychometrics that directly connect physical parameters (path D) or technology 
variables with overall image quality models (path A) or preferences (path C). These have 
been partially successful, but, having left out some of the steps around the circle, they are 
very limited, often applying only to the circumstances used in their particular experi­
ment. When these circumstances apply, however, such abbreviated methods are valuable. 
Following all the steps around the circle leads to a more complete understanding and 
more general models that can be adapted to a variety of situations where preferences and 
circumstances may be very different. The reader needs to be aware of this and judge the 
extent of any particular model’s applicability to the problem at hand.
3.2  BASIC CONCEPTS AND EFFECTS
3.2.1  Fundamental Principles of Digital Imaging
The basic electronic imaging system performs a series of image transformations sketched 
in Figure 3.4. An object such as a photograph or a page with lines and text on it is converted 
from its analog nature to a digital form by a raster input scanner (RIS). It becomes “digital” 
in distance where microscopic regions of the image are each captured separately as dis­
crete pixels; that is, it is sampled! It is then quantized, in other words, digitized in level, and 
is subsequently processed with various strictly digital techniques. This digital image is 
transformed into information that can be displayed or transmitted, edited, or merged with 
other information by the electronic and software subsystem (ESS). Subsequently a raster output 
scanner (ROS) converts the digital image into an analog form; that is, it is reconstructed, typ­
ically through modulating light falling on some type of photosensitive material. The latter, 
working through analog chemical or physical processes, converts the analog optical image 
into a reflectance pattern on paper, or into some other display as the final output image.
What follows assumes optical output conversion, but direct-marking processes, involv­
ing no optics (e.g., ink jet, thermal transfer, etc.) can be treated similarly. Therefore, while 
one often thinks of electronic imaging or scanned imaging as a digital process, we are 
really concerned in this chapter with the imaging equivalent of analog to digital (A/D) 
and digital to analog (D/A) processes. The digital processes occur between as image pro­
cessing. In fact that is where we become familiar with the scanned imaging characteristics 
because that is one place where we can take a look at a representation of the image, that is, 
in a computer.
3.2.1.1  Structure of Digital Images
Before considering all the system and subsystem effects, let us turn our attention to the 
microscopic structure of this process, paying particular attention to the A/D and sampling 
domain of the input scanner. Sampled electronic images were first studied in a compre­
hensive way by Mertz and Gray.1

Image Quality for Scanning and Digital Imaging Systems 
141
To understand how sampling works, let us examine Figure 3.5. It illustrates four dif­
ferent aspects of the input scanning image transformations. Figure 3.5a shows the micro­
scopic reflectance profile representative of an input object: there is a sharp edge on the left, 
a “fuzzy” edge (ramp), and a narrow line. Figure 3.5b shows the optical image, which is a 
blurred version of the input object. Note that the relative heights of the two pulses are now 
different and the edges are sloping that were previously straight. Figure 3.5c represents 
the blurred image with a series of discrete signals, each being centered at the position of 
the arrows. This process is referred to as sampling.
Each sample in Figure 3.5c has some particular height or gray value associated with it 
(scale at right). When these individual samples can be read as a direct voltage or current, 
that is they can have any level whatsoever, then the system is analog. When an element 
in the sensor output circuit creates a finite number of gray levels such as 10, 128, or even 
1000, then the signal is said to be quantized. (When a finite number of levels is employed 
and is very large, the quantized signal resembles the analog case.) Being both sampled and 
quantized in a form that can be manipulated by a digital processor makes the image digi­
tal. Each of these individual samples of the image is a picture element, often referred to as a 
pixel or pel. A sampled and multilevel (>2) quantized image is often referred to as a grayscale 
image (a term also used in a different context to describe a continuous tone analog image). 
When the quantization is limited to two levels, it is termed a binary image. Image processing 
algorithms that manipulate these different kinds of images can be “bit constrained” to the

number of levels appropriate to the image bit depth (another expression for the number 
of levels), that is, integer arithmetic. This is effectively equivalent to many digital image 
processing circuits. Alternatively, algorithms may be floating point arithmetic, the results 
of which are quite different from the bit constrained operations.
A common and simple form of image processing is the conversion from a gray to a 
binary image as represented in Figure 3.5d of Figure 3.5. In this process a threshold is set 
at some particular gray level, and any pixel at or above that level is converted to white 
or black. Any pixel whose gray value is below that level is converted to the other sig­
nal, that is, black or white, respectively. Four threshold levels are shown in Figure 3.5c by 
arrows on the gray-level scale at the right. Results are depicted in Figure 3.5d as four rows, 
each being a raster from the different binary images, one for each of the four thresholds.

In Figure 3.5d, each black pixel is represented by a dot, and each white pixel is represented 
by the lack of a dot. (It is common to depict pixels as series of contiguous squares in a lat­
tice representing the space of the image. They are better thought of as points in time and 
space that can have any number of dimensions, attributes, and properties.)
Each row of dot patterns shows one line of a sampled binary image. These patterns are 
associated with the location of the sampling arrows, shown in Figure 3.5c, the shape of the 
blur, and the location of the features of the original document. Notice at the 85% thresh­
old, the narrow line is now represented by two pixels (i.e., it has grown), but the wider and 
darker pulse has not changed in its representation. It is still five-pixel wide. Notice that the 
narrow pulse grew in an asymmetric fashion and that the wider pulse, which was asym­
metric to begin with, grew in a symmetric fashion. These are quite characteristic of the 
problems encountered in digitizing an analog document into a finite number of pixels and 
gray levels. It can be seen that creating a thresholded binary image is a highly nonlinear 
process. The unique imaging characteristics resulting from thresholding are discussed in 
detail in Section 3.5.
Figure 3.6 represents the same type of process using a real image. The plot is the gray 
profile of the cross section of a small letter “I” for a single scan line. The width of the letter 
is denoted at various gray levels, indicated here by the label “threshold” to indicate where 
one could select the potential black to white transition level. The reader can see that the 
width of the binary image can vary anywhere from one to seven pixels, depending on the 
selection of threshold.
Figure 3.7a returns to the same information shown in Figure 3.5, except that here we 
have doubled the frequency with which we sampled the original blurred optical image. 
There are now twice as many pixels, and their variation in height is more gradual. In this 
particular instance, increased resolution is responsible for the binary case detecting the 
narrow pulse at a lower level (closer to 0% threshold). This illustration shows the general 
results that one would expect from increasing the spatial density at which one samples the 
image; that is, one sees somewhat finer detail in both the gray and the binary images with 
higher sampling frequency.

This is, however, not always the case when examining every portion of the microstruc­
ture. Let us look more closely at the narrower of the two pulses (Figure 3.7b). Here we see 
the sampling occurring at two locations, shifted slightly with respect to each other. These 
are said to be at different sampling phases. In phase A the pulse has been sampled in 
such a way that the separate pixels near the peak are identical to each other in their inten­
sity, and in phase B one of the pixels is shown centered on the peak. When looking at the 
threshold required to detect the information in phase A and phase B, different results are 
obtained for a binary representation of these images. Phase B would show the detection 
of the pulse at a lower threshold (closer to ideal) and phase A, when it detects the pulse, 
would show it as wider, namely as two pixels in width.
Consider an effect of this type in the case of an input document scanner, such as that 
used for facsimile or electronic copying. While the sampling array in many input scanners 
is constant with respect to the document platen, the location of the document on the platen 
is random. Also the locations of the details of any particular document within the format 
of the sheet of paper are random. Thus the phase of sampling with respect to detail is ran­
dom and the type of effects illustrated in Figure 3.7 would occur randomly over a page.

There is no possibility that a document covered with some form of uniform detail can look 
absolutely uniform in a sampled image. If the imaging system produces binary results, 
it will consistently exhibit errors on the order of one pixel and occasionally two pixels of 
edge position and line width. The same is true of a typically quantized gray image, except 
now the errors are primarily in magnitude and may, at higher sampling densities, be less 
objectionable. In fact, an analog gray imaging process, sampling at a sufficiently high fre­
quency, would render an image with no visible error (see the next subsection). Continuing 
with the same basic illustration, let us consider the effect of blur. In Figure 3.7c we have 
sketched a less blurred image in the region of the narrower pulse and now show two sam­
pling phases A and B, as before, separated by half a pixel width. Two things should be 
noted. First, with higher sharpness (i.e., less blur), the threshold at which detection occurs 
is higher. Secondly, the effect of sampling phase is much larger with the sharper image. 
Highly magnified images in Figure 3.8 illustrate some of these effects.
3.2.1.2  The Sampling Theorem and Spatial Relationships
By means of these illustrations we have shown the effects of sampling frequency, sam­
pling phase, and blur at an elementary level. We now turn our attention to the more formal 
description of these effects in what is known as the sampling theorem. For these purposes 
we assume that the reader has some understanding of the concepts of Fourier analysis or 
at least the frequency-domain way of describing time or space, such as in the frequency 
analysis of audio equipment. In this approach, distance in millimeters is transformed 
to frequency in cycles per millimeter (cycles/mm). A pattern of bars spaced 1 mm apart 
would result in 1 cycle/mm as the fundamental frequency of the pattern. If the bars were 
represented by a square wave, the Fourier series showing the pattern’s various harmonics 
would constitute the frequency-domain equivalent.
Figure 3.9 has been constructed from such a point of view. In Figure 3.9a we see a single-
raster profile of an analog input document (i.e., an object) represented by the function f(x).

including white, black and two levels of gray. Parts (c) and (d) are 1 bit/pixel images, that is, binary with only 
black and white where the threshold was set between the two levels of gray used in (a) and (b). Note the thicken­
ing of some strokes in the shaper image and the increased raggedness of the edges in the binary images. Some 
parts of the sharp binary images are also less ragged.

This is a signal extending in principle to +∞ and contains, upon analysis, many different 
frequencies. It could be thought of as a very long microreflectance profile across an origi­
nal document. Its spectral components, that is, the relative amplitudes of sine waves that fit 
this distribution of intensities, are plotted as F(µ) in Figure 3.9b. Note that there is a maxi­
mum frequency in this plot of amplitude versus frequency, at w. It is equal to the reciprocal 
of λ (the wavelength of the finest detail) shown in Figure 3.9a. This is the highest frequency 
that was measured in the input document. The frequency w is known as the bandwidth 
limit of the input document. Therefore the input document is said to be band limited. This 
limit is often imposed by the width of a scanning aperture that is performing the sampling 
in a real system.
We now wish to take this analog signal and convert it into a sampled image. We multiply 
it by s(x), a series of narrow impulses separated by Δx as shown in Figure 3.9c. The prod­
uct of s(x) and y f(x) is the sampled image, and that is shown in Figure 3.9e. To examine 
this process in frequency space, we need to find the frequency composition of the series 
of impulses that we used for sampling. The resulting spectrum is shown in Figure 3.9d. It 
is, itself, a series of impulses whose frequency locations are spaced at 1/Δx apart. For the 
optical scientist this may be thought of as a spectrum, with each impulse representing a 
different order; thus the spike at 1/Δx represents the first-order spectrum, and the spike at 
zero represents the zero-order spectrum. Because we multiplied in distance space in order 
to come up with this sampled image, in frequency space, according to the convolution 
theorem, we must convolve the spectrum of the input document with the spectrum of the

sampling function to arrive at the spectrum of the sampled image. The result of this con­
volution is shown in Figure 3.9f.
Now we can see the relationship between the spectral content of the input document 
and the spacing of the sampling required in order to record that document. Because the 
spectrum of the document was convolved with the sampling spectrum, the negative side 
of the input document spectrum F(µ) folds back from the first-order over the positive side 
of the zero-order document spectrum. Where these two cross is exactly halfway between 
the zero- and first-order peaks. It is a frequency (1/2Δx) known as the Nyquist frequency. 
If we look at the region in Figure 3.9g between zero and the Nyquist frequency, the region 
reserved for the zero-order information, we see that there is “contamination” from the 
negative side of the first order down to the frequency [(1 – Δx) – w], where w is the band 
limit of the signal. Any frequency above that point contains information from both the 
zero and the first order and is therefore corrupted or mixed, often referred to as aliased.
Should one desire to avoid the problem of aliasing, one must sample at a finer sampling 
interval, as shown in Figure 3.9h. Here the spacing is one-half that of the earlier sketches, 
and therefore the sampling frequency is twice as high. This also doubles the Nyquist fre­
quency. This merely separates the spectra by spreading them out by a factor of 2. Since 
there is no overlap of zero and first orders in this example, one can recover the original 
signal quite easily by simply filtering out the higher frequencies representing the orders 
other than zero. This is illustrated in Figure 3.10, where a rectangular function of width ±w 
and amplitude 1 is multiplied by the sampled image spectra, resulting in recovery of the 
original signal spectra. When inversely Fourier transformed, this would give the original 
signal back [compare Figures 3.10e and 3.9a].

that apply to sampled imaging: if a function f(x) representing either an original object or 
the optical/aerial image being digitized contains no frequencies higher than w cycles/mm 
(this means that the signal is band limited at w), it is completely determined by giving its 
values at a series of points <1/2w mm apart. It is formally required that there be no quan­
tization or other noise and that this series be infinitely long; otherwise windowing effects 
at the boundaries of smaller images may cause some additional problems (e.g., digital per­
turbations from the presence of sharp edges at the ends of the image). In practice, it needs 
to be long enough to render such windowing effects negligible.
It is clear from this that any process such as imaging by a lens between the document 
and the actual sampling, say by a CCD sensor, can band limit the information and ensure 
accurate effects of sampling with respect to aliasing. However, if the process of band limit­
ing the signal in order to prevent aliasing causes the document to lose information that was 
important visually, then the system is producing restrictions that would be interpreted as 
excessive blur in the optical image. Another way to improve on this situation is, of course, 
to increase the sampling frequency, that is, decrease the distance between samples.
We have shown in Figure 3.10 that the process of recovering the original spectrum is 
accomplished by a filter having a rectangular shape in frequency space (Figure 3.10d). This 
filter is known as the reconstruction filter and represents an idealized reconstruction pro­
cess. The rectangular function has a (sin x)/x inverse transform in distance space (Figure 
3.10c), whose zero crossings are at ±NΔx from the origin where N = 1,2, . . . Rectangular and 
other filters with flat modulation transfer functions (MTFs) are difficult to realize in inco­
herent systems. This comes about because of the need for negative light in the sidelobes 
(in distance space). A reconstruction filter need not be precisely rectangular in order to 
work. It should be relatively flat and at a value near 1.0 over the bandwidth of the signal 
being reconstructed (also difficult and often impossible to achieve). It must not transmit 
any energy from the two first-order spectra. If the sampling resolution is very high and the 
bandwidth of the signal is relatively low, then the freedom to design the edge of this recon­
struction filter is relatively great and therefore this edge does not need to be as square. 
From a practical point of view the filter is often the MTF of the output scanner, typically 
a laser beam scanner, and is not usually a rectangular function but more of a Gaussian 
shape. A nonrectangular filter, such as that provided by a Gaussian laser beam scanner, 
alters the shape of the spectrum that it is trying to recover. Because the spectrum is multi­
plied by the reconstructing MTF, this causes some additional attenuation in the high fre­
quencies, and a trade-off is normally required in practical designs.
3.2.1.3  Gray Level Quantization: Some Limiting Effects
Now that we have seen how the spatial or distance dimension of an input image may be 
digitized into discrete pixels, we explore image quantization into a finite number of dis­
crete gray levels. From a practical standpoint this quantization is accomplished by an A/D 
converter, which quantizes the signal into a number of gray levels, usually some power of 
2. A popular quantization is 256 levels, that is, 8 bits, which lends itself to many computer 
applications and standard digital hardware. There may be good reasons for other quanti­
zations, higher or lower, to optimize a design or a system. (See Reference 21, pp. 213–227 
for some practical applications and tests.)
From an overall systems engineering perspective, one needs to understand the limits 
on the useful number of quantization levels. This should be based upon noise in the input 
as seen by the system (inbound limit) or upon the ultimate output goal of how many dis­
tinguishable gray levels can be seen by the human eye (outbound limit). Both approaches 

Image Quality for Scanning and Digital Imaging Systems 
149
have been explored in the literature and involve complex calculations and experimental 
measurements.
Use of the HVS response with various halftoning methods represents an outbound limit 
approach to defining practical quantization limits for scanned imaging. The “visual limit” 
results shown in Figure 3.1144 plot the number of visually distinguishable gray levels against 
the spatial frequency at which they can be seen. This curve was derived from a very conser­
vative estimate of the visual system frequency response and may be thought of as an upper 
limit on the number of gray levels required by the eye. Plotted on the same curve are perfor­
mance characteristics for 20 pixels/mm (500 pixels/in) digital imaging systems that produce 
3 bits/pixel and 1 bit/pixel (binary) images. These were obtained by use of a generalized 
algorithm to create halftone patterns (see Section 3.2.2.3 and Reference 45) at different spa­
tial frequencies. The binary limit curve, added here to Roetling’s, graph, shows the number 
of effective gray levels for each frequency whose period is two halftone cells wide. The 3-bit 
limit assumes each halftone cell contributes 23 gray values, including black and white.
Roetling44 integrated the visual response curve to find an average of 2.8 bits/pixel as 
a good upper bound for the eye itself. Note that his general halftoning approach, using 
3 bits/pixel and 20 pixels/mm (500 pixels/in) also approximates the visual limit in the 
important midfrequency region. Specialized halftoning techniques7,45 may produce differ­
ent and often more gray levels per pixel at the lower frequencies.
Another approach to setting quantization limits is to examine the noise in the input, 
assuming in so doing that the quantization is input bound and not output bound by the 
visual process as in the foregoing approach. A range of photographic input was selected as 
examples of a practical lower limit (best) on input noise. The basic principle for describing 
the useful number M of gray levels in a photograph involves quantizing its density scale 
into steps whose size is based on the noise (granularity) of that photographic image46 when 
scanned by the digital imaging process. In simplified terms this can be described as

where L = the density range of the image, σa = measured standard deviation of density 
using aperture area = A, and k = the number of standard deviations in each distinguishable 
level.
The question being addressed by this type of quantization is how reliably one wants to 
be able to determine the specific tone in a given part of the input picture from a reading of 
a single pixel. For some purposes, where the scanned image is used to extract radiometric 
information from a picture,46 the reliability must be high, for other cases such as simply 
copying a scene for artistic purposes it can be much lower. To precisely control a digital 
halftone process (see later) it must be fairly high.
Photographic noise is approximately random uncorrelated noise. To a first order, pho­
tographic noise (granularity) is the standard deviation of the density fluctuations. It is 
directly proportional to the square root of the effective detection area,47,48 a of a measuring 
instrument or scanner-sensor, that is, Selwyn’s law:
	
sa = S

(3.2)
where S is a proportionality constant defined as the Selwyn granularity. It is also propor­
tional to the square root of the mean density, that is, Siedentopf’s relationship,47,49 in an ideal 
film system. In practical cases, as is done here, the density relationship must be empirically 
determined. Figure 3.12 shows the number of distinguishable gray levels reported in the 
literature by various authors for various classes of films obtained by directly measuring 
granularity as a function of density. They are reported at apertures that are approximately 
equivalent in size to the smallest detail the film could resolve, that is, the diameter of 
the film spread function. For a real world example, assume that 35-mm film images are 
enlarged perfectly by a high-quality 3.3 × enlarger. The conversion to the number of dis­
tinguishable gray levels per pixel is based on assuming Selwyn’s law, a reliability of 99.7% 
(± 3λ or k = 6) and that any nonlinear relationship between granularity and density scales 
as the aperture size changes. The actual scanner aperture is reduced by 3.3 × in its two 
dimensions to resemble directly scanning the film.
Four specific films were selected, each representative of a different class, three of which 
are black and white films: (1) an extremely fine-grained microfilm; (2) a fine-grained ama­
teur film; and (3) a high-speed amateur film.50 A special purpose color film was also included.51 
Despite now being obsolete, these films still represent a reasonable cross section of pho­
tographic materials. A 3.3 × enlargement was selected as typical of consumer practice, 
roughly giving a 3.5″ × 5″ print from a 35-mm negative. The reciprocal of this magnifica­
tion is used to scale the scanner aperture back to film dimensions. Two popular scanner 
resolutions of 600 and 300 dpi were selected. The corresponding sensor “aperture” widths 
in μm, scaled to the film, are noted in parentheses in the key at the top of each figure. The 
width is the inverse of the sampling period. A third scanner aperture, equivalent to that 
in the Roetling visual calculations, was used for one case, that is, a 20 samples/mm (500 
samples/in) scanning system with an aperture of 50 × 50 μm (2 × 2 mils). The fourth situa­
tion, called “Film @ max” describes the number of levels resulting from scanning the film 
with an aperture that matches the blur (spread function) for the film, given in the film cat­
egory label in parentheses at the bottom of each figure. These approximate calculations are 
an oversimplification of the photographic and enlarging processes, ignoring significant 
nonlinearities and blurring effects, but they provide a rough first-order analysis.
Examination of the charts suggests that a practical range of inbound quantization limits 
(IQLs) for pictorial images is approximately anywhere from 2 to 4 bits/pixel (microfilm is 

Image Quality for Scanning and Digital Imaging Systems 
151
not made for pictorials). For typical high-quality reproduction, then, an input bound limit 
is a little over 3 bits/pixel at 600 dpi using the three standard deviation criterion. This com­
pares with the rate of 2.8 bits/pixel found by Roetling for a visual outbound quantization 
limit (OQL). Recent work by Vaysman and Fairchild,52 limited to an upper frequency of 
300 dpi by their printer selection, also found, through psychophysical studies, that 3 bits/
pixel/color was a useful system optimum for reproducing color pictures.
One may ask, then, why are there so many input scanners operating at 8, 10, or even 
12 bits/pixel? First of all there are many reasons to modify these calculations for spe­
cific situations such as larger tolerances on probabilities for distinguishing differences less 
reliably, considering larger sampling apertures for certain rendering/viewing methods, 
different frequency weightings and many others that would result in more inbound or 
outbound gray levels (Reference 53, p. 198).
A very practical reason, however, is that actual hardwired scanners cannot adapt to 
detail and granularity in originals and change performance striving for these optimums 
in the way they were calculated. For slower, computationally intensive, off-line image pro­
cessing which can adapt to the information in small regions of the image (as in the case 
of JPEG and other lossy compressions—see Section 3.7.1) one can, in essence, approximate 
the limits just discussed. (As an example 10–20 × JPEG compression for 8-bit images works 
well and is approx. 4+ bits, leaving 3+ bits for the resulting image.)
Actual hardwired real-time scanners have to assume the worst case (e.g., 200 gray 
levels—see Figure 3.11). This is rounded up to 256 or 8 bits. However, the 200 gray levels

are not equally spaced in linear units. They are essentially spaced as equal increments on 
an L* scale (See Equations 3.5 and 3.8.)
Thus for an input density of 2.0 or an L* of ~9 and a difference of .5 L* (=1/200 of full 
L* scale) a linear difference of ~.0006 is called for. This is 1 part out of 1700, or more than 
10 bits (1024) and would require an 11-bit system (not a common A to D circuit). From a 
practical perspective that suggests 12 bits (4096 levels) which allows for some enhance­
ment of high density areas. For those believing that a ∆L* of 1 is just noticeable (true for 
certain conditions) the above situation calls for approx. 870 levels and 10 bits is satisfactory. 
Another alternative to stay with 8 bits and meet the visual requirements is to distort the 
linear sensor response via scanner electronics to approximate L* (some digital cameras and 
scanners do this) prior to the final digital output
Being aware of the inbound limits, the system options and the outbound limits as an 
endpoint gives a framework for robust engineering and optimization of image quality in a 
systems context. Information capacity approaches extend these concepts (see Section 3.6.7).
3.2.2  Basic System Effects
3.2.2.1  Blur
Blur, that is, the spreading of the microscopic image structure, is a significant factor in 
determining the information in an image and therefore its quality. In the input scanner, 
blur is caused by the optical system, the size and properties of the light-sensing element, 
other electronic elements, and by mechanical and timing factors involved in motion. This 
blur determines whether the system is aliased. Roughly speaking, if the image of a point 
(the profile of which is called the point spread function) spreads over twice the sam­
pling interval, the system is unaliased. The spreading also determines the contrast of fine 
details in the gray video image prior to processing. The cascading of these elements can 
be described conveniently by a series of spatial frequency responses [see later under MTFs 
for a detailed discussion] or other metrics that relate generally to the sharpness of optical 
images. It can be compensated for, in certain aspects, by subsequent electronic or computer 
image processing.
Blur in an output scanner is caused by the size of the writing spot, for example, the laser 
beam waist at focus, by modulation techniques and by the spreading of the image in any 
marking process such as xerography or photographic film. It is also affected by motion of 
the beam relative to the data rate and by the rate of motion of the light-sensitive receptor 
material. Output scanner blur more directly affects the appearance of sharpness in the 
final hard copy image that is presented to the HVS than does blur in the input scanner. 
Overall enhancement of the electronic input scanned image can, however, draw visual 
attention to details of the output image unaffected by blur limitations of either scanner.
Blur for the total system, from input scanner through various types of image processing 
to output scanner and then to marks on paper, is not easily cascaded, because the inter­
vening processing of the image information is extremely nonlinear. This nonlinearity 
may give rise to such effects as a blurred input image looking very sharp on the edges 
of a binary output print because of the small spot size and low blur of the marking pro­
cess. In such a case, however, the edges of square corners look rounded and fine detail 
such as serifs in text or textures in photographs may be lost. Conversely, a sharp input 
scan printed by a system with a large blurring spot would appear to have fuzzy edges, 
but the edge noise due to sampling would have been blurred together and would be less 
visible than in the first case. Moiré, from aliased images of periodic subjects caused by 

Image Quality for Scanning and Digital Imaging Systems 
153
low blur relative to the sample spacing, however, would still be present in spite of output 
blur. (Note, superposition of periodic patterns such as a halftoned document (see Section 
3.2.2.3) and the sampling grid of a scanner results in new and often striking periodic pat­
terns in the image commonly called Moiré patterns (see Bryngdahl54). Once aliased, no 
amount of subsequent processing can remove this periodic aliasing effect from an image.) 
The popular technologies called “anti aliasing” deal with a different effect of undersam­
pling, namely that binary line images exhibit strong visible staircase or jaggie effects on 
slanted lines when the output blur and sampling are insufficient for the visual system. 
These techniques nonlinearly “find” the stair steps and locally add gray pixels to reduce 
the visibility of the jaggie (see Section 3.7.2 and Figure 3.43).55 Aliasing is also known as 
spurious response.13
It is apparent, then, that blur can have both positive and negative impacts on 
the overall  image quality and requires a careful trade-off analysis when designing 
scanners.
3.2.2.2  System Response
There are four ways in which electronic imaging systems display or print tonal informa­
tion to the eye or transmit tonal information through the system:
	
1.	By producing a signal of varying strength at each pixel, using either amplitude or 
pulse-width modulation.
	
2.	By turning each pixel on or off (a two-level or binary system; see Section 3.5).
	
3.	By use of a halftoning approach, which is a special case of binary imaging. Here, 
the threshold for the white–black decision is varied in some structured way over 
very small regions of the image, simulating continuous response. Many, often 
elaborate, methods exist for varying the structure; some involve multiple pixel 
interactions (such as error diffusion; see the end of Section 3.2.2.3) and others use 
subpixels (such as high addressability, extensions of the techniques mentioned in 
Section 3.7.2).
	
4.	By hybrid halftoning combining the halftone concept in (3) with the variable gray 
pixels from (1) (e.g., see References 44 and 45).
From a hardware point of view, the systems are either designed to carry gray informa­
tion on a pixel-by-pixel basis or to carry binary (two-level) information on a pixel-by-pixel 
basis. Because a two-level imaging system is not very satisfactory in many applications, 
some context is added to the information flow in order to obtain pseudogray using the 
halftoning approach.
Macroscopic tone reproduction is the fundamental characteristic used to describe all 
imaging systems’ responses, whether they are analog or digital. For an input scanner it is 
characterized by a plot of an appropriate, macroscopic output response, as a function of 
some representation of the input light level. The output may characteristically be volts or 
digital gray levels for a digital input scanner and intensity or perhaps darkness or den­
sity of the final marks-on-paper image for an output scanner. The correct choice of units 
depends upon the application for which the system response is being described. There are 
often debates as to whether such response curves should be in units of density or optical 
intensity, brightness, visual lightness or darkness, gray level, and so on. For purposes of 
illustration, see Figure 3.13.

Here we have chosen to use the conventional photographic characterization of output 
density plotted against input density using normalized densities. Curve A shows the case 
of a binary imaging system in which the output is white or zero density up to an input 
density of 0.6, at which point it becomes black or 2.0 output density. Curve B shows what 
happens when a system responds linearly in a continuous fashion to input density. As the 
input is equal to the output here, this system would be linear in reflectance, irradiance, or 
even Munsell value (visual lightness units).
Curve C shows a classic abridged gray (severely limited number of levels) system 
attempting to write linearly but with only eight levels of gray. This response becomes 
a series of small steps, but because of the choice of density units, which are logarithmic, 
the sizes of the steps are very different. Had we plotted output reflectance as a function 
of input reflectance, the sizes of the steps would have been equal. However, the visual 
system that usually looks at these tones operates in a more or less logarithmic or power 
fashion, hence the density plot is more representative of the visual effect for this image. 
Had we chosen to quantize in 256 gray levels, each step shown would have been broken 
down into 32 smaller substeps, thereby approximating very closely the continuous curve 
for B.
When designing the system tone reproduction, there are many choices available for the 
proper shape of this curve. The binary curve, as in A, is ideal for the case of reproducing 
high-contrast information because it allows the minimum and maximum input densities 
considerable variation without any change to the overall system response.
For reproducing continuous tone pictures, there are many different shapes for the rela­
tionship between input and output, two of which are shown in Figure 3.13. If, for example, 
the input document is relatively low contrast, ranging from 0 to 0.8 density, and the output 
process is capable of creating higher densities such as 1.4, then the curve represented by 
D would provide a satisfactory solution for many applications. However, it would create 
an increase in contrast represented by the increase in the slope of the curve relative to B, 
where B gives one-for-one tone reproductions at all densities. Curve D is clipped at an 
input density greater than 0.8. This means that any densities greater than that could not be 
distinguished and would all print at an output density of 1.4.
In many conventional imaging situations the input density range exceeds that of the 
output density. The system designer is confronted with the problem of dealing with this 
mismatch of dynamic ranges. One approach is to make the system respond linearly to 
density up to the output limit; for example, following curve B up to an output density

of 1.4 and then following curve D. This generally produces unsatisfactory results in the 
shadow regions for the reasons given earlier for curve D. One general rule is to follow 
the linear response curve in the highlight region and then to roll off gradually to the 
maximum density in the shadow regions starting perhaps at a 0.8 output density point for 
the nonlinear portion of the curve as shown by curve E. Curve F represents an idealized 
case approximating a very precisely specified version arrived at by Jorgenson.56 He found 
the “S”-shaped curve resembling F to be a psychologically preferred curve among a large 
number of the curves he tried for lithographic applications. Note that it is lighter in the 
highlights and has a midtone region where the slope parallels that of the linear response. 
It then rolls off much as the previous case toward the maximum output density at a point 
where the input density reaches its upper limit.
3.2.2.3  Halftone System Response
One of the advantages of digital imaging systems is the ability to completely control the 
shape of these curves to allow the individual user to find the optimum relationship for 
a particular photograph in a particular application. This can be achieved through the 
mechanism of digital halftoning as described below. Historically important studies of 
tone reproduction, largely for photographic and graphic arts applications, include those of 
Jones and Nelson,57 Jones,58 Bartleson and Breneman,59 and two excellent review articles, 
covering many others, by Nelson.60,61 Many recent advances in the technology of digital 
halftoning have been collected by Eschbach.7
The halftoning process can be understood by examination of Figure 3.14. In the top of 
this illustration two types of functions are plotted against distance x, which has been 
marked off into increments one pixel in width. The first functions are three uniform reflec­
tance levels, Rl, R2, and R3. The second function T(x) is a plot of threshold versus distance, 
which looks like a series of up and down staircases, that produces the halftone pattern. 
Any pixels whose reflectance is equal to or above the threshold is turned on, and any that 
is below the threshold for that pixel is turned off.
Also sketched in Figure 3.14 are the results for the thresholding process for R1 on the 
second line and then for R2 and R3 on the third line. The last two are indistinguishable 
for this particular set of thresholding curves. It can be seen from this that the reflectance 
information is changed into width information and thus that the method of halftoning is a 
mechanism for creating dot growth or spatial pulse-width modulation over an area of sev­
eral pixels. Typically, such threshold patterns (i.e., screens) are laid out two-dimensionally. 
An example is shown in Figure 3.15.
This thresholding scheme emulates the printer’s 45° screen angle, which is considered to 
be favorable from a visual standpoint because the 45° screen is less visible (oblique effect4) 
than the same 90° screen. Other screen angles may also be conveniently generated by a 
single string of thresholds and a shift factor that varies from raster to raster.62,63 The num­
bers in each cell in the matrix represent the threshold required in a 32-gray-level system 
to turn the system on or off. The sequence of thresholds is referred to as the dot growth 
pattern. At the bottom, four thresholded halftone dots (Parts b–e) are shown for illustra­
tion. There are a total of 64 pixels in the array but only 32 unique levels. This screen can be 
represented by 32 values in a 4 × 8 pixel array plus a shift factor of four pixels for the lower 
set of 32, which enables the 45° screen appearance as illustrated. It may also be represented 
by 64 values in a single 8 × 8 pixel array, but this would be a 90° screen. It is also possible 
to alternate the thresholding sequence between the two 4 × 8 arrays, where the growth 
pattern in each array is most commonly in a spiral pattern, resulting in two unique sets of 

156 
Handbook of Optical and Laser Scanning
32 thresholds for an equivalent of 64 different levels and preserving the screen frequency 
as shown. This screen is called a “double dot.” The concept is sometimes extended to four 
unique dot growth patterns and hence is named a “quad dot.” Certain percent area cover­
age dot patterns in these complex multicentered dot structures generate very visible and 
often objectionable patterns.
The halftone matrix described in Figure 3.15 represented 32 specific thresholds in a spe­
cific layout. There are many alternatives to the size and shape of the matrix, the levels 
chosen, the spatial sequence in which the thresholds occur, and arrangements of multiple, 
uniquely different matrices in a grouping called a super cell. Here there are many differ­
ent cells (more than the four in a quad dot) varying slightly in shape and each may contain 
a slightly different number of pixels. This gives its designer even more gray levels since 
there are more cells and each may contain unique thresholds. There are also more available 
angles due to the size and shape differences of the individual cells giving the centers of the 
collection of all the supercells more precision to form a new screen angle. See Figure 3.16.

The careful selection of these factors gives good control over the shape of the apparent 
tone reproduction curve, granularity, textures, and sharpness in an image. The halftone 
system’s ability to resolve structures finer than the halftone screen array or cell size has 
been described as “partial dotting” by Roetling64 and others and is an important and often 
misunderstood factor in image quality studies (Reference 53, p. 163; Reference 65, p. 403). 
It is the result of the high-resolution pixel-by-pixel comparison of the threshold matrix 
and the image detail which allows high-contrast image detail to pass through the halftone 
matrix, nearly unchanged.
There are also many other methods for converting binary images into pseudog­
ray images using digital halftoning methods of a more complex form.66,67 These 
include alternative dot structures, that is, different patterns of sequences in alternat­
ing repeat patterns, random halftoning, and techniques known as error diffusion. In 
his book Digital Halftoning, Ulichney68 describes five general categories of halftoning 
techniques:
	
1.	Dithering with white noise (including mezzotint)
	
2.	Clustered dot ordered dither
	
3.	Dispersed dot ordered dither (including “Bayer’s dither”)
	
4.	Ordered dither on asymmetric grids
	
5.	Dithering with blue noise (actually error diffusion)

He states that “spatial dithering is another name often given to the concept of digital 
halftoning. It is perfectly equivalent, and refers to any algorithmic process that creates the 
illusion of continuous tone images from the judicious arrangement of binary picture ele­
ments.” The process described in Figures 3.15 and 3.16 falls into the category of a clustered 
dot ordered dither method (category 2) as a classical rectangular grid on a 45° base.
There is no universally best technique among these. Each has its own strengths and 
weaknesses in different applications. The reader is cautioned that there are many impor­
tant aspects of the general halftoning process that could not be covered here. (See Reference 
45 for a summary of digital halftoning technology and many references, and Reference 69 
for many practical aspects of conventional halftoning for color reproduction.) For example, 
the densities described in Figure 3.15 only apply to the case of perfect reproduction of the 
illustrated pixel maps on nonlight-scattering material using perfect, totally black inks. In 
reality, each pattern of pixels must be individually calibrated for any given marking pro­
cess. The spatial distribution interacts with various noise and blurring characteristics of 
output systems to render the mathematics of counting pixels to determine precise density 
relationships highly erroneous under most conditions. This is even true for the use of 
halftoning in conventional lithographic processes, due to the scattering of light in white 
paper and the optical interaction of ink and paper. These affect the way the input scanner 
“sees” a lithographic halftone original. Some of these relationships have been addressed in 
the literature, both in a correction factor sense69,70 and in a spatial frequency sense.71–73 All 
of these methods involve various ways of calculating the effect that lateral light scattering 
through the paper has on the light reemerging from the paper between the dots.
The effects of blur from the writing and marking processes involved in generating the 
halftone, many of which may be asymmetric, require individual density calibrations for 
each of the dot patterns and each of the dithering methods that can be used to generate 
these halftone patterns. The control afforded through the digital halftoning process by the

careful selection of these patterns and methods enables the creation of any desired shape 
for the tone reproduction curve for a given picture, marking process, or application.
3.2.2.4  Noise
Noise can take on many forms in an electronic imaging system. First there is the noise 
inherent in the digital process. This is generally referred to as either sampling noise asso­
ciated with the location of the pixels or quantization noise associated with the number of 
discrete levels. Examples of both have been considered in the earlier discussion. Next there 
is electronic noise associated with the electronic components from the sensor to the ampli­
fication and correction circuits. As we move through the system, the digital components 
are generally thought to be error-free and therefore there is usually no such noise associ­
ated with them.
Next, in a typical electronic system, we find the ROS itself, often a laser beam scanner. If 
the system is writing a binary file, then the noise associated with this subsystem is gener­
ally connected with pointing of the beam at the imaging material and is described as jitter, 
pixel placement error, or raster distortion of some form (see the next subsection). Under 
certain circumstances, exposure variation produces noise, even in a binary process. For 
systems with gray information, there is also the possibility that the signals driving the 
modulation of exposure may be in error, so that the ROS can also generate noise similar to 
that of granularity in photographs or streaks if the error occurs repeatedly in one orienta­
tion. Finally we come to the marking process, which converts the laser exposure from the 
ROS into a visible signal. Marking process noise, which generally occurs as a result of the 
discrete and random nature of the marking particles, generates granularity.
An electronic imaging system may enhance or attenuate the noise generated earlier in 
the process. Systems that tend to enhance detail with various types of filters or adaptive 
schemes are also likely to enhance noise. There are, however, processes (see Section 3.7.2) 
that search through the digital image identifying errors and substitute an error-free pat­
tern for the one that shows a mistake.74,55 These are sometimes referred to as noise removal 
filters.
Noise may be characterized in many different ways, but in general it is some form of sta­
tistical distribution of the errors that occur when an error-free input signal is sent into the 
system. In the case of imaging systems, an error-free signal is one that is absolutely uni­
form, given a noise-free, uniform input. Examples would include a sheet of white micro­
scopically uniform paper on the platen of an input scanner, or a uniform series of laser-on 
pulses to a laser beam scanner, or a uniform raster pattern out of a perfect laser beam 
scanner writing onto the light-sensitive material in a particular marking device. A typi­
cal way to measure noise for these systems would be to evaluate the standard deviation 
of the output signal in whatever units characterize it. A slightly more complete analysis 
would break this down into a spatial frequency or time-frequency distribution of fluctua­
tions. For example, in a photographic film a uniform exposure would be used to generate 
images whose granularity was measured as the root-mean-square fluctuation of density. 
For a laser beam scanner it would be the root-mean-square fluctuation in radiance at the 
pixel level for all raster lines.
In general, certain factors that affect the signal aspect of an imaging system positively, 
affect the noise characteristics of that imaging system negatively. For example, in scanning 
photographic film, the larger the sampled area, as in the case of the microdensitometer 
aperture, the lower the granularity [Equation 3.1]. At the same time, the image information 
is more blurred, therefore producing a lower contrast and smaller signal level. In general the 

160 
Handbook of Optical and Laser Scanning
signal level increases with aperture area and the noise level (as measured by the standard 
deviation of that signal level) decreases linearly with the square root of the aperture area 
or the linear dimension of a square aperture. It is therefore very important when design­
ing a scanning system to understand whether the image information is being noise limited 
by some fundamentals associated with the input document or test object or by some other 
component in the overall system itself. An attempt to improve bandwidth, or otherwise 
refine the signal, by enhancing some parts of the system may, in general, do nothing to 
improve the overall image information, if it is noise in the input that is limiting and that is 
being equally “enhanced.” Also, if the noise in the output writing material is limiting, then 
improvements upstream in the system may reach a point of diminishing returns.
In designing an overall electronic imaging system it should be kept in mind that noises 
add throughout the system, generally in the sense of an RSS (root of the sum of the squares) 
calculation. The signal attenuating and amplifying aspects, on the other hand, tend to mul­
tiply throughout the system. If the output of one subsystem becomes the input of another 
subsystem, the noise in the former is treated as if it were a signal in the latter. This means 
that noise in the individual elements must be appropriately mapped from one system to the 
other, taking into account various amplifications and nonlinearities. In a complex system 
this may not be easy; however, keeping an accurate accounting of noise can be a great advan­
tage in diagnosing the final overall image quality. We expand on the quantitative character­
ization of these various forms of signal and noise in the subsequent parts of this chapter.
3.2.2.5  Color Imaging
Color imaging in general and especially digital color imaging have received considerable 
attention in the literature in recent years.5,6,14,29,30 An elementary treatment is given below 
covering a few major points important to scanning and image quality. See References 16 or 
30 for a recent broad overview and literature survey of digital color imaging, and Reference 
75 for a classic review of more traditional color reproduction systems and colorimetry.
3.2.2.5.1  Fundamentals
There are two basic methods of creating images, including digital images, in color, called 
additive and subtractive methods.
In an additive color system one creates the appropriate color image pixels by combin­
ing red (R), green (G), or blue (B) microsized lights, that is, pixels of varying intensities. 
Roughly equal amounts of each produce the sensation of “white” light on viewing. This 
applies to many self-luminous displays such as a CRT/TV or liquid crystal displays. The 
pixels must be small enough that the eye blurs them together. The eye detects these signals 
using sensors called “cones” in the retina. These are associated with the HVS sensations 
of red, green, and blue.
In the second method of color imaging, called subtractive color, light is removed from 
otherwise white light by filters that subtract the above components one at a time. Red is 
removed by a cyan (C) filter, green by a magenta (M) filter, and blue by a yellow (Y) filter. 
For an imaging system, these filters are created by an imagewise distribution of transpar­
ent colorants created (e.g., pixel by pixel) in varying amounts. They are laid down color 
layer by color layer. The “white” light may come from a projector as in the case of trans­
parencies or from white room light reflected by a white sheet of paper with the imagewise 
distribution of transparent colorants bonded to it. Here the subtraction occurs once on the 
way to the paper and then a second time after reflection on the way to the eye. Color pho­
tographic reflection prints and color offset halftone printing both use this method.

Image Quality for Scanning and Digital Imaging Systems 
161
A digital color imaging system, designed to capture the colors of an original object, 
breaks down light reflected (or transmitted) from the object into its R, G, and B compo­
nents by a variety of possible methods. It uses separate red, green, and blue image capture 
systems and channels of image processing, which are eventually combined to form a full 
color image.
The visual response involves far more than just the absorption of light. It involves the 
human neurological system and many special processes in the brain. The complexity of 
this can be appreciated by observing the results of simple color matching experiments, 
in which an observer adjusts the intensities of three color primaries until their mixture 
appears to match a test color. Such experiments, using monochromatic test colors, lead 
to the development of a set of color matching functions for specific sets of colored light 
sources and specific observer conditions. Certain monochromatic colors require the sub­
traction of colored light (addition of the light to the color being matched) in order to create 
a match. Color matching experiments are described extensively in the literature4,10,14,29 and 
provide the foundation to the science of colorimetry.
Two such sets of color matching functions are shown in Figures 3.17a and b. The first 
set reports experimental results using narrow band monochromatic primaries. Note the 
large negative lobe on the third curve of “a,” showing the region where “negative light” 
is needed, that is, where the light must be added to the color under test to produce a 
match. The second set has become a universally accepted representation defining the CIEs 
(Commission Internationale de l’Eclairage) 1931 2° Standard Colorimetric Observer. It is a 
linear transformation of standardized color matching data, carefully averaged over many 
observers and is representative of 92% of the human population having normal color 
vision. This set of functions provides the standardization for much of the science of the 
measurement of color, in other words, important colorimetry standards.
This overly simplistic description goes beyond the scope of this chapter to explain. 
Ideally the information recorded by a color scanner should be equivalent to that seen by 
an observer. In reality, the transparent colorant materials used to create images are not 
perfect. Significant failures stem from the nonideal shapes of the spectral sensitivities of 
the capturing device and the nonideal shapes of the spectral reflectance or transmittance 
of the colorants. Practical limitations in fabricating systems and noise also restrict the 
accuracy of color recording for most scanners. Ideal spectral shapes of sensitivities and 
filters would allow the system designer to better approximate the HVS color response. For 
example, an input original composed of conventional subtractive primaries such as real 
magenta (green absorbing) ink, not only absorbs green light, but also absorbs some blue 
light. Different magentas have different proportions of this unwanted absorption. Similar 
unwanted absorptions exist in most cyan and, to a lesser extent, in most yellow colorants. 
These unwanted characteristics limit the ability of complete input and output systems to 
reproduce the full range of natural colors accurately. Significant work has been carried out 
to define quality measures for evaluating the color quality of color recording instruments 
and scanning devices.32, 6 (ch. 5), 21 (ch. 19). See also Table 3.9: INCITS-WI, ANSI–IT8.
3.2.2.5.2  Colorimetry and Chromaticity Diagrams
This leads to two large problem areas in color image quality needing quantification, 
namely: (1) that the color gamuts of real imaging systems are limited; and (2) that col­
ors which appear to match under one set of conditions appear different by some amount 
under another set of circumstances. This is conveniently described by a color analysis tool 
from the discipline of colorimetry (the science of color measurement) called a chromaticity 
diagram, shown in Figure 3.18. It describes color in a quantitative way. It can be seen, in this 

162 
Handbook of Optical and Laser Scanning
illustration, that the monitor display is capable of showing different colors from a partic­
ular color printer. It is also possible, with this diagram, to show the color of an original. 
Note that a color gamut is the range of colors that can be produced by the device of interest 
as specified in some three- or more dimensional color space. It is important to note that a 
two-dimensional representation, like that shown here, while very helpful, is only a part 
of the whole three-dimensional color space. Variations derived from the chromaticity dia­
gram, and the equations that define it, however, provide a basis for much of the literature 
that describes color image quality today. It is designed to facilitate description of small 
color differences, for example, between an original and a reproduced color or two different 
reproductions of the same color.
The reader must be warned, however, that the actual perception of colors involves many 
psychophysical and psychological factors beyond those depicted in this diagram.4 It is, 
however, a useful starting point. It describes any color in an image or a source and is

often the starting point in many of the thousands of publications on color imaging. There 
are also many different transformations of basic chromaticity diagram, a few primary 
examples of which we will describe here.
For the purposes of this chapter the basic equations used to derive the chromaticity 
diagram and to transform it provide an introduction to color image quality measurement. 
The outer, horseshoe-shaped curve, known as the “spectral locus,” represents the most sat­
urated colors possible, those formed by monochromatic sources at different wavelengths. 
All other possible colors lie inside this locus. Whites or neutrals by definition are the least 
saturated colors, and lie nearer the center of the horseshoe-shaped area. The colors of 
selected broad-spectrum light sources A, B and C are shown later in Figure 3.47 (along 
with the equal energy white point E from Figure 3.18, plotted here for reference) using a 
more precise chromaticity diagram. Saturation (a perceptual attribute) of any color patch 
(transparent or reflection) can be estimated on this chart by a physical measure called 
excitation purity. It can be seen as the relative distance from the given illumination of the 
patch to the horseshoe limit curve along a vector. The dominant wavelength (approximate 
correlate with perceptual attribute of hue) is given by the intersection of that vector with 
the spectral locus. The lightness of the color is a third dimension, not shown, but is on an 
axis perpendicular to the plane of the diagram (coming out of the page). Use of dominant 
wavelength and purity to describe colors in the x, y version of the chromaticity diagram is 
shown in Figure 3.46 in Section 3.9. Different light sources may be used but standard source 
“C” (See Figure 3.47) was chosen here. These correlates are only approximate because lines 
of constant hue are slightly curved in these spaces.

The x, y chromaticity diagram. Variations derived from it, and the equations that define it, provide a basis 
for much of the literature that describes color image quality today. It is designed to facilitate description of 
small color differences such as an original and a reproduced color or two different reproductions of the same 
color. Examples of the differences between possible colors at a given lightness formed in two different media, 
a printer and monitor, are shown (adapted from Adams, R.M.; Weisberg, J.B. The GATF Practical Guide to Color 
Management; GATF Press, Graphic Arts Technical Foundation: Pittsburgh, PA, 2000, which cites data from X-Rite 
Inc). A more precise chromaticity diagram is shown in Figure 3.46.

In practical terms, results where ΔEab
∗= 1 represent approximately one just noticeable 
visual difference (see Section 3.8). However, the residual nonlinearity of the CIELAB chro­
maticity diagram, the remarkable adaptability of the human eye to many other visual factors, 
and the effect of experience require situation-specific experiments. Only such experiments 
can determine rigorous tolerance limits and specifications. Color appearance models that 
account for many such dependencies and nonlinearities have been developed.4,76 Attempts 
to standardize the methodology have been developed by CIE TC1-34 as CIECAM97s and 
proposed CIECAM02. (See Appendix A of Reference 4).
For readers not familiar with conventional graphic arts, printing and photographic anal­
ysis, densitometers are widely used to characterize those imaging systems. They measure 
transmission or reflection density, D,
	
Df = Log10(1/Rf)	
(3.9)
where Rf = Y/Yref from the above equations. It is called the reflectance (or transmittance for 
films and filters) factor and may be expressed as a % or decimal. The subscript “f” indicates 
that there are many factors such as light source optical geometries and filters that need to be 
specified. The “ref” indicates the measurement of Y for a white reference, one of the many 
factors. Since many tests and test targets used to evaluate scanners and digital cameras are 
derived from these disciplines, it is useful to examine the relationship between density, 
L*, and reflectance as in Figure 3.19. It is seen that to a first approximation (within .05L*) a

straight line approximates the density–L* relationship to a density of about 1.2 which is a 
useful range for many image quality measurements, representing the eye’s response better 
than the reflectance factor which is only approximately linear to density of 0.5. An abridged 
conversion table listing the corresponding values is given in the appendix as Table 3.8.
Another very important color description tool is the Munsell system in which painted 
paper chips of different colors have been arranged in a three-dimensional cylindrical coor­
dinate system. The vertical axis represents value (akin to lightness), the radius represents 
chroma, and the angular position around the perimeter is called hue. These have been care­
fully standardized and are very popular as color references.76
3.3  PRACTICAL CONSIDERATIONS
Several overall systems design issues are of some practical concern, including the choice of 
scan frequency as well as motion errors and other nonuniformities. They will be addressed 
here in fairly general terms.
3.3.1  Scan Frequency Effects
As digital imaging evolved in the previous decade, it had generally been thought that the 
spatial frequency, in raster lines or pixels per inch, which is used either to create the output 
print or to capture the input document, is a major determinant of image quality. Today 
there is a huge range of scan frequencies emanating from a huge range of products and 
applications from low-end digital cameras and fax machines, through office scanners and 
copiers, to high-end graphic arts scanners, all used with a plethora of software and hard­
ware image processing systems that enlarge and reduce and interpolate the originally cap­
tured pixel spacings to something else. Then, other systems with yet additional processing 
and imaging affects are employed to render the image prior to the human reacting to the 
quality. It is only at this point in the process, where all the signal and noise effects roll up 
that the underlying principles from other parts of this chapter can be used to quantify 
overall image quality. Needless to say, scan frequency or pixel density is only one of these 
effects, and to assert it is the dominant effect is questionable in all but the most restrictive 
of circumstances. Yet it is an important factor and many type A shortcut experiments have 
attempted to address the connection between the technology variable of pixel density and 
various dimensions of overall image quality.
If a scanned imaging system is designed so that the input scanning is not aliased and the 
output reconstruction faithfully prints all of the information presented to it, then the scan 
frequency tends to determine the blur, which largely controls the overall image quality in 
the system. This is frequently not the case, and, as a result, scan frequency is not a unique 
determinant of image quality. In general, however, real systems have a spread function or 
blur that is roughly equivalent to the sample spacing, meaning they are somewhat aliased 
and that blur correlates with spacing. However, it is possible to have a large spot and much 
smaller spaces (i.e., unaliased), or vice versa (very aliased). The careful optimization of 
the other factors at a given scan frequency may have a great deal more influence on the 
information capacity of any electronic imaging system and therefore on the image-quality 
performance than does scan frequency itself. To a certain extent, gray information can be 
readily exchanged for scan frequency. We shall subsequently explore this further when 
dealing with the subject of information content of an imaging system.

Image Quality for Scanning and Digital Imaging Systems 
167
In the spirit of taking a snapshot of this huge and complex subject, Figure 3.20 summa­
rizes three types of practical findings, two about major applications of scanned or digital 
images, namely digital photography and graphic arts–digital reprographics, and one sim­
plification of human perception. The curves in the lower graph (solid dots) show results of 
two customer acceptability experiments with digital photography, varying camera resolu­
tion and printing on 8 bpp contone printers (Al from Reference 77, A2 from Reference 78). 
Experiments on digital reprographics are shown by the curves with the open symbols, 
which suggest acceptable enlargement factors for input documents scanned at various 
resolutions and printed at various output screen resolutions. Finally we can put this in 
perspective by noting, as triangles along the frequency axis, the resolution limitations of 
the HVS at normal and close inspection viewing distances using modest 6% and very sen­
sitive 1% contrast detection thresholds. Returning to Figure 3.3, both applications are type 
A methods, while the HVS limits were inferred from visual algorithms.
A fairly general practice is to design aliased systems in order to achieve the least blur 
for a given scan frequency. Therefore, another major effect of scan frequency concerns the 
interaction between periodic structures in the input and the scanning frequency of the sys­
tem that is recording the input information. These two interfere, producing beat ­patterns

at sum and difference frequencies leading to the general subject of moiré phenomena. 
Hence, small changes in scan frequency can have a large effect on moiré.
One of the major considerations in selecting output scan frequency is the number of gray 
levels required from a given halftone screen. Recall the discussion of Figure 3.15 dot matri­
ces from 4 × 4 to 12 × 12 are shown in Table 3.1 at a range of printing frequencies from 200 to 
1200 raster lines per inch (7.87–47.2 raster lines/mm). For example, a 10 × 10 matrix of thresh­
olds (on top row) can be used to generate a 51 gray level, 45° angle screen (two shifted 5 × 10 
submatrices) as in Figure 3.15 but with different thresholds in each. Its screen frequencies 
are shown in the ninth column at the eight different printer scan frequencies and varies 
from 28 to 170 halftone dots/inch. Also indicated in the table between the bold lines is the 
approximate useful range for the visual system. The range starts at a lower limit of approx. 
65 dots/in (2.56 dots/mm) halftone screen, formerly found in newspapers. This results in 
noticeably coarse halftones and has recently moved into the range of 85 dots/in (3.35 dots/
mm) to 110 dots/in (4.33 dots/mm) in modern newspapers. The upper bound represents a

Entries are given in halftone dots/inch measured along the primary angle (row 2) of the halftone pattern. Dot

Q2 = Q3; (B) conventional 90° halftone where Q1 = Q2 = Q3 = Q4. Expansions of the number of halftone gray 
levels show three new types: (C) = Type A except Q3 and Q4 thresholds are set at halfway between those in Q1 
and Q2 (45° double dot), (D) where Q1 = Q4, but Q2 and Q3 thresholds are set halfway between those in Q1 (90° 
double dot); (E) where Q1 through Q4 thresholds are each set to generate intermediate levels among each other 
(90° quad dot). The number of gray values includes one level for white.

materials limit of around 175 dots/in (6.89 dots/mm), which is a practical limit for many 
lithographic processes. The number of gray levels is shown in the third, fourth, and fifth 
rows. Conventional dots are single centered like Figure 3.15. Increased number of gray lev­
els for double dots is shown as the “expanded by 2×” row and quad dots (four centers) by 
the row labeled as “expanded by 4×” are indicated by the row. This table assumes that the 
pixels are binary in nature. If a partially gray or high addressability output imaging system 
is employed then the number of levels in the table must be multiplied by the number of 
gray levels or subpixels per pixel appropriate to the technology. The use of these techniques 
and supercells to expand the gray level resolution has increased in recent years as real time 
microprocessing has enabled reasonable speed and memory for such approaches.
3.3.2  Placement Errors or Motion Defects
Since the basic mode of operation for most scanning systems is to move or scan rapidly in 
one direction and slowly in the other, there is always the possibility of an error in motion 
or other effect that results in locating pixels in places other than those intended. Figure 3.21 
shows several examples of periodic raster separation errors, including both a sinusoidal and 
a sawtooth distribution of the error. These are illustrated at 300 raster lines/in (11.8 lines/
mm) with ±10 through ±40 μm (±0.4 through ±1.6 mils) of spacing error, which refers to the 
local raster line spacing and not to the error in absolute placement accuracy. Error frequen­
cies of 0.33 cycles/mm (8.4 cycles/in) and 0.1 cycles/mm (2.5 cycles/in) are illustrated.
For input scanners, which convert an analog signal to a digital one, the error takes the form 
of a change in the sampling of the analog document. Since sampling makes many mistakes,

the sampling errors due to motion nonuniformity are most visible in situations where the 
intrinsic sampling error is made to appear repeatable or uniform, and the motion error, 
therefore, appears as an irregular change to an otherwise uniform pattern. Long angled 
lines that are parallel to each other provide such a condition because each line has a regular 
periodic phase error associated with it, and a motion error would appear as a change to this 
regular pattern. Halftones that produce moiré are another example, except that the moiré 
pattern is itself usually objectionable so that a change in it is not often significant.
In patterns with random phase errors such as text, the detection of motion errors is more 
difficult. Effects that are large enough to cause a two-pixel error would be perceived very 
easily; however, effects that produce less than one-pixel error on average would tend to 
increase the phase errors and noise in the image generally and would therefore be per­
ceived on a statistical basis. Many identical patterns repeated throughout a document 
would provide the opportunity to see the smaller errors as being correlated along the 
length of the given raster line that has been erroneously displaced, and would therefore 
increase the probability of seeing the small errors.
Motion errors in an output scanner that writes on some form of image-recording material 
can produce several kinds of defects. In Table 3.2, several attributes of the different types of 
raster distortion observables are shown. The first row in the matrix describes the general 
kind of error, that is, whether it is predominantly a pixel placement error or predominantly 
a developable exposure effect or some combination of the two. The second row is a brief 
word description or name of the effect that appears on the print. The third row describes 
the spatial frequency region in cycles/mm in which this type of error tends to occur. The 
next row indicates whether the effect is best described and modeled as one-dimensional or 
two-dimensional. Finally, a graphical representation of an image with the specific defect is 
shown in the top row, while the same image appears in the bottom row without the defect.
The first of the columns on the left is meant to show that if the frequency of the error is 
low enough then the effect is to change the local magnification. A pattern or some form of 
texture that should appear to have uniform spacings would appear to have nonuniform 
spacings and possibly the magnification of one part of the image would be different from 
that of another. The second column is the same type of effect except the frequency is much 
higher, being around 1 cycle/mm (25 cycle/in). This effect can then change the shape of a 
character, particularly one with angled lines in it, as demonstrated by the letter Y.
Moving to the three right-hand columns, which are labeled as developable exposure 
effects, we have three distinctly different frequency bands. The nature and severity of 
these effects depend in part on whether we are using a “write white” or “write black” 
recording system and on the contrast or gradient of the recording material. The first of 
these effects is labeled as structured background. When the separation between raster 
lines increases and decreases, the exposure in the region between the raster lines where 
the Gaussian profile writing beams overlap increases or decreases with the change. This 
gives an overall increase or decrease in exposure, with an extra large increase or decrease 
in the overlap region. Since many documents that are being created with a laser beam 
scanner have relatively uniform areas, this change in exposure in local areas gives rise to 
nonuniformities in the appearance in the output image.
In laser printers, for example, the text is generally presented against a uniform white 
background. In a positive “write white” electrophotographic process, such as is used in 
many large xerographic printers, this background is ideally composed of a distribution of 
uniformly spaced raster lines that expose the photoreceptor so that it discharges to a level 
where it is no longer developable. As the spacing between the raster lines increases, the 
exposure between them decreases to a point where it no longer adequately discharges the

photoreceptor, thereby enabling some weak development fields to attract toner and pro­
duce faint lines on a page of output copy. For this reason among others, some laser print­
ers use a reversal or negative “write black” form of electrophotography in which black (no 
light) output results in a white image. Therefore, white background does not show any 
variation due to exposure defects, but solid dark patches often do.
The allowable amplitude for these exposure variations can be derived from minimum 
visually perceivable modulation values and the gradient of the image-recording process.79,80 
In the spatial frequency region near 0.5 cycles/mm (13 cycles/in), where the eye has its 
peak response at normal viewing distance, an exposure modulation of 0.004–0.001 ΔE/E 
has been shown to be a reasonable goal for a color photographic system with tonal repro­
duction density gradients of 1–4.81
If the frequency of the perturbation is of the order 1–8 cycles/mm (25–200 cycles/in), and 
especially if the edges of the characters are slightly blurred, it is possible for the nonuni­
form raster pattern to change the exposure in the partially exposed blurred region around 
the characters. As a result, nonuniform development appears on the edge and the rag­
gedness increases as shown by the jagged appearance of the wavy lines in column 7. The 
effects are noticeable because of the excursions produced by the changes in exposure from 
the separated raster lines at the edges of even a single isolated character. The effect is all 
the more noticeable in this case because the darkened raster lines growing from each side 
of the white space finally merge in a few places. The illustration here, of course, is a highly 
magnified version of just a few dozen raster lines and the image contained within them.
In the last column we see small high-frequency perturbations on the edge, which would 
make the edge appear less sharp. Notice that structured background is largely a one-
dimensional problem, just dealing with the separation of the raster lines, while character 
distortion, ragged or structured edges, and unsharp images are two-dimensional effects 
showing up dramatically on angled lines and fine detail. In many cases the latter require 
two dimensions to describe the size of the effect and its visual appearance.
Visually apparent darkness for lines in alphanumeric character printing can be approxi­
mately described as the product of the maximum density of the lines in the character times 
their widths. It is a well-known fact in many high-contrast imaging situations that exposure 
changes lead to line width changes. If the separation between two raster lines is increased, 
the average exposure in that region decreases and the overall density in a write white system 
increases. Thus, two main effects operate to change the line darkness. First, the raster informa­
tion carrying the description of the width of the line separates, writing an actually wider pat­
tern. Secondly, the exposure level decreases, causing a further growth in the line width and to 
some extent causing greater development, that is, more density. The inverse is true in regions 
where the raster lines become closer together. Exposure increases and linewidth decreases.
If these effects occur between different strokes within a character or between nearby 
characters, the overall effect is a change in the local darkness of text. The eye is generally 
very sensitive to differences of line darkness within a few characters of each other and 
even within several inches of each other. This means that the spatial frequency range over 
which this combination of stretching and exposure effect can create visual differences is 
very large, hence the range of 0.005–2 cycles/mm (0.127–50 cycles/in). Frequencies listed in 
Table 3.2 cover a wide range of effects, also including some variation of viewing distance. 
They are not intended as hard boundaries but rather to indicate approximate ranges.
Halftone nonuniformity follows from the same general description given for line dark­
ness nonuniformity except that we are now dealing with dots. The basic effect, however, 
must occur in such a way as to affect the overall appearance of darkness of the small 
region of an otherwise uniform image. A halftone works on the principle of changing a

certain fractional area coverage of the halftone cell. If the spatial frequency range of this 
nonuniformity is sufficiently low, then the cell size changes at the same rate that the width 
of the dark dot within the cell changes. Therefore the overall effect is to have no change in 
the percent area coverage and only a very small change in the spacing between the dots. 
Hence, the region of a few tenths to several cycles/mm (several to tens of cycles/in) is the 
domain for this artifact. It appears as stripes in the halftone image.
The allowable levels for the effects of pixel placement errors on spacing nonuniformity 
and character distortion depend to a large extent upon the application. In addition to 
application sensitivity, the effects that are developable or partially developable are highly 
dependent upon the shape of the profile of the writing spot and upon amplification or 
attenuation in the marking system that is responding to the effects. Marking systems also 
tend to blur out the effects and add noise, masking them to a certain extent.
3.3.3  Other Nonuniformities
There are several other important sources of nonuniformity in a raster scanning system. 
First, there is a pixel-to-pixel or raster-to-raster line nonuniformity of either response in 
the case of an input scanner or output exposure in the case of an output scanner. These 
generally appear as streaks in an image when the recording or display medium is sensitive 
to exposure variations. These, for example, would be light or dark streaks in a printed half­
tone or darker and lighter streaks in a gray recorded image from an input scanner looking 
at a uniform area of an input document. A common example of this problem in a rotating 
polygon output scanner is the effect of facet-to-facet reflectivity variations in the polygonal 
mirror itself. The exposure tolerances described for motion errors above also apply here.
Another form of nonuniformity is sometimes referred to as jitter and occurs when the 
raster synchronization from one raster line to another tends to fail. In these cases a line 
drawn parallel to the slow scan direction appears to oscillate or jump in the direction of 
the fast scan. These effects, if large, are extremely objectionable. They will manifest them­
selves as raggedness effects or as unusual structural effects in the image, depending upon 
the document, the application, and the magnitude and spatial frequency of the effect.
3.3.3.1  Perception of Periodic Nonuniformities in Color Separation Images
Research on the visibility of periodic variations in the lightness of 30% halftone tints of 
cyan, magenta, yellow, and black color image separations printed on paper substrates 
has been translated into a series of guidelines for a specification for a high-quality color 
print engine.82 (Figure 3.22). They were chosen to be slightly above the onset of visibility. 
Specifically they are set at {[1/3] × [(2 × “visible but subtle threshold”) + (“obvious thresh­
old”)]} and adjusted for a wider range of viewing distances and angles than during the 
experiments, which were at 38–45 cm. These guidelines are given in terms of colorimetric 
lightness units on the output prints. Visibility specifications must ultimately be translated 
into engineering parameters. We have selected the traditional CIE L*a*b* metrics version 
for illustration. These also tend to shows the smallest, most demanding ∆Es. Guidelines 
developed in terms of ∆E for other color difference metrics (CMC 2:1 and CIE-94) have also 
been developed,82 and show different visual magnitudes, by as much as a factor of 2.
To translate these into a guidelines for the approximate optical scanner exposure varia­
tion, the ∆E values in this graph must be divided by the slope of the system response curve, 
in terms of ∆E/∆exposure, for the color separation of interest. Exposure, H, is the general 
variable of interest since it is the integrated effect of intensity and time variations, both

of which can result from the scanner errors discussed in the pages above. The system 
response would be approximated by the cascaded (multiplied) slopes of the responses 
of all the intermediate imaging systems between the scanner and the resulting imaging 
media assuming the small signal theory approximation to linearity of the cascaded sys­
tems. In the particular case where a system is positive working and linear such that, ΔR = 
ΔH, then taking the derivative of Equation 3.5 gives
	
ΔE = ΔL*.	
(3.10)
For Y/ Yn = R = 0.70. R and H are decimal output reflectance and normalized exposure val­
ues respectively (i.e., both full scale of 1 and a minimum of zero) R = 0.70 is the reflectance 
for a 30% halftone used above. For ΔE = 0.2 this yields ΔR = 0.0041 which also = ΔH, indeed 
a very small exposure value yielding visible errors.
Specific relationships for exposure and reflectance, and for any of the other colorimet­
ric units described in this research should be developed for each real system. The linear 
gain = 1.0 assumption shown here should not be taken for granted. The reader is also 
reminded that these results are for purely sinusoidal errors of a single frequency and a sin­
gle color and that actual nonuniformities occur in many complex spatial and color forms.

sampled images. Originally this was explored as analog sampled images in television, 
most notably by Schade83,84 in military and in early display technology.85 As computer 
and digital electronics technology grew, this evolved into the general subject of evaluat­
ing digital sampled image acquisition systems, which include various cameras and input 
scanners. Modern scanners and cameras are different only in that a scanner moves the 
imaging element to create sampling in one direction while the camera imaging element is 
static, electronically sampling a two-dimensional array sensor in both dimensions. This 
topic can be divided into two areas. The first concerns scanners and cameras that gener­
ate output signals with a large number of levels (e.g., 256), where general imaging science 
using linear analysis applies.13 The second deals with those systems that generate binary 
output, where the signal is either on or off (i.e., is extremely nonlinear) and more special­
ized methods apply.86 These are discussed in Section 3.5.
In recent years, the advent of digital cameras and the plethora of office, home, and pro­
fessional scanners have promoted wide interest in the subject of characterizing devices 
and systems that produce digital images. Also, several commercially available image 
analysis packages have been developed for general image analysis, many using scanners 
or digital cameras, often attached to microscopes or other optical image magnification 
systems. Components of these packages and the associated technical literature specifically 
address scanner analysis or calibration.87–89 A variety of standards activities have evolved 
in this area.90–93 Additional related information is suggested by the literature on evaluating 
microdensitometers.94,95 These systems are a special form of scanners in which the sensor 
has a single aperture of variable shape. Much of this work relates to transmitted light scan­
ners but reflection systems have also been studied.96 Methods for evaluating digital cam­
eras and commercially available scanners for specific applications have been described by 
many authors.77,93,97
3.4.1  Tone Reproduction and Large Area Systems Response
Unlike many other imaging systems, where logarithmic response (e.g., optical density) 
is commonly used, the tonal rendition characteristics of input scanners are most often 
described by the relationship between the output signal (gray) level and the input reflec­
tance or brightness. This is because most electronic imaging systems respond linearly to 
intensity and therefore to reflectance. Three such relationships are shown in Figure 3.23. In 
general these curves can be described by two parameters, the offset, O, against the output 
gray level axis and the gain of the system Γ, which is defined in the equation in Figure 3.23. 
Here g is the output gray level, and R is the relative reflectance factor. If there is any offset, 
then the system is not truly linear despite the fact that the relationship between reflectance 
and gray level may follow a straight-line relationship. This line must go through the origin 
to make the system linear.
Often the maximum reflectance of a document will be far less than the 1.0 (100%) shown 
here. Furthermore, the lowest signal may be significantly higher than 1% or 2% and may 
frequently reach as much as 10% reflectance. In order to have the maximum number of gray 
levels available for each image, some scanners offer an option of performing a histogram 
analysis of the reflectances of the input document on a pixel-by-pixel or less frequently 
sampled basis. The distribution is then examined to find its upper and lower limits. Some 
appropriate safety factor is provided, and new offset and gain factors are computed. These 
are applied to stretch out the response to cover as many of the total (256 here) output levels 
as possible with the information contained between the maximum and minimum reflec­
tances of the document.

176 
Handbook of Optical and Laser Scanning
Other scanners may have a full gray-scale capability from 4 to 12 bits (16–4096 levels). 
In Figure 3.23, curve C is linear, that is, no offset and a straight-line response up to a reflec­
tance of 1.0 (100%), in this case yielding 128 gray levels. Curve A would represent a more typ­
ical general purpose gray response for a scanner while curve B represents a curve adjusted 
to handle a specific input document whose minimum reflectance was 0.13 and whose maxi­
mum reflectance was 0.65. Observe that neither of these curves is linear. This becomes very 
important for the subsequent forms of analysis in which the nonlinear response must be 
linearized before the other measurement methods can be applied properly. This is accom­
plished by converting the output units back to input units via the response function.
In a digital scanner the sensors themselves are fairly linear as can be seen in Figure 3.24 
which plots exposure in linear units (lux-s) versus output in millivolts (mV). The response is 
strictly linear from 0 to 2.2 lux-s and then begins to roll over as it saturates. Notice the difference 
between the “linear saturation exposure” and the “saturation exposure” which is a graphical 
construct projecting the linear part of the curve to the maximum signal. It is often observed 
that digital sensors are linear but it can be seen from Figure 3.24 that this is only true for most 
but not all of the response curve. The scanner or camera designer is free to use as much or as 
little of the nonlinear high end of the curve as he desires. For digital cameras the indicated 
standard exposure differs by camera specifications but is usually in the linear region
It is also possible to arrange the electronics in the video processing circuit so that equal 
steps in exposure do not generate equal steps in electronic or digital response, but rather 
are appropriately spaced steps in some units that are more significant, either visually or in 
terms of materials properties. A logarithmic A/D converter is sometimes used to create a 
signal proportional to the logarithm of the reflectance or to the logarithm of the reciprocal 
reflectance (which is the same as “density”). Some scanners for graphic arts applications 
function in this manner. Another common conversion is making the signal proportional to 
L*. Both of these require a larger number of levels to start with than what is output. These 
systems are highly nonlinear, but may work well with a limited number of gray levels, for 
example with 8 bits (256 levels) rather than the 10 or 12 bits as discussed earlier.
Many input scanners operate with a built-in calibration system that functions on a pixel-
by-pixel basis. In such a system, for example, a particular sensor element that has greater

responsivity than others may be attenuated or amplified by adjusting either the gain or 
the offset of the system or both. This would ensure that all photosites (individual sensor 
elements) respond equally to some particular calibrated input, often, as is common with 
most light measuring devices such as photometers and densitometers, using both a light 
and dark reflectance reference (e.g., a white and black strip of paint).
It is possible in many systems for the sensor to be significantly lower or higher in respon­
sivity in one place than another. As an example, a maximum responsivity sensor may per­
form as shown in curve A while a less sensitive photosite may have the response shown in 
curve C. If curve C was captured with the same A/D converter at the same settings (as is 
often the case in high-speed integrated circuits), the maximum signal range it contains has 
only 120 gray levels. A digital multiplier can operate upon this to effectively double each 
gray level, thereby increasing the magnitude of the scale to 220 or 240, depending upon 
how it handles the offset. Note that if some of the elements of a one-dimensional sensor 
responded as curve C, others as A, with the rest in between, then this system would exhibit 
a kind of one-dimensional granularity or nonuniformity, whose pattern depends upon the 
frequency of occurrence of each sensor type. This introduces a quantization error varying 
spatially in one-pixel-wide strips, and ranging, for this example, from strips with only 120 
steps to others with 240 steps, yet covering the same distribution of output tones.
An ideal method for measuring tone reproduction is to scan an original whose reflec­
tance varies smoothly and continuously from near 0% to near 100%, or at least to the light­
est “white” that one expects the system to encounter. The reflectance is evaluated as a 
function of position, and the gray value from the scanner is measured at every position 
where it changes. Then the output of the system can be paired with the input reflectance at 
every location and a map drawn to relate each gray response value to its associated input 
reflectance. A curve like Figure 3.23 can then be drawn for each photosite and for various 
statistical distributions across many photosites.

Handbook of Optical and Laser Scanning
The classic concepts of quality in tone reproduction generally extend to processes and 
devices beyond the capture device. Hence the idea of quality for a scanner involves how 
well it integrates into an overall system that would include a printer or display. This inte­
gration is facilitated by image processing, both hardwired in the scanner and through 
off-line software systems. The graphical construction of a multi quadrant “Jones Plot” has 
often been used in photography to characterize how a film integrates with camera/optics, 
film processing, an enlarger and printing paper and even the visual system.60,61 Similar 
systems plots can be constructed for the digital system starting either with the camera or 
the scanner. One such example, using representative system data is shown in Figure 3.25.
Starting at the axis labeled “original density” one creates four quadrants in a clockwise 
progression starting with Quadrant 1 (lower right) as a plot of digital output level (DOL) 
versus input Density (or equivalent Log Exposure) for the scanner or camera in question. 
This is a type of OECF (Optoelectronic Conversion Function) Curve.65 In this illustration 
Density of the original target is plotted increasing to the left (Log exposure would increase 
to the right) and DOL (some call this value digital count or gray value) increases toward

maps the same DOLs on y-axis to image processing digital output levels (DOLs on x-axis) The latter are also digital 
input levels in Q3 (upper left) for either a printer or display. Here printer digital input levels map to output printed 
density (y-axis). In Q4 (upper right) the resulting solid curve (follow the dashed arrow through all four quadrants 
to see the cascading) gives printed density (y-axis) compared to original test object’s density (x-axis). This is the

the top. A dashed line indicates a linear response that follows the actual curve down to 
the dark region where it begins to “tail up”, due largely to flare light. The fact that the log 
values of density in the bolder solid curve agree so well with the linear values of electronic 
output (DOLs) suggests that the on-board image processing in this scanner is creating a 
nonlinear response (for the linear sensors as noted above) in order to better fit some out­
put needs of printing or viewing. This would be typical of some digital cameras as well 
as some scanners where off-line image processing was expected. The lighter dotted line 
represents the output of a typical scanner integrated with the printer shown in Quadrant 
3, a so-called all-in-one system or a digital copier.
In many such evaluations two of the other three quadrants are specified and the goal is 
to derive the missing curve. Consider that the rendering device (Quadrant 3 clockwise) is a 
printer with a fixed density response to a given array of input DOLs. Assume that the it is 
desired that reproduction (Quadrant 4) be a linear relationship between density of the orig­
inal and that of the print, even though the maximum densities do not match. This leaves the 
image processing (Quadrant 2) to be determined. A linear, one for one, image processing 
between input from the first scanner and output DOLs (dashed curve) would result in a 
very light print with a somewhat curved density reproduction relationship. The solid curve 
in Quadrant 2 (Image Processing) results in the desired linear density relationship in Q4.
The second scanner curve (dotted) is less linear but includes on-board image processing 
which predistorts the output to compensate for the highly curved printer density response 
curve. This scanner response directly provides another linear final tone reproduction in 
Quadrant 4, although with slightly lower maximum density. In the Jones Plot this result 
uses the dashed “no image processing” curve in Quadrant 2 since off-line image process­
ing is not possible in an all-in-one (copier) system. This scanner curve is the same one used 
in Figure 3.26.
Most scanners operate with sufficiently small detector sites or sensor areas that they 
respond to input granularity. Thus, a single pixel or single photosite measurement will not

suffice to get a solid area response to a so-called uniform input. Some degree of averaging 
across pixels is required, depending upon the granularity and noise levels of the input test 
document and the electronic system.
The use of a conventional step tablet or a collection of gray patches, where there are sev­
eral discrete density levels, provides an approximation to this analysis but does not allow 
the study of every one of the discrete output gray levels. For a typical step tablet with 
approximately 20 steps 0.10 reflection density, half of the gray values are measured by only 
4 steps, 0, 0.1, 0.2 and 0.3 density (or 50% reflectance). Thus a smoothly varying density 
wedge is more appropriate for the technical evaluation of an electronic input scanner.
However, suitable wedges are difficult to fabricate repeatably and the use of uniform 
patches of several discrete densities is common in many operations. See, for example, 
Reference 97 and the ISO standard targets in Figures 3.48b, 3.49 or the IEEE target in Figure 
3.50b (see middle of pattern). Nonetheless, wedges are available (see for example the top of 
Figure 3.50b), and are essential to accurately evaluate binary scanning (see Section 3.5.2).
Returning to the large area tonal response of the scanner itself, it is tempting to describe 
it as the linear equation for the sensor itself but the fact is that most scanners today have 
some built-in image processing associated with them and it is more practical to use a curve. 
To compensate for some common printer and display response, scanner’s tone response 
neglecting flare can often be mapped as
	
DOL = Hr1/𝛾	
(3.11)
where Hr is the relative exposure from the input and γ (gamma) is a constant designed to 
compensate for the exponential-shaped curves often found in output printers or displays. 
Values of 1.8, 2.2 are examples for Mac and PC monitors and 3 to emulate L* but a general 
purpose scanner may desire to satisfy all these conditions with some hybrid and a few 
other terms. Results for a recent desktop scanner are shown in Figure 3.26—an x versus y 
inverted type of OECF21 curve—using the resulting digital output levels as the x-axis and 
various characterizations of the input as the y-axis to deduce the vendors image process­
ing. The system is not linear in reflectance but is approximately linear in either L* or γ = 2. 
Note γ = 2 is halfway between the Mac and PC standards.
Setting the maximum point equal to 100% input reflectance is often a waste of gray levels 
since there are no documents whose real reflectance is 100%. A value somewhere between 
70% and 90% would be more representative of the upper end of the range of real docu­
ments. Some systems adjust automatically to the input target and are therefore difficult to 
evaluate. They are highly nonlinear in a way that is difficult to compensate. See Gonzalez 
and Wintz98 for an early discussion of automatic threshold or gray scale adjustment and 
Hubel93 for more recent comments on this subject as it relates to color image quality in dig­
ital cameras. Most amateur and some professional digital cameras fall into this automatic 
domain93 as do many scanners. A system that finds this point automatically is optimized 
for each input differently and is therefore difficult to evaluate in a general sense.
An offset in the positive direction can be caused either by an electronic shift or by stray 
optical energy in the system (as shown in Q1 of Figure 3.25). If the electronic offset has 
been set equal to zero with all light blocked from the sensor, then any offset measured 
from an image can be attributed to optical energy. Typical values for flare light, the stray 
light coming through the lens, would range from just under 1% to 5% or more of full 
scale.96 While offset from uniform stray light can be adjusted out electronically, signals 
from flare light are document dependent, showing up as errors in a dark region only when 
it is surrounded by a large field of white on the document. Therefore, correction for this

measured effect in the particular case of an analytical measurement with a gray wedge or 
a step tablet surrounded by a white field may produce a negative offset for black regions 
of the document that are surrounded by grays or dark colors. If, however, the source of 
stray light is from the illumination system, the optical cavity, or some other means that 
does not involve the document, then electronic correction is more appropriate. Methods 
for measuring the document-dependent contribution of flare have been suggested in the 
literature.96,97,99 Some involve procedures that vary the surround field from black to white 
while measuring targets of different widths;96 others use white surround with different 
density patches.97
A major point of confusion can occur in the testing of input scanners and many other opti­
cal systems that operate with a relatively confined space for the illumination system, docu­
ment platen, and recording lens. This can be thought of as a type of integrating cavity effect. 
In this situation, the document itself becomes an integral part of the illumination system, 
redirecting light back into the lamp, reflectors, and other pieces of that system. The docu­
ment’s contribution to the energy in the illumination depends on its relative reflectance and 
on optical geometry effects relating to lamp placement, document scattering properties, and 
lens size and location. In effect the document acts like a position-dependent and nonlinear 
amplifier affecting the overall response of the system. One is likely to get different results if 
the size of the step tablet or gray wedge used to measure it changes or if the surround of the 
step tablet or gray wedge changes between two different measurements. It is best, therefore, 
to make a variety of measurements to find the range of responses for a given system. These 
effects can be anywhere from a few percent to perhaps as much as 20%, and the extent of the 
interacting distances on the document can be anywhere from a few millimeters to a few cen­
timeters (fraction of an inch to somewhat over one inch). Relatively little has been published 
on this effect because it is so design specific, but it is a recognized practical matter for mea­
surement and performance of input scanners. An electronic correction method exists.100,101

of the scanning element during one reading, electronic effects associated with the rise time 
of the circuit, the effective scanning aperture (sensor photo site) size, and various electro-
optical effects in the detection or reading out of the signal. The circuits that handle both the 
analog and the digital signals, including the A/D converter, may have some restrictive rise 
times and other frequency response effects that produce a one-dimensional blur.
To explore the analysis of these effects, refer back to Figure 3.5. A primary concept begins 
with a practical definition of an ideally narrow line object and the image of it. Imagine that 
the narrow line object profile shown at the top right of Figure 3.5a was steadily reduced 
in width until the only further change seen in the resulting image Figure 3.5b is that the 
height of the image peak changes but not the width of its spreading. This is a practical 
definition of an ideally narrow line source. Under these conditions we would say that the 
peak of the image on the right of Figure 3.5b was a profile of the line spread function for the 
imaging system. [It is also seen at higher sampling resolution in Figure 3.7b.]
To be completely rigorous about this definition of the line spread function, we would 
actually use a narrow white line rather than a black line. If the input represented a very 
fine point in two-dimensional space we would refer to its full two-dimensional image as 
a point spread function. This spreading is a direct representation of the blur in any point in 
the image and can be convolved with the matrix of all the pixels in the sampled image to 
create a representation of the blurred image. The line spread function is a one-dimensional 
form of the spreading and is usually more practical from a measurement perspective. In 
the case illustrated, the line spread function after quantization would be shown in Figure 
3.5c as the corresponding distribution of gray pixels.
There are several observations to be made about this illustration, which underscore some 
of the practical problems encountered in typical measurements. First, the quantized image 
in Figure 3.5c is highly asymmetric while the profile of the line shown in Figures 3.5a and 
b appears to be more symmetric. This results from sampling phase and requires that a 
measurement of the line spread function must be made, adjusting sampling phase in some 
manner (Figure 3.7b). This is especially important in the practical situation of evaluating 
a fixed sampling frequency scanner. Secondly, note the limited amount of information 
in any one phase. It can be seen that the smooth curve representing the narrow object in 
Figure 3.5b is only represented by three points in the sampled and quantized image.
The averaging of several phases would improve on this measurement, increasing both 
the intensity resolution and the spatial resolution of the measurement. One of the easiest 
ways to do this is to use a long narrow line and tip it slightly relative to the sampling grid 
so that different portions along its length represent different sampling phases. One can 
then collect a number of uniformly spaced sampling phases, each being on a different scan 
line, while being sure to cover an integer number of complete cycles of sampling phase. 
One cycle is equivalent to a shift of one complete pixel. The results are then combined 
in an interleaved fashion, and a better estimate of the line spread function is obtained. 
(This is tantamount to increasing the sampling resolution, taking advantage of the one-
dimensional nature of the test pattern.) This is done by plotting the recorded intensity for 
each pixel located at its properly shifted absolute position relative to the location of the 
line. To visualize this consider the two-phase sampling shown in Figure 3.7b and c. There 
the resulting pixels from phase A could be interleaved with those from phase B to create a 
composite of twice the spatial resolution. Additional phases would further increase effec­
tive resolution.
In the absence of nonlinearities and nonuniformities, the individual line spread func­
tions associated with each of the effects in Table 3.3 can be mathematically convolved with 
each other to come up with an overall system line spread function.

3.4.2.1  MTF Approaches
For engineering analysis, use of convolutions and measurements of spread functions are 
often found to be difficult and cumbersome. The use of an optical transfer function (OTF) 
is considered to have many practical advantages from both the testing and theoretical 
points of view. The OTF is the Fourier transform of the line spread function. This function 
consists of a modulus to describe normalized signal contrast attenuation (or amplifica­
tion), and a phase to describe shift effects in location, both given as a function of spatial 
frequency. The signal is characterized as the modulation of the sinusoidal component at 
the indicated frequency. Therefore the contrast altering function is described as a modu­
lation transfer function (MTF). The value of OTF analysis is that all of the components in a 
linear system can be described by their OTFs, and these are multiplied together to obtain 
the overall system response. The method and theory of this type of analysis has been cov­
ered in many journal articles and reference books.13,47,78,102
Certain basic effects can be described in analytic form as MTFs and a few of these are 
indicated in Table 3.3 and illustrated in Section 3.9 in Figures 3.51–3.53, plotted in logarith­
mic form to facilitate graphical manipulation. Several photographic MTF curves are plot­
ted in Figure 3.55 to provide a reference both as a range of input signals for film scanners 
or a range of output filters that transform optical signals to permanently readable form. 
One may also consider using these with an enlargement factor for understanding input of 
photographic prints to a desktop or graphic arts scanner. (For example, a spatial frequency 
of 10 cycles/mm on an 8× enlarged print is derived from the 80 cycles/mm pattern on the 
film. Therefore the film MTF at 80 cycles/mm is an upper limit input signal for an 8 × 10 
in enlargement of a 35-mm film.) Other output MTFs would involve display devices such 
as monitors, projection systems, analog response ink systems, and xerographic systems. 
Obtaining the transform of the line spread function has many of the practical problems 
associated with measuring the line spread function itself plus the uncertainty of obtaining 
an accurate digital Fourier transform using a highly quantized input.
There are several commonly used methods for measuring the OTF. These include:
	
1.	Measuring images of narrow lines using appropriate compensation for finite 
widths.
	
2.	Directly measuring images of sinusoidal distributions of radiation.103,104
	
3.	Harmonic analysis of square-wave patterns.97,103,104
	
4.	Taking the derivative of the edge profile in the image of a very sharp input edge. 
This generates the line spread function, and then the Fourier transform is taken, 
taking care to normalize the results properly.13,92 (Table 3.9, ISO TC42, WG18 and 
Figures 3.48a and b)
	
5.	Spectral analysis of random input (e.g., noise) targets with nearly flat spatial fre­
quency spectrum.
It should also be mentioned at this point that for most characterizations of imaging sys­
tems the modulus, that is, the MTF, is more significant than the phase. The phase transfer 
function, however, may be important in some cases and can be tracked either by careful 
analysis of the relative location of target and image in a frequency-by-frequency method 
or by direct computation from the line spread function.
In general, these methods involve the use of input targets that are not perfect. They 
must have spatial frequency content that is very high. The frequency composition of the 
input target is characterized in terms of the modulus of the Fourier transform, Min(f), of 

184

its spatial radiance profile. The frequency decomposition of the output image is similarly 
characterized, yielding Mout(f). Dividing the output modulation by the input modulation 
yields the MTF as

The success of this depends upon the ability to characterize both the input and the output 
accurately.
A straightforward method to perform this input and output analysis involves imaging 
a target of periodic intensity variations and measuring the modulation on a frequency-by-
frequency basis. If the target is a set of pure sine waves of reflectance or transmittance, that 
is, each has no measurable harmonic content, and the input scanner is linear, then the 
frequency-by-frequency analysis is straightforward. Modulation of a sinusoidal distribu­
tion is defined as the difference between the maximum and minimum divided by their 
sum. The modulation is obtained directly, measuring the maximum and minimum output 
gray values g′, and the corresponding input reflectance (or transmittance or intensity) val­
ues, R, of Equation 3.17 for each frequency pattern. Expanding the numerator and denomi­
nator for Equation 3.16 and the case of sinusoidal patterns and linear systems yields

where the prime is used to denote gray response that has been corrected for any non­
linearity as described below.
Figures 3.27 and 3.28 show an example of this process. In Figure 3.27 we see the layout 
of a representative periodic square-wave test target (aR) and a sinusoidal test target (aL) 
which exhibits features of well-known patterns105 available today in a variety of forms (e.g., 
from Applied Image Reference 106). The periodic distributions of intensity (reflectance) 
are located in different blocks in the center of the pattern. Uniform reflectance patterns of 
various levels are placed in the top and bottom rows of the sinusoid to enable character­
izing the tone response. A similar arrangement of uniform blocks is used with the square 
waves but not shown here. This enables correcting for its nonlinearities should there be 
any. Parts (b) and (c) show enlargements of parts of the square-wave pattern selecting a 
lower and a higher frequency. Parts (f) and (g) are enlargements of a gray image display of 
the electronically captured image of the same parts of the test target. Parts (d), (e), (h), and 
(i) show profiles of the patterns immediately above them.
To calculate a MTF, the modulation of each pattern is measured. For sinusoidal input 
patterns, one can use Equation 3.17 directly, finding the average maximum and minimum 
for many scan lines for each separate frequency. These modulation ratios, plotted on a 
frequency-by-frequency basis, describe the MTF. For square-wave input, the input and 
output signals must be Fourier transformed into their spatial frequency representations 
and only the amplitudes of the fundamental frequencies used in Equation 3.17. Schade103 
offers a method to compute the MTF by measuring the modulations of images of each 
square wave directly (i.e., the square wave response) and then unfolding for assumed per­
fect input square-waves without taking the transforms.
From a practical standpoint it is important to tip the periodic patterns slightly as seen 
in parts (d) and (e) to cover the phase distributions as described above under the spread

function discussion. A new higher resolution image can be calculated by interleaving data 
points from the individual scan lines, each of which is phase shifted with respect to the 
sine or square wave.
Figure 3.28 shows several examples of linear and nonlinear response curves. It describes 
correcting the output of an MTF analysis (i.e., using g′ in Equation 3.17) for the case of 
nonlinearity with offset. Here the maximum and minimum values for the sine waves 
are unfolded through the response curve to arrive at minimum and maximum input

The figures on the right, (c), (e), (g), and (i) are from a higher frequency square wave. Enlargements of the test

play of the scanner output) are shown in parts (f) and (g). Profiles of each of these images are displayed beneath 
them in parts (d), (e), (h), and (i), respectively. Because these are square-wave test patterns, special analysis of 
these patterns is required to compensate for effects of harmonics as described in the text. The reader should 
ignore small moiré effects caused by the reproduction process used to print this illustration.

reflectances, that is, the linear variables. For a full profile analysis, as needed for a Fourier 
transform method, and to obtain corrected modulation, each output gray level must be 
modified by such an operation.
If the response curve for the system was one of those indicated as linear in Figure 3.28, 
then no correction is required. It is important to remember that while the scanner system 
response may obey a straight-line relationship between output gray level and the reflect­
ance, transmittance, or intensity of the input pattern, it may be offset due to either optical 
or electronic biases (e.g., flare light, electronic offset, etc.). This also represents a nonlinear­
ity and must be compensated.
As the frequency of interest begins to approach the sampling frequency in an aliased 
input scanning system, the presence of sampling moiré becomes a problem. This produces 
interference effects between the sampling frequency and the frequency of the test pattern. 
If the pattern is a square wave, this may be from the higher harmonics (e.g., 3×, 5× the fun­
damental). When modulation is computed from sampled image data using maxima and 
minima in Equation 3.17, errors may arise. There are no harmonics for the sinusoidal type 
of patterns, a distinct advantage of this approach.
See Figure 3.29 for an example of these phase effects on a representative MTF curve. It 
shows errors for test sine waves whose period is a submultiple of the sampling interval. 
Consider the case where the sinusoidal test pattern frequency is exactly one-half the sam­
pling frequency, that is, the Nyquist frequency. In this case, when the sampling grid lines 
up exactly with the successive peaks and valleys of the sine wave, we get a strong signal 
indicating the maximum modulation of the sine wave (point A). When the sampling grid 
lines up at the midpoint between each peak and valley of the sinusoidal image (phase 
shifted 90° relative to the first position), each data point will be the same, and no modula­
tion whatever results (point B). There is no right or wrong answer to the question of which 
phase represents the true sine-wave response, but the analog or highest value is often 
considered as the true MTF. Each phase may be considered as having its own ­sine-wave

response. Reporting the maximum and minimum frequency response and reporting some 
statistical average are both legitimate approaches, depending upon the intended use of the 
measurement. It is common practice to represent the average or maximum and the error 
range for the reported value.
The analog MTF, on the other hand, is only given as the maximum curve, representing 
the optical function before sampling. Therefore, the description of upper and lower phase 
boundaries for sine wave response shows the range of errors in the measurement of the 
MTF which one might get for a single measurement. This strongly suggests the need to 
use several phases to reduce error if the analog MTF is to be measured. Mathematically, 
phase errors may be thought of as a form of microscopic nonstationarity complicating the 
meaning of MTF for sampled images at a single phase. The use of information from several 
phases reduces this complication by enabling one to approximate the correct analog MTF 
that obeys the principle of stationarity.
In the case of a highly quantized system, meaning one having a relatively small number 
of gray levels, quantization effects become an important consideration in the design and 
testing of the input scanner. The graph in Figure 3.30 shows the limitation that quantiza­
tion step size, Eq, imposes on the measurement of the MTF using sine waves. The number 
of gray levels used in an MTF calculation can be maximized by increasing the contrast of 
the sinusoidal signal that is on the input test pattern. It can also be increased by repeated 
measurements in which some analog shifts in signal level are introduced to cause the 
quantization levels to appear in steps between the previous discrete digital levels and 
therefore at different points on the sinusoidal distributions. The latter could be accom­
plished by changing the light level or electronic gain.

It is also important to note that because the actual MTF can vary over the field of view, a 
given measurement may only apply to a small local region over which the MTF is constant. 
(This is sometimes called an isoplanatic patch or stationary region within the image.) To 
further improve the accuracy of this approach, one can numerically fit sinusoidal distribu­
tions to the data points collected from a measurement, using the amplitude of the resultant 
sine wave to determine the average modulation. Taking the Fourier transform of the data 
in the video profile may be thought of as performing this fit automatically. The properly 
normalized amplitude of the Fourier transform at the spatial frequency of interest would, 
in fact, be the average modulation of the sine wave that fits the video data best.
The approach involving the application of square-wave test patterns (as opposed to sinu­
soidal ones, which have intrinsic simplicity as an advantage) has been shown by Newell 
and Triplett104 to have significant practical advantages. They also show square-wave analy­
sis has excellent accuracy when all-important details are carefully considered, especially 
the sampling nature of the analysis and the noise and phase effects. Square-wave test 
patterns are commonly found in resolving power test targets and are much easier to fabri­
cate than sine waves, because the pattern exists as two states, foreground (e.g., black bars) 
and background (e.g., white bars). Two levels of gray bars may also be used depending on 
desired contrast. Fourier transform analysis and paying attention to the higher harmonics 
have been particularly effective.97,104 It has been shown that the general Discrete Fourier

Transform (DFT) algorithms where the length of the input can be altered is much better 
suited to MTF analysis than use of the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) where the required 
power of two sampling points are a limitation.
One successful practice104 included tipping the bar patterns to create a one pixel phase 
shift over eight scan lines and averaging over approximately 30 scan lines to reduce noise. 
The DFT was used and tuned to the precise frequency of the given bar pattern by chan­
ging the number of cycles of the square wave being sampled and using approximately 
1000 data points. An improvement in MTF accuracy of several percent was demonstrated 
using the DCT over the more common FFT.
It is generally advisable to measure the target’s actual harmonic content rather than to 
assume that it will display the theoretical harmonics of a perfect mathematical square 
wave. Likewise, other patterns of known spectral content can be calibrated and used. Edge 
analysis techniques are also popular.91,92,107 Using similar care such as a 5° slanted edge, 
a standardized algorithm, and specification on the edge quality, these achieve good accu­
racy too.
3.4.2.2  The Human Visual System’s Spatial Frequency Response
As a matter of practical interest, several spatial frequency response measurements of the 
HVS are shown in Figure 3.31. These provide a reference to compare to system MTFs. The 
work of several authors is included.108–114 The curves shown have all been normalized to 
100% at their respective peaks to provide a clearer comparison. Except for the various nor­
malizing factors, the ordinates are analogous to a modulation transfer factor of the type 
described by Equation 3.17. However, MTFs are applicable only to linear systems, which 
the human eye is not. The visual system is in fact thought to be composed of many inde­
pendent, frequency-selective channels,115,116 which, under certain circumstances, combine 
to give an overall response as shown in these curves. It will be noted that the response of 
the visual system has a peak (i.e., modulation amplification relative to lower frequencies) 
in the neighborhood of 6 cycles/degree (0.34 cycles/milliradian) or 1 cycle/mm (25 cycles/
in) at a standard viewing distance of 340 mm (13.4 inches). The variations among these 
curves reflect the experimental difficulties inherent in the measurement task and may also 
illustrate the fact that a nonlinear system such as human vision cannot be characterized 
by a unique MTF.117 For this reason such curves are called contrast sensitivity functions 
(CSFs) and not MTFs. For readers desiring a single curve, the luminance CSF reported 
by Fairchild4 is given in Section 3.9, Figure 3.56. While similar in shape to many curves 
in Figure 3.31, it displays a greater range of responses and also shows the red–green and 
blue–yellow chromatic CSFs.
3.4.2.3  Electronic Enhancement of MTFs: Sharpness Improvement
These visual frequency response curves suggest that the performance of an imaging sys­
tem could be improved if its frequency response could be increased at certain frequencies. 
It is not possible with most passive imaging systems to create amplification at selected 
frequencies. The use of electronic enhancement, however, can impart such an amplified 
response to the output of an electronic scanner. Amplification here is meant to imply a 
high-frequency response that is greater than the very low-frequency response or greater 
than unity (which is the most common response at the lowest frequencies). This can be 
done by convolving the digital image with a finite-impulse response (FIR) electronic filter 
that has negative sidelobes on opposite sides of a strong central peak. The details of FIR 

190

filter design are beyond the scope of this chapter, but the effects of two typical FIR filters 
on the system MTF are shown in Figure 3.32.
3.4.3  Noise Metrics
Noise in an input scanner, whether the scanner is binary or multilevel gray, comes in 
many forms (see Section 3.2.2). A brief outline of these can be found in Table 3.4. Various 
specialized methods are required in order to discriminate and optimize the measurement 
of each.
In this table we see that there are both fixed and time-varying types of noise. They may 
occur in either the fast or the slow scan direction and may either be additive noise sources 
or multiplicative noise sources. They may be either totally random or they may be struc­
tured. In terms of the spatial frequency content, the noise may be flat (white), that is, con­
stant at all frequencies to a limit, or it may contain dominant frequencies, in which case the 
noise is said to be colored. These noise sources may be either random or deterministic; in 
the latter case, there may be some structure imparted to the noise.
The sources of the noise can be in many different components of the overall system, 
depending upon the design of the scanner. Instances of these may include the sensor of

the radiation, or the electronics, which amplify and alter the electrical signal, including, 
for example, the A/D converter. Other noise sources may be motion errors, photon noise 
in low-light-level scanners, or noise from the illuminating lamp or laser. Sometimes the 
optical system, as in the case of a laser beam input scanner, may have instabilities that add 
noise. In many scanners there is a compensation mechanism to attempt to correct for fixed 
noise. This typically utilizes a uniformly reflecting or transmitting strip of one or more 
different densities parallel to the fast scan direction and located close to the input position

for the document. It is scanned, its reflectance(s) is memorized by the system, and it is then 
used to correct or calibrate either the amplifier gain or its offset or both.
Such a calibration system is, of course, subject to many forms of instabilities, quantiza­
tion errors, and other kinds of noise. Since most scanners deal with a digital signal in one 
form or another, quantization noise must also be considered.
In order to characterize noise in a gray output scanner, one needs to record the signal 
from a uniform input target. The most challenging task is finding a uniform target with 
noise so low that the output signal does not contain a large component due to the input 
or document noise. In many of these scanners, the system is acting much like a micro­
densitometer, which reacts to such input noise as the paper fibers or granularity in photo­
graphic, lithographic, or other apparently uniform samples.
The basic measurement of noise involves understanding the distribution of the signal 
variation. This involves collecting several thousand pixels of data and examining the 
histogram of their variation or the spatial frequency content of that variation. Under the 
simplifying assumptions that we are dealing with noise sources that are linear, random, 
additive, and flat (white), a typical noise measurement procedure would be to evaluate the 
following expression:

standard deviation recorded during the analysis; σο = the standard deviation of the noise 
in the input object (o) measured with an aperture that is identical to the pixel size; σm = the 
standard deviation of the noise due to measurement (m) error; and σq = the standard devi­
ation of the noise associated with the quantization (q) error for those systems that digitize 
the signal. This equation assumes that all of the noise sources are independent. Removing 
quantization noise is an issue of whether one wants to characterize the scanner with or 
without the quantization effects, since they may in fact be an important characteristic of a 
given scanner design. The fundamental quantization error118 is

where b = the number of bits to which the signal has been quantized.
The second and third terms in Equation 3.18 give the performance of the analog portion 
of the measurement. They would include the properties of the sensor amplification circuit 
and the A/D converter as well as any other component of the system that leads to the noise 
noted in the table above. The term s q
2 characterizes the digital nature of the scanner and, of 
course, would be omitted for an analog scanning system.
Equation 3.18 is useful when the noise in the system is relatively flat with respect to spatial 
frequency or when the shape of the spatial frequency properties of all of the subsystems is 
similar. If, however, one or more of the subsystems involved in the scanner is contributing 
noise that is highly colored, that is, has a strong signature with respect to spatial frequency, 
then the analysis needs to be extended into frequency space. This approach uses Wiener 
or power spectral analysis.47,119 Systems with filters of the type shown in Figure 3.32 would 
exhibit colored (spatial frequency dependent) noise. A detailed development of Wiener 
spectra is beyond the scope of this chapter. However, it is important here to realize its basic 

Image Quality for Scanning and Digital Imaging Systems

form. It is a particular normalization of the spatial frequency distribution of the square of 
the signal fluctuations. The signal is often in optical density (D), but may be in volts, cur­
rent, reflectance, and so on. The normalization involves the area of the detection aperture 
responsible for recording the fluctuations. Hence units of the Wiener spectrum are often 
[μm D]2 and can be [μm R]2. (See Reference 119; the latter units are more appropriate for 
scanners because they respond linearly to reflectance, or, more generally, to irradiance.)
3.5  EVALUATING BINARY, THRESHOLDED, 
SCANNED IMAGING SYSTEMS
3.5.1  Importance of Evaluating Binary Scanning
Many output scanners accept only binary signals, that is, on or off signals for each pixel or 
subpixel. This translates to only black or white pixels on rendering. A binary thresholded 
image may be generated directly by the scanner, or reduced to this state through image 
processing just prior to delivery to an output scanner. It may also be the degenerate state 
of inappropriate gray or dithered image processing in which signals are overamplified 
in a variety of ways, to look like thresholded images. Irrespective of how they are gener­
ated, binary thresholded renderings remain an important class of images today and often 
produce image characteristics that are surprising to the uninitiated. Understanding and 
quantifying this type of imaging become an important part of the evaluation of the overall 
input scanner to output scanner-printer system.
As noted earlier, there are two types of binary digital images, either thresholded or dith­
ered signals. To a first order, dithered systems (halftoned or error diffused) can be eval­
uated in a way similar to that used to evaluate full gray systems, with one simplifying 
assumption. The underlying concept is that, within the effective dither region over which 
a halftone dot is clustered or the error is diffused, the viewer does not notice the dither 
pattern. As a result, these systems are primarily evaluated using instruments and meth­
ods whose resolution is equal to or larger than the effective dither region and hence are 
confined largely to tone rendition and some forms of image noise. Extensive discussions 
of these measurement approaches are beyond the scope of this chapter. Many of the basic 
underlying principles are discussed in Section 3.5 of Chapter 3 of the earlier edition of this 
book and in 2.2.3 under halftone system response and detail rendition. Limited discussion 
follows here.
To understand and evaluate binary images, a few new concepts are explored and appro­
priate analytic methods developed.120
3.5.1.1  Angled Lines and Line Arrays
To adequately describe performance over a range of sampling phases, it is important that 
the image structures must be measured at a large number of sampling phases. In other 
words the evaluation is repeated several times with respect to the input pattern at positions 
predetermined to create images at different sampling phases. These may be produced by 
shifting the components by various fractions of a pixel. Tilting lines or rectilinear patterns 
by a few degrees generates a continuum of phases along the edge of the designated struc­
ture. Without tilting for example, a fine line may be imaged in one test as two-pixel wide, 

194 
Handbook of Optical and Laser Scanning
and on another random test and therefore at another sampling phase, it may be imaged as 
one-pixel wide.
3.5.2  General Principles of Threshold Imaging Tone 
Reproduction and Use of Gray Wedges
For binary system response, that is, binary tone reproduction, testing can best be accom­
plished by having smooth calibrated structures that allow finding the on–off binary tran­
sitions to a small fraction, say 1 part in 200, of an input characteristic like reflectance.
A calibrated gray wedge is useful. This device resembles a photographic step tablet 
except that it varies smoothly from a very low density to a very high density without steps. 
Ideally it would vary linearly in reflectance or transmittance as a function of distance, but 
the physical means for creating wedges often make them somewhat logarithmic. Accurate 
measurement of transmittance or reflectance versus distance from some reference mark on 
the wedge is used to calibrate the pattern, as shown in the graph in the top of Figure 3.33. 
Note that the picture at the bottom shows the image of a negative working system—that is, 
the maximum transmittance gives black and the minimum gives white.
The distance at which the wedge turns from black to white (or is 50% black and 50% 
white pixels for a noisy image) is measured for a given gray threshold and converted to a 
transmittance or reflectance) threshold.
3.5.2.1  Underlying Characteristic Curve and Noise
If one is trying to determine the underlying characteristic curve of the scanner, a series of 
specified transmittances or reflectances can be determined along the wedge. The digital

output gray level of the threshold setting that creates the black to white transition at each 
specified transmittance or reflectance is then plotted. This describes the underlying char­
acteristic curve of the binary system in output threshold gray level versus input trans­
mittance or reflectance and is a type of OECF (optoelectronic conversion function) curve 
(Reference 65).
Because of noise in the typical system, including noise on the input document, the loca­
tion along the length of the wedge where the image changes from white to black will not 
be a sharp straight line. Rather it will be a region of noise as shown in Figure 3.33. Typically 
the middle of this transition region (T2 + T1)/2 is identified as the transmittance or reflec­
tance at which an average threshold is set. A unit called Gray Wedge Noise = GWN = 
(T1 − T2) can be set here where T2 and T1 the transmittances at a fixed probability of finding 
a minimal or maximum response (such as 95% white or black).
3.5.3  Binary Imaging Metrics Relating to MTF and Blur
Given the on–off nature of a binary thresholded image, a linear approach such as MTF 
analysis does not work. To deal with this nonlinearity we can pose three specific types of 
questions about imaging performance: (1) Detectability: what is the smallest isolated detail 
that the system can detect? (2) Discriminability of fine detail: what is the finest, most complex 
small structure or fine texture that the system can handle (legibility, resolving power)? 
(3) Fidelity of reproduction: for the larger details and structures, how do the images compare 
to the original input such as some reasonable width line? To create a specific metric in each 
of these categories, one defines a specific test object or test pattern that relates to the imag­
ing application. One then defines a set of rules or criteria by which to judge performance 
against that pattern. These include rules for determining threshold variation/selection 
and phase probabilities for decision criteria. These are more completely described in the 
earlier edition (Reference 53) including line width detectability and fidelity.
3.5.3.1  Resolving Power (A Measure for Discrimination of Fine Detail)
Resolving power is a commonly used descriptor of image quality for nearly every kind 
of imaging system. Its application to binary electronic imaging and scanning systems is 
therefore appealing. However, because of its extreme sensitivity to threshold and test pat­
tern design, it must be applied with great care to prevent misleading results. Its primary 
value is in understanding performance for fine structures. The metrics noted above apply 
to isolated detail, while resolving power tends to emphasize the ability to distinguish 
many closely spaced details. In general, it can often be considered as an attempt to meas­
ure the cutoff frequency, that is, the maximum frequency for the MTF of a system. Binary 
systems are so nonlinear that even an approximate frequency-by-frequency MTF analysis 
cannot be considered.
The basic concept of a resolving power measurement is to attempt (through somewhat 
subjective visual evaluations) to detect a pattern in the thresholded video, which, to some 
level of confidence, resembles the pattern presented in the test target. For example, one 
may establish a criterion of 75% confidence that the image represents five black bars and 
four white spaces at the appropriate spacing. Values of 50%, 95%, 100% or any other con­
fidence could also be used. As in all the metrics above, each judgment must be measured 
over a wide range of sampling phases for the bar pattern, resulting in an appropriate aver­
age confidence over all phases. Tipping the bar target so the length of the bars intercepts 
an integer number of sampling phases is again convenient. More detail on this test is given 

196 
Handbook of Optical and Laser Scanning
in the earlier edition (Reference 53) including unusual and non-intuitive sampling pat­
terns that may arise, pseudo- or spurious resolution (Reference 121) and gray in white 
spaces between bars in well-resolved image that is caused by light scattering in test target 
substrates71–73 and may change expected thresholding results.
Binary imaging systems have extremely powerful contrast enhancement properties 
under the right circumstances. Selecting exactly the right threshold, one between the light 
and dark part of a resolving power image, amplifies a 1% or 2% modulation of the optical 
or gray electronic image to an on–off pattern (i.e., 100% modulation) that can be easily 
resolved in the video bit map.
Because it is possible to detect these low contrast patterns, it is also common to detect 
the situation known as pseudo- or spurious resolution. Here the blurring due to the input 
scanner is in a particular form that causes the light bars of the pattern to turn dark, and the 
dark bars to turn light.121 There are many strategies available for using resolving power. 
These would include:
	
1.	Varying the threshold and noting the pattern that is resolved (see Figure 3.34).
	
2.	Fixing the bar spacing of interest, and looking for the threshold at which it is 
detected.
It should be noted in any digital system (binary or gray) that there is a strong depen­
dence on angular orientation. Unlike resolving power in a conventional optical system, 
a nonzero or non-90° orientation may in fact perform better because of the independent 
MTFs in the x- and y-directions and the rectangular sampling grid.
Resolving power test targets come in many forms and substrates and these make a signifi­
cant difference in the results, as noted earlier. Some of these are illustrated in Figure 3.35.

Only the coarser patterns are imaged in this illustration and no attempt should be made 
by the reader to use these images for testing. They are illustrations only. Two general forms 
exist: those with discrete changes in the bar spacing and those with continuous variation 
in the bar spacing. In the former category there are several fairly commonly encountered 
types, designed for visual testing, namely the NBS lens testing type (e), NBS microcopy 
test chart type (b), the US Air Force type (f), the Cobb chart type (2 bars, not shown) and 
finally, the ANSI Resolving Power test patterns (h). This form also includes the extended 
square-wave types as represented by either Ronchi rulings (not shown) or ladder charts 
(not shown), which are simply larger arrays of the Ealing test pattern (g) which shows 
15  bars of each square wave. Machine-readable forms are also useful where the mod­
ules are arranged in a pattern that can be scanned in a single straight line, as in (c). The

differences between these can be seen in the aspect ratio of the bars in the various patterns, 
the number of bars per frequency, the layout of the pattern itself, whether it is a spiral or a 
rectangle displaying progression of spacing, and the actual numerical progression of dif­
ferent frequency patterns within the target. In many cases low contrast versions or reverse 
polarity (white and black parts are switched) are also available.
The second major class, the continuously varying frequency pattern, is exemplified by the 
Sayce chart (d) and the radial graded frequency chart (a). The Sayce patterns are particularly 
useful for automated readout, provided the appropriate phase information is obtained (coor­
dinates of each black bar) to prevent the pseudoresolution phenomena described above.
3.5.3.2  Line Imaging Interactions
A strategy for evaluating line and text imaging against all of the above metrics is to estab­
lish a fixed threshold that optimizes system performance for one of the major categories, 
such as line width fidelity, and then to report performance for the other variables, such as 
detectability and resolving power, at that threshold. One may also choose to plot detect­
ability, fidelity, and resolving power as a function of threshold on a single plot in order 
to observe the relationships among the three and find an optimum threshold, trading off 
one against the other. This is illustrated in Figure 3.34 for a particular scanner. Such a plot 
provides several useful perspectives relating to the effects of blur on a binary system. It is 
clear in this example that the maximum fidelity occurs between 35% and 45% threshold 
while the maximum fine-line detectability keeps growing as the threshold drops below 
30%. The resolving power has a distinct maximum at about 33%. Such a plot is different for 
each system and is governed by the shape of the underlying MTF curves and the various 
nonlinear interactions produced by image processing and the electronics.
3.5.4  Binary Metrics Relating to Noise Characteristics
Conventional approaches to measuring the amplitude of the noise fluctuations using vari­
ous statistical measures of the distribution are not appropriate for binary systems. In these 
systems the noise shows up as pixels that are of the wrong polarity; that is, a black pixel 
that should have been white or a white pixel that should have been black. In general it is 
the distribution and location of these errors that need to be characterized. The practical 
approach to this problem is to examine the noise in a context equivalent to the main appli­
cations of interest for the binary imaging system. The resulting metrics include:
	
1.	The range of uncertainty associated with determining the threshold using a gray 
wedge as described above in Section 3.5.2, which has led to the gray wedge metric 
for noise.
	
2.	The noise seen on edges of lines and characters, which has led to the line edge range 
metric for noise.
	
3.	The characterization of noise in a halftone image, that is, halftone granularity.
These are all described below.
3.5.4.1  Gray Wedge Noise
Figure 3.33 shows the transmittance profile of a gray wedge as a function of distance. The 
thresholded image of that gray wedge is shown below this profile with the x-axis lined 

Image Quality for Scanning and Digital Imaging Systems

up to correspond to the position in the profile plot. Here, as noted earlier The GWN (Gray 
Wedge Noise) = T2 − T1.
To make a statistically satisfactory measure of noise, a probability distribution is used 
with the criteria for determining the positions d1 and d2. As illustrated, these are the point 
where the signal is 95% black and the point where the signal is 95% white. Under the 
assumption of normally distributed noise this would represent plus or minus approxi­
mately two standard deviation limits on the noise distribution.
To fully characterize a binary system with this metric, one plots the width of the noise 
band in effective transmittance as a function of the independent variable, threshold (con­
verted to transmittance).
3.5.4.2  Line Edge Noise Range Metric
The noise associated with the edges of lines is an important type of noise to be directly 
evaluated for many practical reasons. The image of every line has a microscopic gray 
region associated with it where the intensity falls off gradually from the white surround 
field into the black line. For the image of the edge of a line oriented at a very small angle 
to the sampling matrix there is a distribution of gray varying along the edge of the line. It 
gradually increases from white to black. In a binary system this scan line appears white 
until it reaches a fractional coverage along the tilted edge required by the threshold, and 
then changes to black. Much like the case associated with the wedge in the previous met­
ric as the edge approaches the transition point where the threshold causes a change in the 
binary signal, the probability for an error resulting from noise increases. Thus the binary 
signal along the length of this slightly tipped line acts much like the signal for the wedge 
in the previous example, oscillating between black and white. This provides the basis for a 
second metric, which we refer to as the line edge noise range metric.
In Figure 3.36, a slightly tilted input line is shown relative to several scan lines. The binary 
video bit map for this line is shown in the lower part of Figure 3.36. Vertical lines mark the 
location at which the edge of the line makes a transition from the center of one raster line 
to the next. In the video bit map this transition is noisy and the two ranges in which this 
uncertainty of the black to white transition exists are indicated as N1 and N2. The centers

of these noisy transition regions are marked by the transition lines at X1 and X2 and are 
separated by the distance ΔΧ. The metric can be applied to edges of lines, or edges of solids, 
or any straight edge and is therefore generically referred to as “edge noise range” or ENR 
and simply defined as

The numerator and the denominator are averages over a large number of transitions along 
one or more constantly sloping straight lines. ΔΧ is the number of pixels per “step.” The 
range N is determined by subtracting the pixel number of the first white pixel in the black 
region from that of the last black pixel in the white region along the length of the line in 
each transition region.
Figure 3.37 shows the relationships among ENR, the step ratio ΔΧ, and the percentage 
of RMS noise in the imaging system, assuming additive white Gaussian noise distribu­
tions (private communication, J.C. Dainty, 1984) These are not intuitive relationships. For 
example, it should be noted from Figure 3.37 that an increase of a factor of 2 in RMS noise 
for a given angle line produces a line edge noise range increase of anywhere from 2 1
2  to 
4× depending upon the slope of the line and the exact noise level. It is noted that the noise 
is highly dependent on the angle of the line. Gradually sloping lines not only produce a 
larger absolute range but also a larger fractional range.
Here the MTF of the imaging system was considered to be perfect. The effect of blur, 
that  is, decreases in MTF, is to increase the magnitude of ENR above those values 
shown.
It must also be noted that document noise will create extra fluctuations along the edge of 
the line and also increase the length of the range.
3.5.4.3  Noise in Halftoned or Screened Digital Images
This is the binary situation where a gray signal is created by a gray scanner and then 
converted to a binary halftone signal via processing in order to print on a binary render­
ing device (i.e., it is not a characteristic of a binary scanner per se). Scanning a typical

photograph and applying a halftone screen of the type described earlier (2.2.3) results in 
a bit map in which some of the arrangements of pixels in the halftone cells do not follow 
the prescribed growth pattern for the screen (see Figure 3.38). The noise in the scanning 
system itself can produce pixel-by-pixel changes in the effect of threshold at each one of 
the sites within the halftone cell. Some of these errors are introduced by the partial dot­
ting mechanism, described earlier, when the granularity of the otherwise uniform input 
document, which was scanned to create the image, is of sufficient contrast to change the 
structure inside areas formed by individual halftone cell’s threshold matrix. See Section 
3.2.2.3 and Figures 3.14 and 3.15 for a review of these mechanisms.
One way of evaluating this type of noise is to create images of a series of perfectly uni­
form patches of differing density and process them through the halftoning method of 
choice. One then measures the RMS fluctuation in the percent area coverage for the result­
ing halftone cells, one patch at a time. To the extent that the output system is insensitive to 
the orientation of the bit map inside the halftone cell, this fluctuation becomes a reasonable 
measure of the granularity of the digital halftone pattern. For the electronic image, it can 
be calculated with a simple computer program that searches out each halftone cell and 
calculates its area coverage, collecting the statistics over a large number of halftone cells.
There are many image analysis packages on the market that will find particles in a dig­
ital image and evaluate their statistical distribution. They are found in biology, medicine, 
or metallurgy software applications as well as in image analysis packages.87–89 In this case 
a “particle” is a halftone dot whose area corresponds to the number of pixels.

If the image has been printed, a microdensitometer can be set up with an aperture that 
exactly covers one halftone cell, then scanned along rows of halftone dots. The RMS fluc­
tuations or the low-frequency components of the noise spectra can then be evaluated. This 
is sometimes referred to as aperture filtered granularity measurement.
3.6  SUMMARY MEASURES OF IMAGING PERFORMANCE
Many attempts have been made to take the general information on image quality measure­
ment and reduce it to a single measure of imaging performance. These often take the form 
of shortcut “D” in Figure 3.3. While none of the resulting measures provides a single uni­
versal figure of merit for overall subjective image quality, each brings additional insight to 
the design and analysis of particular imaging systems and its quality. Each has achieved 
some level of success in a limited range of applications. Preferred image quality, however, 
is a psychological reaction to a complex set of trade-offs and visual stimuli. There is a very 
subjective, application-oriented aspect to this reaction that does not readily lend itself to 
analytical description.
Instead, in an attempt to help the engineer control or design his systems, we shall 
describe a number of metrics.
The metrics are described here in their general form, many were developed for analog 
imaging systems such as cameras and film, others for digital. To the extent that the scan­
ning systems in question are unaliased and have a large number of gray levels associated 
with them, the direct application of analog metrics is valid. In general, it should be remem­
bered that digital imaging systems are not symmetric in slow and fast scan orientations in 
either noise or spatial frequency response (MTF). Therefore, what is given below in one-
dimensional units must be applied in both dimensions for successful analysis of a digital 
input scanner. These concepts can be extended to an entire imaging system with little 
modification if the subsequent imaging modules, such as a laser beam scanner, provide 
gray output writing capability and generate no significant sampling or image conversion 
defects of their own (i.e., they are fairly linear). Since full gray scale input scanners are 
usually linear, most of these concepts can be applied to them, with the qualification that 
some display or analysis technique is required to convert the otherwise invisible electronic 
image to a visual or numerical form.
Most of these summary measures can be described by curves like the illustrative ones 
shown in Figure 3.39. Here we show some common measures, generically symbolized by 
F for both signal and noise, such as intensity, modulation or (modulation)2 plotted as a 
function of spatial frequency f. A signal S(f) is shown generally decreasing from its value 
at 0 spatial frequency to the frequency fmax. A limiting or noise function N(f) is plotted on 
the same graph starting at a point below the signal; it too varies in some fashion as spa­
tial frequency increases. The various unifying constructs (metrics) involve very carefully 
considered approaches to the relationship between S and N, to their respective definitions, 
and to the frequency range over which the relationship is to be considered, along with the 
frequency weighting of that relationship
3.6.1  Basic Signal-to-Noise Ratio
The simplest of all signal-to-noise measures is the ratio of the mean signal level S(0) to the 
standard deviation N(0) of the fluctuations at that mean. If the system is linear and the 

Image Quality for Scanning and Digital Imaging Systems 
203
noise is multiplicative, this is a useful single number metric. If the noise varies with signal 
level, then this ratio is plotted as a function of the mean signal level to get a clearer pic­
ture of performance. Hypothetical elementary examples of this are shown in Figure 3.40, 
in which are plotted both the multiplicative type of noise at 5% of mean signal level (here 
represented as 100) and additive noise of 5% with respect to the mean signal level. It can 
be seen why such a distinction is important in evaluating a real system. It should be noted 
that in some cases, multiplicative or additive noise might vary as a function of signal level 
for some important design reason.
In comparing signals to noise, one must also be careful, to ensure that the detector area 
over which the fluctuations are collected is appropriate for the application to which the 
signal-to-noise calculation pertains. This could be the size of the input or output pixel, of

collected in the orientation of interest. In general, for scanned imaging systems there will 
be a different signal-to-noise ratio in the fast scanning direction than in the slow scanning 
direction.
3.6.2  Detective Quantum Efficiency and Noise Equivalent Quanta
When low light levels or highly noise limited situations occur, it is desirable to apply the 
concepts of detective quantum efficiency (DQE) and noise equivalent quanta (NEQ). These 
fundamental measurements have been extensively discussed in the literature.47
If we set gain of a system response to a constant r in arbitrary output units, and assume 
the distribution of fluctuations obeys normal statistics, then we can write

where σ0 represents an estimate of the standard deviation of the distribution of the output 
fluctuations. Here for DQE the average signal level q is divided by the square of the standard 
deviation (i.e., the variance) and contains a modifier that is related to the characteristic ampli­
fication factors associated with a particular detection system, namely r, which also enters as a 
square. It should also be pointed out that DQE is an absolute measure of performance, since 
q is an absolute number of exposure events, that is, number of photons or quanta.
For illustration purposes, Figure 3.39 shows all of the above constructs.
3.6.3  Application-Specific Context
The above descriptions are frequently derived from the fundamental physical characteris­
tics of various imaging systems, but the search for the summary measure of image quality 
usually includes an attempt to arrive at some application-oriented subjective evaluation, 
correlating subjective with objective descriptions. Applications that have been investigated 
extensively include two major categories: those involving detection and recognition of spe­
cific types of detail and those involved in presenting aesthetically pleasing renderings of 
a wide variety of subject matter. These have centered on a number of imaging constraints, 
which can usually be grouped into the categories of display technologies and hard-copy 
generation. Many studies of MTF have been applied to each.85,97,122–126 All of these studies 
are of some interest here. Note that modern laser beam scanning tends to focus on the gen­
eration of hard copy where the raster density is hundreds of lines per inch and thousands 
of lines per image compared with the hundreds of lines per image for early CRT technol­
ogy used in the classical studies of soft display quality.
3.6.4  Modulation Requirement Measures
One general approach characterizes N(f) in Figure 3.39 as a “demand function” of one of 
several different kinds. Such a function is defined as the amount of modulation or signal 
required for a given imaging and viewing situation and a given target type. In one class 

Image Quality for Scanning and Digital Imaging Systems 
205
of applications, the curve N(f) is called the threshold detectability curve and is obtained 
experimentally. Targets of a given format but varying in spatial frequency and modulation 
are imaged by the system under test. The images are evaluated visually under conditions 
and criteria required by the application. Results are stated as the input target modulation 
required (i.e., “demanded”) for being “just resolved” or “just detected” at each frequency. 
It is assumed that the viewing conditions for the experiment are optimum and that the 
threshold for detection of any target in the image is a function of the target image modula­
tion, the noise in the observer’s visual system, and the noise in the imaging system preced­
ing the observer. At low spatial frequencies this curve is limited mostly by the HVS, while 
at higher frequencies imaging system noise as well as blur may determine the limit.
One such type of experiment involves measuring the object modulation required to 
resolve a three-bar resolving power target. For purposes of electronic imaging, it must be 
recalled that the output video of an input scanner cannot be viewed directly, and there­
fore any application of this method must be in the systems context, including some form 
of output writing or display. This would introduce additional noise restrictions. The out­
put could be a CRT display of some type, such as a video monitor with gray-scale (analog) 
response. Another likely output would be a laser beam scanner writing on xerography or 
on silver halide film or paper. The details for measuring and using the demand function 
can be found in work by Scott127 for the example of photographic film and in Biberman,85 
especially Chapter 3 for application to soft displays.
3.6.5  Area under the MTF Cure (MTFA) and Square Root Integral (SQRI)
Modulation detectability, while useful for characterizing systems in task-oriented appli­
cations, is not always useful in predicting overall image quality performance for a broad 
range of imaging tasks and subject matters. It has been extended to a more general form 
through the concepts of the threshold quality factor128 and area under the MTF curve 
(MTFA).129,130 These concepts were originally developed for conventional photographic 
systems used in military photo-interpretation tasks.128 They have been generalized to 
electro-optical systems applications for various forms of recognition and image-quality 
evaluation tasks, mostly involving soft displays.85 The concept is quite simple in terms of 
Figure 3.39. It is the integrated area between the curves S(f) and N(f) or, equivalently, the 
area under the curve labeled S–N. In two dimensions, this is

where S is the MTF of the system and N is the modulation detectability or demand func­
tion as defined above, and fcx and fcy are the two-dimensional “crossover” frequencies 
equivalent to fc shown in Figure 3.39.
This metric attempts to include the cumulative effects of various stages of the scan­
ner, films, development, the observation process, the noise introduced into the perceived 
image by the imaging system, and the limitations imposed by psychological and physio­
logical aspects of the observer by building all these effects into the demand function N(f). 
Extensive psychophysical evaluation and correlation has confirmed the usefulness of this 
approach130 for recognition of military reconnaissance targets, pictorial recognition in gen­
eral, and for some alphanumeric recognition.
Related approaches using a visual MTF weighting have been successfully applied to a 
number of display evaluation tasks, showing good correlation with subjective quality.123

Handbook of Optical and Laser Scanning
Many studies examine differences in quality where noise factors are relatively constant. 
One of these is the square root integral (SQRI) model of Bartend.124,131 Here, the demand 
function is specified by a general contrast sensitivity of the HVS and the comparison of the 
quality of two images of interest is specified in JND units (see Section 3.8 for a definition 
of JND, a just noticeable difference).

where M(w) is the cascaded MTF of the image components, including that of the display 
and Mt(w) is threshold MTF of the HVS, both in units of angular spatial frequency w. 
Results are to be interpreted with the understanding that 1 JND is “practically insignifi­
cant.” It is equal to a 75% correct response in a paired comparison experiment. Note that 3 
JND is “significant,” and 10 JND is “substantial.”124,132 The Mt(w) term describes the HVS as 
the threshold contrast for detecting a grating of angular frequency w as follows:

L is the display luminance in cd/m2 and sw is the display size or width in degrees. These 
equations have been shown to have high correlation with perceived quality over a wide 
range of display experiments,124 one of which is shown in Figure 3.41. Here the resolution, 
size, and subject matter of projected slides were varied and the equation was fit to the 
data.
It is noted by Barten that noise should be taken into account in the modulation threshold 
function, which is done by using a root sum of squares method of a weighted noise modu­
lation factor to Mt(w).121 Other authors have expanded on these concepts, extending them 
to include more fundamentals of visual mechanisms.125,126,133
3.6.6  Measures of Subjective Quality
Several authors have explored the broader connection between objective measures of image 
quality and overall aesthetic pictorial quality for a variety of subject matters encountered 
in amateur and professional photography.134–140 The experiments to support these studies 
are difficult to perform, requiring extremely large numbers of observers to obtain good 
statistical measures of subjective quality. The task of assessing overall quality is less well 
defined than the task of recognizing a particular pattern correctly, as evaluated in most of 
the studies cited above. It would appear that no single measurement criterion has become 

Image Quality for Scanning and Digital Imaging Systems 
207
universally accepted by individuals or organizations working in this area. Below we shall 
discuss a few of the key descriptors, but we do not attempt to list them all.
Many of the earlier studies tended to focus on the signal or MTF-related variable only. In 
one such series of studies,134,135 S in Figure 3.39 is defined as the modulation of reflectance 
on the output print (for square waves) divided by the modulation on the input document 
(approximately 0.6 for these experiments). The quality metric is defined as the spatial fre­
quency at which this ratio falls to 0.5. This is indicated in Figure 3.39 by the frequency fb 
for the curve S as drawn. In these studies, a landscape without foreground was rated good 
if this characteristic or critical frequency was 4–5 cycles/mm (100–125 cycles/in), but for 
a portrait 2–3 cycles/mm (50–75 cycles/in) proved adequate. Viewing distance was not a 
controlled variable. By using modulation on the print and not simply MTF, the study has 
included the effects of tone reproduction as well as MTF. Granularity was also shown to 
have an effect, but was not explicitly taken into account in the determination of critical 
frequency.
Several studies have shown that the visual response curve discussed earlier can be con­
nected with a measure of S(f) to arrive at an overall quality factor. See, for example, sys­
tem modulation transfer acutance (SMT acutance) by Crane139 and an improvement by 
Gendron140 known as cascaded area modulation transfer (CMT) acutance. One metric, 
known as the subjective quality factor (SQF),136 defines an equivalent passband based on 
the visual MTF having a lower (initial) cutoff frequency at fi and an upper (limiting) fre­
quency of fl. Here, fi is chosen to be just below the peak of the visual MTF, and fl is chosen 
to be four times fi (two octaves above it). For prints that are to be viewed at normal view­
ing distance [i.e., about 340 mm (13.4 in)], this range is usually chosen to be approximately 
0.5–2.0 cycles/mm (13–50 cycles/in).
The MTF of the system is integrated as follows.

This function has been shown to have a high degree of correlation with pictorial image 
quality over a wide range of picture types and MTFs. It is possible that a demand function 
similar to that described in the MTF concepts above could be applied to further improve 
the performance. The SQF metric is applied to the final print as it is to be viewed and may 
be scaled to the imaging system, when reduction or enlargement is involved, by applying 
the appropriate scaling factor to the spatial frequency axis.
It should be noted that there is a significant difference between the upper band limit 
of this metric at 2 cycles/mm (50 cycles/in) and the critical frequency described above 
in Biedermann’s work for landscapes, which is in the 4–5 cycles/mm (100–125 cycles/in) 
region. But there is good agreement for the portrait conclusions of the earlier work, which 
cites an upper critical frequency of 2–3 cycles/mm (50–75 cycles/in). Authors of both met­
rics acknowledge the importance of granularity or noise without directly incorporating 
granularity into their algorithms. Granger141 discusses some effects of granularity and 
digital structure in the context of the SQF model, but calls for more extensive study of 
these topics before incorporating them into the model.
It is clear that when the gray content and resolution of the digital system are high 
enough to be indistinguishable from an analog imaging system, then these techniques, 
which are general in nature, should be applicable. The quantization levels at which this 
equivalence occurs vary broadly. Usually 32 to 512 levels of gray suffice, depending on 
noise (higher noise requires fewer levels), while resolution values typically range from 
100 to 1000 pixels/in (4–40 pixels/mm), depending on noise, subject matter, and viewing 
distance.
Another fairly typical approach to quantifying overall subjective image quality involves 
measuring the important attributes of a set of images made under a range of technology 
variables of interest and then surveying a large number of observers, usually customers 
for the products using the technology. They are asked for their overall subjective reaction 
to each image. A statistical regression is then performed between the measured attributes 
and the average subjective score for each image. This is the “type D shortcut” illustrated in 
Figure 3.3. An equation describing quality is derived using only the most important terms 
in the regression, that is, those that describe most of the variance. The “measures” may 
also be visual perceptions, that is, the “nesses,” in which case the result is Engeldrum’s 
“image quality models,”12,41 but must include all the factors that could have any reason­
able bearing on quality. Sometimes the technology variables themselves are used (type A 
shortcut, Figure 3.3). This makes the resulting equation less general in its applicability but 
gives immediate answers to product questions.
Below is an example of an image quality model142 selecting five visual perception attri­
butes from a list of 10 general image quality attributes143 to describe a series of 48 printed 
color images from lithography, electrophotography, inkjet, silver halide, and dye diffusion, 
under a wide variety of conditions. A linear regression against overall preferences of 61 
observers yielded the following equation.
	
Avg. Preference = 8.8 Color Rendition + 5.5 MicroUniformityy
+ 4.4 Effective Resolution + 3.5 MacroUniformity
+ 1.9 Glooss Uniformity.
	
(3.24)
A plot showing the Preference versus a fitted three-dimensional surface for the top two 
correlates is given in Figure 3.42.

Other regression equations between physical or measured image parameters and cus­
tomer preference have been developed in many different imaging environments some 
tackling huge lists of variables.144

A study comparing perceived image quality and acceptability of photographic prints 
of images from different resolution digital capture devices77 directly compared perceived 
quality by a range of individuals with varying experience in photography and computers. 
Photographic prints (4 × 6 in) showing optimum tone and color rendering were used as 
output for viewing. Their results and others were given earlier in Figure 3.20.
3.6.7  Information Content and Information Capacity
There are numerous articles in the imaging science literature that analyze imaging sys­
tems in terms of information capacities and describe their images as having various infor­
mation contents.
Using basic statistics of noise and spread function concepts from Section 3.2.1.3 a sim­
ple description of image information is given by Equation 3.33.46,50,51 It defines image

where the numerator is set equal to p, the probability that a detected level within a set

probable distinguishable levels (i.e., the quantization) from Equation 3.1 in Section 3.2.1.3. 
Assuming a high reliability such that p approaches unity, the simplification on the right 
results. The standard deviation of density in Equation 3.1 must be measured with a mea­
suring tool whose aperture area is equal to a.
An approximation useful in comparing different photographic materials uses the stan­
dard deviation of density σa at a mean density of approximately 1 to 1.5 and Equation 3.30

(3.27)
where k was set to ± 3 (= 6), leading to p = 0.997 (~1); L is the density range of the imaging 
material.
Since the standard deviation of density is strongly dependent on the mean density 
level, it is more accurate and also common practice to measure the standard deviation at 
several average densities and segment the density scale into adjacent, empirically deter­
mined, unequal distinguishable density levels. These levels are separated by k standard 
deviations of density as measured for each specific level.46,50,51 If the input scanner itself is 
very noisy, then the σa term must represent the combined effects of both input noise and 
scanner noise. This was covered in Section 3.4.3 (see References 46, 50, and 51 for further 
information).
Another approach uses all of the spatial frequency based concepts developed above for 
the MTF and the Wiener spectrum and can incorporate the HVS as well. It produces results 
in bits/area that are directly related to the task of moving electronic image data from an 
input scanner to an output scanner or other display. Much of the research in this area 
began on photographic processes, but has also been applied to electronic scanned imag­
ing. Both are addressed here. The basic equation for the spatial frequency based informa­
tion content of an image is given146 by

where Hi is the information content of the image, ΦS is the Wiener spectrum of the signal, 
ΦN is the Wiener spectrum of the system noise, and f is the spatial frequency, usually given 
in cycles per millimeter. This equation is in one-dimensional form for simplicity, in order 
to develop the basic concepts. For images, these concepts must, as usual, be extended to 
two dimensions. Unlike the work dealing with the photographic image, the assumption 
of uniform isotropic performance cannot be used to simplify the notation to radial units. 
For digital images the separation of the orthogonal x- and y-dimensions of the image must 
be preserved.
Alternative methods for calculating information capacity do not include explicit spatial 
frequency dependence but do explicitly handle probabilities.46,50,51,147 They served as the 
basis for our discussion of quantization and Equation 3.29, is rewritten as
	
H

(3.29)
where N is the number of independent information storage cells per unit area. It may be 
set equal to the reciprocal of the smallest effective cell area of the image, for example, 
a number of pixels or the spread function. Here, p is the reliability with which one can 
distinguish the separate messages within an information cell, and M is the number of mes­
sages per cell. M is determined by the number of statistically different gray levels that can 
be distinguished in the presence of system noise at the reliability p, using noise measure­
ments made with the above cell area.
Generalizing Equations 3.29 and 3.1 to the “generic” units of Figure 3.39, L is set equal 
to S0 and σa is set equal to σs for the maximum signal and its standard deviation, respec­
tively. We select a spread function for an unaliased system equal to 2 × 2 pixels and trans­
late this to frequency space using the reciprocal of the sampling frequencies fsx and fsy in 
the x- and y-directions. This gives a generalized, sampling-oriented version of Equations

where S and σs are measured in the same units. k can be set to determine the reliability for 
a given application. Values from 245 to 2043 have been proposed for k for different applica­
tions; 6 is suggested here, making p = 0.997. This assumes that σs is a constant (i.e., additive 
noise) at all signal levels. If not, then the specific functional dependence of σs on S must be 
accounted for in determining the quantity in the brackets, measuring the desired number 
of standard deviations of the signal at each signal level over the entire range.46,51 While this 
approach predicts text quality and resolving power147 and deals with the statistical nature 
of information, it does not (as noted above) permit the strong influence of spatial frequency 
to be handled explicitly.

where Φi (f)  is the Wiener spectrum of the input scene or document and MTF(f) is the 
MTF of the imaging system (assumed linear) with all its components cascaded. At this 
point we need to begin making some assumptions in order to carry the argument further. 
The constant K in the equation is actually the gain of the imaging system. It converts the 
units of the input spectrum into the same units as the spectral content of the noise in the 
denominator. For example, a reflectance spectrum for a document may be converted into 
gray levels by a K factor of 256 when a reflectance of unity (white level) corresponds to the 
256th level of the digitized (8-bit) signal from a particular scanner; the noise spectrum is 
in units of gray levels squared.
Various authors have gained further insight into the use of these general equations. Some 
of those investigating photographic applications have extended their analysis to allow for 
the effect of the visual system;137 others attempted to apply some rigor to the terms in the 
equation that are appropriate for digital imaging.148,149 Others have worked on image qual­
ity metrics for digitally derived images,138 but some have tended to focus on the relation­
ship to photointerpreter performance.150
Several of these authors have suggested that properly executed digital imagery does not 
appear to be greatly different from standard analog imagery in terms of subjective quality or 
interpretability. One almost always sees these images using some analog reconstruction pro­
cess to which many analog metrics apply. It therefore seems reasonable to combine some of this 
work into a single equation for image information and to hypothesize that it has some direct 
connection with overall image quality when applied to a scanner whose output is viewed or 
printed by an approximately linear display system. It must also be assumed that the display 
system noise and MTF are not significant factors or can be incorporated into the MTF and 
noise spectra by a single cascading process. A generic form of such an equation is given below 
as Equation 3.35 without the explicit functional dependencies on frequency in order to show 
and explain the principles that follow (expanding on the analysis in Reference 137).

Let us begin by examining the numerator. Several authors have attempted to multiply the 
MTF of the imaging system by a spatial frequency response function for the HVS to arrive 
at an appropriate weighting for the signal part of Equation 3.34. Kriss and his coworkers137 
observed that a substantial increase in the enhancement beyond the eye’s peak response 
produced larger improvements in overall picture quality than did equivalent increases in 
enhancement at the peak of the eye’s response. The pictures with large enhancement at the 
eye’s peak response were “sharper,” but were also judged to be too harsh. These results 
indicate that the HVS does not act as a passive filter and that it may weigh the spatial fre­
quencies beyond the peak in the eye’s response function more than those at the peak.
Lacking a good model for the visual system’s adaptation to higher frequencies as 
described above, Kriss et al. proposed the use of the reciprocal of the eye frequency 
response curve as a weighting function, R1(f), that could be applied to the numerator. The 
conventional eye response R2(f) should be applied in the denominator to account for the 
perception of the noise, since the eye is not assumed to enhance noise but merely to filter 
it. The noise term, ΦΝ, in the earlier equation has been replaced by the expression in the 
square brackets and multiplied by R
f
2
2 ( ). The reciprocal response, R1, is set equal to 0.0 at 
8 cycles/mm (200 cycles/in) in order to limit this function.

Next let us examine the noise effects themselves. A major observation is that noise in the 
visual system, within one octave of the signal’s frequency, tends to affect that signal. It can 
be shown that the sum in the first curly brackets in the denominator of Equation 3.35 pro­
vides a weighting of noise frequencies appropriate to this one-octave frequency-selective 
model for the visual system.137 Several authors116,126,133,151 describe frequency-selective mod­
els of the visual system. The present construct for noise perception was first described by 
Stromeyer and Julesz.152 A term for the Wiener spectrum of the noise in the visual process, 
ΦE, has been added to the second factor in the denominator to account for yet one more 
source of noise. It is not multiplied by the frequency response of the eye, since it is gener­
ated after the frequency-dependent stage of the visual process.
The factor in square brackets in the denominator contains three terms unique to the dig­
ital imaging system.149 These are Φa, the Wiener spectrum of the aliased information in the 
passband of interest; Φn, the Wiener spectrum of the noise in the electronic system, nomi­
nally considered to be fluctuations in the fast scan direction; and Φq the quantization noise 
determined by the number of bits used in the scanning process. We have thus combined 
in Equation 3.35 important information from photographic image quality studies, includ­
ing vision models and psychophysical evaluation, with scanning parameters pertinent to 
electronic imaging.
The study of information capacity, information content, and related measures as a per­
ceptual correlate to image quality for digital images is an ongoing activity. By necessity it 
is focused on specific types of imaging applications and observer types. For example, an 
excellent database of images and related experiments on quality metrics was built for aer­
ial photography as used by photointerpreters.150
Experiments correlating subjective quality scores with the logarithm of the basic infor­
mation capacity, taking the log of Hi as defined in Equations 3.1 and 3.29 showed cor­
relation of 0.87 and greater for subjective quality of pictorial images.153 Specific MTF and 
quantization errors were studied. The results were normalized by the information content 
of the original.
By use of various new combinations of the same factors discussed above, it was possible 
to obtain even higher correlations. A digital quality factor was defined153 as

where we retain the one-dimensional frequency description used for simplicity by the 
original authors and the subscripts “s” and “v” refer to the system under test and the 
visual process, respectively. L is the density range of the output imaging process, fn is the 
Nyquist frequency, M is the number of quantization levels, and σ is the RMS granularity 
of the digital image using a 10 × 1000 μm microdensitometer slit. The first factor is related 
to the SQF described in Equation 3.27, and the second factor is related to the fundamental 
definition of image information capacity in Equation 3.29. A correlation coefficient of 0.971 
was obtained for these experiments, using student observers and pictures showing a por­
trait together with various test patterns. It must be noted, however, that information capac­
ity or any of these information-related metrics cannot be accepted, without psychophysical 
verification, as a general measure of image quality when different imaging systems or 
circumstances are to be compared.15,154 Since systems models are used to determine MTFs 
and information capacities and hence arrive at useful descriptions of technology variables,

these are good examples of the type A shortcut regression models described in Figure 3.3, 
but are restricted to the limitations of such regression shortcuts.
In conclusion, this brief overview of specific quality metrics should give the reader some 
perspectives on which ones may be best suited to his or her needs The variety of these 
metrics, and the considerable differences among them, are evidence of the inherent diver­
sity of imaging applications and requirements. Given this diversity, together with the large 
and rapidly expanding range of imaging technologies, it is hardly surprising that no single 
universal measure of quality has been found.
3.7  SPECIALIZED IMAGE PROCESSING
Most scanned images either begin or end in a digital form that needs to be efficiently man­
aged in the larger context of a computer system, often in a network with other devices. This 
brings other dimensions to scanned image quality, namely the need to control the size of 
the files and the quality of the scanned images beyond the devices themselves. Controlling 
the file size is the subject of image compression.11,155–157 Compression is an image quality 
issue because several methods do so at the expense of image quality, with lossy compres­
sion being one example and reduced sampling versus increased gray resolution, that is, 
resolution enhancement,55 being another. Finally there is the color management challenge: 
finding a method to ensure that a color scanned image created by any of a number of scan­
ners will look well when printed on any of a number of differently designed or maintained 
color printing devices.6,14
3.7.1  Lossy Compression
Image compression is a technology of finding efficient representation155,156 for digital 
images to:
	
1.	Reduce the size and cost of on-board or off-line computer memory and disk drive 
space required for their storage;
	
2.	Reduce the bandwidth and or time needed to manipulate, send, or receive images 
in a communication channel; and
	
3.	Improve effective access time when reading from storage systems.
The need to improve storage is easily seen in the graphic arts business, where an 8.5 × 11 in, 
600 × 600 in, 32 bit color image is approximately 109 (or a billion) bits/image. Even the good 
quality portable amateur still cameras require 6+ megabytes (1 byte = 8 bits) per color image. 
Needless to say, transmitting such large files or accessing them takes tremendous amounts 
of time or bandwidth. Many standards groups are actively trying to create order out of the 
plethora of possible compression methods in order to reduce the number and types of tools 
needed to work in our highly interactive world of communications and networks.
There are generally two types of compression: lossless and lossy. Lossless takes advan­
tage of better ways to encode highly redundant spatial or spectral information in the 
image, such as many contiguous white pixels in a text document. Results vary from com­
pression ratios well over 100:1 on some text to 1.5:1 or less on many pictures. Group 3 and 

Image Quality for Scanning and Digital Imaging Systems 
215
Group 4 facsimile (“fax”) standards, established by the CCITT (Consultative Committee 
of the International Telephone and Telegraph), now ITU-T, the Telecommunication 
Standardization sector of the International Telecommunication Union) are perhaps the 
best known and apply only to binary images.157 Other standards include JBIG,11,158 which is 
especially important for black and white halftones where it achieves about 8:1 compression 
while best CCITT methods actually expand file size by almost 20% over the uncompressed 
version.11,159 See Table 3.9 for links to these standards groups and the latest upgrades.
All compression involves several different operations from transformation of the data 
to allow for efficient coding (e.g., discrete cosine transform (DCT)) to the actual symbol-
encoding step where many technologies have developed. The latter include Huffman,160 
LZ,161–163 and LZW164 encoding, which are often cited as important parts of complete com­
pression schemes.
Lossy compression is important from an image quality perspective since it removes 
information contained in the original image and therefore potentially causes a reduction 
in image quality to gain a compression advantage. Sometimes lossy compressions are said 
to be “visually lossless” in that they only give up information about the original that they 
claim cannot be detected by the HVS (recall the limits discussed in Section 3.2.1.3). Simply 
invoking binary imaging, for example, is an excellent method of compression, which is 
visually lossless when scanning ordinary black text on a white substrate at high resolution. 
It reduces a gray image from 8 bits to one and preserves all the edge information if it is 
high enough in resolution while throwing away all the useless gray levels in between. It 
does not work well on a photograph, where the primary information is in the tones that 
are all lost! Most lossy compression methods are very complex, involving advanced signal 
processing and information theory6,17,157 beyond the scope of this chapter.
The best-known lossy compression technique is called JPEG (after the Joint Photographic 
Experts Group formed under the joint direction of ISO-IEC/JTC1/SC2/WG10—see Table 
3.9—and CCITT SGVIII NIC in 1986).11 It is aimed at still-frame, continuous tone, mono­
chrome, and color images. In the case of JPEG, the underlying algorithm is a DCT of the 
image one 8 × 8 pixel cell at a time. It then makes use of the frequency-dependent quantiza­
tion sensitivity of the eye (Figure 3.11) to alter the quantization of the signal on a frequency-
by-frequency basis within each cell.
Many lossy compression methods are adjustable depending on the users’ needs, so that 
the amount of compression is proportional to the amount of loss. They can be adjusted 
to a visually lossless state or to some acceptable state of degradation for a given user or 
design intent. The JPEG technique is adjustable by programming a table of coefficients in 
frequency space, called a Q table, which specifies the quantization at each of several spa­
tial frequency bands. It can also be adjusted using a scaling factor applied to the Q table. 
Psychometric experiments (see Section 3.8) should be employed to determine acceptable 
performance in making such changes, using the exact scanning and marking methods 
and objects of interest. There are many other features of the JPEG approach that cannot be 
covered here. It has routinely been able to show an order of magnitude better compression 
over raw continuous tone pictures11 with very little to no apparent visual loss of quality.
As noted earlier, compression is often aimed at improving communication of data and as 
such it is closely linked with file formats. In recent years a heavy focus on both the Internet 
and fax159,165 has led to significant progress. JPEG and GIF have become widely used in the 
Internet,165 where, in a greatly simplified view, it is seen that the former is lossy in spatial 
terms while the latter is lossy in color terms.
Color fax standards159,166 have recently been developed in which the color, gray, and bitonal 
information is encoded into multiple layers for efficient transmission and compression. 

216 
Handbook of Optical and Laser Scanning
These are formally known as TIFF-FX formats and generally fall into the broad category of 
mixed raster content or MRC.159
A new standard, JPEG 2000167 has been developed, which, in addition to several other 
improvements, utilizes wavelets as an underlying technology and includes several optional 
file formats called the JP family of file formats. One, the JPM file format168 with extension 
.jpm is aimed at compression of compound images, those having multiple regions each 
with differing requirements for spatial resolution and tonality. It employs this multiple 
layer approach. MRC formats allow the optimization of image quality, color quality via 
good color management, and best compression, all in one package. The base mode of MRC 
decomposes a mixed content image into three layers: a bitonal (binary) Mask layer, and 
color Foreground, and Background layers. The wavelet approach in JPEG 2000 causes less 
objectionable artifacts than the DCT-based baseline JPEG.168
3.7.2  Nonlinear Enhancement and Restoration of Digital Images
The characteristics of a scanned image may be altered in nonlinear ways to enable its 
portability between output devices of different resolutions while maintaining image qual­
ity and consistency of appearance. This may also be done to improve quality by reduc­
ing sampling effects or otherwise enhancing image appearance when compared to a 
straightforward display or print of the bit map. These are the general goals of digital image 
enhancement and restoration, topics that have been covered extensively in the literature 
and pursued by many imaging and printer corporations. They have been summarized 
by Loce and Dougherty.55 Many of the techniques fall in the domain of morphological 
image processing,3,169 which treats images as collections of well-defined shapes and oper­
ates on them with other well-defined shapes. It is most often used with binary images 
where template matching, that is, finding an image shape that matches the filter shape and 
then changing some aspect of the image shape, is a good general example. Two particular 
examples illustrate some of the underlying concepts.
“Anti-aliasing” is a class of operations in which “jaggies” or staircases (i.e., sampling arti­
facts or “aliased” digital images of tilted lines) in binary images are reduced to a less objec­
tionable visual form. In Figure 3.43 the staircased image of a narrow line is analyzed by a 
filter programmed to find the jaggies (template matching) and then operated on, pixel by 
pixel, to replace certain all-white or all-black edge pixels with new pixels, each at an appro­
priate level of gray, in this case one of three levels. The gray pixels may be printed using

conventional means of gray writing such as varying exposure on a continuous tone print­
ing medium at the output stage. This may be thought of as amplitude modulation. A similar 
but often more satisfactory effect, producing sharper edges, can be achieved by using high 
addressability or pulse-width modulation in conjunction with printing processes having an 
inherently sharp exposure threshold rather than continuous tone response.
Methods to evaluate the prints to determine the reduction of the appearance of the jag­
gies involve scanning along the edge of a line containing the effects of interest with a long 
microdensitometer slit whose length covers the space from the middle of the black line to 
the clear white surround. The resulting reflection profile is proportional to the excursions 
of the edge. It indicates the additional effects of the printing and measurement processes 
on decreasing or increasing the jaggies and can be analyzed for its visually significant 
components against an appropriate CSF.170 Some of these components are random based 
on the marking process, others are periodic based on the angle of the line and the resulting 
frequency of the staircase effect.
Figure 3.44 shows an example of several practical effects of such enhancement and restora­
tion on an italic letter “b.” The upper figure is a representation of a conventional bit map 
of the original computer generated letter. Note the jaggies or staircase on the straight but 
tilted stroke at the left and a variety of undesirable effects throughout the character. Using 
the observation window employed by Hewlett Packard’s RET (Resolution Enhancement 
Technology)55,171,172 as shown on the left, roughly 200 pixel-based templates are compared 
to the surrounding pixels for each individual pixel in the original “b,” a part of which is 
shown here. A decision is made regarding how large a mark, if any, should replace that 
pixel, based on a series of rules developed for a particular enhancement scheme, in this case 
the RET algorithm. The mark in this case is created by modifying the width of the pulse 
in the horizontal dimension as illustrated. The resulting map of full and width-modulated 
pixels is shown in the lower part of the letter “b.” Note that some of the narrow pixels can 
be positioned left or right. This is called pulse-width position modulation, PWPM.
When the individual pulses are blurred and developed by the marking process, they 
will tend to merge into the body of the letter, both physically and visually, to produce even

smoother edges than shown as a bit map image here. There are many similar techniques 
patented prior to and following the above and sold by other companies such as Xerox,173 
IBM,174 Destiny,175 and DP-Tek,178 now owned by Hewlett Packard, to name only a few, each 
with its own special features. They all create the effect on the HVS equivalent to that pro­
vided by a higher resolution print and many enhance the images in other ways as well, 
such as removing ink traps or sharpening the ends of tapered serifs.55
3.7.3  Color Management
Color measurement systems, as discussed earlier in Section 3.2.2.5, are the key to manag­
ing color reproduction in any situation. The advances in scanned color imaging systems 
that separated input and output scanning devices and inserted networks, electronic image 
archives, monitors and preprinting (prepress) software in between have made it desirable 
to automate the management of accurate or pleasing (not the same) color reproduction. 
This in turn has meant automating or at least standardizing and carefully controlling the 
objective measurement of the color performance of the many input, output, and image 
manipulation devices and a variety of methods for insuring consistency.6,14
The basic concept is to encode, transmit, store, and manipulate images in a device-
­independent form, carrying along additional information to enable decoding the files at the step 
just before rendering to an output device, that is, just before making it device specific. CIELAB 
(i.e., L*a*b*) based reference color space, above, is commonly used to relate characteristics of both 
of these types of devices to an objective standard. Standardized operating system software, 
operating with standardized tools and files accomplished this, but is beyond the scope of this 
chapter. See References 29 and 30 as well as 6-ch 4, and the papers cited in them for more details 
and Reference 23 for a practical guide to using the tools that are available at this time.
Today, a common ANSI standard target known as IT-8.7 (see Figure 3.49) is manufac­
tured by Kodak (shown), Fuji, and Agfa, each using their own photographic dyes. It is 
scanned by the scanner of interest into a file of red, green, and blue (RGB) pixels. It is also 
measured with a spectrophotometer to determine the CIE L*a*b* values for all 264 patches. 
Color management software then compares both results and constructs a source profile of 
the scanner color performance.
A well-known example of a color management system is the approach organized by the 
International Color Consortium (ICC). See Table 3.9. It has created a standard attempting 
to serve as a cross-platform device profile format to be used to characterize color devices. It 
enables the device-independent encoding and decoding primarily developed for the print­
ing and prepress industries, but allows for many solutions providers.
This profile, often called an “ICC profile” if it follows the Consortium’s proforma, is a 
lookup table that is carried with all RGB files made with that scanner. It is useful for correc­
tion as long as nothing changes in the scanner performance or setup. Similarly, a destination 
profile is created, typically for a printer or a monitor. Here, known computer-generated pat­
terns of color patches are displayed or printed, and measured with a spectrophotometer in 
L*a*b*. Again, a comparison between the known input and the output is performed by the 
color management software, which creates a lookup table as a destination profile.
The color management architecture incorporates two parts. The first part is the profiles as 
described above. They contain signal processing transforms plus other material and data 
concerning the transforms and the device. Profiles provide the information necessary to 
convert device color values to and from values expressed in a color space known as a profile 
connection space (L*a*b* in the ICC example). The second basic part is the color management 
module (CMM), which does the signal processing of the image data using the profiles.

Image Quality for Scanning and Digital Imaging Systems 
219
Progress in color management and the ICC in particular have pulled together an impor­
tant set of structures and guidelines.6,14 These enable an open color management architec­
ture that has made major improvements. Of course, gamut differences like those in Figure 
3.18, are not a problem that color management, per se, can ever solve. It is also important to 
note that drift in the device characteristics between profile calibrations cannot be removed.

color matching experiments using ICC profiles for a graphic arts application. Control over 
specific limited sets of system components, colors or small color ranges as well as newer 
measurement technologies can show much tighter tolerances than these. There is still a 
great deal of analysis and work that must be carried out to make color management more 
universal, easier, and more successful.176,179–181
3.8  PSYCHOMETRIC MEASUREMENT METHODS 
USED TO EVALUATE IMAGE QUALITY
3.8.1  Relationships between Psychophysics, Customer 
Research, and Psychometric Scaling
As one attempts to develop a scanned imaging system, there are usually some image qual­
ity questions that cannot be answered by previous experience or by reference to the lit­
erature. Often this reduces to a question of determining quantitatively how “something” 
new looks visually for “some task.” It is a problem because no one else has ever evalu­
ated the “something” or never used it for “some task” or both. We give the reader at least 
some pointers to the basic visual scaling discipline and tools to attack his own specialized 
problems.
As the Image Quality Circle12,40 and the full framework in Figure 3.3 indicates, there are 
many places where one needs to quantify the human visual responses. Sometimes this 
is in the short-cut paths connecting technology variables (the “something”) directly to 
customer quality preferences for “some tasks” through customer research. Sometimes, it is 
in creating a more thorough understanding by developing visual algorithms, which con­
nect the physical image parameters, that is, attributes (other types of “something”), with 
the fundamental human perceptions of these attributes. The science of developing these 
latter connections is referred to as psychophysics. The underlying discipline for doing both 
engineering-oriented customer research and psychophysics is psychometric psychometric 
scaling. Hundreds of good technical papers, chapters, and whole books have been writ­
ten on these subjects, but are often overlooked in imaging science and engineering for a 
variety of reasons. Many of the papers cited in this chapter draw on the rich resources of 
psychometric scaling disciplines in certain large corporations, government agencies, and 
universities to develop their algorithms. Engeldrum12 has recently distilled many of the 
basic disciplines and compiled many of the classic references into a useful book and soft­
ware toolkit for imaging systems development.

3.8.2  Psychometric Methods
There are many classes of psychometric evaluation methods, the selection of which 
depends on the nature of the imaging variable and the purpose of the evaluation. We can 
only describe them at a high level in this section. Figure 3.45 describes a framework for 
considering psychometric experiments, starting with two fundamental purposes, at the 
left, each of which breaks down into three basic approaches and six types of data.
The way in which the sample preparation is done, observer (called “respondent” in mar­
ket research) quantity and selection methods, and the numbers of images shown can all 
be very different, depending on the purpose. In general the customer-user experiments 
require significantly more care in all areas, are restricted to user-like displays of relatively 
few images, and require several dozen to hundreds of respondents. They tend to focus on 
quantifying the “Customer Quality Preference” block in Figure 3.3.
Visual sciences experiments on psychophysics and perception are useful for develop­
ing the image quality models and especially the visual algorithms of Figure 3.3 and the 
comparisons between the HVS and measurements indicated in Figure 3.2. Here smaller 
numbers of observers, from a few to several dozen, are often deemed adequate. These 
observers are often experts or technical personnel and can be told to overlook certain 
defects in samples and concentrate on the visual characteristic of interest. Such observers 
can be asked to try more fatiguing experiments. These are often broken into several visits 
to the laboratory, something not possible with customer research.

Psychometric experiments for diverse purposes, grouped in two classes here, can be further classified into three 
types of variables, which in turn lead to a few basic but significantly different types of scales.

Image Quality for Scanning and Digital Imaging Systems 
221
In general, experiments with good statistical design should be used, in which a targeted 
confidence level is established. It is common practice in many customer and general exper­
iments to seek 95% confidence intervals (any basic statistics book183 will provide equations 
and tables to enable this, provided the scaling method is properly classified as shown 
below). This requires estimating the size of the standard deviation between observers and 
using it along with the confidence interval equation to determine the number of indepen­
dent observations that translate to the number of observers. The experimenters in visual 
sciences can use fewer observers than a customer researcher because the visual sciences 
use variables and trained observers that have much better agreement, that is, smaller stan­
dard deviations. Also, these experimenters may require less statistical confidence because 
they are often more willing to use other technical judgment factors such as models and 
inferences from other work.
For either purpose, the decisions regarding basic approach must be determined by look­
ing at the types of variables and the types of scales to be built. If the goal is to determine 
when some small signal or defect (such as a faint streak) is just visually detected, threshold 
scales are developed. They show the probability of detection compared to the physical 
attribute(s) of the image samples or the observation variables. One may wish to compare 
readily visible signals, such as images of well-resolved lines, trying to distinguish when 
one is just visually darker than another. This involves determining the probability, in 
matching experiments, of what levels of a variable(s) cause two images to be seen as just 
noticeably different (JND), that is, just do not match each other. Dvorak and Hamerly184 and 
Hamerly185 give examples of JND scaling for text and solid area image qualities.
These experiments often explore fundamental mechanisms of vision and can draw on 
a relatively small number of observers in well-controlled experimental situations using 
electronic displays with side-by-side image comparisons. The temptation to substitute an 
easily controlled electronic display experiment for one in which the imaging media is 
identical to the actual images of interest (e.g., photographic transparencies viewed by pro­
jection, or xerographic prints viewed in office light) must be carefully weighed in each 
situation. Various forms of image noise, display factors affecting human vision (especially 
adaptation), as well as visual and psychological reference cues picked up from the sur­
round, are often important enough to outweigh the ease of electronic display methods.
When the magnitude of visible variables is large and the goal is to compare quality 
attributes over a large range, as in the bottom two “variables” boxes in Figure 3.45, then a 
decision about the mathematical nature of the desired scale and the general nature and dif­
ficulty of the experimental procedure becomes important. The four basic types of scales186 
shown here were developed by Stevens187–189 and are shown in increasing order of “math­
ematical power” in Figure 3.45 and with very short descriptions in Table 3.5.
There is an abundance of literature on the theory and application of scaling methods,12 
some of which are indicated in the table as column headings. Additional general refer­
ences include References 190–199. Below is a very brief summary of the methods to assist 
the reader in beginning to sort through these choices. Here we assume the samples are 
“images,” but they could just as well be patches of colored chips, displays on a monitor, 
pages of text, or any other sensory stimulus.
3.8.3  Scaling Techniques
The methods by which the various types of scales (Table 3.5) may be constructed are listed 
with very brief descriptions and the type of scale they may be used to construct in ( ). 
Where only complicated procedures enable a type of scale to be derived it is unbolded. 

222 
Handbook of Optical and Laser Scanning
Engeldrum12 gives a good discussion of all these methods. References using these meth­
ods are also listed for each.
3.8.3.1  Identification (Nominal)
In this simple scaling method, observers group images by identifying names for some 
attributes and collecting images with those attributes. The resulting nominal scales are 
useful in organizing collections of images into manageable categories.
3.8.3.2  Rank Order (Ordinal)
Observers arrange a set of images according to decreasing or increasing amount of the per­
ceived attribute.12,188,190,194 A median score for the group is frequently used to select the rank 
for each sample. Agreement between observers can be tested to understand the nature of 
the data by calculating the coefficient of concordance or the rank order coefficient.197
3.8.3.3  Category (Nominal, Ordinal, Interval)
Observers simply separate the images into various categories of the attribute of inter­
est, often by sorting into labeled piles. This is useful for a large number of images, many 
of which are fairly close in attributes, so that there are some differences of opinion over 
observers or over time as to which category is selected. Interval scales can be obtained if 
the samples can be assumed to be normally distributed on the perceived attributed.199
3.8.3.4  Graphical Rating (Interval)
The observers score the magnitude of the image attribute of interest by placing an indi­
cator on a short line scale that has defined endpoints for that attribute. The mean of the 
positions on the scale for all observers is used to get a score for each image.12
3.8.3.5  Paired Comparison (Ordinal, Interval, Ratio)
All images are presented to all observers in all possible pairwise combinations, usually one 
pair at a time, sometimes with a reference. The observer selects one of the pair as having

(Equality of intervals may be determined and any linear transformation is OK. Mean, 
standard deviation, coefficient of correlation are valid. Basis for much image quality 
analysis) 
Ratio
Interval scale where “none” of an attribute is assigned 0 response.
y = ax (i.e., b = 0)
(Interval scale operations are OK and coefficient of variation and equality of ratios are 
valid—many lightness scales are an example with an absolute zero)

more of the attribute of interest. If there are N different images then there are N(N − 1)/2 
pairs The proportion of observers for which each particular image is selected over each 
other image is arrayed in a matrix. The average score for each image (i.e., any column in the 
matrix) is then computed to determine an ordinal scale.12,191,197,206 If it is assumed that the per­
ceived attributes are normally distributed, then, as with the category method, an interval 
scale can be determined. This is done using Thurstone’s Law of Comparative Judgement199 
in which six types of conditions for standard deviations describing the datasets are used to 
construct tables of Z-Deviates,12,197 from which interval scales are directly obtained.
3.8.3.6  Partition Scaling (Interval)
The observer is given two samples, say S1 and S9, and asked to pick a third sample from 
the set, whose magnitude of the appearance variable under test is halfway between the 
two samples; call it S5 in this case. Next he finds a sample halfway between S1 and S5, call 
it S3, then he finds one between S5 and S9, calling it S7, and so on, until he has built a com­
plete interval scale using as many samples and as fine a scale as desired.4
3.8.3.7  Magnitude Estimation (Interval, Ratio)
The observer is asked to directly score each sample for the magnitude of the attribute of 
interest.12,187,189,194,195 Often, the observer is given a reference image at the beginning of his 
scoring process, called an anchor, whose attribute of interest is identified with a moderately 
high, easy to remember score, such as 100. His scores are based on the reference and he is 
coached in various ways to use values that reflect ratios. This process implies that a zero 
attribute gets a zero response and hence generates a ratio scale. However actual observa­
tions sometimes are more in line with an interval scale, and this needs to be checked after 
the test.
3.8.3.8  Ratio Estimation (Ratio)
This test may be done by selecting samples that bear specific ratios to a reference image. 
The experimenter does not assign a value to the reference. Alternatively, the observers 
may be shown two or more specific images at a time and asked to state the apparent ratios 
between them for the attribute of interest.4,195
3.8.3.9  Semantic Differential (Ordinal, Interval)
Typically used for customer research.190 The image attributes of interest are selected and a 
set of bipolar adjectives is developed for the attributes. For example, if the attribute class 
were tone reproduction, the adjectives could be such pairs as darker–lighter, high contrast–
low contrast, good shadow detail–poor shadow detail. Each image in the experiment is 
then rated on a several point scale between each of the pairs. Each scale is treated as an 
interval scale and the respondents’ scores for each image and each adjective pair are aver­
aged. A profile is then displayed.
3.8.3.10  Likert Method (Ordinal)
Typically used for customer research and attitude surveys. A series of statements about the 
image quality attributes of a set of images is provided (e.g., “The overall tones are perfect in 

224 
Handbook of Optical and Laser Scanning
this images,” “the details in the dark parts of this image are very clear”). The respondents 
are then asked to rate each statement on the basis of the strength of their personal feelings 
about it: strongly agree (+2); agree (+1); indifferent (0); disagree (−1); strongly disagree (−2). 
Note signs on numbers reverse for negative statements. The statements used in the survey 
are often selected from a larger list of customer statements. A previous set of judges maybe 
was used to determine those statements that produce the greatest agreement in terms of 
scores assigned to this set of images.
3.8.3.11  Hybrids (Ordinal, Interval, Ratio)
There are many approaches that combine the better features of these different methods to 
enable handling different experimental constraints and obtaining more accurate or more 
precise results. A few are noted here:
	
1.	Paired Comparison for Ratio: Paired comparisons reduced to an interval scale that is 
fairly precise and transformed to accommodate a separate ratio technique (accu­
rate but less precise) to set a zero. This gives a highly precise ratio scale.197
	
2.	Paired Comparison Plus Category: The quality of each paired comparison is evalu­
ated by the observer, using something like a Likert scale below. A seven-level scale 
from strongly prefer “left” (e.g., +3) to strongly prefer “right” (e.g., −3) is used.206
	
3.	Paired Comparison Plus Distance using distance (e.g., linear scale on a piece of paper) 
to rate the magnitude of the difference between each pair, giving the same infor­
mation as the graphical rating methods discussed earlier, but with the added pre­
cision of paired comparison.
	
4.	Likert and Special Categories: A variety of nine-point symmetrical (about a center 
point) word scales can provide categories of preferences that are thought to be of 
equal intervals. One scale attributed to Bartleson194 goes from: Least imaginable 
“. . . ness” → very little “. . . ness” → mild “. . . ness” → moderate “. . . ness” → average 
“. . . ness” → moderate high “. . . ness” → high “. . . ness” → very high “. . . ness” → 
highest imaginable “. . . ness.” Another similar scale is 1 = Bad, 2 = Poor, 3 = Fair, 
4 = Good, 5 = Excellent. Many other such scales are found in the literature.
3.8.4  Practical Experimental Matters Including Statistics
Each of these techniques has been used in many imaging studies, each with special math­
ematical and procedural variations well beyond the scope of this chapter. A short list of 
common procedural concerns is given in Table 3.6 (from literature4,10,14,29 plus a few from 
the authors’ experience).
The * items represent a dozen practical factors that must always be considered in design­
ing nearly any major experiment on image quality or attributes of images.
The statistical significance of the results are often overlooked but cannot be stressed 
enough. For an interval scaling experiment that samples a continuous variable like dark­
ness, standard deviations and means and subsequent confidence intervals on the responses 
can be calculated in straightforward ways to determine if the appearances of two samples 
are statistically different or to determine the quality of a curve fit. (See any statistics book 
on the confidence interval for two means given an estimate of the standard deviations for 
each sample’s score, or to determine the confidence for a regression.)

Image Quality for Scanning and Digital Imaging Systems 
225
In detection experiments it is often desired to know if two scanned images, which 
gave two different percentages of observers who saw a defect or an attribute, are signifi­
cantly different from each other (market researchers call such experiments sampling for 
attributes). This involves computing confidence intervals for proportions and therefore 
estimating standard errors for proportions, a procedure less commonly encountered in 
engineering. If p = the fraction of observers detecting an attribute, q = the fraction not 
detecting an attribute (note p + q = 1.0) and n = number of observers, assuming n is a very 
small fraction of the population being sampled, then the standard error for proportions is

where, for example, Z = 1.96 for 95% confidence and 1.28 for 80%. A few cases are illus­
trated in Table 3.7 to give the reader perspective on the precision of such experiments and 
the number of observers required. The first column shows the value of p, the fraction of 
observers finding the attribute of interest. The second column gives the confidence desired 
in % where 95 is common in many experiments, and 80 is about the lowest confidence cited

in many texts and statistical tables. The numbers reported in the table are the deviations 
about the fraction in column one that constitute the confidence interval for the population 
of all observers that would detect the attribute. The unbolded italic numbers correspond to 
values οf p that cannot be realized by straightforward means for an observer population as 
small as indicated (e.g., a “p” value of 0.99 could not be observed with only four people—it 
would take 100!). As an example, for a sample with an attribute that was seen 90% of the 
time by a sample of 20 observers, one can be 80% confident that 82% to 98% (0.90 ± 0.08) of 
all observers would see this attribute. One would also be 95% confident that between 77% 
and 100% (numerically 103%, which here is equivalent to 100%) would see it.
3.9  REFERENCE DATA AND CHARTS
The following pages are a collection of charts, graphs, nomograms, and reference tables, 
which, along with several earlier ones, the authors find useful in applying first-order 
analyses to many image quality engineering problems. Needless to say, a small library of 
computer tools covering the same material would provide a useful package. In addition 
to those in this section, there are a few graphs, charts, and tables of value to engineering 
projects included in the text where their tutorial value was considered more important.
These include Figure 3.17 on CIE standard observer color matching function, Figure 3.20 
on scan frequency effects, Figure 3.22 on nonuniformity guidelines, Figures 3.30 and 3.31 
on MTF, and, finally, Figure 3.37 on edge noise calculations. The tables include Table 3.1 on 
halftone calculations, Table 3.3, which serves as a directory to Figures 3.50 to 3.53 in this 
section, and Table 3.7, giving confidence intervals for proportions.
In this section additional graphs on basic colorimetry are provided as Figure 3.46 for a 
more precise x, y chromaticity diagram with a dominant wavelength example and some

sources. Table 3.8 gives useful conversions between imaging oriented variables of density or 
reflectance and colorimetry units of L* (see also Figure 3.19).
Figures 3.48–3.50 show, through annotations, the important structures in useful indus­
try standard test patterns, two each for monochrome in Figure 3.48 and 3.50 and one for 
color in Figure 3.49 (reproduced here in black and white). Figure 3.48a is the monochrome 
ISO 12233 reflection test chart for testing digital still cameras which is also well suited 
to testing flat platen scanners for detail rendition and resolving power. Figure 3.48b is 
a monochrome test pattern suited for measuring pictorial monochrome scanners using 
methods referred to in ISO 16067 (see Table 3.9). Unlike Figure 3.48a which is two-level 
pattern, it contains a range of gray information to allow mapping tonal response and MTF 
analysis. Notice that both have many tilted edges and lines to show a wide range of sam­
pling phases as well as untilted ones. Bar pattern and edge patterns are suited to software 
analysis of spatial frequency response using gray response while resolving power targets 
can be measured directly and visually with a monitor under magnification.
Next are some useful MTF equations and their corresponding graphs (plotted in log–log 
form for easy graphical cascading).

to certain cases of actual scanner MTF performance. These are shown in Figure 3.54 
where n = the power of the [sine πDN/πDN] term. In one case averaging over all sampling 
phases with an ideal sensor (where the sensor width = array spacing, i.e. 100% fill), the 
n = 2 case was a good approximation. In the case of several real film scanners (Reference 
200) where other degradations from optics enter in, the n = 3 case was shown to be a good 
fit. Finally it appears that some inexpensive flatbed scanners which have even more deg­
radation fit the n = 4 case.
Figure 3.55 presents data on four representative modem films, plotted here to provide 
perspective on the range of practical photographic characteristics. They are shown here to 
set scanning performance in perspective. These are not intended to be performance speci­
fications of specific films.
Lastly we finish the reference curves with visual performance relationships. Figure 3.56 
illustrates recently developed visual contrast sensitivity curves (related to MTF of linear 
systems) including color components of vision, after Fairchild,4 drawn with scales relating 
to the earlier published visual frequency response characteristics shown in Figure 3.31.

scanning. His outstanding contributions to Xerox research and the careers and ideas of 
many he worked with at Xerox, as a consultant and in the general technical community, are 
widely regarded with the highest esteem. The previous edition of this chapter would not 
have been completed without his efforts, as he continued to help in its editing, even during 
his last days. We all miss his learned advice, special humor, and profound insights.
Contributions  We are indebted to Cherie Wright, John Moore, David Lieberman, Roger 
Triplett, and others on the staff of the Imaging Sciences Engineering and Technology 
Center of the Strategic Programs Development Unit at Xerox Corporation for their helpful 
participation and support in the preparation of enduring parts of the earlier version of this 
chapter, and to Xerox Corporation for the use of their resources. I’d also like to thank my 
colleagues in the Imaging and Photographic Technology Department201 at RIT for their 
support as I reworked the current edition. All illustrations, except as noted, are original 
drawings created for purposes of this chapter. However, those inspired by another author’s 
way of illustrating a complex topic or providing a collection of useful data, reference his 
or her contribution with the note “(From Reference___).” We are grateful for these authors’ 
ideas or data, which we could build on here. We also wish to thank our reviewers Martin 
Banton, Guarav Sharma, Robert Loce, and Keith Knox for their time and many valuable 
suggestions, and our wives Jane Lehmbeck and Mary Urbach for their support and encour­
agement during work on the earlier edition and Jane during the current revision.

4.1  INTRODUCTION
Polygonal scanners have found a role in a wide range of applications including inspection, 
laser printing, medical imaging, laser marking, laser radar, and displays, to name a few. 
Ever since the laser was first discovered, engineers have needed a means to move the laser 
output in a repetitive format.
The term “polygonal scanner” refers to a category of scanners that incorporate a rotat­
ing optical element with three or more reflective facets. The optical element in a polygonal 
scanner is usually a metal mirror. In addition to the polygonal scanner other scanners can 
have as few as one facet such as a pentaprism, cube beam splitter, or “monogon.” This sec­
tion will concentrate on scanners that use a metal mirror as the optical element.
Polygonal scanners are not the only technology available to move an optical beam. These 
other technologies include galvanometers, micromirrors, hologons, piezo mirrors, and 
acousto-optic deflectors. Each technology has a niche where it excels. Polygonal scanners 
excel in applications requiring unidirectional scans, high scan rates, large apertures, large 
scan angles, or high throughputs. The polygonal scanner in most applications is paired 
with another means for beam steering or object motion to produce a second axis. This cre­
ates a raster image with the polygonal scanner producing the fast scan axis of motion.
This chapter will provide information on types of scan mirrors, fabrication techniques 
to create these mirrors, and typical specifications for these mirrors. The motor and bearing 
systems used with the mirror to construct a scanner are covered. A section on properly 
specifying a polygonal scanner as well as the cost drivers in the scanner design is included. 
The incorporation of the scanner into a scan system including system level specifications 
and design approaches is reviewed. The final section covers system image defects and 
methods used to compensate for these defects in a scanning system.
4.2  TYPES OF SCANNING MIRRORS

4.2.1  Prismatic Polygonal Scanning Mirrors
A regular prismatic polygon is defined as one having a number of plane mirror facets that 
are parallel to, equidistant from, and face away from a central rotational axis (Figure 4.1). 
This type of scan mirror is used to produce repetitive scans over the same image plane. It 
is the most cost effective to manufacture and therefore finds its way into the vast majority 
of applications including barcode scanning and laser printing. An illustration of why the 
manufacturing cost can be lower than other types of scan mirrors is shown in Figure 4.2.

Handbook of Optical and Laser Scanning
Here we see a stack of mirrors that can be moved through the manufacturing process as a 
single piece resulting in less handling, more consistency, and less machining time.
4.2.2  Pyramidal Polygonal Scanning Mirrors
A regular pyramidal polygon is defined as one having a number of facets inclined at the 
same angle, usually 45°, to the rotational axis (Figure 4.3). This type of polygon is expen­
sive to manufacture since one cannot stack mirrors together to process at the same time as 
is done with regular prismatic polygons.
A significant feature of the 45° pyramidal polygon is that it can produce half the output 
scan angle of a prismatic polygon for the same amount of shaft rotation. This feature can 
be used to the system designer’s advantage by reducing data rates for a given polygon 
rotation speed. Prismatic polygons are used primarily with the input beam perpendicular 
to the rotation axis whereas pyramidal polygons are used primarily with the input beam 
parallel to the rotation axis (Figure 4.4).
4.2.3  “Monogons”
“Monogons” are scan mirrors where there is only one facet centered on the rotational axis. 
Because there is only one facet, a monogon is not a true polygon but is an important subset 
of the scan mirror family. Monogons are also referred to as truncated mirrors and find 
application in internal drum scanning. In a typical system employing a monogon, the laser 
is directed toward the monogon along the rotation axis and the output sweeps a circle on 
an internal drum as the scanner rotates. This type of scan system can produce very accu­
rate spot placement and very high resolution and finds application in the prepress market. 
An example of a monogon scan mirror is shown in Figure 4.5.
4.2.4  Irregular Polygonal Scanning Mirrors
An irregular polygonal scanning mirror is defined as one having a number of plane fac­
ets that are at a variety of angles with respect to, and face away from, the rotational axis 
FIGURE 4.3

(Figure 4.6). The unique feature of this type of scan mirror is that it can produce a raster 
output without a second axis of motion. The resulting output scans are nonsuperimposing 
if the facets are at different angles. This type of scanner finds its way into coarse scanning 
applications such as:
	
1.	Point-of-sale barcode readers
	
2.	Laser heat-treating systems
	
3.	Low resolution writing and display systems

These polygons typically cost significantly more than regular polygons because their asymme­
try prevents cost savings from stacking. Another disadvantage of these scanners is the inherent 
dynamic imbalance of the polygon during rotation. This limits use to low-speed applications. 
A special case where equal and opposing facets are used on each side of the polygon helps 
with the balance problem. The result is the scan pattern is generated twice each revolution.
Now that the types of scan mirrors have been covered, a logical next step is to consider 
the materials used to fabricate the mirrors. The following section addresses the most com­
mon materials in use today.
4.3  MATERIALS
Material selection for polygonal mirrors is driven by considerations of performance and cost. 
The most common materials for polygonal mirrors are aluminum, plastic, and beryllium. 
Facet distortion/flatness is a key performance consideration when choosing a material.
Aluminum represents a good trade-off between cost and performance. This material 
has good stiffness, is relatively light, and lends itself to low-cost fabrication methods. The 
upper limit for the use of aluminum mirrors without the risk of facet distortion beyond 
λ/10 is on the order of a tip velocity of 76 m/s. Above this speed the size of the facet, the 
disc shape, and the mounting method all play a role in the distortion of the facet. It is 
recommended that a finite element analysis be performed if you intend to operate above 
this level. An example of the shape change due to high-speed rotation, for a six-faceted 
polygon, is shown in Figure 4.7.
Plastic is used in applications where cost is the primary concern and performance is 
good enough for the application. An example is in the hand-held barcode market and 
other short-range, low-resolution scanning applications. Injection molding techniques 
have come far in the past few years but it is still difficult to reliably produce plastic mirrors 
larger than 2-mm diameter with facets flat to better than 1 wave.
Beryllium has been used successfully in applications where high speed and low distor­
tion are required. It is a very expensive substrate and produces toxic dust when machined, 
requiring specialized extraction and filtration equipment. Therefore it does not find wide 
usage and is a very expensive solution. Beryllium is typically nickel plated prior to polish­
ing. The nickel plating seals in the beryllium and removes the risk of toxic dust.
FIGURE 4.6

In some high-speed applications, distortions in facet flatness can be tolerated. In these 
cases the structural integrity of the polygonal mirror must be considered. The speed at 
which the dynamic stress will reach the yield strength (causing permanent distortion and 
dangerously close to the breaking speed) is found using the formula below.1

where B = maximum safe speed (rpm), S = yield strength (lb/in2), w = weight of material 
(lb/in3), R = outer tip radius (in), r = inner bore radius (in), and m = Poisson’s ratio. This 
formula does not have a margin of safety, so it would be wise to consider this and back off 
the results by an appropriate margin.
4.4  POLYGONAL MIRROR FABRICATION TECHNIQUES
Aluminum is the most common substrate for the fabrication of polygonal mirrors. There 
are two techniques for fabricating aluminum polygons that are widely used. These tech­
niques are conventional polishing and single point diamond turning. Each technique has 
its advantages and the application will usually dictate the technique used.
4.4.1  Conventional Polishing
Conventional polishing in this context is pitch lapping in much the same manner as glass 
lenses and prisms are polished. A polishing tool is covered with a layer of pitch and a 
polishing compound is used that is a slurry composed of iron oxide and water. The pitch 
lap rubs against the optic using the polishing compound to remove material. Pitch lapping 
can be used to produce high-quality surfaces on a number of materials. Unfortunately, alu­
minum is not one of them. The aluminum surface is too susceptible to scratches during the

polishing process. New techniques have been developed, but these rely on minimal abra­
sive mixtures and therefore material removal rates that are too slow to be cost effective.
Because one cannot polish the aluminum directly, a plating must be applied prior to pol­
ishing. Electroless nickel is the most common plating applied. This combination provides 
the low cost and ease of machining of the aluminum substrate with the superior polishing 
properties and durability of nickel. The mirror facets are polished individually, blocked 
up in a surround as shown in Figure 4.8. If the polygonal mirror is regular then a stack of 
polygons can be polished in one setup.
4.4.2  Single Point Diamond Turning
Single point diamond machining is a process of material removal using a finely sharpened 
single-crystal diamond-cutting tool. Diamond machining centers are available in the form 
of lathes and mills. The use of ultra-precise air-bearing spindles and hydrostatic table 
ways, coupled with vibration isolating mounting pads, enables machining to optical qual­
ity surface specifications. Figure 4.9 shows a diamond machining center with a polygon 
in process.
Diamond machining has proven to be an efficient process for generating optical surfaces 
since it can be automated and the process time is a small fraction of the time required 
for conventional polishing. The diamond machined mirror is typically fabricated from 
aluminum, but satisfactory results have been obtained on other substrates. The diamond 
machined mirror face appears to be a perfect mirror, but upon close inspection the resid­
ual tool marks on the surface are apparent. These tool marks create a grating pattern on the 
surface. This grating pattern can increase the scatter coming from the surface, particularly 
at wavelengths below 500 nm.
4.4.3  Polishing versus Diamond Turning
Diamond turned aluminum scan mirrors are by far used in the highest volumes. This is 
due to the low manufacturing cost and good performance characteristics. Polished mirrors,

Polygonal Scanners: Components, Performance, and Design

however, have found a niche where they outperform diamond turned mirrors and justify 
the higher cost. These applications tend to be very scatter sensitive, such as writing on 
film. A polished mirror can approach surface roughness levels of 10 Å rms whereas dia­
mond turned mirrors are limited to roughness levels of about 40 Å rms. Short-wavelength 
applications may also require the lower scatter of a polished mirror surface. Applications 
below 400 nm frequently need the lower scatter level of polished mirrors and the scatter 
can be a problem in applications up to about 500 nm.
There is also a difference in the type of scatter produced by the two surface types. 
Polished surfaces tend to produce lambertian scatter pattern which has a large wide-angle 
component whereas diamond turned surfaces produce a large percentage of low angle 
scatter. The low angle scatter travels along a path close to the specular reflection so it can 
be difficult to mask out in an optical system.
4.5  POLYGON SPECIFICATIONS
In addition to selecting the type of polygon, the material to use, and the fabrication tech­
nique, several mechanical specifications need to be established. In a perfect world the poly­
gon would have exactly the dimensions and angles that we specify on a print. Real-world 
manufacturing limitations cause us to have to add in a practical set of tolerances on the 
polygon and evaluate how these imperfections would affect system performance. Some of 
the items that need to be specified on a polygonal mirror include:
	
1.	Facet-to-facet angle variance
	
2.	Pyramidal error
	
3.	Facet-to-axis variance (total and adjacent facet)

4.5.1  Facet-to-Facet Angle Variance
The definition of facet-to-facet angle variance (Δ) is the variation in the angle between 
the normals (y) of the adjacent facets on the polygon (Figure 4.10). This variation in angle 
causes timing errors from one facet to the next as the polygon rotates. Typical values for 
this angle range from ±5 arc s to ±30 arc s. Most scanning systems are not sensitive to 
errors in this range because of the use of start of scan sensors and/or encoders.
This, as well as all other angular tolerances, is a mechanical measure. The system 
designer needs to ensure that everyone is discussing these errors in mechanical rather 
than optical terms since there is a factor of two involved between the mechanical toler­
ances and the optical effects.
4.5.2  Pyramidal Error
Pyramidal error is defined as the average variation (Ω) from the desired angle between the 
facet and the mirror datum (Figure 4.11). This variation results in a pointing error of the 
output beam and can also cause scan line bow. Typical values for this specification are ±1 
arc minute (mechanical).
4.5.3  Facet-to-Axis Variance
This is defined as the total variation of the pyramidal error from all the facets within one 
polygon (Figure 4.12). This is a critical specification for the mirror and contributes to a 
scanner specification of dynamic track, discussed later. Typical values for this specification 
range from 2 arc s to 60 arc s (mechanical).

Another parameter related to this is the adjacent facet-to-axis variance. This is defined as 
the largest step in the pyramidal angle from one facet to the next within a polygon. This is 
important to control in order to reduce banding artifacts in the final system. Typical values 
for this specification are in the range of 1–30 arc s (mechanical).
Optical scanning systems may employ correction devices that allow this value to be 
reduced. System resolution plays a large part in determining the actual value required. 
Film writing applications tend to have the tightest requirements and passive reading sys­
tems tend to have the loosest requirements.
4.5.4  Facet Radius
The facet radius (referred to as facet height by some manufacturers) is the distance from 
the center of the polygon to the facet. The variation in this radius within the polygon 
and the tolerance on the average radius are important to specify. The average facet 
radius is important because it locates the facet in the optical system. The variation of 
this radius within a polygon causes errors in the focal plane location from one facet to 
the next. It also causes velocity variations within the scan line, which are usually small 
and show up as jitter errors. Typical values for these parameters are ±60 microns for 
the facet radius average position and ±25 microns for the facet radius variation within 
a polygon.

4.5.5  Surface Figure
Surface figure is the macro shape of the polygon facet and is measured as the deviation 
from an ideal flat surface. The flatness of polygon facets will have an impact both on the 
aberrations in the beam as well as the pointing of the beam. The aberrations can affect the 
final focused spot size in the scan system. The pointing error results in velocity variations 
across the scan.
Several factors influence the flatness of polygon facets:
	
1.	Initial fabrication tolerances
	
2.	Distortion due to mounting stresses
	
3.	Distortion due to forces induced when rotating at high speeds
	
4.	Distortion due to long-term stress relief
Interferometers are commonly used to measure static flatness. The flatness is specified 
in wavelengths, λ, (or fractions thereof) of light. A typical flatness specification is: λ/8 at 
633 nm. Departure from flatness can have a variety of forms, depending on how the sur­
face was fabricated. For example, conventionally polished mirror surfaces tend to depart 
from flat in a regular spherical form, either convex or concave. Diamond machined surfaces 
usually depart from flat in a regular cylindrical form, either convex or concave. A polygon 
will typically have two specifications related to flatness, a surface power specification and 
irregularity. The irregularity is defined as the deviation from a best-fit sphere. Another 
common way of specifying the optical surface is in terms of power and pv—power (peak 
to valley error minus power), which separate the regular and irregular shapes. Most poly­
gons used in printing applications are specified in the λ/8 to λ/10 range at the wavelength 
of interest.
4.5.6  Surface Quality and Scatter
Ideally a reflective optical surface will reflect all of the incident light without introducing 
any scattered components. In reality an optical surface has multiple defects of various 
sizes. The U.S. military developed a scratch and dig specification for surface defects, which 
is included in MIL-PRF-13830B and is in broad use within the optics industry. This method 
of quality determination involves close examination of a surface and identifying a scratch 
and dig level in a given unit area. A typical high-quality conventionally polished polygon 
will have a quality level of 40–20 scratch and dig.
Machined optical surfaces on the other hand, are made up of a precise regular pattern 
of machine tool marks, which are sufficiently high in frequency and low in height errors 
as to behave as a plane mirror at most visible and infrared wavelengths. The scratch and 
dig specification must be supplemented with an additional measure of surface quality 
here. A more representative definition for the overall surface quality is the rms surface 
roughness. The rms surface roughness can be measured directly by mechanical or optical 
profilometry means or indirectly by measuring the scatter from the surface.
A special test system is required to measure the scatter from the surface and correlate 
this to an rms roughness value. Different tests must be used for the measurement of scat­
ter of diamond turned and conventionally polished mirrors. Diamond turned surfaces 
produce a significant fraction of scattered energy in a narrow cone around the reflected 
beam. Conventionally polished mirrors have the majority of their scattered energy in a 
cone significantly greater than the divergence angle of the reflected beam.

Polygonal Scanners: Components, Performance, and Design 
259
Conventionally polished mirrors can be tested using an integrating sphere that gathers a 
wide cone angle (Figure 4.13). Scattered light in the cone of 4–180° is gathered with this test 
method. The diamond turned mirrors can be tested using a combination of the integrating 
sphere and a near angle test (Figure 4.14). Scattered light in the cone of 0.4–4° is gathered 
using this test.
A correlation has been developed between the rms surface roughness and the total inte­
grated scattered incident light:2

The combination of scratch and dig along with rms surface roughness provide a good 
description of the surface structure higher in frequency than surface figure.
4.6  THIN FILM COATINGS
There are two major functions of optical coatings on polygons: to improve the reflectance 
of the surface and/or to improve durability. In the case of diamond machined polygons, 
the substrate is usually aluminum (in itself a good reflector over most of the visible spec­
trum). This aluminum surface is too soft without a coating. It is easily scratched during 
even a light cleaning so one solution is to apply a thin layer of silicon monoxide, a dielectric 
material, as a surface protector. The optical thickness is usually about one-half wavelength 
at the wavelength of interest. This material is more durable than the base aluminum and 
can be readily cleaned. The coating just described is typically referred to as a protected 
aluminum coating. This coating has a reflectivity of >88% across the 450–650 nm range.
The protected aluminum coating is fine for many applications and because of its simplic­
ity is relatively inexpensive. Many applications, however, require enhancement coatings 
due to needs for higher reflectivity performance at various wavelengths.
The first layer deposited in most applications is a binding layer, then a metal, such as 
aluminum, silver, or gold. The layer or layers above the metal are composed of dielectric 
materials. The metal is selected based on the wavelengths of interest. As mentioned earlier, 
aluminum is a good choice in the visible region. It is also selected for ultraviolet applica­
tions since its reflectivity can be enhanced in this region with a dielectric stack. Gold is 
often selected as the base metal in applications above 600 nm. It has good reflectivity at 
600 nm (90%) and very good reflectivity from 1 micron, out past 10.6 microns (>98%).
Silver exhibits very desirable reflectance characteristics over a broad spectrum and is fre­
quently considered as a material for polygon coating. In practice, however, it is frequently 
a disappointing choice for the long term. The slightest pinhole (or minute scratch from 
cleaning) will expose the silver to reactive contaminants from the atmosphere, which over 
time (several days or weeks) will diffuse into the silver, producing an expanding blemish. 
Aluminum, which initially exhibits somewhat lower values of reflectance than silver, is far 
superior in terms of durability.
Common dielectric materials used to protect the surface and enhance reflectivity are sil­
icon monoxide, silicon dioxide, hafnium oxide, and titanium dioxide. A quarter wave stack 
combining high refractive index and low refractive index materials is used to enhance 
the reflectivity in the wavelength region of interest. The term quarter wave stack refers 
to an alternating series of high and low index materials that are one-quarter of an opti­
cal wavelength thick at the wavelength of interest. The design of this quarter wave stack 
can be tailored to raise the reflectivity of the base metal significantly in various regions of 
interest. Most companies will offer a variety of standard reflectivity enhancing coatings 
for different wavelengths.
Thin film coatings are applied in vacuum deposition chambers such as the one shown 
in Figure 4.15. The tooling to coat a polygon is specialized because the polygon has opti­
cal surfaces around its periphery. The polygons are stacked onto coating arbors that are 
placed in the chamber above the evaporant sources. The arbors are rotated with a drive 
mechanism during the deposition process at a constant rate so that all facets will see the 
same thickness of coating material. The rotation rate must be fast enough that the time for 

Polygonal Scanners: Components, Performance, and Design 
261
one revolution is a small fraction of the deposition time for a single layer. Otherwise there 
will be significant variation around the polygon depending on when the shutter is opened 
and closed.
Reflectance uniformity both within a facet and facet-to-facet is an important poly­
gon specification. The reflectance uniformity can impact the accuracy of written or read 
images. In practice, the reflectance uniformity of rather large polygon facets (e.g., a few 
inches square) is more difficult to achieve than if the facets are small (e.g., 1
2in square). This 
has to do with the consistency of the cleaning of the surface prior to coating and the varia­
tions in deposition rates with location and time within the coating chamber.
Aluminum polygons cannot be heated up to high temperatures during a coating run as 
one would typically do for good adhesion and layer density. The shape of the polygons 
makes them susceptible to slight stress changes during this heating cycle. This results in 
changes to the facet flatness. The coating process should be designed to keep the polygons 
below a temperature of 225°C to maintain the flatness.
Crucial to all of the desired characteristics of the coating of a polygon is its cleanliness 
prior to coating. Irrespective of the fabrication methods, polygons will be handled prior to 
coating during the inspection processes, transport, and installation into the coating cham­
ber. The polygon must be cleaned thoroughly to remove foreign material that will degrade 
surface quality, prevent good coating adhesion, or outgas in the coating system.
Several tools are available to measure the optical performance of the coating. Common 
measuring tools to determine reflectance are spectrophotometers and laser reflectometers. 
Spectrophotometers are used to provide information on the reflectance versus wavelength. 
The majority of spectrophotometers with a reflectance measuring attachment are limited 
to small sample sizes on the order of 1 to 2 in in diameter. This fact usually precludes 
measuring the polygon itself. A witness sample is coated at the same time as the polygon 
and can be used to represent the actual part performance. This can be a reliable method of 
ascertaining the performance of the polygon as long as the witness sample has a similar 
surface preparation and quality level to the polygon. This means that diamond turned 
witness samples should be used with diamond turned polygons and polished witness 
samples used with polished mirrors.

Handbook of Optical and Laser Scanning
Laser reflectometers compare the reflected beam to the incident beam at a specific wave­
length and can be designed to test over a range of angles with either S or P polarization. 
Reflectometers are useful for determining performance at one specific wavelength but 
cannot provide broadband information.
4.7  MOTORS AND BEARING SYSTEMS
The polygonal mirror requires a bearing system and a drive mechanism to turn it into 
a functional scanner. Drive mechanisms include pneumatic, AC hysteresis synchronous, 
and brushless DC. Bearing systems used in most applications are ball bearing, aerostatic 
air bearings, or aerodynamic air bearings.
4.7.1  Pneumatic Drives
Much of today’s scan mirror technology has evolved from the development of ultra-
high-speed polygon/turbine motors for the high-speed photography industry. Compressed 
air turbines continue to offer an attractive method of rotating a polygonal mirror at speeds 
beyond the capability of electric motors. The advantages of turbine drives are:
	
1.	Substantial horsepower can be delivered to the scan mirror to produce rapid accel­
eration and very high speed (up to 1,000,000 rpm).
	
2.	Compact in size and low in weight in proportion to delivered power.
	
3.	Can be equipped with shaft seals so that the scan mirror can be used in a partial 
vacuum.
The disadvantages of turbine drives are:
	
1.	Require a compressed air source
	
2.	Asynchronous devices
	
3.	Relatively high in cost
	
4.	Relatively short total running life
Pneumatic drives are only recommended for short duty cycles and where ultra-high 
speed is essential.
4.7.2  Hysteresis Synchronous Motors
The rotor of a hysteresis synchronous motor is usually fabricated from a single piece of 
hardened steel selected out of a group (predominantly alloyed with cobalt) that exhibits 
substantial hysteresis loss. This resistance to the movement of magnetic flux in the mate­
rial imparts torque to a rotor out of sync with the drive current. This torque is responsible 
for the motor’s ability to start rotation. When the rotor approaches the speed of the stator 
flux, it becomes permanently magnetized and “locks in” to synchronism with the drive. If 
the motor is turned off and restarted, the stator flux demagnetizes the rotor and hysteresis

takes over again. The synchronous mode of operation is more efficient than the hysteresis 
or startup mode, and in many systems a sync detector is used to reduce drive current after 
the motor is locked in to save energy and reduce heating.
AC hysteresis synchronous motors exhibit a characteristic called phase jitter (hunting). 
The rotors behave as though they were coupled to the drive waveform by a spring. Within 
synchronism the rotor springs forward and back in phase at a rate determined by the 
spring rate (flux density) and the torque/inertia ratio of the system. Typically, the frequency 
of this phase jitter is in the range of 0.5–3 Hz, at an amplitude of a few degrees (1–6° peak 
to peak). Under perfect conditions this jitter damps to zero values of amplitude. However, 
perfection is seldom seen and continual recurrence of jitter may be expected, caused by 
electrical transients on the input, mechanical shock to the assembly, variable resistance 
torque of the motor bearings, and so on. For many systems the 0.5–0.01% velocity error 
contribution of phase jitter is acceptably small. If this is not the case then a feedback loop 
is needed to reduce this level.
4.7.3  Brushless DC Motors
Brushless DC motors are by far the most common motor used to drive polygonal scanners. 
These motors use a permanent motor magnet and a stator that supplies the varying mag­
netic force. Motor magnets are composed of various materials including neodymium and 
ferrite depending on the application. Stators can be iron-based or ironless, with or without 
teeth. The number of magnetic poles is usually determined by the operating speed. Low-
speed motors tend to have higher pole counts (8–12) while higher speed motors (>10,000 
rpm) tend to have lower pole counts (4–6). The reason for the large number of poles at low 
speed is to achieve smoother rotation. At higher speeds this is not required and the lower 
pole count motors have less losses because the stator flux speed is lower.
Brushless motors do not have the hunting problem associated with AC hysteresis syn­
chronous motors. The motor controls used to drive these motors can hold a tighter control 
loop. These motors can exhibit more high-frequency variations due to the torque available 
to rapidly change speed. This high-frequency velocity change is referred to as jitter. The 
amount of jitter is related to the rotor inertia and the number of feedback pulses per revolu­
tion. At higher speeds the inertia smoothes out the rotation and limits the amount of jitter. 
At lower speeds the number of feedback pulses helps keep the control loop errors small 
and therefore less velocity jitter when the motor has a correction torque applied. Hall effect 
devices are used at higher speeds to provide magnetic position feedback to the controller. 
Hall effect devices at lower speeds, where inertia is lower, can induce jitter as the controller 
chases the positional and triggering errors of the Hall effect devices. At lower speeds an 
encoder on the rotor may be required to achieve low jitter levels. Even incremental encod­
ers can induce jitter errors due to disc quality, alignment, and component quality.
4.7.4  Bearing Types
Polygonal scanners require a bearing support system to allow the rotor to rotate. The most 
common bearings used in scanners are:
	
1.	Ball bearings
	
2.	Aerostatic air bearings
	
3.	Aerodynamic air bearings

264 
Handbook of Optical and Laser Scanning
These three types of bearing systems are discussed in detail in other chapters in this book. 
Ball bearings are used where possible due to their low cost. Applications requiring speeds 
less than 20,000 rpm and that can tolerate bearing nonrepeatable errors, both in scan and 
cross scan, are candidates for ball bearings.
Aerodynamic air bearings have made large inroads in laser scanning since the 1980s. An 
aerodynamic bearing generates its own air pressure as it rotates. It is commonly designed 
with two close-fitting cylinders for the radial bearing. The axial bearing can be either an 
air thrust bearing or magnetic bearing. These systems have many advantages over both 
conventional ball bearing systems and aerostatic air bearings. The speed range for aero­
dynamic bearings is from approx. 4000 rpm to over 100,000 rpm. These bearings are only 
slightly more costly than an equivalent ball bearing system. There is no wear while operat­
ing and they require no external pressure support equipment. These bearings have been 
developed to withstand over 20,000 start/stop cycles. Aerodynamic bearings do have some 
limitations that limit their application. They are not well suited to dirty environments. 
Many designs exchange outside air frequently during operation, thereby ingesting the 
outside debris. Most designs cannot withstand high shock loads because the bearing stiff­
ness is limited. The mass of the optic is limited in many applications due to both the lack of 
support and the need to withstand constant starting and stopping. Additional mass causes 
added wear to the bearing during startup and shutdown.
Aerostatic air bearings provide the ultimate in performance at a high cost. An aerostatic 
bearing uses pressurized air and closely spaced axial and radial bearing surfaces to float 
the rotor. When pressurized, the bearing has no contacting parts, resulting in extremely 
long life. These bearings are very stiff and have wobble errors less than 1 arc s. They are 
capable of supporting heavy loads and do not suffer from wear at startup and shutdown. 
They do require external components to supply the pressure to the bearing. This increases 
system complexity as well as cost.
4.8  SCANNER SPECIFICATIONS
Once the polygon, motor, and bearing system have been decided on, the packaging of the 
assembly becomes the next concern. One of the key elements in attaining high scanner 
performance is the mounting of the scan mirror to the rotating spindle.
To preserve the facet flatness achieved during initial polygon fabrication, it is necessary 
to fasten the polygon to its drive spindle with care, particularly if λ/8 or better flatness is 
required. The interface between the mirror and the rotor must not induce stress in the mir­
ror that is translated out to the facets.
A typical mounting scheme is shown in Figure 4.16. In this case the datum surface of the 
polygon and the locating annulus of the mounting hub are lapped to optical quality so that 
when the two are firmly held together, distortions are minimized.
Equally important to the accurate mounting of mirror datum and rotor hub surfaces is 
cleanliness at assembly and the appropriate torque levels of the fastening screws. Polygons 
can be attached in the manner described in low- and medium-speed applications. When 
tip velocities approach 76 m/s, other methods of mounting need to be considered.
In many applications the facets can be allowed to distort as long as they all change by the 
same amount. A symmetrical mounting method with screws aligned with every apex will 
work in this type of application. Other applications cannot stand significant shape change 

Polygonal Scanners: Components, Performance, and Design

on the facets and require a true radially symmetric mounting method such as clamping. 
Clamping has been used successfully but this also requires a radial attachment means that 
may consist of an elastic material or aluminum shaped to have a spring force.
Once the polygonal mirror is integrated with the motor and the bearing system it can 
be referred to as a polygonal scanner. The scanner assembly is defined by performance 
specifications that include:
	
1.	Dynamic track
	
2.	Jitter
	
3.	Speed stability
	
4.	Balance
	
5.	Perpendicularity
	
6.	Time to sync
4.8.1  Dynamic Track
Dynamic track is defined as the total mechanical angular variation of the facets perpen­
dicular to the scanning direction. This is illustrated in Figure 4.17. An optical beam illu­
minating a polygon with a dynamic track of 10 arc s will have a scan envelope from all the

facets of 20 arc s perpendicular to the scan direction. This is caused by an angle doubling 
effect on reflection from the rotating mirror.
There are four significant contributors to dynamic track error. The first is the polygon itself, 
which has a variation in the angle of each facet and can have a residual pyramidal (squareness) 
error. The second contribution comes from the mounting of the polygon to the rotating shaft. 
If the polygon is not perfectly perpendicular to the rotating shaft, then the facets will change 
their pointing in a sinusoidal manner with a period of one revolution. These first two contribu­
tions are fixed and repeatable. The third contribution is a random nonrepeatable error caused 
by the bearing support system. The random component of the dynamic track error will be 1–2 
arc s for a ball bearing assembly and less than 1 arc s for air bearing assemblies. The fourth 
contribution, which is a repeatable error, comes from the grinding operation performed on the 
mounting hub of the spindle. This hub needs to be perpendicular to the rotation axis of the 
spindle and typically a few arc s error is present due to the grinding tolerance.
The repeatable component of dynamic track (which tends to be larger) will show up in 
a laser writing system as a banding artifact. The line spacing will not be uniform and will 
repeat the pattern on each revolution of the polygon. Dynamic track errors can be reduced, 
if needed, through either active or passive correction means. These are methods discussed 
in Section 4.12.1.
4.8.2  Jitter and Speed Stability
Velocity errors from a polygonal scanner are important to minimize because they affect 
the pixel placement in a writing application and the receiving angle in a reading applica­
tion. Velocity errors have both repeatable and nonrepeatable components. The repeatable 
components are easier to deal with than the nonrepeatable errors.
Specifications for velocity errors are broken into both high-frequency (jitter) and low-
frequency (speed stability) components. The high-frequency components range from 
pixel-to-pixel to once per revolution. The low-frequency components are over multiple 
revolutions. There are many elements of the scanner system that contribute to either jitter 
or speed stability errors. These contributing elements are shown in Table 4.1.
This is a long, but certainly not exhaustive, list of causative elements contributing or 
potentially contributing to velocity errors. It becomes obvious that the entire scanner opti­
cal system is involved and influences the speed stability measurement and result.
4.8.3  Balance
Polygonal scanners are rotational devices that can operate at high speeds. As such, they 
need to be properly balanced to reduce the amount of imbalance forces generated dur­
ing operation. This includes compensating for both static and dynamic imbalance. This 
requires that a two-plane balancing system be used. In a two-plane balancing system sen­
sors are located at two separated planes where correction weights are to be applied. The 
sensors record the magnitude and phase of the imbalance.
Various methods of either adding or removing weight are used to balance scanners. The 
most common techniques are:
	
1.	Drill balancing
	
2.	Epoxy balancing
	
3.	Screw balancing
	
4.	Grind balancing

Polygonal Scanners: Components, Performance, and Design 
267
The preferred approach for high-speed operation is either grinding or drilling to remove 
material. The addition of material always brings risk of improper attachment and slinging 
of bonding agents.
Unbalance is typically measured in mg mm, a mass multiplied by the distance from the 
rotational axis. An unbalance of 100 mg mm, for example, indicates one side of the rotor 
has excess mass equivalent to 100 mg at a 1-mm radius. Typical values for small high-
speed scanners range from 10 to 100 mg mm. The impact of unbalance on a scanner is 
vibration. This vibration can be measured and from this the actual scanner unbalance can 
be calculated.
4.8.4  Perpendicularity
Another important scanner parameter is the perpendicularity of the rotation axis to 
the mounting datum. This is important to ensure proper pointing of the beam after 
reflection from the polygon and to minimize the bow that can be created by striking 
the polygon out of the rotation plane. A typical specification for perpendicularity is 3 to 
5 arc minutes.

4.8.5  Time to Synchronization
The time that it takes for the scanner to reach operating speed from a stopped condition 
can be important in some applications. This is a function of the motor/winding and the 
available current as well as the rotor inertia and the windage that must be overcome as the 
scanner approaches operating speed. Typical values range from 3 to 60 s.
4.9  SCANNER COST DRIVERS
Polygonal scanners can range from low-cost, easy-to-manufacture units, to high-cost state-
of-the-art devices. It is important when designing a scan system to understand the cost 
drivers. One should try to minimize the overall cost through system level trade-offs. The 
scanner assembly has many cost drivers including:
	
1.	Polygon shape
	
2.	Number of facets
	
3.	Fabrication method, conventionally polished or diamond turned
	
4.	Optical specifications including surface figure, surface roughness, and scratch/dig
	
5.	Coating requirements
	
6.	Polygon size
	
7.	Type of bearing system
	
8.	Speed
	
9.	Velocity stability
	 10.	Dynamic track specification
In an earlier section the various shapes of polygons were discussed. In order to reduce 
costs it is advisable when possible to select either a regular polygon or a monogon. The 
other polygon shapes have cost penalties that may or may not be justified based on the 
application. While polygons can be manufactured with any number of facets, fewer facets 
result in lower cost. This is not a large cost component in a diamond turned mirror but has 
a large impact on the cost of a polished mirror.
The selection of diamond turned or polished mirror has a major impact on scanner cost. 
Diamond turned mirrors are the lowest cost and have surface roughness values greater 
than 40 Å rms. Conventionally polished mirrors are more costly but can bring the surface 
roughness down to 10 Å rms. All but the most scatter-sensitive short-wavelength systems 
can use diamond turned mirrors.
The optical specification of surface figure can also have a large influence on cost. Optical 
surface figure values of λ/4 per inch at 633 nm are common but surface figure values down 
to λ/20 can be achieved at additional cost. A scratch/dig specification of 80/50 is a typical 
standard, but specifications down to 10/5 can be achieved at significantly higher cost.
The optical coating chosen for the polygon can have a minor impact on the cost. The 
lowest cost option is a simple aluminum coating with a silicon monoxide overcoat. As 
the reflectivity specifications get higher, more dielectric layers are needed to enhance 
the reflectivity, which can increase chamber time and therefore costs. Gold is another 

Polygonal Scanners: Components, Performance, and Design 
269
expensive coating option for the infrared. The inherent high reflectivity of gold across the 
IR spectrum is often worth the cost of the material.
Bearing selection can have a significant effect on cost. In the speed range of 500–4000 
rpm, the choice is between ball bearings and aerostatic air bearings. Ball bearing scanners 
are relatively low in cost and are the appropriate solution for many applications, but are 
susceptible to damage, generate many vibration frequencies, and can create motor speed 
instability. Aerostatic scanners are costly and require support equipment, but offer the 
ultimate in scanning performance.
The bearing choice in the speed range of 4000–20,000 rpm includes ball bearings, aero­
dynamic air bearings, and aerostatic air bearings. The selection is based on cost and 
performance criteria such as velocity stability and dynamic track. Above 20,000 rpm, aero­
dynamic air bearings are usually the best solution. These bearings are relatively low in 
cost and have long life operating at this speed. Ball bearings start to have life issues above 
20,000 rpm and aerostatic bearings usually are not cost effective.
Velocity stability standard specifications are a function of speed and mirror load. If 
speeds are too low or mirror loads too small then an encoder is required to achieve tight 
velocity stability. Velocity stability in this context is a measurement of the variation in the 
time for a beam reflected from the same facet of a scanner to cross two stationary detectors 
in an image plane over 500–1000 revolutions. Scanners operating faster than 4000 rpm can 
easily achieve 0.02% velocity stability. On most units this can be improved upon down to 
0.002% at additional cost. Below 4000 rpm the mirror load becomes very important. The 
lighter the mirror and slower the speed, the more difficult it is to achieve tight velocity 
stability.
A final significant cost driver is the track specification placed on the assembly. Mechanical 
track values of 45 arc s results in low-cost assemblies, but specifications as tight as 1 arc s 
can be achieved by some vendors at much higher costs. This specification is a serious cost 
driver, so it is recommended that you review your actual needs carefully to obtain the 
most cost-effective design.
4.10  SYSTEM DESIGN CONSIDERATIONS
Laser scanning systems based on polygon technology can take on a variety of forms. 
Systems can range from very simple to extremely complex based on the performance level 
required. The first system consideration is whether it will be a reading or writing system. 
Writing systems tend to have much tighter performance requirements than reading sys­
tems. This is due to the fact that writing system errors tend to be visible, whereas the same 
level of error in a reading system will not typically be great enough to impact data integ­
rity. A reading system, however, has the additional complexity of collecting the scattered 
light back from the target.
Reading systems will either use an external collection system that is separate from the 
scan system or an internal collection system where the scattered light passes back through 
the scan system and is derotated by the polygonal scanner. The internal collection sys­
tem places increased demands on the scan system by requiring less backscattered light 
and reduced ghost images. For laser radar systems, one often has a scanning system for 
transmitting the laser, and a separate receiver, with a synchronized scanner to avoid this 
problem. This, however, is a very expensive solution. Another approach taken with laser 

270 
Handbook of Optical and Laser Scanning
radar is to increase the facet width and separate the transmission and receive apertures. 
Care must be taken in the design to ensure that the receiver instantaneous field of view 
encompasses the transmitter output over the distance range desired. This topic is covered 
in greater detail in the chapter on laser radar later in this book.
Beyond having knowledge of the basic system configuration it is important to develop a 
thorough list of performance specifications when starting the system design process. A list 
of key parameters and typical values are shown in Table 4.2.
The list in Table 4.2 covers the majority of specifications that are placed on a scanning 
system. Some scan systems will require additional specifications based on the unique 
nature of the writing or reading application.
The optical system used in laser scanners can be separated into two generic types: pre-
objective and post-objective. Pre-objective is a term used to describe the use of a polygon to 
deflect a ray bundle, which after deflection is imaged by a lens or curved mirror (Figure 4.18). 
This method of scanning places the function of focal plane definition on the lens, referred 
to as a scan lens, rather than on the scanning facet. Several desirable characteristics can be 
designed into the scan lens when employed in pre-objective scanning. An example is a lens 
design referred to as F-Theta. An F-Theta lens has the following characteristics:
	
1.	A flat focal plane
	
2.	Uniform spot diameter over the entire scan
	
3.	Linear spot velocity at the scan plane (assuming constant angular velocity of the 
polygon)
Usually it is desirable to have the scanning spot move with a highly accurate and constant 
velocity in the scan plane. Polygonal mirror deflectors provide angular velocity stability in 
the range 0.002%–0.05%, depending on the speed and inertia of the scanner. Without the 
aid of an F-Theta lens, however, the spot velocity variation on a flat focal surface will be

proportional to the tangent of the scan angle, which for systems involving several degrees 
of scan means several percent variation.
Post-objective scanning is a term used to describe the use of a polygon to deflect a focus­
ing ray bundle over a focal surface (Figure 4.19). This method places the function of focal 
plane definition on the polygonal mirror, and the imaging (spot forming) lens is a rela­
tively simple component located prior to the polygon.
The focal surface of a post-objective scanner is curved. The center of curvature is the 
center of the polygon facet. This type of scan system is typically used when the scan plane 
can be curved to match the focal surface. Otherwise there are problems with spot size and 
velocity variations across the scan. The most popular system design incorporating post-
objective scanning is a drum scanner. A drum scanner uses a monogon mirror, usually at 
45°, with the source on the scan axis. As the monogon rotates, the focal surface is generated 
on the inside of a drum. Film or other flexible medium is located on this drum for image 
generation.

272 
Handbook of Optical and Laser Scanning
Post-objective scanning finds application in very high-resolution systems requiring 
greater than 25,000 points across the scan. Scanners designed for the prepress industry 
use this design technique quite often.
Another factor to consider when designing a scan system is the degree of telecentric­
ity required. A system is considered to be telecentric if the output from the scan system 
strikes the image plane at 90° for all points across the scan line. A post-objective scanner 
can be telecentric if the image plane can be curved to intercept the output from the scan­
ner. If a flat image plane is required, a pre-objective scan system will need to have a scan 
lens that is slightly larger than the scan plane to meet the telecentric requirement. This can 
drive up the scan lens costs and result in a prohibitively expensive system. Normally, some 
level of deviation from telecentricity is given in a system specification.
In a writing application a decision as to how to use the available polygon facet is needed. 
Systems can either be under- or overfilled. Underfilled designs are the most common and do 
not waste available laser energy because the facet is sized such that the beam footprint on 
the facet never crosses over the edges of the facet during the full system scan angle. On the 
other hand, in an overfilled design the polygon facet is sized such that the beam completely 
fills the polygon facet over the entire full scan angle. Underfilled designs are preferred in 
many applications because there is less wasted energy and there is minimal diffraction from 
the facet edges. Overfilled designs have the one advantage that the system duty cycle can 
approach 100%. The duty cycle is the ratio of the active scan time to the full facet time.
4.11  POLYGON SIZE CALCULATION
Once a system concept is chosen, and the optical design completed, the polygon size needs 
to be calculated. A few key parameters must be known in order to size the polygon:
	
1.	Scan angle, θ
	
2.	Beam feed angle, α
	
3.	Wavelength, λ
	
4.	Desired duty cycle, C
θ is the full extent of the active scan measured in degrees as illustrated in Figure 4.20. 
This value is usually in the range of 5–70°. α is the beam feed angle measured in degrees 
between the input beam to the polygon and the center of the scan exiting the polygon. It 
will be cost effective to keep this angle as small as possible in order to reduce polygon size. 
In certain scanner applications the beam feed angle is zero. The beam is brought in through 
a beamsplitter in the center of scan or at a slight angle relative to the exiting scanned beam. 
λ is the operating wavelength expressed in microns and to be used in the calculation of 
the beam size on the polygon with a known desired spot size in the scan plane. C is the 
duty cycle, which is the ratio of active scan time to total time. Duty cycles in the range of 
30%–90% are common. However, the greater the duty cycle, the larger and more costly the 
polygon. With all conventional scan systems with the exception of monogon drum scan­
ners some portion of the time will be spent transitioning from one facet to the next. We will 
assume that the design being considered is underfilled. This means that only one facet is 
being used to scan the image plane at any given time.

Polygonal Scanners: Components, Performance, and Design 
273
The number of facets, n, to be used is a trade-off that needs to be addressed. The formula 
for the number of facets is given by:
	
n
C
= 720
q
	
(4.3)
If this equation produces a noninteger answer, this means that there is no exact solution 
to provide the duty cycle desired at the same time as the optical scan angle requirement is 
satisfied. A next logical step is to fix the number of facets to an integer value near the result 
from the previous calculation and fix either the scan angle or the duty cycle and solve for 
the remaining variable.

(4.4)
For a writing application, once the duty cycle, scan angle, and number of facets are deter­
mined, the beam diameter D incident to the facet can be calculated. The following formu­
las assume a Gaussian beam profile and the beam size defined at the 1/e2 intensity points.

where T is the distance from the polygon to the focal surface in mm, and d is the 1/e2 
beam diameter on the focal surface in microns.
For a reading system, D is a selected value based on the system-limiting aperture. The 
intensity profile across the diameter is no longer Gaussian but top hat instead.
Since the size of the facet depends on the actual beam footprint on the facet, the feed angle 
effect on D must be taken into account. The value D′ is the projected footprint on the polygon 
facet. It takes into account the truncation diameter and the cosine growth of the beam on the 
facet due to the beam feed angle. The formula for calculating the beam footprint is:

The calculations assume a TEM00 Gaussian beam that is truncated at the 1.5 × 1/e2 diam­

size can be reduced.

If the polygon diameter is too large then there are three options. The first is to reduce the 
duty cycle and suffer a higher speed and burst data rate. The second is to reduce the beam 
feed angle. The third is to allow more intensity variation across the scan by reducing the 
1.5 multiplier. This in turn, reduces the facet length.
4.12  MINIMIZING IMAGE DEFECTS IN SCANNING SYSTEMS
In order to design a scanning system that accurately reproduces information, knowledge 
of the types of artifacts that the scan system can produce and visibility thresholds of these 
artifacts is needed. The specifications required to reduce the artifacts to acceptable levels 
vary by application; for example, a prepress imager has different requirements from a 
laser printer. This section is written with writing applications in mind. Many of the defects 
associated with writing applications can also be present in reading applications.
4.12.1  Banding
Banding is one of the most common scan artifacts that will show up in scanning systems. 
Banding is a periodic variation in the line-to-line separation or intensity of the output. The 
human eye is very sensitive to periodic errors. The sensitivity is frequency dependent and 
great care must be taken to ensure that scan errors in the peak frequency range are mini­
mized.4 In continuous tone and halftone printers the line-to-line placement errors need to 
be reduced to less than 0.5% of the line spacing. In other applications this can be as large 
as 10%–20% before banding becomes visible.

275
The sources of banding include reflectivity variations, dynamic track errors between fac­
ets, mechanical vibrations, electrical noise and secondary axis translation errors. Polygon 
reflectivity variations can be easily eliminated by properly specifying the polygon coating 
such that these errors will not be visible. A specification of less than 1% variation of reflec­
tivity on all facets will be adequate for all but the most demanding applications.
Either improving the polygon itself or compensating for the error can reduce dynamic 
track errors. Either approach will increase system costs so the trade-off between the brute 
force approach of improving the polygonal scanner must be weighed against the costs of 
additional system complexity.
Dynamic track error compensation can either be active or passive. Active techniques 
rely on using an active component to move the beam to compensate for the error whereas 
passive techniques rely on optics to minimize the errors. Active correction techniques will 
compensate for repeatable errors, but not errors that vary throughout the scan line. Passive 
techniques will compensate for both repeatable and nonrepeatable errors.
Active correction techniques are usually based on sampling the beam position errors 
perpendicular to the scan direction (cross scan) between scans and applying a beam steer­
ing correction in the system prior to the polygon to change the beam pointing. These 
techniques are used primarily in low-speed systems due to the frequency response limita­
tions of the beam steering components. Active correction systems are rare because there 
is added mechanical complexity, higher cost, and the lack of correction for changes that 
occur during scan.
Passive correction techniques are quite common and the basic concept is illustrated in 
Figure 4.21. The polygon facet is reimaged with some magnification to the scan plane in 
the cross-scan axis. A cylindrical lens element is typically used to create a line focus on 
the polygon facet. The reimaging of this line in the cross-scan axis can be accomplished 
using a variety of components. Common methods include using a toroidal element near 
the polygon, a cylindrical lens near the scan plane, or a cylindrical mirror near the scan 
plane.5,6 These passive methods will provide a significant reduction, but not perfect com­
pensation due to pupil shifting. The pupil shift is due to the fact that the polygon rotates 
about its center rather than rotating about the facet. The facet vertex changes during rota­
tion so the object point moves in and out as the facet rotates.
Banding does not necessarily result from optical effects. Other sources such as vibration 
or electrical noise can contribute to banding. Mechanical vibrations can be introduced by 
the rotating device and amplified by the scan system platform. If the platform is not rigidly 
coupled to the image plane, then relative motion between the scanner and the image can 
result in a banding artifact.

Electrical noise can be generated by lasers or laser power supplies. It can modulate the 
laser output directly or it can affect the performance of an external modulation device 
such as an acousto-optic modulator. Continuous tone applications can be particularly sen­
sitive to electrical noise. Repeatable noise on the order of 0.5% of peak power can be visible. 
The electrical noise can appear to be banding if the frequency is near to or a multiple of 
the revolution rate.
In most scan systems the second axis of the image is controlled by a mechanical device, 
such as a translation stage, direct drive rollers, or a belt drive. The velocity stability of this 
second axis must be specified to the same level of requirements as the scanner device. 
Velocity errors in this second axis directly impact the banding in the image.
This section has shown that there are a variety of sources of banding. Care must be taken 
in the design phase to properly specify all components that contribute to this problem 
since it can be difficult to isolate the root cause when this defect appears in a scan system.
4.12.2  Jitter
Jitter is the high-frequency variation in the pixel placement along the scan direction. Various 
systems can tolerate different levels of jitter before artifacts become visible. Output scanners 
that place a premium on pixel placement will typically require 0.1-pixel accuracy whereas 
visual image outputs can tolerate up to 1 pixel in many applications. Jitter has both random 
and repeatable components. Random jitter is visually less objectionable than periodic jitter.
Random jitter errors can be produced by the ball bearings used in most low-speed scan­
ning systems. The magnitude of these errors is dependent on the inertia of the rotor, the 
ball bearings chosen, and the bearing mounting method. Errors are usually small enough 
not to be of concern. Aerostatic air bearings offer an alternative if the system is sensitive to 
the ball bearing errors.
Motor cogging with brushless DC motors can also create jitter errors that repeat once 
per revolution. The motor controller can reduce these errors with proper feedback rates 
(encoders or start of scan feedback), but they cannot be eliminated. One method to over­
come these errors in low-speed applications is to retime the output data, based on actual 
scanner position information provided by an encoder. The only way to eliminate these 
errors is to find a motor with zero cogging torque. There is a class of toothless motors that 
have close to zero cogging torque. They are expensive, but may become more affordable as 
they further penetrate the market.
Polygon facet flatness variations result in a periodic jitter with a frequency of once per 
revolution or higher. The curvature causes small deviations in the angle of reflection from 
the facet. If the curvature of each facet varies, this causes the time between start of scan 
and end of scan to vary. A special case exists where there is no contribution to jitter if all 
facets have the same curvature. A facet flatness specification on the order of λ/8 is adequate 
for most applications.
Facet radius variations in systems using post-objective scanning result in beam displace­
ment in the scan plane.7 A facet radius variation specification of less than 25 microns is 
acceptable for most scanning applications.
4.12.3  Scatter and Ghost Images
There are many sources of scattered light and ghost images in an optical system. The 
majority of ghost images can be controlled through proper coatings and the placement of 
baffles. For example, if the strays are out of the plane of the scanned image an exit slit does 

Polygonal Scanners: Components, Performance, and Design 
277
a good job of eliminating them. Scan lenses can create problems with ghost images. The 
interior surfaces in these lens systems set up ghost images that are difficult if not impossi­
ble to eliminate with baffles. The antireflection coatings need to be high quality, reducing 
reflections to near zero.
As mentioned earlier in the chapter, the polygon surface can contribute to scatter. In 
extremely sensitive applications a diamond turned surface may produce too much scatter. 
This type of surface also produces a large percentage of near angle scatter that is diffi­
cult to baffle. A conventionally polished polygon produces wide-angle scatter and a much 
lower magnitude of total integrated scatter.
If the system contains an exit window or has a lens close to the scan plane, then the 
cleanliness of this element is important. Dust particles on this element can cause localized 
scatter in the scan plane since the spot is typically small at this point in the optical system. 
If repeated each scan, this will result in a line being produced down the image.
Adjacent polygon facets tend to be problematic in many systems where there is signifi­
cant reflection from the target surface. The beam can find its way back through the system 
to the next facet. The problem with this type of stray light is that it will be on axis. The 
best solution is to tilt the scan plane a few degrees relative to the scan system so scan plane 
reflections are out of plane. Another solution is to mask the polygon sufficiently to leave 
only the active scan aperture open.
The time between scans when the beam is passing over the tips of the polygon is another 
source for scatter. Light will scatter from the tips of the polygon and from the side of scan 
lens mounts. Turning off the beam between scans and using a time interval counter to 
turn the beam on just prior to the start of scan sensor will eliminate this possible source 
of problems.
Acousto-optic modulators can produce several undesirable effects. Scatter from the crystal 
can limit the extinction ratio. Long decay times may result in tails when transitioning from 
black to gray in a continuous tone application. The crystals used can also suffer from sound 
field reflections that show up as ghost images. Working with an application engineer at the 
modulator supplier is the best way to avoid these issues from affecting a scan system.
4.12.4  Intensity Variation
Variations in laser intensity can produce a variety of image artifacts depending on the fre­
quency of the variation. A slowly varying fluctuation is much less objectionable than a high-
frequency variation. Whereas intensity variation on the order of a few percent may be tolerable 
over an entire image, local intensity variations may need to be controlled to less than 0.5%.
Scan lens coatings and the coatings on any other elements located after the polygon can 
cause variations in the scan plane intensity across the scan. A transmission or reflection 
uniformity specification is needed to control this variable.
4.12.5  Distortion
Scanning systems typically employ a scan lens that has an F-theta characteristic. The lens 
distortion is controlled to produce image height that is proportional to the scan angle. This 
F-theta characteristic ensures linear scans with constant velocity. These lenses are not per­
fect but they do reduce the nonlinearity down to 0.01%–0.1% range. This is adequate for all 
but the most critical applications. These residual errors are repeatable, therefore; intensity 
compensation for dwell time differences or variable clocking schemes for pixel placement 
differences can be employed to remove the residual error.

278 
Handbook of Optical and Laser Scanning
4.12.6  Bow
Bow is defined as the variation from straightness of a scan line. Bow is usually a slowly 
varying function across the scan. A considerable amount of bow can be tolerated before 
becoming visually objectionable. In most applications 0.05% of the scan line length of bow 
is an adequate specification. If the system is designed to have the beam brought in on the 
same axis as the scan then bow is caused by the errors in beam alignment. This can nor­
mally be adjusted to very fine levels and is therefore usually not a serious problem in a 
polygonal scan system. An equation for bow is given by:

where F is the focal length of the scan lens, E is the spot displacement as a function of field 
angle, θ is the field angle, and β is the angle between the incoming beam and the plane that 
is perpendicular to the rotation axis.8
4.13  SUMMARY
This chapter has covered the components, performance characteristics, and design 
approaches for polygonal scanners and systems based on these scanners. This technology 
continues to evolve and thrives among increasing competition from other technologies 
both in writing and reading applications. I fully expect that the performance values that 
are stated in this chapter will be significantly improved on in the near future. However, 
the system level artifacts that a system designer must be careful to avoid tend to remain a 
constant. An in-depth knowledge of these artifacts and their root causes will help reduce 
development time for new systems.

5.1  INTRODUCTION
This chapter updates and expands upon the material covered by Gerald A. Rynkowski 
in Optical Scanning,l with greater emphasis being placed on brushless DC motors and the 
associated control electronics designed specifically for rotary scanning applications. Some 
background topics related to polygon scanning have been carried over to this chapter in 
order to clarify or illustrate control concepts. Other topics not directly related to motors 
and controllers, such as the discussion of air bearing design, have been omitted since these 
areas are covered in greater detail elsewhere in this book.
The availability of low-cost brushless DC motors and the continuing improvement in 
scanner control, as well as miniaturization of the drive electronics, have contributed greatly 
to the viability of optomechanical scanning in many new applications. Optomechanical 
scanning continues to be a cost-effective alternative to competing solid-state technolo­
gies. Several new application examples have been added that highlight the trend toward 
brushless DC motors and compact integrated control systems designed for military and 
­commercial use.
Polygonal scanners have been designed, developed, and manufactured in all shapes and 
configurations during the past 35 years. These devices have been employed in military 
reconnaissance and earth resources studies, thermal imaging systems, film recorders, laser 
printers, flight simulators, and optical inspection systems, to name a few of the well-known 
applications. A common characteristic of all of these scanners is the requirement for precise 
control of polygon rotation, and consequently, the control of the beam scan. Recent advances 
in motor and control technologies have greatly improved the performance and efficiency of 
these scanners while simultaneously reducing the cost and size of the system.
This chapter explores the trends in motor and control technologies that are being ­utilized 
in today’s polygonal scanners through the discussion of specific applications. In addi­
tion, motor characteristics, control techniques, and system models are presented to aid the 
­optomechanical engineer in understanding these critical areas of scanning system design.
5.2  POLYGONAL SCANNER BASICS
Although a more thorough discussion of polygon geometry and scanning optics can be 
found elsewhere in this book, it will be useful to review some of the basic polygon configu­
rations and optical designs as they influence the selection of the scan motor and control 
system. Also, a film recording system is presented in some detail in the next section in 
order to illustrate the influence of the scanner motor and controller characteristics on the 
overall system performance.
5.2.1  Polygon Configurations
In general, three types of scanner mirror configurations are popularly utilized in colli­
mated or convergent, passive, or laser scanning optical systems. These rotating mirror 
spinners (polygons) are at the center of the electro-optical system. They direct incoming 
optical signals to a detector or steer outgoing modulated laser beams by virtue of their 
geometry and rotation about an axis.

The three most utilized scanner beam deflector configurations are the regular poly­
gon, pyramidal, and the single-faceted cantilever design. The regular polygonal scanner 
is ­generally the most popular with system designers and can be utilized with either the 
­collimated-beam or the convergent-beam scanning configurations. Figures 5.1 and 5.2 
illustrate the two configurations using six-sided polygons having the spin axis projected 
into the page. In Figure 5.1 the facets are illuminated with a collimated beam and reflected 
to a concave mirror that focuses at a curved focal plane.
Figure 5.2 shows a lens system that focuses the collimated beam prior to being reflected 
at the scanner facets, and then converging at a focus. Comparing the two configurations, it 
is obvious that both focal image surfaces are curved. This presents a problem to the system 
designer, but is usually corrected optically with a suitable field-flattening correction lens 
system, or perhaps the recording surface is curved to conform to the focal surface.

Handbook of Optical and Laser Scanning
Another difference with regard to the polygon is that the convergent-beam ­bundle 
(Figure  5.2) uses less area of the facet than the collimated configuration. However, 
­maximum ­utilization of the facet area is desirable because the facet surface flatness irregu­
larities tend to be averaged out, and therefore, minimize modulation of the exiting-beam 
­scanning angles. Most precision polygonal scanning systems use the collimated beam 
scanning configuration, which utilizes a larger proportion of the area of the facets.
Figure 5.3 illustrates a pyramidal mirror scanner commonly used with the rotational 
and optical axes parallel, but not coincident. Note that either the collimated or convergent 
configuration can be utilized with this design.
Figure 5.4 illustrates a regular polygonal scanner in which the optical axis is normal to 
the rotational axis, or where the angle is acute to normal. Note that when the two axes, 
optical and rotational, are normal, the beam can reflect back upon itself.
Shown in Figure 5.5 is a single-faceted cantilevered scanner with the beam and rota­
tional axes coincident and reflecting from a 45° facet, and thereby generating a continuous 
360° scan angle and a circular focused scan line.
This configuration has been used in passive infrared scanning systems having long 
focal length and requiring a large aperture. Nine-inch, clear-aperture scanners have been 
manufactured in this configuration for high collection efficiency.
This type of beam deflector design is also popular in scanning systems that are used 
in the image setting machines sold to the printing market. Many of these image setting 
machines have an “internal drum” design which involves the placement of a large piece 
of film on the inside surface of a cylinder. The single-faceted “monogon” beam deflector 
rotates at high speed and scans a laser spot across the width of the film as it travels the 
length of the drum. Figure 5.6 illustrates a monogon beam deflector designed for rota­
tional speeds exceeding 30,000 rpm.

5.2.2  Polygon Rotation and Scan Angle Relationship
At this point, it is noteworthy to realize the relation between the facet angle and scan 
angle. The facet angle is defined as 360°/N (N = number of facets). The optical scan angle 
may be expressed as:
	
Scan angle (degrees) = 720
N
for N ≥ 2. Observe that for N ≥ 2, the optical scan angle is two times the shaft angle. This 
angle-doubling effect must obviously be considered when relating the shaft and facet 
parameters and their effects on the angular position of the focused spot at the focal plane.

286 
Handbook of Optical and Laser Scanning
The optical angle-doubling effect places an even greater demand on the control of the 
polygon rotational velocity and must be carefully considered if the desired system accu­
racy is to be achieved.
The scanner rotational speed may be expressed as:
	
rpm = 60W
N
where W = line scans/s, and N = number of facets.
An increase in the number of facets reduces the motor speed requirements as well as 
the maximum scan angle. However, the usable scan angle may in some cases also be lim­
ited by aperture size and the allowable vignette effect. In practice, the optical design will 
usually dictate the number of facets and consequently the motor and controller will have 
to be selected to accommodate the optical system designer. Figure 5.7 illustrates a small 
12-faceted polygon mirror.
5.2.3  Polygon Speed Considerations
When a range of polygon rotation speeds are allowed by the optical design, it is best to 
avoid configurations that require speeds that are very low or very high. Problems with 
motor controllability may occur at speeds below about 60 rpm and motor efficiency may 
suffer when speeds exceeding 60,000 rpm are specified. To achieve good speed regulation 
at very low polygon rotation speeds, special motor and control designs are often required 
that will lead to increased system cost. A polygon rotating at 60 rpm and specified for 
l0 ppm (10 parts per million, or 0.001%) speed regulation will likely require a sinusoidally 
driven slotless brushless DC motor and complex controller design to achieve this level of 
performance.
Another complication associated with low-speed designs involves the selection of the 
velocity feedback device. Often the feedback device will be an optical encoder (Figure 5.8), 
FIGURE 5.6

Motors and Controllers for High-Performance Polygonal Scanners 
287
which functions both as a tachometer to monitor the polygon speed, and in some systems, 
as a position sensor for reporting the true position of the polygon to the scan process­
ing electronics. Today’s high-performance speed control systems operate using phase-lock 
loop techniques that provide excellent short-term as well as long-term speed regulation. 
These systems operate by comparing the frequency and phase of a stable reference sig­
nal with that of the polygon encoder, thereby generating an error signal, which is used to 
adjust the polygon speed. In order to achieve good speed control at low speeds, a high-
resolution/high-accuracy encoder is necessary.
Depending on the polygon inertia, bearing friction, and the level of disturbances present, 
an encoder line density greater than 10,000 lines (counts) per revolution may be required 
for a 60 rpm scanner. Optical encoders having greater than a few thousand line counts per 
FIGURE 5.7

FIGURE 5.8

288

revolution will also contribute to increased system cost since the disc pattern and the edge 
detection functions must be more precise.
As the polygon operating speed increases, fewer pulses per revolution from the encoder 
are required to achieve the same level of performance, all other factors being equal. This 
is due to the fact that at higher speeds, lower encoder resolutions can still produce an 
adequate number of pulses or “speed updates” per second from the encoder and allow for 
a reasonably fast control loop bandwidth. Higher control system bandwidth is desirable 
because the control loop can more readily react to short duration disturbances in speed, 
which may not be adequately attenuated by the polygon inertia.
The control system will receive some average polygon speed between encoder pulses 
from the phase detector, but it is essentially operating open loop until the next pulse arrives 
and updates the speed based on the encoder pulse phase relative to the reference clock. 
During this period between speed updates the polygon speed will generally decrease 
from the set point (and the last update) until the next encoder pulse arrives and the control 
system makes a correction. Therefore to achieve a specified update rate or bandwidth for 
the control system, the slower polygon will require a higher resolution encoder with cor­
respondingly better pattern accuracy.
The actual speed change between encoder updates is a function of many factors, includ­
ing the operating speed, total rotating inertia of the scanner, the amplitude and frequency 
of disturbances, the control system gain, and the friction. In general, higher polygon/
motor inertia and lower bearing and windage friction are beneficial and will reduce the 
short-term speed variations present in the scanner. This will be discussed in greater detail 
in Sec. 5, which deals with the control system design.
At the other extreme, high operating speeds require that the polygon and the entire 
rotating assembly exhibit exceptionally low imbalance, ideally less than 10 μin-oz. Often 
this requires that the scanner must be balanced in two planes: at the polygon and at the 
motor/encoder location. This is necessary not only for maintaining the mechanical integ­
rity and life of the rotating components, but also for achieving precise speed control within 
one revolution of the scanner. Any imbalance that causes concentricity error at the encoder 
will result in a sinusoidal scanner speed variation. This is especially true for air bearing 
scanners where the bearing stiffness is lower and allows for larger concentricity errors to 
be produced.
Also, the motor efficiency is adversely affected at high speeds, especially when the com­
mutation frequency exceeds 1000 cycles/s. Special motor designs are required for efficient 
high-speed operation and these designs usually require expensive development time and 
have higher unit cost.
5.3  CASE STUDY: A FILM RECORDING SYSTEM
A film recording scanning system has been selected as a reference subsystem for pur­
poses of discussing the scanner parameters as well as the dynamic performance require­
ments involving the motor and control system design. Figure 5.9 depicts a laser recording 
system capable of recording high-resolution video or digital data on film. The rotating 
polygon (spinner) generates a line scan at the film plane using a focused, intensity-modulated 
laser beam. The laser exposes the film in proportion to the intensity modulation in the 
video or digital signal. Line-to-line scan is accomplished by moving the photographic 

Motors and Controllers for High-Performance Polygonal Scanners

film at constant velocity and recording a continuous corridor of data limited only by 
the length of film. The film controller provides precise control of film velocity, which 
is locked to the polygon rotation. The expanded and collimated laser beam is intensity 
modulated with video or digital data and then scanned by the facets of the spinner to the 
film plane. A field correction lens (F–θ) is used to focus the beam, to linearize the scan 
line with respect to the scan angle, and thereby provide a uniform spot size along the line 
at the film plane.
The scanner assembly contains a 12-faceted polygon required to perform the optical 
scan function. The rotating mirror, its drive motor rotor, and a precision optical tachom­
eter are supported by externally pressurized gas bearings. The electronic controller pro­
vides precise motor speed control and synchronization between the reference frequency 
sync generator and the high-density data track of the optical encoder. The encoder also 
supplies an index pulse used for facet identification and derivation of the synchronized 
field frequency that is required for some raster scanning systems, as well as pixel registra­
tion and control of the film drive motor.
5.3.1  System Performance Requirements
The system performance parameters for our example digital film recorder are discussed in 
the following paragraphs. These parameters are summarized in Table 5.1 and are typical 
and representative of a recently manufactured film recording system.
The system resolution requirements are defined at the film plane since all optical, 
­scanning, and film transport errors will become evident on the recording media. The 
application requires 10,000 pixels of digital data per line at the scan plane using a 10-μm

spot diameter measured at the 1/e2 irradiance level. One can calculate that for a 13.97-cm 
line scan length the pixel spacing, center to center, must be 13.97 μm, as must the spacing 
between scan lines. The line spacing variance, or film transport jitter, is conservatively 
specified to be less than ±5 ppm (half the nominal spot size). For a reasonable throughput, 
the application dictates a scan rate requirement of 1200 lines/s. From this information the 
calculated pixel frequency is found to be 12 MHz (1200 lines/s × 10,000 pixels/line), and 
the film speed needed is 1.6764 cm/s (1200 lines/s × 13.97 μm/line).
5.3.2  Spinner Parameters
The polygon specification is determined and driven by the form, fit, and functional 
­performances set by the optical requirements of the system. At this point, the optical 
­engineer must optimize the design of the optical elements, which includes specifying 
the polygon type, facet number, facet width and height, inscribed diameter of the poly­
gon, facet flatness and reflectance, and rotating speed. Owing to the interactions of the 
specifications and the high-accuracy requirements, the spinner is addressed as a scanner 
sub­system to allow the scanner designer to make trade-off decisions within the limits 
imposed by the optical and system performance requirements.
The scanner subsystem in our film recorder example consists of a one-piece beryllium 
scan mirror and shaft, suspended on hydrostatic gas bearings, and driven by a servo-
­controlled AC synchronous motor. The F–θ lens is designed to function with a 60° optical 
scan entrance angle which dictates a 30° facet angle specification for the polygon. The num­
ber of facets is therefore calculated to be 12, and a motor speed of 100 rev/s, or 6000 rpm, 
generates 1200 scan lines per second. Depicted in Table 5.2 is a summary of the ­scanner 
polygon requirements.
5.3.3  Scanner Specification Tolerances
Scanner specification tolerances are determined by the permissible static and dynamic 
pixel position errors acceptable at the film plane. These worst-case errors are referenced 
back through the optical system and scanner subsystem to be distributed and budgeted 
between the operational elements and reference datum. The acceptable variances are often 
specified as a percentage of pixel-to-pixel angle, pixel diameter, pixel-to-pixel spacing, or 
the motor speed regulation (stability) over one or more revolutions. The conversion of these 
variances to meaningful and quantifiable units is necessary for manufacturing, measure­
ment, inspection, and testing of the scanning system components.

Our primary concern here is to relate the scanning system specifications, which ulti­
mately determine the quality of the scanned image, to the performance requirements that 
are imposed on the motor and control system. It is apparent (Table 5.3) that the polygon 
rotation regulation plays a major role in the scanning system performance and that the 
design of the motor and control system must be given careful consideration in order to 
achieve the precise pixel placement accuracy.
Precision closed-loop control of the motor speed is essential if the performance targets 
outlined in Table 5.1 are to be met. To achieve the level of speed regulation required by 
the 13.97-μm pixel spacing specification, a phase-lock loop control system with a quartz 
oscillator frequency reference will be required. The 13.97-μm pixel spacing translates to a 
polygon speed regulation requirement of 0.001% (10 ppm) within one rotation of the scan­
ner and over the time required to write the full page of the image onto the film. Speed

variations within one turn of the polygon will produce an uneven scan line length, which 
will be visible as a variation along the edge of the film opposite the start of scan. Slower 
speed variations that occur over many revolutions but still within the same film frame 
may produce other undesirable image artifacts and distortions.
Subtle variations in the printed image such as shading and banding can also result from 
short-term speed changes within the scanner, which may occur over a few revolutions, 
and the human eye has a remarkable ability to detect these otherwise minor variations 
within the image.
5.3.4  High-Performance, Defined
Table 5.4 depicts the performance of the film recorder reference system in comparison to 
a state-of-the-art recording system considered by many as the highest resolution and fast­
est system manufactured to date. Note that the polygon speed regulation required in the 
state-of-the-art system is less than one part per million, or 0.0001%.
5.4  MOTOR CONSIDERATIONS
5.4.1  Motor Requirements
In the most demanding scanning applications, which require high speed and exceptional 
accuracy, the precision of the integral polygon, shaft, and bearing assembly must not be 
degraded by the introduction of the motor rotor. This places a heavy burden on motor 
rotor selection.
Any motor rotor attached to the shaft must have very stable and predictable character­
istics with regard to strength and temperature, and if possible, the rotor material should 
be homogeneous. If the rotor is of a complex mechanical configuration and consists of 
laminations and windings, the assembly may not maintain a precision balance (less than 
20 μin-oz) when operating at high speeds. Additionally, thermal expansion and high

centrifugal forces may shift and reposition the rotor and perhaps cause a catastrophic fail­
ure in an air bearing scanner.
Two motor designs are considered for use with high- and low-speed air bearing and ball 
bearing scanners, respectively; they are the hysteresis synchronous and the DC brushless. 
Pictured in Figure 5.10 is a high-speed DC brushless motor with integral Hall effect sen­
sors for commutation and the associated rotor magnet mounted on a brass encoder hub 
assembly. Figure 5.11 depicts the two main components of a hysteresis synchronous motor: 
the stator and the hysteresis ring rotor.

5.4.2  Hysteresis Synchronous Motor
The difficult rotor mechanical stability requirements for high-speed scanner operation are 
easily achieved with the use of a hysteresis synchronous motor (Figure 5.11). The hysteresis 
rotor is uncommonly simple in design and consists of a cylinder of hardened cobalt steel 
that is heat shrunk onto the rotor shaft assembly. Careful calculations are required with 
regard to the centrifugal forces and thermal expansion influences on the rotor and shaft for 
safe and reliable operation. This type of motor is well suited for operation at speeds rang­
ing from 1000 rpm to 120,000 rpm. Motors having output power as large as 2.2 kw have 
been successfully used on large-aperture IR scanning systems operating at 6000 rpm.
The operation of a hysteresis synchronous motor relies on the magnetic hysteresis 
­characteristics of the rotor material. As the magnetizing force from a suitably powered 
stator (not unlike that used with reluctance-type motors) is applied to a cobalt steel rotor 
ring or cylinder, the induced rotor magnetic flux density will follow the stator coil current, 
as illustrated in Figure 5.12.
The sinusoidal current is shown to increase from zero, along the initial magnetiza­
tion curve, to point (a), thereby magnetizing the material to a corresponding flux level at 
the peak of the sinusoid. As the current decreases to zero, the rotor remains magnetized 
at point (b). If the current at this point in time were to remain at zero, the rotor would 
be ­permanently magnetized at the point (b) flux level. However, as the current reverses 
direction, the flux reduces to zero at some negative value of current as shown at point (c). 
Further decreases in current (negative direction) reverse the direction of flux as shown at

point (d), corresponding with the negative peak of the current. The process continues to 
point (e) and back to point (a), completing the loop for one cycle of current. The figure gen­
erated is called a magnetic hysteresis loop. In physics, hysteresis is defined as a lag in the 
magnetization behind a varying magnetizing force.
By analogy, as the axis of the magnetizing force rotates, the axis of the lagging force of 
the rotor will accelerate the rotor in the same direction as the rotating field. As the rotor 
accelerates, its speed will increase until it reaches the synchronous rotating frequency of 
the field. At this point, the rotor becomes permanently magnetized and follows the rotat­
ing field in synchronism.
The synchronous speed of the rotor can be calculated with the following expression:
	
rpm = 120 f
N
where f = line frequency (Hz) and N = number of poles.
Figure 5.13 depicts a typical speed versus torque characteristic curve for a hysteresis 
synchronous motor.
If a fixed line voltage and frequency is applied to the stator winding of the motor, an 
accelerating torque is developed equal to the starting torque, Ts, shown at point A. As the 
speed of the rotor increases, the operating point on the curve moves through the maxi­
mum torque developed at point B, and continues through point C, at which time synchro­
nous speed is reached. The final operating point, D, is determined by the operating load 
torque presented to the shaft at torque level T0. Note that if the operating load torque is 
greater than the in-sync torque, synchronous speed will not be reached.
Figure 5.14 is a vector representation of the rotating magnetizing field and the ­magnetized 
rotor field while in synchronism. Note that the rotor field vector lags the magnetizing 
field by an angle α. The operating torque (as developed by the motor in synchronism) is 
in proportion to the sine of the angle α in electrical degrees. If the load torque and stator 
frequency are absolutely constant, their frequencies will be precisely equal.
However, should the torque angle be modulated sinusoidally, as indicated in Figure 5.14 
(with a torque variance of ±β), the rotor vector will advance and retard as indicated about 
the average angle α. The long-term average speed will be as constant as the applied stator 
source frequency, but the instantaneous speed will follow the derivative of the sine wave

on a one-to-one basis. The effect of torque perturbations that are not attenuated by system 
inertia will also modulate the shaft speed accordingly.
A characteristic of hysteresis synchronous motors (and other second-order devices and 
systems) called “hunting” may be observed when operating the motor in a system having 
low losses and damping factor. The motor rotor will oscillate in a sine wave fashion, not 
unlike that depicted in Figure 5.14, if perturbed by applied forces internal or external to the 
system. If the perturbations are sustained, the oscillations will also be sustained.
However, if the perturbations are not sustained, the oscillations will diminish in ampli­
tude to essentially zero. The internal damping factor of the motor can be influenced by the 
rotor resistivity, rotor-to-stator coupling coefficient, and driver source and stator imped­
ance. In a typical open-loop operation (no external velocity or position feedback) the oscil­
lations may not be predictable and, therefore, may suddenly appear due to an unknown 
source or sources of perturbing forces. The amplitude of the oscillations in shaft degrees 
can typically range from 1° to 10°, and, as a practical matter, is very difficult to calculate; 
however, the rotar oscillating (hunting) frequency (Wn) can be estimated as

and I = shaft moment of inertia (in-oz s2).

function to zero, and then calculating the maximum positional rate of change in radians

Figure 5.15 shows two curves of percent velocity regulation versus speed in rpm, for a 
typical open-loop scanning system having peak angular displacements of 1° and 5°. A four-
pole motor with a peak torque of 10 oz-in and having a total inertia of 0.076 oz-in s2 was used 
for the calculations in Figure 5.15. Note that for peak angular displacements of 1°, velocity 
regulation of 0.05% could be claimed for all speeds greater than 3000 rpm. However, should 
the peak angular displacements increase to 5°, then 0.05% velocity regulation is only obtain­
able at speeds greater than 14,000 rpm. Figure 5.15 ­illustrates that, for a typical open-loop 
scanning system operating at speeds above 3000 rpm, the system designer can expect vari­
ance in velocity ranging from less than 0.05% to as high as 0.25%. In conclusion, if system 
speed regulation requirements must be guaranteed to be less than 0.05% (500 ppm), closed-
loop control of the motor speed using phase position feedback must be incorporated.
Another advantage of hysteresis synchronous motors in precision scanners is the near 
absence of rotor eddy currents when the rotor is synchronized with the rotating stator 
field. These currents can produce increased I2R? rotor losses that can cause rotor/shaft 
­distortions due to generated temperature gradients and produce adverse effects, espe­
cially in air bearing designs. The primary source of rotor eddy current losses is from 
the spurious flux changes that occur as the rotor passes the stator slots. These parasitic 
losses are often referred to as “slot effect losses” and can be very significant at high

speeds, rendering the device very inefficient as is often noted in older designs. Careful 
stator design can minimize these losses to the extent that the primary source of rotor/
shaft heating is through the air bearing gap from the stator or due to air friction. Any 
residual heat generated by stator losses may be further reduced and diverted away from 
the bearing/rotor system by water or air cooling of the stator housing to minimize the 
rotor/shaft temperature rise.
In summary, AC hysteresis-synchronous motors were a natural choice in early poly­
gon scanners, especially for high-speed applications. Simplicity of construction and reli­
able, maintenance-free operation were key advantages. Also, since the long-term shaft 
speed was precisely determined by the excitation frequency, no speed control system was 
required in order to produce acceptable results in low-cost systems. However, as scanner 
speed control requirements became more critical, feedback devices such as optical encod­
ers were added in order to control the short-term speed variation or “hunting” found in 
this type of motor. This required increase in control complexity paved the way for the 
entry of DC brushless motors for precision scanning applications.
5.4.3  Brushless DC Motor Characteristics
The brushless DC motor (Figure 5.10) is well suited for speeds ranging from near zero to 
as high as 80,000 rpm. These motors exhibit the same characteristic as brush commutated 
types and can therefore be used in the same applications. They are also suited for velocity 
and position servo applications since they have a near ideal, linear control characteristic, 
meaning that the torque produced by the motor is in direct proportion to the applied 
current.
The elimination of brushes and commutating bars provides reduced electromagnetic 
interference, higher operating speeds and reliability, with no brush material debris 
from brush wear. The commutating switching function is accomplished by using mag­
netic or optical rotor position sensors that control the electronic commutating logic 
switching sequence. In actual operation, a DC current is applied to the stator wind­
ings, which generates a magnetic field that attracts the permanent magnets of the 
rotor, causing rotation. As the rotor magnetic field aligns with the stator field, the field 
currents are switched, thereby rotating the stator field and the rotor magnets follow 
accordingly.
The rotor will continue to accelerate until the motor output torque is equal to the load 
torque. Under no load conditions, the motor speed will increase until the back electromo­
tive force (BEMF) generates a voltage equal to the stator supply voltage minus the DC 
winding resistance voltage drop. At this point, the rotor speed reaches an equilibrium 
level as determined by the BEMF motor constant.
The open-loop speed stability and regulation under controlled power supply and 
­temperature conditions is usually 1%–5%, so the device is typically used with closed-loop 
feedback control. In the closed-loop mode of operation, particularly in the phase-lock loop 
configuration, short-term speed stability of 1 ppm is obtainable. However, on a long-term 
basis, the speed stability and accuracy are only as good as the reference source, which is 
routinely specified at 50 ppm or less for quartz crystal oscillator references, which are used 
in phase-lock loop speed control systems.
The brushless DC motor, when properly commutated, will exhibit the same performance 
characteristics as a brush commutated DC motor, and for servo analysis the two may be 
considered equivalent devices. Both motor types may be characterized by the same set of 
parameters as described in the following discussion.

5.4.3.1  Torque and Winding Characteristics
The basic torque waveform of a brushless DC motor has a sinusoidal or trapezoidal shape. 
It is the result of the interaction between the rotor and stator magnetic fields, and is defined 
as the output torque generated relative to rotor position when a constant DC current is 
applied between two motor leads. With constant current drive, the torque waveform 
­follows the shape of the BEMF voltage waveform generated at any two motor winding 
leads. The frequency of the BEMF voltage waveform is equal to the number of pole pairs 
in the motor times the speed in revolutions per second. The BEMF waveform is easily 
observed by rotating the motor at a constant speed and is in fact often used to characterize 
the motor during testing.
The brushless DC motor exhibits torque/speed characteristics similar to a conventional 
brush-type DC motor. The stator excitation currents may be square wave or sinusoidal 
and should be applied in a sequence that provides a constant output torque with shaft 
rotation. Square wave excitation results in a small ripple in the output torque due to the 
finite ­commutation angle.
The commutation angle is defined as the angle the rotor must rotate through before 
the windings are switched. Ripple torque is typically expressed as a percentage of 
­average-to-peak torque ratio and is present whenever the windings are switched by a step 
­function either electrically via solid-state switches or mechanically via brushes. In brush­
less DC motors designed for square wave excitation, the ripple torque can be minimized 
by reducing the commutation angle through the use of a larger number of phases, which 
also improves motor efficiency. For a two-phase brushless motor, the commutation angle is 
90 electrical degrees, which yields the largest ripple torque of about 17% average-to-peak. 
A three-phase delta-wound motor is shown in Figure 5.16. The commutation angle is 60° 
and the ripple torque is approximately 7% average-to-peak. Since two-thirds of the avail­
able windings are used at any one time, compared to one-half for the two-phase motor, the 
three-phase system is more efficient.
The torque waveforms shown in Figure 5.16 have a sinusoidal shape. For square wave 
excitation of the motor a trapezoidal torque waveform will produce improved torque 
­uniformity. A trapezoidal torque waveform can be obtained by using a salient pole ­structure 
in conjunction with the necessary lamination/winding configuration. In ­practice, the trap­
ezoidal torque waveform does not have a perfectly flat top and the benefit to torque ripple 
reduction may be small.
The commutation points and output torque for a three-phase brushless motor are shown 
in Figure 5.16. Each phase (winding) is energized in the proper sequence and polarity to 
produce the sum torque shown at the bottom of Figure 5.16 and is calculated to be equiva­
lent to the current times the torque sensitivity of the motor (IKT).
5.4.3.2  Brushless Motor Circuit Model
The equivalent electrical circuit model for a DC brushless motor is shown in Figure 5.17. 
This model can be used to develop the electrical and speed–torque characteristic equa­
tions, which are used to predict the motor performance in a specific application.

Since the speed–torque curves are linear, their construction is not required for predict­
ing motor performance. The system designer can calculate the required information for 
servo performance from the basic motor parameters given by the manufacturer.
5.4.3.3  Winding Configurations
Almost all of the brushless motors and drives produced today will be of the three-phase 
configuration, although two-phase motors have unique advantages, which are exploited 
in very low-speed applications. Three-phase windings can be connected in either a “delta” 
or “Y” configuration as shown in Figure 5.19.
Excitation currents into the windings can be switched full on, full off, or be applied 
as a sinusoidal function depending on the application. The switch mode drive is the 
most commonly used system because it results in the most efficient use of the elec­
tronics. Two switches per phase (winding) terminal are required for the switch mode 
drive system. Therefore, only six switches are required for either the “Y” or “delta” 
configuration.
The delta windings form a continuous loop, so current flows through all three windings 
regardless of which pair of terminals are connected to the power supply. Since the internal 
resistance of each phase is equal, the current divides unequally, with two-thirds flowing 
through the one winding connected directly between the switched terminals, and one-
third flowing through the two series-connected windings appearing in parallel with it. 
This results in switching only one-third of the total current from one winding to another 
as the windings are commutated.
For the “Y” connection, current flows through the two windings between the switched 
terminals. The third winding is isolated and carries no current. As the windings are com­
mutated, the full load current must be switched from terminal to terminal. Owing to the 
electrical time constant of the windings, it takes a finite amount of time for the current to 
reach full value. At high motor speeds, the electrical time constant (TE = L/R) may limit the 
switched current from reaching full load value during the commutation interval, and thus 
limits the generated torque. This is one of the reasons the delta configuration is preferred 
for applications requiring high operating speed. Other considerations are manufacturing 
factors, which permit the delta configuration to be fabricated with lower BEMF constant, 
resistance, and inductance. A lower BEMF constant allows the use of more common low-
voltage power supplies, and the solid-state switches will not be required to switch high 
voltage. For other than high-speed applications, the “Y” connection is preferred because

it provides greater motor efficiency when used in conjunction with brushless motors 
designed to generate a trapezoidal torque waveform.
5.4.3.4  Commutation Sensor Timing and Alignment
A brushless DC motor duplicates the performance characteristics of a DC motor only 
when its windings are properly commutated, which means that the winding currents 
are applied at the proper time, polarity, and in the correct order. Proper commutation 
involves the timing and sequence of stator winding excitation. Winding excitation must be 
timed to coincide with the rotor position that will produce optimum torque. The excitation 
sequence controls the polarity of generated torque, and therefore the direction of rotation. 
Rotor position sensors provide the information necessary for proper commutation. Sensor 
outputs are decoded by the commutation logic electronics and are fed to the power drive 
circuit, and activate the solid-state switches that control the winding current.
A useful method to achieve correct commutation timing is to align the position sensor 
to the BEMF waveform. Since the BEMF waveform is qualitatively equivalent to the torque 
waveform, the test motor can be driven at a constant speed by another motor, and the 
position sensors aligned to the generated BEMF waveform. The sensor transition points 
relative to the corresponding BEMF waveforms should be coincident when correct com­
mutation has been achieved. For critical applications that require the commutation points 
to be optimized, the motor should be operated at its rated load point, and then the position 
sensors should be adjusted until the average winding current is at its minimum value.
The commutation points and output torque for a three-phase brushless motor are shown 
in Figure 5.16. The commutation angle is 60 electrical degrees. The windings are switched 
“on” at 30 electrical degrees before the peak torque position, and switched “off” at 30 elec­
trical degrees after the peak torque position. The current polarity must be reversed for 
negative torque peaks to produce continuous rotation. To identify each of the six commu­
tation points, a minimum of three logic signals are required, as shown in Figure 5.20. The 
logic signals are generated by three sensors which are spaced 60 electrical degrees apart 
and produce a 50% duty cycle.
As indicated in Figures 5.16 and 5.20, sensor S1 can be readily aligned to the ØΑ–ØΒ zero 
torque position. This can be accomplished by applying a constant current to the ØΑ–ØΒ 
terminals. The rotor will rotate to the ØΑ–ØΒ zero torque position and then stop. Sensor 
Sl should then be positioned so that its output just switches from a low to high logic state. 
Sensors S2 and S3 may then be positioned 120 and 240 electrical degrees respectively 
from S1 (either CW or CCW direction depending on the direction of rotation) and basic 
­commutation will be established for the motor.
5.4.3.5  Rotor Configurations
The brushless DC motor rotor configurations (Figure 5.21) most often used for scanners 
consist of rare-earth samarium–cobalt permanent magnets that are contained with a rigid 
ring or cup for the outer rotor configurations, and are usually bonded to a machined 
hub for the inner rotor configurations. The inner rotor configuration is generally used at 
the higher speeds because of the lower centrifugal forces resulting from a reduced rotor 
diameter.
Owing to the elastic characteristics of epoxy and other adhesives, and the need for stable 
and reliable precision balancing, the operating speed of DC brushless spinner rotors is gen­
erally less than what can be expected for the hysteresis motors. However, DC brushless 

304

motor technology is steadily displacing other motor types in many high-speed applica­
tions. Stainless steel sleeves have been used to aid in the retention of the rotor magnets and 
improve the rotor mechanical characteristics at high speeds. In addition, ring magnet rotors 
have been developed for high-speed designs, allowing DC brushless motors to operate in 
excess of 80,000 rpm. In this rotor configuration, a ring of the rotor material is magne­
tized by the pole pieces of a powerful electromagnet, which imprints the pole locations and 
polarities into the ring. This type of rotor design has in fact been employed to drive preci­
sion polygonal scanners for laser projection systems which operate at 81,000 rpm.
Pictured in Figure 5.10 is a low-cost, high-speed DC brushless motor, which has been 
successfully used in several scanner designs. The simple stator design, which allows for 
machine winding of the coils, and the inexpensive ring magnet rotor, account for the 
low manufacturing cost of this rugged and reliable motor. The rotor magnet is further 
strengthened by an outer stainless steel sleeve.

The commutation sensors (Hall effect devices) are placed within the stator slots and do 
not require any timing adjustments. This motor is capable of delivering at least 50 W on a 
continuous duty basis. Also visible in Figure 5.10 is the rotor hub assembly onto which the 
ring magnet and the optical encoder disc are mounted.
Pictured in Figure 5.22 is a miniature eight-pole brushless DC motor, which is suitable 
for many low-power scanner drive applications. The stator configuration is noticeably 
more complex than the low-cost motor pictured in Figure 5.10 and is intended for lower 
speed applications where cogging torque must be minimized. Commutation of the wind­
ings in this design is performed by dedicated channels of a shaft-mounted optical encoder 
rather than Hall effect sensors.

Handbook of Optical and Laser Scanning
Commutation timing adjustment is made possible by rotating the encoder pattern 
relative to the rotor magnet position. Optimum timing at the desired operating speed is 
required in order to produce the lowest torque ripple and power consumption. The rotor 
assembly is of a more conventional design, where individual magnet pieces are bonded to 
a machined hub, which is then ground to the final dimensions.
For low-speed applications it is desirable to construct the motor using the highest pole 
count possible, that is consistent with the physical size and the electrical parameters speci­
fied. The smaller commutation angle and the resulting higher ripple torque frequency may 
be more readily attenuated by the rotating inertia in the system and produce a more con­
stant speed within one revolution of the rotor.
5.5  CONTROL SYSTEM DESIGN
The basic control requirements for a precision polygonal spinner are to provide synchroni­
zation and velocity control for precise scan registration, whether on a film plane or detec­
tor array, or at a distant target being illuminated. To this end, the principles of feedback 
control are utilized for synchronization, velocity, and phase position (shaft angle) control.
In our film recorder example (Figure 5.9), speed control is required for accurate pixel 
positioning, repeatability, and linearity, as well as line-to-line pixel registration and syn­
chronization. In order to accurately position data pixels in a line at the film plane, the 
system must generate precision pulses spatially related to the facet angles. These pulses, 
occurring on a one per pixel basis, are used to gate in and turn off the intensity-modulated 
video being projected to the light-sensitive film surface. Because there are 120,000 pixels 
in the film recorder example (12 times 10,000) per revolution, one clock pulse would be 
required for every 10 arc s of shaft rotation.
Optical encoders are well suited to the task of generating accurately timed and posi­
tioned pulses. However, incremental, high-density data track encoders are expensive, 
large in diameter, and difficult to mechanically interface with an integral spinner/motor/
shaft assembly.
To overcome this problem, a smaller and inexpensive low-density optical encoder have 
6000 pulses per revolution (PPR) was designed into the system. The required 120,000 PPR 
pixel clock pulses are obtained by electronically multiplying the encoder data track fre­
quency (6000 PPR) by a factor of 20. Scanner speed control is accomplished by frequency/
phase locking the encoder data track (600 KHz) to an accurate and stable crystal oscillator. 
An index pulse is accurately positioned at the normal of a facet on a second encoder track, 
thereby providing start of scan (refer to Figure 5.9, SOS detector) synchronization and pixel 
registration.
This system of generating pixel clock pulses places a heavy burden on the performance 
accuracy of the rotating shaft assembly, the encoder design and adjustment, and the stabil­
ity of the crystal oscillator. Nevertheless, the net speed control and jitter performance has 
been optically measured to be less than ±10 ppm for one revolution of the scanner.
5.5.1  AC Synchronous Motor Control
Velocity control of the hysteresis synchronous motor is intrinsic to its design, that is, 
the  long-term speed is as accurate as the applied frequency. With reference to Figure 
5.14, the stator and rotor fields rotate together (at an integer submultiple of the applied 

Motors and Controllers for High-Performance Polygonal Scanners 
307
frequency) with the rotor lagging by the torque angle α and with possible modulations of 
±β, as was previously discussed. The control systems’ task is to fix the rotor vector posi­
tion, and therefore eliminate hunting and other speed variances.
To implement phase-lock control, the shaft rotational frequency and phase position are 
measured with a shaft-mounted incremental encoder. The encoder pulses are frequency 
and phase compared with a stable reference frequency using a frequency/phase compara­
tor, which has the transfer characteristics as shown in Figure 5.23. The frequency/phase 
comparator has a unique transfer characteristic that allows the device to produce an out­
put that is in saturation until the two input frequencies are equal. This is the frequency 
detection mode of the phase comparator. The saturation level is either positive or negative 
in value, and is useful in determining whether the motor speed is too high or too low. 
Assuming that the motor has reached synchronous speed, the tachometer frequency will 
equal the reference frequency, and the frequency/phase comparator will operate in the 
phase comparator mode. In this mode of operation, the output of the phase comparator 
is an analog voltage proportional to the phase difference between fT and fr. At zero fre­
quency and phase differences, the two signals are edge locked, and the phase compara­
tor output voltage is zero. Should the shaft advance or retard for any reason, the phase 
comparator error voltage will be in direct proportion to the phase difference within ±360 
electrical degrees of the reference frequency.
With reference to Figure 5.24, the phase comparator error is processed through a pro­
portional-integral-derivative (PID) controller compensation scheme and fed to the control 
input of the phase modulator.
The phase error-corrected phase modulator output frequency, fM is applied to the motor, 
thereby completing the position control loop from the encoder to the frequency/phase 
comparator. The open-loop DC gain of the system is primarily determined by the product 
of the encoder, frequency/phase comparator, integrator, and phase modulator gains. The 
high DC gain of the integrator (100 dB) reduces the phase error between fR and fT to zero, 
resulting in near perfect synchronization. The differentiation gain constant provides suffi­
cient damping to eliminate “hunting” and improve the overall dynamic performance and 
speed regulation to less than 1 ppm.
5.5.2  DC Brushless Motor Control

in that the brushless motor speed is a function of applied motor voltage, as opposed to

the frequency/phase as the driving function of the latter. The same principles of feedback 
velocity/position control are utilized in a similar fashion and are depicted in Figure 5.25. 
The elements within the closed-loop block diagram are essentially the same, with the 
exception of the motor transfer function and the addition of a DC power amplifier. The 
DC brushless motor transfer function is shown in detail in Figure 5.26. For simplification 
purposes, the commutating and pulsewidth modulation circuits have been omitted, but 
will be covered in a later discussion.
As before, to implement phase-lock control, the shaft frequency and phase position are 
measured with a shaft-mounted incremental encoder. The encoder pulses are frequency 
and phase compared with the reference frequency using a frequency/phase comparator, 
which has the transfer characteristics shown in Figure 5.23. The frequency/phase com­
parator has a unique transfer characteristic that allows the device to produce an output 
that is in saturation until the two input frequencies are equal. The saturation level is either 
positive or negative in value, and is useful in determining whether the motor speed is too 
high or too low.
The controller will accelerate or decelerate the motor until there is no frequency differ­
ence between the reference and the encoder signal. At this point a phase measurement is 
made by the comparator with every reference pulse cycle and an output voltage is gener­
ated that is proportional to the phase error.
The phase error signal is then processed through a PID controller and compensator, 
similar to that used in the hysteresis motor control system (Figure 5.24).
The detailed DC motor transfer function shown in Figure 5.26 relates the motor angular 
velocity w s to the applied terminal voltage VT. In English units the constants are defined as 
(across any two leads for a three-phase delta, or three-phase Y motor): R = motor winding 
resistance (Ohms); L = motor inductance (Henry); IM = motor current (Amperes); KT = motor

moment of inertia (oz-in/s2); JL = load moment of inertia (oz-in/s2); TF + TL = sum of the 
­friction and load torque (oz-in); and F = motor damping coefficient.
As the control system is turned on, the error signal is power amplified, causing the 
motor to accelerate to a speed at which fT exceeds (overshoots) fR. At this point, the error 
signal reverses polarity, reducing the motor speed until fT equals fr. Ultimately, a point 
of equilibrium is reached at which time the frequency/phase comparator error voltage is 
zero, and the integrator output voltage regulates the speed of the motor. Furthermore, the 
high DC gain of the integrator maintains a zero phase difference between fT and fR result­
ing in edge lock synchronization.
To ensure stable and accurate speed control, and to determine the gain coefficients KP, KI, 
and KA, the motor and load characteristics should be modeled. Several very useful simula­
tion programs such as SIMULINK (The Math Works, Inc., Natick, MA) are available for the 
systems designer which greatly reduce development time by allowing the rapid testing of 
various control configurations.
In conclusion, the DC brushless motor, when properly designed for the scanning appli­
cation at hand, is capable of meeting or exceeding the performance of AC hysteresis motors 
in all but the highest speed applications. All of the successful scanning products that are 
discussed at the end of this chapter use brushless DC motor technology.

5.6  APPLICATION EXAMPLES
The following sections describe a few of the many scanner designs and control systems that 
have been developed over the last few years. The overall industry trend reflects the unre­
lenting drive of the end use market to improve performance, reduce power consumption 
and size of the supporting electronics, and to reduce the cost of the scanner subsystem.
Fortunately, the consumer electronics and automotive markets have provided many of 
the electronic components that have proven to be invaluable in the quest to reduce the 
size and cost of the scanning system. Progress in miniaturization and power reduction 
of the scanner control electronics is also largely due to the advancements in brushless DC 
motor technology. As the cost and complexity of the drive electronics for brushless motors 
approach those of conventional DC motors, brushless motor technology will likely dis­
place all other motor types in scanning subsystems, as it offers high efficiency along with 
the high reliability, as previously found only in AC motors.
5.6.1  Military Vehicle Thermal Imager Scanner
Pictured in Figure 5.27 is a small 12-facet polygon scanner that is designed for a military 
vehicle thermal camera system. This compact ball bearing scanner operates at 600 rpm 
and serves to generate the field scan function in conjunction with an infrared detector 
array. The motor and control system is designed to maintain polygon speed regulation 
to within 15 ppm (0.0015%). In addition, the control system must maintain the specified 
speed regulation in the presence of base disturbances, which are passed to the scanner as 
a result of vehicle motion. These challenges have been met in this compact scanner by the 
use of a high-resolution encoder and lightweight polygon design in conjunction with an 
agile control system.
The scanner employs a small low-voltage brushless DC motor, which is optimized for 
low cogging torque and smooth operation at low speed. Motor commutation is derived 
FIGURE 5.27

from three dedicated commutation tracks on the optical encoder disk, which also includes 
a high resolution 3000 count tachometer track as well as an index.
At the center of the control system is a single-chip motor driver, which decodes the com­
mutation information provided by the encoder and produces the correct three-phase motor 
current waveforms necessary for proper operation of the motor. Motor driver ICs of this 
type are commonplace devices found in computer disk drive and CD player applications. 
The motor driver produces a current through the motor windings that is proportional to a 
command voltage at its input and also incorporates a brake feature that is used to deceler­
ate the motor for better control of the polygon speed under the influence of disturbances.
Tight speed control is accomplished by the use of a phase-lock loop regulation method 
as described in detail in the previous sections. At the operating speed of 600 rpm, the 
3000 line optical encoder produces a tachometer frequency of 30 KHz, which is compared 
against an externally generated reference frequency in the phase/frequency compara­
tor circuit. Any resulting phase error is amplified and filtered, and then fed to the motor 
driver, which increases or reduces the motor current to maintain the speed and minimize 
the phase error. If the motor control voltage falls below a predetermined level indicating 
that the scanner is operating above the reference speed, then the control system applies 
dynamic braking to the motor, which quickly decelerates the motor and the polygon.
A block diagram of the controller/driver is shown in Figure 5.28.
5.6.2  Battery-Powered Thermal Imager Scanner
The polygon scanning system pictured in Figure 5.29 was designed for a compact, low-cost, 
military thermal sighting device primarily intended for small arms applications. Many 
unique and difficult requirements are imposed by the system specifications on this rela­
tively low-cost device. A wide operating temperature range, precise scanning speed, low 
cross-scan error, and low power consumption must simultaneously be met. In addition, 
the scanner must meet the demanding performance specifications for a high-resolution

imaging system while being subjected to severe levels of shock and vibration. Particular 
attention was given to ensure the mechanical stability of the polygon under severe envi­
ronmental conditions. Some of the scanner requirements are as shown in Table 5.5.
In order to maximize battery life, the total power consumption of the scanner was lim­
ited by the specification to less than 0.4 W while operating in synchronism at the low-
temperature extreme.
A compact low-speed brushless DC motor similar to that in Figure 5.22 was designed 
specifically to address the low power and low cogging torque requirements necessary for 
this application. A new, single chip motor driver, which employs PWM control, was selected 
to improve efficiency in the drive and help meet the power consumption requirement. The 
driver PWM efficiency benefit becomes more apparent as the motor load increases and the 
drive must supply more current to maintain speed regulation. With a linear motor driver 
such as the one used in the military vehicle scanner, additional power is lost in the form of 
heat dissipated in the driver power section.
Effective speed regulation is achieved by the implementation of the same control scheme 
used in the military vehicle scanner shown in Figure 5.28. The optical encoder tachometer 
track line density was reduced to 1500 counts per revolution to meet the interface require­
ments of the imaging system. At 600 rpm the encoder tachometer track produces a 15-KHz 
pulse frequency, which is at an adequately high rate to maintain precise speed control of 
the polygon.

The phase-lock loop control system was optimized to maintain phase lock of the 
encoder tachometer with the synchronization reference under the influence of base 
motion disturbances and thereby prevent the loss of the image produced by the camera 
system during movement or under vibration. The need to reject base motion distur­
bances while providing precise speed control poses a unique challenge in the design of 
the control system. The scanner total rotational inertia must be minimized to allow the 
motor torque to accelerate and decelerate the polygon in order to overcome disturbance-
induced speed changes. On the other hand, the rotational inertia within the scanner acts 
to reduce the effect of bearing and motor torque fluctuations, which tend to degrade speed 
stability. A compromise design was reached that adequately addresses both needs and 
meets the performance targets set for the scanner.
In order to reduce cost and update the electronic design of the control system, a new 
controller/driver circuit board was developed, which is shown in Figure 5.30. Significant 
cost savings were realized as older, ceramic packaged military grade integrated circuits 
were replaced with industrial quality devices. Performance and environmental specifi­
cations for the scanner were met with the plastic-packaged industrial ICs, and the part 
obsolescence issues were solved that appear with ever greater frequency in the electronic 
components world.
5.6.3  High-Speed Single-Faceted Scanner
The successful scanner design shown in Figure 5.31 was developed for the publishing and 
printing industry for use in the image setting machines that are the output devices lead­
ing to the manufacture of printing plates. The single-faceted mirror, or monogon, rotates 
at high speed and scans an intensity modulated laser spot along a sheet of film not unlike 
that shown in the film recorder system of Figure 5.9. The exceptions are that the film sheet 
FIGURE 5.30

usually lies on the inside surface of a cylindrical drum and the F–θ lens is omitted. Also, 
the film sheet is stationary and the scanner rides the length of the drum on precision linear 
bearings driven by a ball-screw mechanism.
For improved speed stability and cross-scan accuracy, as well as greatly improved bear­
ing life, the scanner rotating elements are supported by self-pumping conical air bear­
ings. This type of bearing provides excellent high-speed stability and low friction with 
the benefit of virtually unlimited operating life. The self-pumping action of the air bear­
ing design is a major factor in reducing the cost of the scanner because an external air 
supply is not required. Some versions of this scanner operate at 60,000 rpm and utilize 
the highspeed motor design shown in Figure 5.10. The low-cost optical encoder shown 
in Figure 5.9 ­provides up to 2000 pulses per revolution for effective speed control and 
also sends mirror position information to the imaging system. The success of this scan­
ner design is partly due to the development of a low-cost single card controller, which 
is described in greater detail in the next section. The scanner and control system block 
diagram is shown in Figure 5.33.
5.6.4  Versatile Single Board Controller and Driver
The need for a versatile, compact, and inexpensive motor driver and speed controller 
led to the development of a successful circuit capable of delivering up to 100 W of power 
to a three-phase brushless motor scanner. All of the functions necessary to achieve pre­
cise scanner speed control have been integrated into one unit. The reference frequency 
generator, phase-lock loop controller, and motor driver are combined on a single low-
cost circuit card, which measures 4 × 8 in. A great deal of flexibility has been incor­
porated into this low-cost controller design so that many scanning applications can 
be readily accommodated without the need for circuit modifications. Various encoder 
resolutions and reference frequencies may be accommodated by setting jumpers that 
reconfigure the digital logic in order to present compatible frequencies to the phase 
comparator circuit.
FIGURE 5.31
High-speed scanner and controller/driver.

Motors and Controllers for High-Performance Polygonal Scanners

This single board controller has been utilized to drive single-faceted as well as ­polygon 
scanners operating between 3000 and 81,000 rpm for a variety of laser scanning applica­
tions, and has demonstrated excellent speed regulation capabilities. The rotational speed 
jitter in many of the air bearing scanners driven by this controller was measured to be only 
a few parts per million within one rotation. This successful design has been incorporated 
into thousands of scanning systems sold to the printing and publishing industry world­
wide. The controller is shown in Figure 5.32.
As shown in Figure 5.33, the circuit functions can be divided into the following main 
categories:
	
1.	Reference frequency generator and external sync processing circuit
	
2.	Phase detector and PWM synchronization circuit
	
3.	Control loop PID circuit
	
4.	Brushless motor controller and FET power section
The controller reference frequency generator and external sync processing circuits 
­function to provide a precise and stable frequency reference to the phase comparator. An 
on-board quartz reference oscillator and programmable divider provide for the selection 
of up to 16 preset operating speeds for the scanner. The speed may also be continuously 
varied within a wide band with the application of an external reference frequency from 
the imaging system controller. In this way, fine adjustments to the scanning speed may be 
made to trim the system optical parameters.
The phase detector and frequency comparator circuits produce the speed error volt­
age, which is then amplified and sent to the servo compensation network. The phase 
detector exhibits high gain since the output is in saturation until the two frequencies 
fR and fT are exactly the same, as discussed previously and shown in Figure 5.23. 
This feature is responsible for the precise nature of phase-lock loop speed control 
systems.

Another useful innovation developed in the quest to provide the best possible speed 
regulation is the synchronization of the PWM oscillator with the phase detector reference 
frequency. The synchronization of these two frequencies ensures that the noise generated 
by the beat frequencies do not interfere with the scanner speed control circuits. When 
synchronized, the two frequencies produce a sum or difference (beat frequency), which 
will be constant. Stationary beat frequencies may be filtered or appear only as DC offsets, 
which may be subtracted from the speed control signal. The PID servo controller is similar 
to the arrangement shown in Figure 5.25 and described in earlier sections. Because most of 
the scanning systems targeted for this controller are for stable and controlled environment 
applications, the servo control loop is optimized for speed control regulation rather than 
response time. In these applications, high rotating inertia in the scanner rotor and polygon 
is a benefit to speed regulation.
The motor driver and power output section consists of a monolithic (single chip) control­
ler and discrete FET power switches. With a modest amount of forced air cooling, the FET 
power section is capable of delivering up to 4 A continuously and 6 A for several seconds 
to deliver higher motor starting current. The motor current is regulated by the driver IC 
using PWM control, which is effective in delivering power to the motor with minimum 
heat generation in the controller.
For some high-speed polygonal scanning applications it may not be possible to include 
an optical encoder within the scanner housing. In this instance, the polygon facet fre­
quency may be used as the speed feedback sensor as depicted in Figure 5.34. The optical 
pulse frequency should be at or above 1 KHz in order to provide precise speed regulation 
in this configuration.

5.7  CONCLUSIONS
The availability of low-cost brushless DC motors and drivers has made a significant 
impact on rotary scanner designs over the past 15 years. Advances in the motor driver 
area have been especially important in that the size and cost of these devices have been 
reduced remarkably. The power efficiency of brushless DC motors as well as the motor 
driver allows for high mechanical power output with minimal temperature rise. For many 
polygon-scanning applications, it is now practical to integrate the drive and control func­
tions directly on the scanner or motor body.

6.1  INTRODUCTION
Although rotary scanners can take a variety of forms today, the basic concept of smoothly 
rotating a reflective, or holographic, optic remains the same. The optic must be rotated 
around a defined axis with a high degree of repeatability, and within a specified speed 
stability. These requirements will define, in the broadest sense, the type of bearings to be 
selected within the scanner assembly. Other considerations will include package price, 
maximum speed, thermal and environmental issues, and lifetime.
Owing to the design interactions of the different components within the scanner assem­
bly, discrete parts can rarely be designed in isolation from one another. It is necessary to 
understand how the dynamics of the shaft interact with the bearing system, together with 
the effects of additional parts such as the motor, encoder, and optic.
The object of this chapter is to examine many of the compromises and trade-offs necessary 
to specify, rather than design, the correct bearing/shaft system, for the machine designer 
with limited experience of such systems. Owing to recent advances in the design of gas 
bearings and the ever increasing demands on performance, this chapter will focus more 
on this technology rather than on ball bearing designs, although all the alternatives will be 
discussed. A more detailed analysis of ball bearing design criteria can be reviewed.1
6.2  BEARING TYPES FOR ROTARY SCANNERS
When designing a new rotating product, the traditional first choice for most designers will 
be some form of rolling element bearing. Readily available, easy to incorporate, and usu­
ally relatively inexpensive, it appears the ideal solution for a rotary scanner, and indeed 
many successful designs were used in early internal drum and flatbed image setters as 
well as laser printers, plotters, faxes, and photocopiers.

Bearings for Rotary Scanners 
321
However, with the advent of higher resolution and productivity, machine designers have 
had to find alternative solutions to the traditional ball bearing assembly. The main types of 
bearings that can be considered will now be examined briefly.
6.2.1  Gas-Lubricated Bearings
Regarded by most now as the industry standard for high-quality scanning devices, the 
use of gas-lubricated, and more specifically air-lubricated, bearings has become wide­
spread across the image setting and laser printing industries. These bearings take the 
form primarily of self-acting, or aerodynamic, design, generating their own internal air 
film between the shaft and bearing, but there are also larger designs using externally pres­
surized bearings requiring some form of compressor. Each type has its own advantages 
and these will be examined in detail later in this chapter.
6.2.2  Oil-Lubricated Bearings
The hydrodynamic oil bearing, being self-acting, could be utilized in a rotary scanner, but 
its main disadvantage of static oil leakage limits it to special applications only.
6.2.3  Magnetic Bearings
The use of active magnetic bearings where the shaft is supported by a strong magnetic 
field, is becoming a practical alternative due to enormous improvements in the electronic 
controls to maintain the position of the shaft within the magnetic fields. A hybrid combin­
ation of passive magnetic bearings and air-lubricated bearings is also now in use.
6.2.4  Ball Bearings
For certain less demanding applications, angular contact ball bearings are still the ideal 
choice, especially with the recent advances in hybrid bearings utilizing ceramic ball bear­
ing technology, and improved grease lubricants. These products can be found in certain 
desktop laser printers, fax machines, and most barcode scanner systems.
6.3  BEARING SELECTION
Before examining each bearing type in some technical detail, it is proposed to compare 
the relative benefits and disadvantages of each technology to allow the designer to focus 
quickly on the correct selection and move on to the relevant section of this chapter. Figure 
6.1 shows a simple comparison chart of the most likely bearing systems to be considered 
for a rotary scanner based on rotational accuracy, maximum speed capability, relative 
price, and lifetime.
From Figure 6.1, it is clear that for most high-accuracy scanner applications, air bearing 
technology is the most suitable, while for lower specification products, the ball bearing 
design would be the most cost effective. However, a more detailed comparison may be 
necessary if the scanner is to be operated under special conditions, which could demand 
other bearing systems. Table 6.1 gives a more detailed comparison, and compares the mer­
its of self-acting against aerostatic air bearings.

6.4  GAS BEARINGS
This section of the chapter examines in some detail the two main types of gas bearings; 
namely self acting, aerodynamic and pressure-fed aerostatic designs. Typical mechanical 
construction of both types will also be investigated.

Bearings for Rotary Scanners

bearing can be traced back as far as 1897 with the work of Kingsbury.2 This was followed 
up in 1913 by Harrison,3 who developed an approximate theory governing the perform­
ance of a gas-lubricated bearing, which allowed for the effects of compressibility.
At this early stage, the theory made clear that extreme accuracy would be necessary in 
the manufacture of a gas bearing. For this reason the concept lay dormant for the next 
40 years. During the 1950s, many new fields of research were developing, most notably 
that of atomic energy. Nuclear reactors were being created, and the study of the radioac­
tive environment necessitated the circulation of gas through the atomic pile. The demands 
on the circulators were considerable, with some power requirements being in excess of 
100 HP. The original circulators designed for the purpose used conventional lubricants. 
Unfortunately, however, it was soon discovered that the radioactive environment caused 
the bearing lubricants to solidify, resulting in bearing seizure.
The failure of the gas circulators seriously hampered atomic research, and sparked an 
extensive search for a solution. It became clear that the only lubricant available for the 
circulators was the radioactive gas itself, and necessity became the mother of invention, as 
so often in the past.
Early work on research into gas bearings was carried out at Harwell, and the task was 
soon passed on to a number of major manufacturers of aero engines, these being the only 
companies at the time having facilities to achieve the level of accuracy required. Early 
results were encouraging, but following bearing seizures in many research establishments, 
it became clear that a bearing instability termed half-speed whirl presented a major obs­
tacle, which had to be surmounted before desired speeds could be achieved. A number of 
solutions were finally devised, and circulators were built capable of handling radioactive 
gases at temperatures of up to 500 °C at pressures of 350 psig. One of the largest circulators 
was constructed by Societe Rateau for the Dragon reactor project. The pump ran at 12,000 
rpm at 120HP circulating helium at 289 psig at 350 °C.
A further need for gas lubrication during this period was in the field of inertial naviga­
tion, where the replacement of miniature ball bearings resulted in a remarkable advance 
in accuracy of the instrument.
In the early stages of the above developments, theoretical performance characteristics 
gave little more than a guide, and the demands stimulated intensive theoretical and exper­
imental research. Of the many vital theoretical contributions made, perhaps Raimondi 
should be singled out for his informative paper in 1961 entitled “A numerical solution for 
the gas lubricated full journal bearing of finite length.”4 By the use of computer-generated 
design charts in this paper, it proved possible to obtain excellent agreement between the­
ory and practice for the aerodynamic bearing. Unfortunately, at this stage, half-speed whirl 
defied accurate prediction, and solutions relied heavily on practical experience.
In parallel with studies on aerodynamic bearings, work was also proceeding on the 
theoretical performance of pressure-fed bearings. This type of bearing tended to be more 
amenable to prediction, and again many valuable contributions were made to assist engi­
neers in their efforts to create practical gas-lubricated bearings.
One of the earliest practical applications of the pressure-fed air bearing was in the realm 
of dentistry. In the 1960s a dental drill produced by Westwind Air Bearings proved very 
successful in the field, operating at 500,000 rpm with minimal vibration. Other applica­
tions included precision grinding and drilling spindles for the machine tool industry.
It is only within recent times that the aerodynamic bearing has come to the fore once 
again, this time in the field of laser scanning. The characteristics of the aerodynamic bear­
ing are ideally suited to this particular application, which demands high-speed rotation 
with very low levels of vibration, and zero contamination of the environment. Figure 6.2

shows typical aerodynamic scanners and items used in the internal drum laser scanning 
market.
6.4.2  Fundamentals
There are certain fundamental characteristics of gases that explain why gas bearings are 
particularly suitable for high-speed rotary scanner designs.
6.4.2.1  Low Heat Generation
Compared with even the lightest instrument bearing oil, dynamic viscosity of the com­
mon gases used in gas bearing spindles are several orders of magnitude lower (Table 6.2). 
The main benefit of low viscosity can be seen from the equation below showing the power 
loss in a journal bearing.5

(6.1)
where μ = viscosity of the fluid/gas, D = shaft diameter, L = length of journal, ω = angular 
velocity of shaft, and c = radial clearance between the shaft and journal.
It can be readily seen how the power consumed is proportional to the lubricant viscos­
ity, and this allows the gas bearing to be run at much higher speeds for the same shaft 
diameter as in an oil bearing. Figure 6.3 shows typical journal heat generation figures for 
several common air bearing shaft sizes. Also, the shaft diameter has a critical effect on the 
heat generation, due to the cubic function in Equation 6.1.

(6.2)
where b = outside radius of the thrust bearing, a = inside radius of the thrust bearing, and 
h = axial clearance between the shaft and bearing surface.
6.4.2.2  Wide Temperature Range
Another important factor is that the variation of viscosity with temperature is small for all 
the gases in Table 6.2. This allows gas bearings a very wide operating temperature range, 
and it is the mechanical properties of the bearing and shaft materials that will usually 
limit the maximum temperature of operation, not the bearing itself. This limit could be the 
differential thermal expansion between the shaft and journal changing the clearance to an 
unacceptable amount or even the maximum thermal conductivity of the bearing material 
to transmit heat out of the bearing system.
6.4.2.3  Noncontamination of Environment
With aerodynamic bearings, the gas surrounding the bearing is used as the lubricant, usu­
ally air for common rotary scanners, and no contamination of the gas will occur (provided

the bearing materials do not chemically react with the gas). With aerostatic bearings, the 
pressurized gas supply (again usually air in normal scanners) will purge out of the bear­
ing, mixing harmlessly with the environment. This has the added benefit of preventing the 
ingress of dust or other particles that could eventually cause damage to the shaft/bearing 
assembly by blocking the gap between the shaft and bearing.
6.4.2.4  Repeatability of Smoothness
As there is no physical contact between the shaft journal and the bearing during rotation, 
the axis of rotation, or the orbit of the shaft, will not degrade over the lifetime of the spin­
dle, ensuring repeatable optic performance. The smoothness of rotation within one revo­
lution of the shaft ensures minimal cross-scan errors off the optic.
6.4.2.5  Accuracy of Rotation
The shaft journal will find the average centerline of the bearing, as it is surrounded by the 
gaseous lubricant, which will conform to any local irregularities created during the manu­
facturing process, and as a general rule the shaft orbit will be an order of magnitude better 
than the measured roundness of the bearing in which it is revolving.
6.4.2.6  Noise and Vibration
Particularly with reference to aerodynamic bearings, audible noise is negligible from the 
bearing system. The main source of noise is generated by the windage of the optic. The 
damping properties of the gas film help ensure that transmission of any shaft vibration 
through to the bearing is reduced.
6.4.3  Aerostatic Bearings
A constant supply of pressurized gas must be supplied to both the radial and axial bearing 
gaps to support the shaft load with aerostatic bearings. Although the lift-off, or float pres­
sure, will be at a very low pressure, to achieve useful loads and stiffness a pressure in the 
order of 3–6 bar is normally used.
This requires the use of an external compressor, which is a big disadvantage in many 
rotary scanner applications as the rest of the scanning system will not usually require 
compressed air, and additional noise, vibration, and cost associated with the compressor 
could be prohibitive. However, particularly when rotating large, overhung optics, the ben­
efits of high radial and axial loads may justify the use of aerostatic bearings, particularly if 
very low speed operation is required (such as a few hundred revolutions per minute).
Another benefit with aerostatic bearings is that the shaft can be rotated in either direction 
with identical performance, something not normally possible with aerodynamic bearings. 
This feature could be of use where one aerostatic spindle is to be used in a variety of scan­
ning products, which could well run in different directions. Finally, although the exhaust­
ing of gas through the end of the bearings creates additional noise, the self-cleaning effect 
could be useful to prevent particles created in the scanning machine (particularly paper 
and carbon) from being deposited inside the scanner.
The general design principles will now be examined, followed by some general notes on 
construction.

6.4.3.1  Aerostatic Journal Bearing
The general principle of operation can be explained by reference to Figure 6.4. The bear­
ing consists of an annular cylinder containing two sets of orifices, or jets, one row towards 
each end of the bearing.
The jets are supplied with gas at pressure Ps and the gas exhausts at Pa to atmosphere. 
With no load on the shaft (and ignoring its own mass) the downstream pressure in the gap 
between the shaft and the bearing is equal all round any circumference as shown in the 
cross section of the bearing through one of the jet planes. The associated pressure profile 
diagram along the bearing shows how the discharge pressure Pd slowly drops as the gas 
flows towards the ends of the bearing until it exhausts at the atmospheric pressure Pa. In 
other words, there is a constant flow of gas between the jet plane and the end of the bear­
ing, while the area between the jet planes remains at a constant pressure.
When a radial load is applied to the shaft, it will be displaced in the direction of the force, 
reducing the gap between the shaft and the bearing. The localized gas flow will reduce,

causing an increase in pressure (Pd1 - Pa), with a similar reduction in pressure (Pd5 - Pa) 
due to an increase in flow on the other side of the shaft. This resultant pressure difference 
across the shaft will cause it to resist the applied load, preventing surface contact between 
the two parts. When the load is removed, the pressure distribution will return the shaft to 
the central position again.
In practice, due to the relatively small number of jets per row, typically 8 to 12, disper­
sion effects reduce the effective pressure zone between the rows of jets. This will reduce 
the load capacity slightly, as will circumferential flow around the bearing from the high 
pressure to the low pressure zone. Although there are other methods of feeding the gas 
into the bearings, such as slot feeds or the use of porous materials, the discrete jet orifice 
method has become the favorite for this market.
6.4.3.1.1  Load Capacity
The standard equation for expressing the radial load capacity of an aerostatic journal 
bearing is:

(

where Ps = supply pressure, Pa = ambient pressure, L = bearing length, D = bearing diam­
eter, and CL = dimensionless load coefficient. The load coefficient CL is affected by sev­
eral different parameters, including the eccentricity ratio, the downstream pressure Pd, 
the number of jets (the dispersion effect), and the jet position in relation to the end of the 
bearing. There are ways of estimating these effects as shown by Shires.6
To be able to estimate the actual maximum load capacity, the designer must decide how 
close to the bearing surface the shaft can be moved before local irregularities in the bear­
ing or shaft cause actual contact; that is, balance, roundness of the shaft, ovality of the 
bearing, and squareness of the shaft to the bearing all have an effect on this decision. This 
displacement is usually referred to as the eccentricity ratio ε of the shaft in the bearing 
and a typical maximum figure while rotating would be 0.5. That is, the shaft has been dis­
placed by half the total radial clearance. Figure 6.5 shows typical load capacities for shaft 
diameters used in rotary scanners, with two different bearing length-to-diameter ratios: 
using ε = 0.5, jet position = 0.25 × L, Ps = 5.5 bar g.

where We is the load capacity at ε = 0.1, ε = 0.1, and C0 = radial clearance between the shaft

ous shaft sizes.
6.4.3.1.3  Heat Generation
At first glance the designer would want to keep the radial clearance as small as possible 
to ensure maximum stiffness, but the trade-off is that bearing heat generation is inversely 
proportional to the clearance as shown in Equation 6.1, and a compromise has to be reached 
between these two factors. Figure 6.7 shows bearing heat generation plotted against clear­
ance for the common sizes of shaft.

Dependent upon the construction of the spindle, there will be a critical limit on the heat 
generation per square centimeter of bearing surface above which liquid cooling will be 
necessary to maintain the correct clearance between the shaft and bearing (due to thermal 
expansion).
6.4.3.1.4  Bearing Gas Flow
Before the air flow can be calculated, another design factor that must be considered is the 
shape of the jet orifice itself. There are two common forms of discrete jet: the plain jet and 
the pocketed jet. Figure 6.8 shows a simplified form of both types.
With the plain jet the smallest flow area is controlled by the bearing radial clearance c 
and hence the area used for flow calculations is the surface area of a hollow cylinder with 
the length equal to the radial clearance c.
	
A = πdc
However, with the pocketed jet (or simple orifice) the smallest flow area is controlled by 
the jet diameter itself, hence the area for flow calculations is the cross-sectional area of the 
jet itself.
	
A
d

Obviously, if very large clearances are used, which is rare, even a plain jet will run as a 
simple orifice.
For better control of flow, pocketed jets are preferable and yield higher stiffness due to 
reduced dispersion effects, but plain jets provide greater damping reducing the likelihood 
of instability. This instability or resonance can occur if the pocket volume is too large for 
the bearing design and a self-induced pneumatic hammer can be heard.
Figure 6.9 shows typical air flow for a 25-mm shaft for both pocketed jets and plain jets 
with a diameter of 0.16 mm.
6.4.3.2  Aerostatic Thrust Bearing
An aerostatic thrust, or axial bearing system consists of two opposed circular thrust plates 
sandwiching the shaft axial runner with the gap between the surfaces being controlled by

a spacer, slightly thicker than the shaft runner, which is located around the outside diam­
eter of the shaft.
Figure 6.10 shows a single thrust plate fitted with an annular row of discrete jets, linked 
by a narrow groove. The purpose of the groove is to create a pressure ring around the jet 
pitch circle diameter (PCD) for optimum performance, particularly when the shaft runner 
is almost at touchdown condition on the thrust face. The associated pressure profile is also 
shown.
For stability, two thrust plates are used in opposition, trapping the shaft runner between.

axially the shaft will move towards one face of the axial bearing and the flow through the 
jets will drop, causing an increase in pressure over that bearing face. This will create an 
opposing force on the shaft runner, preventing it from moving closer to the bearing sur­
face. Meanwhile, the opposite happens on the other bearing face, reducing the force on the 
other shaft runner face.
This mechanism can be seen more clearly with reference to Figure 6.11a, which shows 
the load capacity lines of both faces and where they cross will become the equilibrium pos­
ition of the shaft runner. Other forms of axial bearing such as the center fed or journal fed 
are possible but the annular ring of jets is the most suitable for this market.

where Pd = downstream pressure, Pa = ambient pressure, b = outside radius of plate, and 
a = inside radius of plate. Estimation of the downstream pressure Pd is based on a num­
ber of factors, which are beyond the scope of this chapter (see Reference 5). Again, with 
reference to Figure 6.11a, it can be seen that the maximum load capacity of an opposed 
thrust plate assembly is the summation of (W2 - W1), at the point where the runner is 
approaching contact with thrust face 2.
Figure 6.11b shows some typical load values used in axial bearings for scanner applica­
tions, with a constant ratio between the outer radius and the inner radius of 1.6.

Axial stiffness is calculated using the equation

where W2 = load capacity of face 2 for the position of (equilibrium position −δ), W1 = load 
capacity of face 2 for the position of (equilibrium position +δ), and δ = distance moved for 
applied external load. Note, for maximum stiffness, K is normally calculated for a δ of 
<10% of the total endfloat.
It can be seen from Figure 6.12, a plot of axial stiffness against axial clearance for various 
bearing diameters, that the centerline (or equilibrium position) stiffness is highly depend­
ent upon the clearance between the shaft runner and the bearing.
To achieve optimum stiffness, the number of jets, the radius of the jets, and the dimen­
sion of the groove must all be considered. For minimum air flow, and highest stiffness, a 
small clearance is desirable, but again heat generation will be highest at this clearance.
6.4.3.2.3  Heat Generation
Using Equation 6.2, the effect of small clearances on axial bearing heat generation is shown 
in Figure 6.13.

the mass of the polygon the axial bearing system is located at the rear of the shaft, adjacent 
to the brushless DC motor. To minimize air flow, a long single radial bearing design has 
been used with only two rows of jets. For maximum radial stiffness and load capacity, a 
four-jet row, twin bearing system could be used at the expense of higher-air flow. An opti­
cal encoder system is fitted at the rear of shaft to guarantee high-accuracy speed control. 
The bearing materials would typically be bronze or gunmetal, while the shaft itself would 
be stainless steel.

6.4.4  Aerodynamic Bearings
In recent years, the use of aerodynamic or self-acting bearings has become more wide­
spread, replacing ball bearing or aerostatic bearing assemblies in this market. In gen­
eral, machining tolerances are much smaller for aerodynamic bearings and it is only 
with the recent advent of higher precision computer numerical control (CNC) machines 
that it has become more cost effective to introduce this technology for high-volume 
manufacturing.
In its simplest form, the aerodynamic bearing consists of a plain circular tube in which 
the shaft rotates as shown in Figure 6.15. If a load W is imposed onto the shaft as shown, 
causing the shaft to move off center by an amount εh0, the pressure will rise in the reduced 
gap due to viscous shear of the gas, creating a “wedge” similar to the mechanism occur­
ring in a hydrodynamic oil bearing. This high-pressure zone allows the shaft to float so it 
can rotate without contact in the bearing.
Owing to the low viscosity of gases, the clearance between the shaft journal must be 
very small, typically a few microns for this effect to be useful. Obviously, when the shaft 
is stationary, there is no viscous shear, or supporting pressure, and the shaft journal and 
bearing will be in contact. To avoid damage to both surfaces when starting to rotate the 
shaft a high-torque motor is required to accelerate the shaft to floating speed in a very 
short time. For shaft diameters utilized in scanner assemblies, this speed is typically sev­
eral hundred rpm.
Obviously gases are compressible, and this will reduce the effect of the pressure wedge 
compared with a liquid, and the resulting load calculations can be complex. However, it 
can be shown that the compressibility number Λ can be used as a guidance of bearing 
performance.6

Figure 6.16 shows how the load capacity at constant eccentricity ε for compressible 
and incompressible fluids varies with increasing compressibility number Λ. It can be 
seen that for gases at high compressibility numbers, the load capacity becomes inde­
pendent of this number. Practically speaking, this means that there comes a point when 
the radial load capacity (and stiffness) become independent of the speed of the shaft.
Also from Figure 6.15, it can be seen that when load W is applied to the shaft, the closest 
approach between the journal and bearing is not in direct opposition to W, but at an atti­
tude angle ø. This angle can theoretically vary between zero and 90° and is mainly depen­
dent on the compressibility factor.
Load Capacity  Estimating the load capacity of an aerodynamic bearing is more complex 
than for the aerostatic version, due to the compressibility effects. However, Raimondi4 
managed to compute numerical solutions and create design charts using the dimensionless 
group:
	
load ratio

P

where P = bearing pressure, Pa = ambient pressure, W = load capacity, r = shaft radius, and 
L = bearing length, and the compressibility number Λ (Equation 6.3) for various eccentric­
ity ratios. Figure 6.17 shows the Raimondi graph4 for a bearing L/D ratio of 2, probably the 
minimum number for practical aerodynamic bearings. Having calculated the compress­
ibility number, and decided what is the maximum practical eccentricity ratio, the load 
capacity can be derived.
Unfortunately, from the explanation regarding load capacity, it is obvious that if no load 
is applied to the shaft in an aerodynamic bearing, then there is no wedge action and with­
out the associated pressure effect, the shaft is essentially unstable. To overcome this insta­
bility, the designer must incorporate some kind of surface form into the bearing of the 
shaft that creates a wedge effect without the use of a load. Obviously, the shaft mass itself 
creates a small eccentricity if the shaft is running horizontally, but often it is not. Also with 
Compressibility no. ∧

the correct surface form design, the effect of load at constant eccentricity becoming inde­
pendent of speed at high compressibility numbers can be dramatically reduced.
There are two main surface forms used in aerodynamic scanner bearings; spiral grooves 
and lobing.
6.4.4.1  Spiral Groove Bearings
A series of shallow spiral grooves can be machined into either surface, but usually in the 
shaft journal, which are open to the atmosphere at one end. Gas is drawn into these grooves 
by viscous shear during rotation and creates a pressurized zone towards the closed end 
(Figure 6.18). The important journal groove geometric parameters are: groove angle, α; no. 
of grooves, N; groove depth ratio, h0/h; groove length ratio, Lg/L; and groove width ratio, 
W1/(W1 + W2).
The compressibility number from Equation 6.3 can still be used and from using the 
appropriate graphs7 the optimized geometry can be deduced.

The same concept can be applied to the axial annular bearings with a series of shallow 
grooves machined into one of the surfaces, which spiral in towards the center, again creat­
ing a pressurized zone at the closed inner ends. Figure 6.19 shows a typical example with 
the pressure profile. The important thrust groove geometric parameters are: radius ratio, 
(rb - ri)/(rb - ra); width ratio, W1/W2; depth ratio, h0/h; and groove angle, θ. Practical values 
of these parameters have been established by Whitley and Williams8 and from these an 
estimation of the load capacity and stiffness can be made.
There are three basic bearing configurations that can be utilized with spiral groove tech­
nology: separate parallel radial and axial bearings, conical bearings, or spherical bearings, 
as Figure 6.20 shows.
Both the conic and the spherical bearing designs have the advantage of only one set of 
grooves, which makes for a compact design, especially if the motor can be placed between 
the bearings, but creating the bearing surfaces precisely is quite a production challenge, 
particularly for the hemispherical type.
6.4.4.2  Lobed Bearings/Shaft
Another form of aerodynamic geometry is the lobed bearing or shaft, which has an out-of-
round surface that generates an axial increased pressure zone, or zones, along the length 
of the bearing as it rotates. Figure 6.21 shows a typical bearing form, which has three lobes 
and also a stabilizing groove that creates a small shaft eccentricity for stability (Westwind 
Patent No. EP07053939).

This design has the advantage of simple manufacture in production volumes with stable 
performance over a wide speed range, and is ideally suited to supporting overhung optics 
due to the large bearing centerline separation.
Alternatively, the shaft could be lobed, and with the latest CNC cam grinding machines 
this form can be machined relatively easily. However, some form of spiral groove axial 
bearing will still be required on either design.

6.4.4.3  Spindle Construction
A typical overhung polygon scanner unit is shown in Figure 6.22 using lobed radial bear­
ing and spiral groove axial bearing technologies. To help balance out the mass of the poly­
gon on the front of the shaft, the axial bearings, together with the motor and encoder, have 
been located at the rear. For vertical operation, additional repulsing magnets are contained 
at the rear of the spindle, one in the shaft and one in the housing, to provide additional 
upwards force to reduce starting frictional torque on the lower thrust plate.
To allow many thousands of stop/start cycles, bearing surfaces need to be coated with 
some form of antiscuff, low-friction material, probably containing PTFE (Teflon®). The 
choice of shaft and bearing materials is important to ensure that the correct bearing clear­
ances are maintained over a wide range of temperatures.
For center-mounted polygon scanners, a conical bearing design with spiral groove tech­
nology is probably the most practical due to its compact shape, with the motor mounted 
between the bearings as shown in Figure 6.23. In this case, the rotor rotates around the 
static central stator.
For many applications today, a monogon optic design is required, which by its very 
nature must be mounted onto the front of the shaft. A typical scanner cross section is 
shown in Figure 6.24 using a lobed radial bearing and spiral groove axial bearing technol­
ogy. Note that the axial bearing is now at the front of the spindle, close to the optic. This 
minimizes the forward axial growth of the shaft due to heat generation within the radial 
bearing system as monogon scanning systems are sensitive to axial movements (which can 
misplace the output beam).

6.4.5  Hybrid Gas Bearings
There is a special form of radial bearing that combines the technologies of both aerostatic 
and aerodynamic design. If the spacing between the two jet rows is increased significantly 
in an aerostatic design, a large increase in stiffness and load capacity will be achieved at 
high shaft rotational speed. Typically a length-to-diameter ratio of 2 would be considered 
ideal, with the jets spaced about one-eighth of the bearing lengths from the bearing ends,

but to achieve significant hybrid performance, the bearing clearance must be kept to a 
minimum.
By utilizing the Raimondi curves, as mentioned previously for aerodynamic perfor­
mance, the additional load capacity can be calculated and summated into the aerostatic 
load capacity calculations. From Figure 6.25, the improvement can be seen in the radial 
bearing stiffness with three different bearing lengths as the speed increase (assuming 
constant bearing clearance over the speed range). This has the great benefit of increasing 
the gas film critical speeds and hence the maximum operating speed of the spindle. This 
will be discussed under Section 4.6 “Bearing and Shaft Dynamics.”
6.4.6  Bearing and Shaft Dynamics
Whichever gas bearing system is selected, certain bearing and shaft dynamics have to be 
considered to allow high-speed operation, and specifically the synchronous whirls, the 
half-speed whirl, and the shaft natural frequency.
6.4.6.1  Synchronous Whirls
Synchronous whirls occur at the shaft rotation speed and can be due to an inherent imbal­
ance in the shaft itself, which will increase quickly with speed as the out-of-balance forces 
are proportional to the square of the speed. Therefore careful dynamic balancing is neces­
sary to minimize these forces. Typically a balance standard of better than G0.4 (International 
Standard ISO 1940) should be achieved for acceptable performance, involving a two-plane 
balancing methodology (see Section 6.4.6.4 for more details on balancing).
However, another phenomenon is encountered in aerostatic bearings, which is due to the 
natural resonant frequencies of the gas film system. As these frequencies are approached, 
any out-of-balance force is magnified dramatically due to the almost total lack of damping. 
However, the shaft can be run through these frequencies and operate very comfortably 
in a “supercritical” mode, with the shaft now rotating around its mass center, and not its 
geometric center.
The speeds at which the natural resonant frequencies occur can be calculated as shown 
below, ω1 being defined as a cylindrical whirl and ω2 as a conical whirl mode.

where J = (distance between bearing centers/2), I = transverse moment of inertia of the 
shaft, and I0 = polar moment of inertia of the shaft. Obviously, for maximum shaft speed, 
the designer needs to achieve the highest radial stiffness possible and keep the shaft mass 
at a minimum.
6.4.6.2  Half-Speed Whirl
This highly destructive phenomenon is encountered in both aerostatic and aerodynamic 
designs, and is usually the limiting speed parameter. In aerostatic designs, it occurs in 
practice at a speed somewhat below twice the lowest of the gas film resonant frequencies, 
typically at about 1.8 times. In aerodynamic designs it is much harder to predict the speed 
at which it will occur, but in general, spiral groove bearing designs do not suffer from this 
problem nearly as much. Half-speed whirl occurs when the rotor is orbiting the bearing 
centerline at a frequency equal to half its rotational speed. The shaft increases its orbit 
without a further increase in speed, and quickly contacts the bearing surface, causing 
seizure.
6.4.6.3  Shaft Natural Frequency
Like any other bearing system, the shaft natural frequency must be calculated using the 
normal processes. It must include the mass effect of additional items like the rotor, encoder 
disc, and, most importantly, the optic and its mount.
In small shaft scanner designs, the natural frequency is usually well above the oper­
ating speed range, maybe by a factor of 2 to 3, but with large shafts this frequency 
must be allowed for. In general, no shaft should be run beyond 80% of the shaft natural 
frequency.
The shaft critical speed can be calculated from the general formula for a uniform shaft 
(simply supported on short bearings):

where l = distance between bearings, E = modulus of elasticity, I = movement of inertia, 
and m = mass of the shaft. From this equation it can be seen that to keep the shaft mass 
and the bearing separation distance to a minimum is really important for high-speed 
operation.
6.4.6.4  Shaft Balance
For successful high-speed spindle operation, dynamic balancing of the shaft and associ­
ated optic assembly is essential. However precisely the components are manufactured, 
there will always be some small level of residual unbalance around the axis of rotation 

344 
Handbook of Optical and Laser Scanning
which must be corrected. This can be achieved by the addition, or subtraction, of material 
at the appropriate position on the shaft or optic assembly:
	
1.	Addition process: Usually this is in the form of adding screws of known mass to 
selected premachined threads in non-operating portions of the shaft, or the optic 
assembly. Alternatively, in some automatic balancing processes, a precise amount 
of fast-curing adhesive can be added to the required position in the shaft.
	
2.	Removal process: This entails the physical removal of material from the shaft, or 
optic assembly, and can be achieved using a small grinding wheel or drill.
Both methods have advantages dependent upon the application, but with all balancing 
techniques the process will often be a compromise as it is not always possible to add, or 
remove, material at the exact point of unbalance as this may well be in an operating part of 
the shaft (journal, motor rotor, etc.) or in the optic surface itself. In this situation, the nearest 
convenient plane must be selected, and any couple induced by this must be corrected for.
Highly sensitive balance equipment must be used to detect and display the residual 
imbalance and Figure 6.26a shows a typical two-plane balancing cradle with an aerody­
namic monogon scanner fitted, ready for final balancing on the optic assembly (removal 
method). Each of the clamp assemblies supporting the scanner contains a vibration trans­
ducer, which feeds a signal back to the analysis equipment shown in Figure 6.26b. A shaft 
position sensor is also fitted to the cradle so that the angular position of the unbalance can 
be calculated. The equipment will display the level of unbalance in gm mm (mass × radius) 
and the angular position in degrees from a reference point on the shaft in both planes. The 
rotational speed used for the balancing trials may well be much lower than the maximum 
operating speed due to the response capability of the balancing equipment, and the need to 
find a “sweet spot” between the resonant frequencies of the transducers and clamp assem­
blies themselves. This could well be in the range of 10,000 to 20,000 rpm.
6.4.7  Shaft Assembly
Although this chapter is primarily concerned with the different bearing types for use with 
scanners, it is important to realize that all the extra components mounted onto the shaft

Bearings for Rotary Scanners

will have an impact on the performance of the scanner. As shown in the previous sections, 
the total mass of the rotor assembly affects both shaft natural frequency and the cylindri­
cal whirl frequency, hence any additional masses built in the rotor must be minimized. 
Another consideration has to be the stresses that the shaft is imposing on these additional 
components when rotating at high speed.
6.4.7.1  Optics and Holders
The types of optics that can be fitted to rotary scanners fall into three basic groups: poly­
gons, monogons, and holographic disks. All these optics are selected for specific appli­
cations and are discussed in much greater depth elsewhere in this book. However, the 
bearing design type of the scanner will in general be dictated by this optic selection.
6.4.7.1.1  Polygons
As shown in Section 4.4.3, polygons can be mounted on the front of the spindle (Figure 
6.22) or in the center of the bearing system (Figure 6.23). From a bearing stability view­
point, the center-mounted conic bearing design is better suited for small, high-speed poly­
gons (<100 mm across flats) although the large bore size required to fit over the scanner 
body may cause optical distortion problems.
The polygon can also suffer from thermal distortion due to the close proximity of the 
motor rotor. Its compact space envelope is probably its greatest advantage and has wide­
spread use across the scanning market.
Large diameter (>100 mm across flats) and also thick-faceted polygons are better suited 
to mounting on the front of the spindle. These tend to operate at lower speeds (<30,000 
rpm), but require a substantial bearing system to support the overhung mass. There is a 
point where even a large, aerodynamic spindle is not really suitable due to high starting 
torque and insufficient load capacity and at this point an aerostatic, or hybrid, bearing 
system will have to be selected (as shown in Figure 6.14).
Whichever system is selected, due design consideration must be given to the polygon 
mount design. The method of polygon attachment, be it using screws or bonding, must 
not affect the optical properties of the facets, either statically or dynamically. The choice 
of material for both the polygon and its mount must take into account the total additional 
mass being supported by the bearing system, the rotational stresses induced, and thermal 
growth characteristics between the hub and mounts. Most scanner polygons and mounts 
are manufactured from high-grade aluminum.
Finally, trapezoidal polygons, that is, polygons with facets not parallel to the axis of rota­
tion, in general will be mounted on the front of the spindle to allow access to the incoming 
axial laser beam.
6.4.7.1.2  Monogons
Monogons, or single-faceted reflective optics, tend to be used when the output beam from 
the optic is to strike a circular, rather than a flat surface, such as in a cylindrical drum 
image setter, although if the output beam is passed through an F-theta lens it can then be 
used on flat surfaces too. The optics used can be of a simple open reflective surface form 
or a more complex glass form such as a prism. The input laser beam is usually coincident 
and parallel to the shaft rotational axis and hence all monogons need to be mounted on 
the front of the spindle.
Particularly with reference to glass optics, but even with aluminum and beryllium, great 
care is required in the design of the optics holder. Unlike polygons, which normally have 

346 
Handbook of Optical and Laser Scanning
some form of bore for location, most glass optics are designed for their optical quality, not 
their ease of mounting. Figure 6.27a and b show two forms of housing into which glass 
prisms have been bonded. Figure 6.27a is a cube prism manufactured from BK7 optical qual­
ity glass with the two non-active sides bonded to the extended cheeks of the housing. As can 
be seen, there are several square edges to the housing, which will cause noise and windage.
An improved version is shown in Figure 6.27b, where the optic bonded in the housing 
has had all the non-active exposed corners ground to a spherical shape. This is called a ball 
prism. The housing is also more aerodynamically shaped for reduced turbulence. In both 
cases, the optics holder is manufactured in high-strength stainless steel. Although this 
adds extra weight to the shaft assembly over using aluminum, only steel can survive the 
very high forces exerted by the cheeks at the speeds used; typically 30,000–60,000 rpm.
Figure 6.27c shows a simple version of the open aluminum mirror. Although the mount­
ing technique is easier, with a thread machined onto the back of the mirror stub, there is 
now the problem of imbalance to correct for, due to the asymmetric form of the mirror. An 
aluminum ring has to be added to the assembly as shown with heavy metal pins added in 
the appropriate position. In addition, the open mirror acts as a form of pump, which not 
only increases the turbulence around the mirror, but it actively attracts dust particles to 
the mirror surface.
For higher speed application, an improved version of the angled mirror design can be 
used as shown in Figure 6.27d. The entire mirror is now enclosed in a sphere-shaped hous­
ing with input and output windows to stop the pumping action. The stress analysis of this 
housing, especially around the output window, is of paramount importance due to the 
large centrifugal force exerted onto the edges of the housing by the output window. Again, 
balancing the asymmetric form of the combined optic and housing is critical with heavy 
metal pins added to the end face of the assembly as necessary.

With large clear apertures, up to 30 mm in diameter, optical distortion due to rotational 
centrifugal forces across the face of the mirror becomes a further challenge to contend 
with. The use of beryllium, rather than aluminum, reduces the deflection considerably 
due to its greater modulus of elasticity-to-density ratio, but there is a large cost penalty 
and processing can be a problem due to the health issues associated with machining 
beryllium.
Another solution that can be used if the application is designed to operate at only one 
fixed speed is to bias the surface of the optic. This involves machining a concave surface 
across the optic face, which becomes flat at the required operating speed. Although the 
extra process will add additional costs, this might allow the use of an aluminum substrate 
rather than beryllium, much reducing the overall cost of the optic assembly.
Obviously, the additional mass created by the spherical housing will reduce the top 
speed of the shaft assembly and Figure 6.28 shows the typical maximum speed for each 
optic type and size.
One optic not already mentioned in this section is the pentaprism (Figure 6.27e), a spe­
cial type of prism with two internal reflectance faces. It has the unique ability to correct 
for a shaft error termed “wobble.” This is a random conic motion of the shaft about its 
longitudinal axis, which occurs much more in ball bearing scanners, but can occur at a low 
level even in an air bearing. Owing to its relatively large mass, expensive manufacturing 
processes, and difficult mounting shape, it is rarely used in modern scanner designs.
6.4.7.1.3  Monogon optic bonding
With the recent demands for higher speeds with larger optics, the process of bonding the 
glass monogon into a metallic holder has become a major issue. Not only for optimum 
optical performance, due consideration must be given to the safety aspects of the stress in 
the bond line too. Enormous centrifugal forces are generated within the open ended hold­
ers at high speed, particularly in the design in Figure 6.27b, as the cantilever sides try to 
deflect radially away from the rotational centerline. This stress is imparted into the optic 
surface via the adhesive film, which must accommodate the resultant deformation without 
peeling away from either surface. An example of the stress that can be induced in the optic 
at high speed can be seen in the FEA analysis shown in Figure 6.29. The highest stress can 
be seen at the root, or the bottom, of the optic, with the lowest around the edges.

Factors to be considered in the bonding process include:
	
1.	Correct adhesive selection for both material surfaces, including reliable material 
property data from the manufacturer
	
2.	Maximum operating temperature of the assembly during use
	
3.	Surface preparation and cleaning
	
4.	Consistent mixing and spreading of the adhesive
	
5.	Curing time/temperature versus residual stresses in the adhesive
	
6.	Minimizing air entrapment in the adhesive during the process
Visual inspection of the finished optic assembly can often reveal possible process issues. 
From Figure 6.30, which shows the bonded area between one side of the optic and the can­
tilever side of the holder, it can be seen that most of the surface has bonded well with only

very small air bubbles. However, a few large bubbles can be seen at one edge which could 
lead to premature failure of the bond during rotation.
6.4.7.1.3  Holographic Disc Optics
Certain scanning applications require the use of a holographic disc to be rotated at a rela­
tively low speed. With a large outside diameter usually, and a small bore, this design is again 
best suited to mounting on the front of the spindle. As the disc is usually made of a glass 
sandwich, the mass is quite high, so either an aerodynamic or an aerostatic scanner may be 
used, depending on the minimum and maximum speeds at which the disc must run.
Owing to the principle of the holographic disc, this scanning process is not as optically 
demanding as rotating monogons and polygons, so many disc scanners in this market are 
still run on ball bearings.
6.4.7.2  Motors
For most scanning applications, some form of synchronous motor is required to ensure 
predictable speed control. The two usual designs employed are the hysteresis motor and 
the brushless DC motor. The lack of brushes and a commutation ring are a definite advan­
tage in gas bearing systems due to there being no wearing parts. In both cases the rotor is 
simple in mechanical construction, and ideal for high-speed rotation due to its composite 
nature.
The brushless DC motor consists of a wound laminated stator with integral “Hall effect” 
devices for commutation wound in. The rotor, in its simplest form, is a cylindrical hollow 
tube manufactured from sintered samarium–cobalt material. This is then magnetized in a 
powerful magnetic fixture to the number of poles required. To withstand the high centrif­
ugal forces, this material is usually contained inside another thin steel tube. Some typical 
brushless DC motors are shown in Figure 6.31.
The rotor assembly can then be bonded directly onto the scanner shaft. In larger motor 
designs, discrete magnet pairs are used rather than the sintered material, but a steel or car­
bon fiber containment ring is still required to prevent individual magnets from separating 
from the shaft at high speed.
The brushless DC motor has become more widely used in recent years and is ideal 
for aerodynamic scanners, which require a very fast acceleration to reach floating speed 
FIGURE 6.31

before surface damage occurs within the bearings. This typically requires a high starting 
torque, which this motor type can deliver. Also, owing to the use of rare earth magnetic 
materials, the power density is very high, minimizing the amount of magnetic mater­
ial and therefore keeping the weight of the rotor down. This is particularly important in 
overhung rotor designs, which are more difficult to design for high-speed operation than 
center motorized shafts.
The hysteresis motor has a wound, laminated stator, without “Hall effect” devices, and 
the rotor consists of a thin cylinder of hardened cobalt steel. This rotor can be shrunk 
directly onto the scanner shaft. Instead of the torque being created by the permanent mag­
nets in the brushless DC motor, the magnetizing force from the stator induces magnetic 
fields in the cobalt steel due to hysteresis effect. This type of rotor produces very little heat 
due to the near absence of rotor eddy currents, and is therefore particularly suited to center 
motorized polygon spindles where low heat output from the rotor is critical.
6.4.7.3  Encoders
Many high-quality scanning systems require very accurate speed control, typically less 
than 10 ppm. A typical brushless DC motor can be speed controlled to about 2% using an 
open loop control system, but if an incremental encoder is fitted, the position of the rotor 
and shaft can be accurately measured during each revolution and controlled by a phase 
lock loop controller, yielding results better than 5 ppm with careful optimization.
Some typical encoder disc/hub assemblies and head assemblies are shown in Figure 
6.32. The head contains a photo diode emitter and receiver assembly, which is focused onto 
a fine grating engraved into a precision glass disc. Typical gratings vary from 200 to 1400 
lines per revolution. In addition, there is a second track that provides a once per revolution 
index pulse, often used as a trigger for the start-of-scan process.
The glass disc is mounted on an aluminum hub very accurately, and the disc/hub assem­
bly can then be fitted to the shaft end, usually after the rotor and stator have been fitted. 
This allows access for final adjustment of the head assembly but from the shaft dynamics

viewpoint, this is yet another additional mass that must be allowed for in the design cal­
culations, albeit a relatively light structure.
The strength of the glass disc can also be a limiting factor to the maximum speed of 
the scanner and for special very high-speed applications, a metal grating disc must be 
used. However, due to constructional reasons, high line counts with a metal disc are not 
possible.
For successful operation in a high-accuracy machine, the disc must be centered to a run­
out value of <5 microns and would typically exhibit an electronic jitter level of <2 ns.
6.5  BALL BEARINGS
Over the last 50 years or so, the quality of ball bearings has improved immensely and the 
designs have become well refined. The major manufacturers supply detailed applications 
design rules together with comprehensive ball bearing characteristic data. Hence it is not 
intended to revisit this information in detail within this chapter. However, a brief review 
of their application to rotary scanners is useful to understand the advantages and disad­
vantages of this bearing technology.
6.5.1  Bearing Design
For precision, high-speed ball bearing scanners, angular contact bearings are normally 
selected as shown in Figure 6.33. Typically, the contact angle used will be in the range of 
12–25°, with the greater the angle, the larger the thrust capacity available.
To ensure an accurate rotational axis, the bearings need to be used in pairs, with an 
axial preload, which will remove all the play in the shaft/bearing system. The preload can 
be ground into the bearing assembly by using different length spacers between the outer

and inner races, or created by fitting disc springs between the outer face and the bearing 
housing.
ABEC 5 or ABEC 7 quality bearings are usually specified to ensure that the critical 
mechanical tolerances are controlled to known standards, particularly parameters such 
as the radial runout, which will have a big effect on the wobble characteristic of the shaft. 
Lubrication normally uses some form of light grease, with seals or shields on the bearings 
to help prevent any leakage. However, evaporation of the lubricant can be a major problem 
and will affect the life of the bearings.
In recent years one of the main improvements in ball bearing technology has been the 
introduction of new materials to improve overall performance. Ceramic balls, usually 
made from silicon nitride, can replace the steel balls in the ring and this design is known 
as the hybrid bearing. It is widely available from most manufacturers and gives the fol­
lowing advantages:
	
1.	Significantly extended bearing life due to the improved running behavior between 
the ceramic and steel materials
	
2.	Higher speed rating due to the reduced density of the ceramic balls and hence 
lower centrifugal forces
	
3.	Lower thermal expansion coefficient of the balls reducing the variation in bearing 
preload
	
4.	Higher bearing rigidity caused by the higher modulus of elasticity of the 
ceramics
The improvement in the maximum speed capability of a hybrid bearing, over a standard 
precision steel ball bearing, for several common inner bore diameters, can be seen in Figure 
6.34. These ratings are based on grease lubrication, ignoring preloads and other construc­
tional constraints, and are extracted from typical manufacturers’ available data.
A further improvement can be introduced by changing the material of the races them­
selves, from 440c typically to a finer structure steel, such as a high nitrogen content stain­
less steel. This allows for cooler operation and higher allowable contact pressure, again 
increasing the maximum speed rating still further, as shown in Figure 6.34, depicted by 
the term “hybrid-ultra.”

The improved running life between ceramics and steels is indicated in Figure 6.35, which 
shows the expected service life for high-speed grease for the two different materials at 
various DN numbers (mean bearing diameter × speed). This graph can only be taken as an 
indication of the improvement in grease life, as the individual application, environment, 
and duty will have an effect on the numbers. The high DN values shown also indicate the 
recent advancements in synthetic grease technology to allow bearings to run above a DN 
of 1,000,000 at all without having to resort to oil mist lubrication. Information is based on 
manufacturers’ available data.
6.5.2  Scanner Construction
Owing to the compact design of ball bearings, a variety of bearing configurations can 
be used in scanner designs. Polygons can be center mounted, overhung, or contained, as 
shown in Figure 6.36 with both the polygon and the motor assembly sandwiched between 
the bearings. To keep the surface speed of the balls to a minimum for the longest life,

the shafts for ball bearing designs tend to be small where they fit into the bearing bores, 
whichever configuration is chosen. This can lead to problems with the shaft critical speeds 
due to its low stiffness. For very compact designs, for laser printers for example, special 
motor technology is incorporated such as a “pancake” or radial wound motor.
6.6  MAGNETIC BEARINGS
In recent years, active bearing spindles have been developed commercially for the 
machine tool industry for high-speed aluminum routing and more recently for turbo­
molecular vacuum pumps in the semiconductor processing industry. Prior to this, mag­
netic bearing technology had been confined to special applications in the aerospace and 
satellite industry. The success of the commercialization lies mostly in the improvements 
in the electronic control system for the bearings, requiring powerful, very fast proces­
sor chips. With the cost of such chips plummeting in recent years, the largest drawback 
of the magnetic bearing, that is, the cost of the complete control system, has reduced 
dramatically.
These systems are now being applied to other lower cost applications within the electron­
ics process industry, and it will not be long before magnetic bearing systems will appear in 
special applications in the scanning industry, particularly in vacuum conditions.
6.6.1  Bearing Design Principle
The principle of the active magnetic bearing is relatively simple. The journal bearing con­
sists of a laminated core that is fitted onto the shaft, and is surrounded by a wound static 
stator, which, once energized, holds the shaft in its magnetic center. A displacement trans­
ducer close to the bearing constantly monitors the position of the shaft, and if any external 
force moves the shaft off center, then the control feedback system connected to the trans­
ducer adjusts the current in the stator coils to move the shaft back to the magnetic center­
line. The feedback system can typically correct the shaft position every 100 μs. Obviously, 
this system is inherently unstable and in the case of transducer, or even electrical power 
failure, a set of catch bearings are necessary to prevent the shaft contacting the bearing 
coils and causing instant damage.
The main technical advantages of this are as follows:
	
1.	Very large clearances between the shaft and the stator coils minimizing heat gen­
eration within the bearings and reducing the motor power required to run the 
spindle
	
2.	Active damping control, which allows the shaft to be driven through shaft criticals 
that other bearing types could not accommodate
	
3.	Operation in total vacuum conditions without contaminating the environment
6.6.2  Scanner Construction
Figure 6.37 shows a diagrammatic cross section of a magnetic bearing spindle. The design 
contains two radial and one bidirectional axial magnetic bearings with the high-frequency

motor between the axial bearing and the rear bearing. In front of the front bearing there 
are position sensors looking on the shaft at 45° to the axis to provide radial and axial dis­
placement information to the controller, and further radial sensors are placed next to the 
outer end of the rear bearing.
For overload conditions, or a power failure, two small angular contact “catch” bearings 
are located one at each end of the shaft, with about 0.1–0.2 mm clearance with the shaft 
under normal running conditions. Typically, the system controller can maintain the radial 
runout of the shaft to less than 1 micron.
6.7  OPTICAL SCANNING ERRORS
In any scanning system there will always be errors associated with the rotation of the 
optic that will lead to the output beam displaying certain distinguishable errors that can 
be traced back to either bearing-related or optic-related issues.
6.7.1  Bearing-Related Errors
Errors due to the rotation of the shaft can be subdivided into two categories: synchron­
ous (repeatable) and asynchronous (nonrepeatable) motions. With synchronous errors, the 
shaft is usually performing some kind of regular conic (or wobble) motion around its axis, 
which could be caused by one of the following issues:
	
1.	Poor shaft assembly balance
	
2.	Running at or close to an axial or radial bearing resonant speed, which will mag­
nify any residual shaft imbalance

3.	Manufacturing errors within the bearings or shaft, such as ovality or 
misalignment
	
4.	Magnetic pulsations from the rotor as it passes the windings
Asynchronous errors are more difficult to locate by their very nature and the shaft may 
describe quite an irregular motion depending on the cause and the type of bearing.
With gas bearings, the onset of half-speed whirl for whatever reason will produce strange 
shaft motion before normally leading to bearing failure. This could be due to an excessive 
bearing clearance caused by thermal effects within the scanner, or an overspeeding of the 
shaft, or in the case of an aerostatic scanner, a sudden large drop in the supply pressure 
level. Also, pneumatic hammer occurring in the aerostatic scanner will create asynchron­
ous errors in the shaft.
With ball bearing scanners, asynchronous errors can be caused by manufacturing errors 
within the ball set beating with the synchronous errors in the track races.
In either bearing system, the ingress of dirt into the bearing will cause intermittent 
motion errors, which may eventually result in premature failure.
Finally, the motor can cause its own form of asynchronous error, which is commonly 
called “jitter.” It is the result of the feedback system controlling the motion trying to correct 
for speed variations, caused mainly by optic windage, which will always tend to over- or 
undershoot the actual target speed. This can be minimized by using a closed-loop system 
with encoder feedback and reducing the effects of turbulence around the optic.
6.7.2  Optic-Related Errors
Although both polygons and monogons suffer from many of the same errors, their effects 
on the scanning system need to be examined separately.
6.7.2.1  Polygons
	
1.	Mounting. Misalignment of the polygon axis to the spin axis is likely to be the 
largest part of the total tracking error. Very accurate machining of the polygon 
bore and the hub on the shaft is required to minimize this tilting effect. Effect: 
Repeating weave pattern.
	
2.	Manufacture. Errors include pyramidal (facet-to-datum), facet-to-facet, dividing 
angle and facet flatness. Effect: Repeatable positional errors.
	
3.	Dynamic distortion. Loss of geometry due to thermal growth or mechanical stresses. 
Effect: Positional tracking errors varying with speed and time.
6.7.2.2  Monogons
	
1.	Mounting. Will only cause a slight permanent change of facet angle, which will 
occur on every revolution and will not usually affect the scan process. Effect: Small, 
permanent positional change of beam.
	
2.	Manufacture. Errors include facet flatness, deflection angle, wavefront distortion, 
and astigmatism. Effect: Spot quality and focus issues with speed and time.

3.	Dynamic distortion. Change in flatness and astigmatism due to thermal growth 
or mechanical stresses. Effect: Change in spot quality and focus with speed and 
time.
6.7.3  Error Correction
6.7.3.1  Polygons
Mounting errors can be minimized by machining the polygon hub in situ on the shaft run­
ning in its own bearings. This helps to correct for many of the synchronous bearing-related 
errors as well as the mechanical errors. Alternatively, an adjustable mount can be used to 
fine tune the tilt of the polygon to bring it on spin axis. The mount can be manufactured 
from a thermally insulating material to stop thermal effects reaching the polygon.
With synchronous errors, an active correction system can be employed to slightly mod­
ify the beam path prior to striking the polygon facet to compensate for the error about to 
be put into the beam. This can be permanently preprogrammed in, or in more complicated 
systems, a facet error detector must be incorporated to constantly update the error com­
pensation system.
6.7.3.2  Monogons
Error correction is more limited in monogon optic systems. To correct for dynamic mech­
anical optic distortion, biased optics can be used that will deform to the correct shape over 
a small specific running speed range, but this only usually refers to open facet mirrors, not 
prisms. However, many of the synchronous errors are not so noticeable as they occur on 
every scan line and in general will not cause banding.
As mentioned earlier in this chapter, the use of a pentaprism can dramatically reduce 
wobble errors generated in the bearings and is ideally suited for ball bearing scanners 
where wobble is a major problem in higher accuracy designs.
6.8  SUMMARY
Throughout this chapter, it has been the intention to provide enough theoretical and prac­
tical information for the designer to be able to understand, and therefore correctly spec­
ify, the bearing system most suitable for the scanning device under consideration. If the 
conclusion is that a gas bearing is required, then it is anticipated that in most cases, the 
reader will be intending to buy rather than make the scanning unit due to the complexity 
of design and manufacture. The graphs contained within this chapter, together with the 
theory, should provide valuable data regarding the critical parameters such as loads, stiff­
ness, and heat generation. These parameters will have effects on the surrounding parts of 
the machine and must be taken into account during the machine design process.
Should the designer opt for ball bearing technology, then the option to make rather than 
buy is more realistic, as both design data and components are readily available. However, 
the design of the optic and the mount can be the most challenging part of the whole scan­
ner and should not be treated lightly.

7.1  INTRODUCTION
Design equations for regular prismatic polygonal scanning systems have been analyzed 
and described by Kessler1 and Beiser.2,3 Beiser’s analytical treatment is comprehensive in 
that the performance in terms of resolution is the key criterion used for the system designs 
and analyses. Henceforth, throughout this chapter, the term polygonal scanner shall infer 
a regular prismatic polygonal scanner.
The prime objective of this chapter is to provide a comprehensive visual understanding 
of the effects of changing the incident beam width (diameter) D, the incident beam offset 
angle 2β, which is the angle the incident beam is offset from the x-axis, and the number N 
of mirror facets on a polygonal scanner without regard to performance in terms of reso­
lution. Diagrams, equations, and coordinates bring to light these insights.
Cartesian rectilinear coordinate axes Ox and Oy are chosen for the equations of lines, 
loci, and the coordinates of significant points. The origin coincides with the axis of rotation 
O of the regular prismatic polygonal scanner. The x-axis (Ox) is parallel to the optical axis 
of the objective lens.
There are three distinct topics associated with pre-objective polygonal scanning systems 
that are covered in this chapter by three separate sections, 7.2, 7.3, and 7.4. To assist a reader 
interested in only one of the topics certain definitions are repeated for continuity of a topic in 
a section so that the reader does not have to cross-refer back and forth to different sections.

Pre-Objective Polygonal Scanning 
361
The topics are: equations and coordinates of a polygonal scanning system; instantaneous 
center-of-scan (ICS); and stationary ghost images outside the image format.
7.1.1  Equations and Coordinates of a Polygonal Scanning System
The midposition orientation of the polygonal scanner facets is such that the reflected col­
limated incident beam is parallel to the x-axis and defines the scan-axis, both of which are 
chosen to be parallel to the optical axis of the objective lens (Figure 7.1).
For a given incident beam offset angle 2𝛽 of the collimated incident beam, the equations 
for the scan-axis, the incident beam, the mirror facet plane, and the objective lens optical 
axis scanner are expressed with respect to the rotation axis O of the polygonal scanner; 
likewise are the precise coordinates of significant points.4
7.1.2  Instantaneous Center-of-Scan (ICS)
Presented is the derivation of the parametric equations for the loci of the ICS for six- and 
twelve-facet prismatic polygonal scanners.5 Depicted are figures that show the changes in 
the loci characteristics for different incident beam offset angles 2β.
7.1.3  Stationary Ghost Images Outside the Image Format
Presented is a pictorial display of diagrams illustrating the permissible angular ranges of 
the incident beam offset angle 2β to ensure that the ghost images lie outside the image for­
mat of the scanned field image format.6
7.2  EQUATIONS AND COORDINATES OF A 
POLYGONAL SCANNING SYSTEM
The origin of the Cartesian rectilinear coordinate axes can be chosen to be either at the 
rotation axis O of the polygonal scanner, or at the point of incidence P on a mirror facet;

each approach has an advantage for giving insights. In this section the rotation axis O has 
been chosen to be the origin.4
Consider Figure 7.1. The diagram depicts a single facet ST of a regular prismatic polyg­
onal scanner with N facets and its circumscribed circle of radius r. The facet ST is oriented 
so that the collimated incident beam, which is offset at an angle 2β from the x-axis, is 
reflected parallel to the x-axis. The beam has a finite width D (see Section 7.2.5).
7.2.1  Objective
The goal is to present the precise coordinates of significant points, the distances between 
these points, and the equations of three axes (incident beam, scan, and objective lens) with 
respect to the rotation axis O of the polygonal scanner, thereby eliminating manual or 
computer-aided iterative techniques. Furthermore, it is to provide unexpected interesting 
insights into the limitations of the optomechanical design layouts of polygonal scanning 
systems.
7.2.2  Midposition and Scan-Axis
Shown in Figure 7.1 is a single facet ST of a polygonal scanner oriented in a midposition 
such that a collimated incident beam is reflected parallel to the x-axis. The reflected beam 
axis PU in this midposition defines the scan-axis.
7.2.3  Mirror Facet Angle A
From this midposition the reflected beam angularly scans symmetrically about the scan-
axis through an angle of ±A. Character symbol A is the facet angle, which is the angle that 
the facet ST subtends at the rotation axis O of the polygonal scanner.

7.2.5  Beam Width (Diameter) D
The Gaussian laser beam width represented by D is the standard “1/e2 beam width” plus a 
margin of safety chosen by the system designer to minimize the imaged spot defects when 
a Gaussian beam is one-sidedly truncated by a facet edge as the polygonal scanner rotates. 
The margin of safety is inextricably linked to the desired scan duty cycle (scan efficiency) η 
of the scanning system for a given 2β, N, and r. For a one-side truncation of the beam by the 
facet edges as the polygon rotates, optimally D is 40% greater than the 1/e2 beam width.2,3
The l/e2 beam width that is symbolized by D1/e2 is the beam width (diameter) beyond 
which the residual laser beam power is 1/e2 of the total power of a laser beam that has a 

Pre-Objective Polygonal Scanning 
363
Gaussian distribution. For a Gaussian distribution, it uniquely and directly also corre­
sponds to the laser beam width (diameter) at which the beam irradiance has dropped to 
1/e2 of the axial peak laser beam irradiance (see Chapter 1).
In Figure 7.1, in which the polygonal scanner is in the midposition:
	
1.	The boundaries of the incident beam width D are designed to cut through the 
circumscribed circle at E and F such that the arcs SE and FT are equal. This 
ensures that the useful angular scan of the reflected beam is symmetrical about 
the scan-axis.
	
2.	In Figures 7.1 and 7.2 the incident beam axis that has a finite width D intersects the 
mirror-facet bisector OMH at the point G, as it proceeds to impinge on the mirror-facet 
as the point P. G is aslo the midpoint of the chord EF. For an infinitesimal beam width 
G coincides with the point H. As the beam increases G approaches M as does P.
7.2.6  Scan Duty Cycle (Scan Efficiency)
The scan duty cycle η of a polygonal scanner is the ratio of the useful scan angle during 
which the beam width D is unvignetted by the edges of the facets, to the full scan angle 
±A of a beam with an infinitesimal beam width. One assumes that the tangential width of 
the footprint of the incident beam is less than the tangential width of the facet, when the 
polygonal scanner is in its midposition (see Chapter 2 of this volume). Henceforth, widths 
refer to tangential widths.

The closeness of Dapprox to D is illustrated in Table 7.1.
Let the polygonal scanner be in its midposition, then:
	
1.	If the incident beam has an infinitesimal width (D = 0), the circumscribed circle of 
the polygonal scanner intersects the axis of the beam at the point H, which coin­
cides with the top of the facet sag MH. The scan duty cycle is 100% (η = 1), ignoring 
the inevitable facet edge manufacturing roll-off (Figure 7.2).
	
2.	If the incident beam has a finite width D with a footprint that just covers the facet’s 
tangential width (D = 2r sin (A/2)), the beam axis is directed at M, at the base of the 
sag MH. The scan duty cycle is 0% (η = 0). Simultaneously, point P coincides with 
M, which is the midpoint of the mirror-facet chord ST.
	
3.	For all finite incident beam widths D with a footprint width that is within the facet 
width (D < 2r sin (A/2)), the beam axis passes through the midpoint G of the chord 
EF, and which lies on the facet sag MH, to impinge on the mirror-facet at the point 
P. The scan duty cycle is finite (1 > η > 0) (Equation 7.3, Figures 7.1 and 7.2).

7.2.10  Optical Axis of the Objective Lens
The objective lens optical axis, which is parallel to both the x-axis and the scan-axis, is 
directed through the point G to ensure that the scanning beam width D scans symmetri­
cally across the aperture of the objective lens (Figures 7.1, 7.2, and 7.3).
The separation between the objective lens optical axis and the scan-axis is given by

As G and P simultaneously approach M the objective lens optical axis and the scan-axis 
move toward each other at the same rate in the y-axis direction until they both coincide 
at M.
When the incident beam has a finite width D and the beam width of the footprint just 
covers the facet chord ST, G and P coincide with M, m = g, (m − g) = 0.
Substituting (m − g) = 0 into Equation 7.28 gives
	
WGmin = 0 	
(7.31)
Thus, the objective lens axis is coincident with the scan-axis.
7.2.11  Equations
Except for the incident beam, the scan-axis and objective lens optical axis are parallel to 
the x-axis and, therefore, have equations independent of x.

7.2.11.4  Mirror Facet Bisector and Normal

system. Thus

7.2.12  Insights from an Alternative Analytical Approach
An alternative perspective for the analysis is to set the Cartesian rectilinear coordinate 
axes to be Px and Py with the origin at the point of incidence P on the facet for when the 
polygonal scanner is in a midposition (Figure 7.4). In this approach the scan-axis is col­
linear with the abscissa, the x-axis (Px), while the ordinate is the y-axis (Py). See the first 
paragraph at the beginning of Section 7.2.
The immediate advantage is that equations for the scan-axis, the incident beam axis, and 
the facet plane all pass through the origin P. The goal of this second approach is to deter­
mine the coordinates (XO, YO) of the rotation axis O of the polygonal scanner with respect 
to the point of incidence P and the scan-axis Px.
The approach presents a diagrammatic visualization of the existence of a finite areal 
zone, with respect to the fixed point P, of a set of loci for the rotation axis ΟN of a polygonal 
scanner that results from changes in the number N of facets (3 ≤ N < ∞), the laser beam 
width D, and the scan duty cycle η, (0 ≤ η ≤ 1), for a given circumscribed circle of radius r of 
the polygonal scanner (Figure 7.4).4

370 
Handbook of Optical and Laser Scanning
All these coordinates and equations can be obtained from those already given in Sections 
7.2.8 to 7.2.11 by the transformation of the origin at O to an origin at P.
7.2.13  Features of Figure 7.4
In Figure 7.4, the loci for N = 5 and for N > 6 are omitted to avoid overcrowding the dia­
gram. Certain character symbols are primed because of a direct, but not obvious, relation­
ship to those corresponding unprimed symbols in Figure 7.2.

The position of the rotation axis on a locus INMN depends on the scan duty cycle (0 < η < 1). 
A fan of straight lines emanating from 
ʹ∞
H  toward INMN represents a set of values for con­
stant scan duty cycle η. The rotation axis On lies at the intersection of one of these fan lines 
of constant η with a base line INMN.
A set of straight lines parallel to 
ʹ∞
H I3 represents a set of values for constant beam width 
D. Similarly, the rotation axis ON lies at the intersection of one of these parallel lines of 
constant D with a base line INMN. The rotation axes ON may not lie beyond MN where the 
incident beam width footprint matches the facet width.
All facet widths SNTN lie between the points S3

,h=  and T3
0
,h=  according to the values 
of N and η. The positional range of facet SNTN directly corresponds to the range of the 
locus ON, that is, the length of the baseline INMN. Uniquely, the rotation axis O lies 
on the scan-axis only when N = 3 and D = 0, that is, an incident beam of infinitesimal 
width.
7.2.14  Conclusion
The visualization of the effects of changing the controlling parameters N, β, D, η, and r of 
an optical scanning system helps in its design, while, in particular, the explicit coordinates 
and equations eliminate manual or computer-aided iterative techniques.
7.3  INSTANTANEOUS CENTER-OF-SCAN
Reflective scanning devices, resonant, galvanometric, and polygonal, have plane mirrors 
that oscillate or rotate about an axis. The rotation of the reflecting mirror deflects an inci­
dent light beam. When (1) the axis of rotation O is coincident with the mirror surface, 
and (2) the incident beam is directed at the axis of rotation, the ICS is a single station­
ary point on, and at, the axis of rotation O for all angular positions of the mirror. These

two ­conditions are difficult to achieve and are rarely met; as a result, the ICS moves with 
respect to the rotation axis O, and, therefore, is a locus (Figure 7.5).5
7.3.1  Objective
This section explores and illustrates the characteristic form of the ICS locus for polygonal 
scanners with respect to the incident beam offset angle 2β; that is, the angle between the 
incident beam and the scan-axis. The analysis, study, and depiction of the ICS loci for sev­
eral incident beam offset angles for regular prismatic polygonal scanners of six and 12 fac­
ets give a visual appreciation of the asymmetry in the optical path lengths of the deflected 
beam as it sweeps through the full scan angle ±A. These characteristics provide interesting 
insights for consideration when undertaking the design of a polygonal scanning system.
7.3.2  Locus of the Instantaneous Center-of-Scan
In Figure 7.5a, the center-of-scan of the reflected beam is a stationary point on the rotation 
axis O. This is because two conditions are met: (1) the axis of rotation lies in the reflecting 
surface of a mirror (reflector); and (2) the incident beam is directed at the axis of rotation 
O of the mirror.
In Figure 7.5b, the center-of-scan is not a stationary point, because, although the axis of 
rotation lies in the reflecting surface of a mirror, the incident beam is directed to one side 
of the rotation axis O. However, there is an ICS at point C ≡ (𝛼, 𝛾) that has a locus.

Pre-Objective Polygonal Scanning 
373
Again, in Figure 7.5c, the center-of-scan is not a stationary point, because, although the 
incident beam is directed at the axis of rotation, the rotation axis O is displaced from the 
reflecting surface of the mirror. Similarly, there is an ICS at point C ≡ (𝛼, 𝛾) that has a locus.
7.3.3  Midposition and Scan-axis
Figure 7.6 depicts a cross section of a hexagonal polygonal scanner set in a midposition 
with an incident beam offset angle 2β of 70°. The midposition is defined by two require­
ments: (1) the polygonal scanner is oriented such that the reflected incident beam from one 
of the facets is parallel to the x-axis (this reflected incident beam defines the scan-axis); and 
(2) the rotation axis O is offset from the scan-axis to a position such that, as the polygonal 
scanner rotates, the reflected incident beam angularly scans symmetrically ±A about the 
scan-axis.
7.3.4  Derivation of the Instantaneous Center-of-Scan Coordinates
Consider a regular prismatic polygonal scanner with N facets and a circumscribed circle 
of radius r (Figure 7.6). Cartesian rectilinear coordinate axes Ox and Oy are chosen for the 
equations of lines, loci, and the coordinates of significant points. The origin O coincides 
with the axis of rotation of the polygonal scanner. The x-axis (Ox) is parallel to the opti­
cal axis of the objective lens. The facet angle A, that is, the angle that the facet subtends at 
the axis of rotation O, is given by 360°/N. For simplicity it is assumed that the beam width 
(diameter) is infinitesimal, such that a single ray represents the incident beam. ICS loci for 
finite beam widths D are considered in Section 7.3.10.

Consider now an incident beam directed at the facet of a polygonal scanner in a mid­
position at an offset angle 2β (70°) (Figure 7.6). Point H on the incident beam is where the 
circumscribed circle of the polygonal scanner and a facet bisector OM scanner intersects 
the incident beam.
Figure 7.7 depicts the position of one facet of the polygon after it has been rotated coun­
terclockwise through an angle θ, and the resultant position and direction of the reflected 
incident beam that has been deflected through an angle 2θ.

bering that α and γ are not variables, but constants at any instant.

The derivative x′ is obtained by differentiating Equation 7.51 with respect to θ. An explicit 
expression is possible but unnecessary when using a computer spreadsheet program. 
Tabulating data against θ, obtained by using a spreadsheet program, are the values of 
(x - 𝛼) and (y - 𝛾) from Equations 7.49 and 7.50; the values of x and y from Equations 7.51 
and 7.52, and the values of the derivative x′; thence the coordinates 𝛼 and 𝛾 are deduced and 
plotted (Figures 7.8 through 7.12).

7.3.7  Instantaneous Center-of-Scan
Figures 7.8 to 7.11 display the ICS loci for four incident beam β offset angles, namely, 0°, 70°, 
100°, and 140°. The data plots on the ICS loci correspond to the mechanical rotation angle θ 
of the polygonal scanner at two-degree intervals from its midposition.
It should be noted that a tangent at any point on the ICS locus is the position and direc­
tion of the reflected incident beam for a rotation angle θ. When the facet edges, S and T, on 
the circumscribed circle pass through the fixed point H on the incident beam, so also on 
the ICS locus do the tangents that represent the reflected incident beam at the full optical 
scan angles ±A (θ = ±A/2) (Figures 7.6, 7.7, and 7.8).
The ICS locus shown in Figure 7.8 displays the expected symmetry for an unlikely inci­
dent beam offset angle 2β of zero degrees. The peak of the ICS cusp characteristic touches 
the inscribed circle of the polygonal scanner and the locus extends beyond the circum­
scribed circle.
Figure 7.9 shows the asymmetry of the ICS locus for a realistic incident beam offset 
angle 2β of 70°. The peak of the ICS cusp characteristic lies within the inscribed circle of 
the polygonal scanner, while one extremity lies beyond the circumscribed circle and the 
other lies between the two circles. The tangent on the ICS locus at the data point θ = 0° 
corresponds to the scan-axis.
Figure 7.10 shows the asymmetry of the ICS locus for an incident beam offset angle 2β of 
100°. The peak of the ICS cusp characteristic lies within the inscribed circle of the polygo­
nal scanner, as does one extremity θ = +30°, while the other extremity θ = –30°, lies between 
the inscribed and the circumscribed circles. The tangent on the ICS locus at the data point 
θ = 0° corresponds to the scan-axis.
Figure 7.11 shows a more extreme asymmetry of the ICS locus for an incident beam 
offset angle 2β of 140° for a 12-facet polygonal scanner, N = 12. The peak of the ICS cusp

has disappeared because, in part, the range of the full mechanical scan angle θ has been 
reduced from ±30° to ±15° by virtue of the increased number of facets from six to twelve. 
The ICS locus extremities range from θ = +15° within the inscribed circle of the polygonal 
scanner to θ = –15° between the inscribed and the circumscribed circles. The tangent on 
the ICS locus at the data point θ = 0° corresponds to the scan-axis.
7.3.8  Locus of P
Axiomatically the locus of the point of incidence P lies along the incident beam line seg­
ment HP. Point P runs back and forth from the fixed point H on the incident beam, at 
which the circumference of the circumscribed circle of the polygonal scanner intersects. 
As the reflected incident beam scans through the full angular range ±A the locus of P 
overlaps itself.
The locus of P is inherently a straight line along the incident beam but doubles back on 
itself from and to the fixed point H. To provide visibility of this locus the data ordinate 
y/r values of Figure 7.10 have been mathematically and linearly stretched in Figure 7.12. 
For clarity the scale of the x/r axis is significantly magnified about tenfold. The markedly 
different spacing between data plots at two-degree intervals is indicative of a rapid accel­
eration and slow deceleration as the point of incidence P traverses the facet.
7.3.9  Offset Angle Limits
The incident beam is not likely to lie within the scan angle when the plane of incidence is 
normal to the axis of rotation; therefore, the smallest offset angle [2β]min for a beam with an 
infinitesimal diameter will always be equal to, or greater than, the semi full optical scan 
angle +A.
The maximum offset angle [2β]max of the incident beam with an infinitesimal diameter 
occurs when the incident beam is at grazing incidence for the semi full optical scan angle –A. 
Therefore, the upper limit to the offset angle will always be equal to, or less than (180°–A).
Thus 2β lies in the range

For real incident beams with a finite width (diameter) the minimum limit 360°/N will 
increase and the maximum limit 180°(l – 2/N) will decrease (see scan duty cycle η in 
Sections 7.2.6 and 7.4.8).
The expressions for the limits of the offset angles provide a useful guideline in the design 
of a scanning system. Although one will endeavor to design the incident beam to have an 
offset angle 2β to lie close to the semi full scan angle +A of the reflected incident beam, 
there are occasions, for reasons of packaging, where this is impossible.
7.3.10  Finite Beam Width D
For simplicity the width of the beam has been assumed to be infinitesimal (Section 7.3.4) 
such that the objective lens optical axis is directed through the fixed point H on the inci­
dent beam where it is intersected by the circumscribed circle of the polygonal scanner in 
the midposition. If the incident beam has a finite width D, the radius r in Equation 7.45 
would be replaced by r(1 - g/r) because the incident beam shifts to the left to pass through 

380 
Handbook of Optical and Laser Scanning
the point G. The dimensional symbol “g” is that shown in Figure 7.2 (Section 7.2). The r in 
Equation 7.46 remains unchanged.
For a finite beam width D the basic cusp-shape characteristic of the ICS loci that is shown 
in Figures 7.8 to 7.11 remains the same, but, with the exception of Figure 7.8 because of 
symmetry, it will be slightly displaced in an upward direction parallel to the facet plane 
by an amount (g tan β) (Figure 7.2). The scan-axis is raised and the objective lens axis is 
lowered, each by an amount (g sin β) with respect to the coordinate axes x/r and y/r. These 
displacement amounts are derived from Figure 7.2, Equations 7.21 and 7.15 in Sections 7.2.9 
and 7.2.8, respectively.
7.3.11  Commentary
The ICS curves with offset angles greater than zero display interesting asymmetrical 
cusp-shape characteristics that offer potential insights into pupil movement that give rise 
to asymmetric aberrations in the image plane of pre-objective scanning systems.
7.3.12  Conclusion
An analysis of real beams of finite width (diameter) is fully expected to produce the same 
basic ICS characteristics as shown in the above documentation. The bottom line is that 
the ICS locus is of interest because it can give insight to the asymmetric wandering of the 
entrance pupil for the optical system lens designer who optimizes a design by minimizing 
the aberrations in the image plane regardless of the ICS locus.
7.4  STATIONARY GHOST IMAGES OUTSIDE THE IMAGE FORMAT
Ghost images are caused by both specular and scattered reflected rays from optical sur­
faces and are always unwanted, especially within the image format of the scanned field 
image plane. Various design innovations have been invented to minimize the effects or 
the presence of ghost images in the image format. Notable are those given in References 
7 and 8 in which a limited angular range for the incident beam offset angle (2β) from the 
scan-axis is given so that stationary ghost images are formed outside the image format of 
the scanned field image plane of regular prismatic polygonal scanning systems.6
7.4.1  Objective
This section explores and illustrates the formation of stationary ghost images that are pro­
duced only by the scattered light rays from the scanned field image plane itself. The goal is 
to determine the angular ranges and limits of the incident beam offset angles 2β (beyond 
that given in References 7 and 8 mentioned above), with visual insights that ensure that the 
stationary ghost images lie outside the image format.
7.4.2  Stationary Ghost Images
Ghost images in the image plane from nonmoving optical components may be expected, 
but, at first thought, not from a rotating optical component such as a polygonal scanner, 
and if so, certainly not stationary. However, the rotating polygonal scanner itself syn­
chronously derotates (descans) these unwanted diffusely reflected rays from the image 

Pre-Objective Polygonal Scanning

plane itself, and they are then specularly rereflected at the mirror facets. If these secondary 
specularly reflected rays are transmitted through the optics of the pre-objective optical 
scanning system, stationary ghost images will be formed in the image plane.
7.4.3  Facet Angle A
The facet angle A is the angle that the facet subtends at the rotation axis O:

= 360

7.4.4  Facet-to-Facet Tangential Angle
The mirror facet-to-facet tangential angle is the angle between successive facet normals 
in a plane perpendicular to the rotation axis. This angle is also denoted by the symbol A, 
because for a regular prismatic polygonal scanner the facet angle and the facet-to-facet 
tangential angle are geometrically identical.
7.4.5  Scan-Axis
The scan-axis is the axis about which the beam angularly scans symmetrically, ±A (see 
Sections 7.2.2 and 7.3.3).
7.4.6  Offset Angle 2β
The incident beam offset angle 2β is the angle that the incident beam makes with the scan-
axis.
7.4.7  Midposition
The midposition of a scanner is that orientation of the polygonal scanner for which a facet 
reflects the incident beam collinearly with the scan-axis, which is parallel to the objective 
lens optical axis (see Sections 7.2.2 and 7.3.3, and Figure 7.1).
7.4.8  Scan Duty Cycle (Scan Efficiency) η
The maximum potential scan duty cycle η of a polygonal scanner is the ratio of the useful 
scan angle, during which the beam width D is effectively unvignetted by the edges of the 
facets, to the full scan angle ±A of a beam with an infinitesimal width (D = 0). We shall 
assume that the footprint of the beam’s tangential width is less than the facet’s tangential 
width in the midposition of a polygonal scanner.

in which r represents the radius of the circumscribed circle of the polygonal scanner (see 
Section 7.2.6). It can be seen from Equation 7.56 that for a given beam of finite width D the 
scan duty cycle η decreases with an increase in the offset angle 2β, or with an increase in 
the number of facets N.
7.4.9  Rotation Axis Offset Distance
The rotation axis offset distance is that distance YP of the rotation axis from the scan-axis 
when the polygonal scanner is set in its midposition (Figures 7.2 and 7.3).
The rotation axis offset distance YP depends on the number of facets N, the incident 
beam offset angle 2β, and beam width D. Replicating Equation 7.25 with a negative sign 
from Section 7.2 gives

It can be seen from Equation 7.59, Table 7.3, and supported by Figures 7.13 to 7.16, that as the 
incident beam offset angle 2β increases, and/or the number of facets N increases, so also 
does the rotation axis offset distance increase YP.
When (N = 3), Equation 7.59 leads to YP = 0, which means the rotation axis lies on the 
scan-axis (Figure 7.4 and Section 7.2.13).

7.4.10 Choosing an Incident Beam Offset Angle 2β
Ideally, for symmetry of design, the incident beam should be directed along the scan-axis, 
but this would obstruct the reflected scanning beam. Therefore, if the image format field 
angle is 2ω, then the incident beam offset angle 2β must at least be slightly greater than the 
semi-image format field angle 𝜔 to avoid this physical interference (Figure 7.13). That is,

(7.60)
Using Equations 7.56 and 7.57 with N = 10, r = 25 mm, and D = 1 mm, leads to Table 7.3.
7.4.11 Ghost Beams gh and Images GH
Pencils of scattered light rays from the incident scanning spot on the scanned surface plane 
are returned through the objective lens. The objective lens recollimates them as they pro­
ceed back to the polygonal scanner’s facets, at which they are specularly reflected to pro­
duce what are known as ghost beams. In Figures 7.13 through 7.16 these ghost beams are 
symbolized by the letters gh, with a subscript that identifies the facet whence they came.
Only if the ghost beams gh are reflected from a facet of the polygonal scanner at angles 
numerically much less than 90°, that is, toward the objective lens, is there a chance that 
they can traverse back through the objective lens, which will focus them onto the image 
plane to form stationary point ghost images GH. A subscript to GH refers to the respective 
facet whence the ghost beam gh came.
If these ghost beams are reflected from a facet of the polygonal scanner at angles numeri­
cally greater than 90°, that is, away from the objective lens, there is no chance of them tra­
versing back through the objective lens to produce stationary ghost images GH.
7.4.12 Ghost Beam Field Angles 𝝓
The field angle φ of all ghost beams gh, whether they produce stationary ghost images in 
the image format plane or not, is always at an angle that is a multiple of 2A away from, and 
on either side of, the incident beam offset angle 2β. This is because the mirror facet-to-facet 
tangential angle of a regular prismatic polygonal scanner is A. Thus

in which n is an integer.
In Section 7.4.3, N = 10, therefore 24 = 72°; hence all ghost beams in Figures 7.13 through 
7.16 occur at intervals of 72° from the incident beam offset angle 2β.
When n = 0, Equation 7.61 represents the retroreflective ghost beam field angle 𝜙1 that is 
collinear with the incident beam. Ghost beam gh1 is not relevant in this discussion and, to 
avoid confusion, it is not depicted in the figures.
If one increases the incident beam offset angle 2β by say 25° counterclockwise, and repo­
sitions the polygonal scanner to a midposition, all the field angles ϕ of the ghost beams 
will have also rotated by 25° counterclockwise, while the polygonal scanner will have only 
rotated 12.5° counterclockwise; and vice versa, if clockwise.
7.4.13  Incident Beam Location
Figures 7.13 through 7.16, which shall be discussed in turn, depict the first significant four 
incidence beam offset angular positions given in Table 7.3, namely, 27°, 52°, 92°, and 124°. 

384 
Handbook of Optical and Laser Scanning
Figures 7.13 through 7.16 depict the respective orientations of the polygonal scanner in the 
midposition and the rotation axis offset distances YP, such that the reflected incident beam 
is collinear with the scan-axis to focus it to the central point C in the image field format. 
Pencils of light rays, gh2, gh3, gh4, and gh10, scattered from point C, are shown passing back 
through the objective lens to meet the facets of the polygonal scanner, whence they are 
again reflected. The subscripts correspond to the facet number.
In Figure 7.13 one such pencil, gh2, passes back through the objective lens to produce the 
point image GH2 below the image field format. There is one pencil gh1, which is reflected 
from facet S1 that is not displayed so as not to overcrowd the diagram. Pencil gh1 is the 
retroreflective pencil that returns collinearly with the path of the incident beam.
As predicted by Equation 7.61 the angle between successive pencils of rays of 
ghost beams gh reflected from the five facets S10, S1, S2, S3, and S4 is 2Α (Figures 
7.13 to 7.16).
One should notice that in Figures 7.13 to 7.16 the vertices of the fan depicting the full scan 
angle ±A and the image field format scan angle ±ω do not coincide, nor do they touch the 
surface of the facet. They lie at two distinct locations. The first lies on the incident beam 
axis at its intersection with the circumscribed circle of the polygonal scanner; the second 
lies below, within the circumscribed circle and above the scan-axis. The difference is best 
observed in Figure 7.16 (see also Section 7.3).
7.4.14  Image Format Scan Duty Cycle ηω
The image format scan duty cycle ηω , is the ratio of the image field format angle 2ω to the 
full scan angle 2A of the polygonal scanner. It must not be confused with the maximum 
potential scan duty cycle (scan efficiency) η. The image format scan duty cycle ηω depends 
directly on the image format angle 2ω.

Since the above image field format scan duty cycle ηω of 55.6% is greater than the maxi­

angle 2β of 164°, this offset angle is not relevant and no figure is provided. The image field 
format scan duty cycle ηω must be less than the scan duty cycle η.
7.4.15  Incident Beam Offset Angle 27°
The incident beam offset angle of 27° in Figure 7.13 is comfortably outside the 
­semi-image format angle ω of +20° to avoid physical obstruction of the scanning 
beam, but at an angle less than the half scan angle A = +36°, of the ten-facet polygo­
nal scanner.

If the ghost beam gh2 traverses the objective lens, there is only one stationary ghost 
image, GH2, at a field angle of ϕ2 = −45°; and it lies outside and 25° below the image field 
format.
From Equation 7.61 the field angles of ghost beams gh10 and gh3 from facet S10 and S3, are  
ϕ10 = +99° and ϕ3 = -117°, respectively. These ghost beams are harmless (| |

In Figure 7.15 the incident beam offset angle is 92°. Let the incident beam offset angle 2β 
with its accompanying ghost beams gh and ghost images GH be rotated counterclockwise 
through a positive angle of +32°. If the ghost beam gh3 traverses the objective lens, the 
ghost image GH3, ϕ3 = -52°, of Figure 7.15 will move up to lie on the lower edge (-ω = -20°)

A simple calculation of adding 72° to the field angle ϕ10 = 164° of ghost beam gh10 in 
Figure 7.15 produces a reflex angle of 236°, thus predicting that the ghost beam gh10 can no 
longer exist.
A close inspection of Figures 7.13 to 7.16 shows the center-of-scan of the total angular 
scan 2A of the scanner progressively becomes displaced from the center-of-scan of the 
image format scan angle 2ω with an increase in the incident beam offset angle β. This is 
valid because the ICS is a locus (see Section 7.3 and Reference 5).

7.4.19  Ghost Images Inside the Image Format

Each has a range of 40°, which, not surprisingly, equates to 2ω.
A figure showing 2β = 164°  is not relevant or depicted, because it has a scan duty cycle η 
less than the required image format duty cycle ηω (Table 7.3).
7.4.20  Ghost Images Outside the Image Format
A study of expressions (7.66), (7.67), and (7.68) shows that when the incident beam off­
set angle lies between +20° and +52° no ghost image will appear in the image format. 
Likewise, when the incident beam offset angle lies between +92° and +124°, each has a 
range of 32°.2
Thus, to ensure ghost images lie outside the image format the condition is as follows:

7.4.21  Number of Facets
Subject toA ≥ ω, as the number of facets N increases, so also does the number of ghost beams 
gh and, therefore, there is a greater possibility of multiple ghost images GH in the scanned 
image plane. A critical case, in this example, occurs when N = 18. Then A = +ω = +20°.

7.4.22  Diameters of Scanner and Objective Lens
No mention has been made with respect to the diameters of the objective lens, the scanner, 
nor the apertures near the scanner, or performance. These topics are out of the scope of 
this section, but all are important issues.2
However, the smaller the diameter of the scanner relative to the objective lens diameter, 
the greater the chance of a ghost beam returning to produce a ghost image in the scanned 
image plane. Likewise, the closer the scanner is to the objective lens, the greater the chance 
of a ghost beam returning to produce a ghost image in the scanned image plane.
7.4.23  Commentary
There is more than one angular zone for the incident beam offset angle to avoid ghost 
images appearing within the image format. These zones have acceptable scan duty cycles 
η, depending on beam width D, the diameter 2r of the polygonal scanner and the number 
of facets N (Figure 7.17, Table 7.3).2
7.4.24  Conclusion
It behooves one to consider the possibility and the whereabouts of stationary ghost images 
in the image format plane during the initial optical system design stage.

8.1  INTRODUCTION
The goal of this section is to offer the reader a comprehension of the parameters that 
shape the design and subsequently the applications of current oscillating optical scanners. 
Hopefully this will explain their design and possibly guide system engineers to reach the 
most desirable compromise between the numerous variables available to them.
It is also my hope that this may stimulate designers to extend the technology or pursue 
different technologies as they appreciate the constraints and limitations of current oscil­
lating optical scanners and their applications.
This text is the third of a series edited by Gerald F. Marshall1,2 covering the evolving field 
of optical scanning. Since oscillating scanners are developed to meet the needs of specific 
technical and scientific applications, it is constructive to review some of these applications. 
Applications are the stimulus that underlies past and future developments.
It is evident that the material presented here is evolutionary and a broader treatment 
can be found in the references. The reader is frequently referred to the previous texts.l,2 
Only Section 8.2.1.4, “Mirrors,” and Section 8.2.23, “Induced Moving Coil Scanner,” are 
reproduced here in toto. These are important subjects that are frequently disregarded by 
system designers, and no meaningful advances have taken place. On occasion, some mate­
rial is taken from the previous editions in order to present the new material in a consistent 
manner. Section 8.2.1.3, “Bearings,” as well as Section 8.2.16, “Dynamic Performances,” 
contains some material from the previous edition as well as new material.
In addition, this edition is inversely organized when compared with its precursors. The 
technology underlying the components of scanners is reviewed up front and new applica­
tions are at the end of the section. Important evolutions of older applications are presented 
generally, while referring the reader to earlier texts for basic descriptions of the subject.
The past decade has seen extensive technology evolutions that have brought major 
changes in the market and manner of use of scanners as well as unexpected performances 
and designs of oscillating scanners. Improved performances of competing technologies 
have attracted applications previously the domain of oscillating mechanical scanners. 
Linear and two-dimensional solid-state arrays now dominate the vision and the night 
vision market, both military and commercial. Digital micromirror devices (DMDs) and 
liquid crystal displays (LCDs) have also captured the field of image projection away from 
oscillating scanners.
On the other hand, the advances of computer control in industry have benefited the 
laser micromachining industry, which requires a high degree of flexibility and is well 
adapted to digital control. This has benefited galvanometric scanner manufacturers, who 
have responded by improving their product.
Improved scanner performances as well as greater choice and more economical associ­
ated technologies have broadened the market for scanners and stimulated new applica­
tions. This in turn has offered opportunities for new sources of supplies.

8.1.1  Historical Developments
The galvanometer is named after the French biologist and physicist Jacques d’Arsonval, 
who devised the first practical galvanometer in 1880. Initially it was used as a static mea­
suring instrument. Its dynamic and optical scanning potential were recognized early 
on when galvanometers were employed to write sound tracks on the talking movies. 
Miniature galvanometers with bandwidths as high as 20 kHz were used for waveform 
recording on UV-sensitive photographic paper as late as 1960.
The invention of the laser broadened the applications of galvanometers in the graphic 
industry during the late 1960s. The first designs were open loop scanners, but very early in 
the 1970s, the position-servoed, better known as the closed loop scanner, came to reign in 
meeting the desire for more bandwidth and increased accurate positioning.
The servoed scanner enabled the accuracy of the device, relegated to the position trans­
ducer, to be dissociated from the torque motor. The next challenge was to minimize inertia 
and optimize rigidity. Cross-talk perturbations were mostly solved with the use of moving 
magnet torque motors and the practice of balancing the load and armature.
Demand for higher speed and greater accuracy forced the design of all the building 
blocks of scanning systems to be refined. The performance of scanners evolved along the 
evolution of its constituents: torque motor, transducers, amplifiers, and computers.
The first milestone in the early 1960s was the development of moving iron scanners, as 
they offered a compact magnetic torque motor. The compact, efficient, and economical 
design offered scanners beyond the capabilities of moving coils at that time.
The second milestone in the late 1980s came as a consequence of the commercialization 
of high-energy permanent magnets. Moving magnet torque motors were developed with 
much greater peak torque. In the same period, a new design of transducers appeared, 
driven by the availability of much improved electronic elements.
The third milestone that came into being in the last decade of the century is marked 
by the presence of computer power to mitigate the shortcomings of even the best gal­
vanometers. The clock rate of ordinary PCs has reached the megahertz range and can 
compensate in real time for position encoder imperfections as well as optimize dynamic 
behavior of periodic and aperiodic armature motions. The PC has also simplified full sys­
tem integration.
High-energy permanent magnets were also developed to power resonant scanners, 
but innovative new designs and the use of PCs form the underpinning of present-day 
devices.
At this writing, all high-performance optical scanners share a common architecture: a 
moving magnet torque motor, a position transducer built along a variable capacitor ceramic 
butterfly for high-precision work and optical sensors for less demanding applications. The 
performance of the galvanometric scanner is limited by the following parameters, which 
shall be covered in more detail in the following sections:
	
1.	The thermal impedance of the magnetic structure and specifically the drive coil. 
This in turn limits the available torque of the magnetic motor and induces unpre­
dictable thermal drift of the position transducer.
	
2.	The thermal stability of the position transducer.
	
3.	The mechanical resonances of the armature and the load as they prevent the sys­
tem from achieving a step response expected from available torque. An expert 
servo designer can appreciably optimize system performances if the elements are 
stable.

396 
Handbook of Optical and Laser Scanning
The ability to integrate all these disciplines, as well as optimum frame configuration, 
mirror design and mounting, drift compensation, and software has become a specialty 
so that a fully integrated subsystem is frequently selected rather than just the scanner. 
Figure 8.1 illustrates all these elements.
The progress of scanners is application driven; consequently more recent applications 
will be reviewed in the last section.
8.2  COMPONENT AND DESIGN ISSUES
Scanners are like old soldiers; they fade away but never die. Moving coil and moving iron 
scanners, as well as some four-pole stepper motors built with laminated stators, are still 
available and priced competitively as their tooling has been amortized. Their design and 
performances have not evolved since they were evaluated previously by this author1,2 and 
will not be reviewed here. Their desirable features do not compensate for their shortcom­
ings such as iron saturation, nonlinearity, and strong unpredictable radial forces, the major 
cause of wobble, for the iron-based scanners and flexible armature and poor thermal prop­
erties for the moving coil units as well as high cost of entry and manufacturing.
8.2.1  Galvanometric Scanners
All modern high-performance oscillating galvanometer scanners are built with a moving 
magnet torque motor and all high-performance position transducers employ a two- or 
four-lobe ceramic variable capacitor.
All oscillating scanners designed in the last decade are built using the NdFeB family of 
permanent magnets. These alloys can have as much as five times the energy product of the 
best ALNICO magnet and certain other benefits, but they have a low Curie temperature, 
possibly as low as 310°C, such as for the 45 MGO material from Ugimag.3
The higher the energy product, the lower the Curie temperature.3 This has two impor­
tant consequences:
	
1.	A typical magnetic strength temperature coefficient of −0.8%/°C in the range 
22°C–85°C.
	
2.	An irreversible flux loss will take place each time the material is heated above 
80°C–100°C. The range reflects the particular alloy selected and the magnetic 
design.
The coil design and its thermal conductivity are critical features of the galvanometric scan­
ner because they are the major cause of transducer thermal drift.
8.2.1.1  Moving Magnet Torque Motor
The torque motor is selected for its ability to integrate with the other elements of the scan­
ner, the mirror, the position sensor, and the electronic driver/controller. It must also sup­
port the dynamic performance requirements and those caused by environmental changes 
and perturbations.

The list of features of an ideal torque motor is long and frequently a compromise is 
reached where some necessary system properties are obtained through other means. 
Environmental control and electronic compensation schemes have become standard fea­
tures of high-performance scanners.
The ideal galvanometric or resonant scanner driver would have the following 
properties:
	
1.	High torque-to-inertia ratio.
	
2.	Low electrical time constant: inductance/resistance.
	
3.	Linear relationship between torque, current, and angular position.
	
4.	Freedom from cross-axis forces or excitations.
	
5.	No hysteresis or discontinuities.
	
6.	No elastic restraint.
	
7.	Some mechanical damping, constant and uniform is acceptable.
	
8.	Very high rigidity in torsion and bending.
	
9.	A balanced armature.
	 10.	Low power consumption [figure of merit; torque/(inertia*Watt1/2)].
	 11.	Immunity to thermal expansion constraints.
	 12.	Good heat dissipation.
	 13.	Demagnetization protection.
	 14.	Simplicity of installation and use.
	 15.	Insensitivity to radio frequency (RF) and other environmental perturbations.
	 16.	Absence of sensitivity to external perturbations.
	 17.	Freedom from self-induced perturbations.
	 18.	Infinite life with stable parameters.
	 19.	Small, light, and cheap.
Additionally, for a resonant scanner, damping properties should be minimum along the 
axis of rotation and high for all other degrees of freedom.
8.2.1.1.1  Moving Magnet Torque Motor
The high energy of rare earth magnets is practically free of radial forces, which makes 
them attractive torque motors. They are the choice of all devices listed in Tables 8.1, 8.2, 
and 8.3. They are large-air-gap devices with comparatively low inductance, and simple to 
interface with electrically.
The driving stage is a conventional inside–out d’Arsonval movement, as shown in 
Figure 8.2. The torque can be calculated as the interaction of two fields or the effect of a 
field on a current. We shall follow the latter method.
Equation 8.1 is derived for coils with a total number of turns N and with conductors at 45° 
from the plane of symmetry. Equation 8.2 gives the torque generated by a device built with 
a coil as shown in Figure 8.3 having a uniform conductor density distribution ±45° from the 
plane of symmetry. This assumes that D is the average diameter of the coil. Also the coil needs 
to be of tightly wound coils and facing the region of highest magnetic field of the rotor:

The outer shell closes the magnetic circuit of the permanent magnet as well as that of the 
drive coil. It is preferably made of sintered high density 50/50 nickel–iron alloy. Low-carbon 
cold rolled steel such as C1020 and other steels have similar magnetic properties, but are 
rarely more economical as the finished part. Its radial thickness is recommended to be 
about one-quarter the diameter of the rotor when a rare earth magnet is used as the rotor.
The constant K in Equation 8.1 takes into consideration the space allocated for the coil 
with respect to the dimension of the magnet. It is expressed as

Rare earth magnets have a very high intrinsic coercive force and they are practically

generated. The torque is only limited by the coil design and construction as it relates to the

cooling capability to prevent either catastrophic failure or excessive thermal drift of the 
position transducer. Coil design and transducer designs are the critical features of galva­
nometric scanners as well as armature rigidity. These elements shall be reviewed in the 
following sections.
8.2.1.1.2  Coil Construction
The use of the space allocated to the coil windings in electromagnetic devices has been 
the subject of numerous texts and studies since electromagnetic devices have been made. 
Roters4 gives a general description of the subject and early patents5 demonstrate the appre­
ciation that efficient packing density of coils as well as their thermal construction are crit­
ical features. Hodges6 gives a detailed description of the benefits that can be derived from 
pressing a coil of round conductors into a minimum cross section. He reports that thermal 
conductivity can be increased by a factor of 3 after compression.
Roters4 shows that “resistance density” and “thermal conductivity” of a coil are nearly 
proportional to the “copper density” of the coil. Optimizing the copper density of a coil 
without prejudicing its reliability or cost has been the pursuit of optical scanner manufac­
turers as these devices are regularly driven extremely hard.

The thermal impedance of a coil is mostly defined by the electrical insulation of the con­
ductor, the copper density as well as the encapsulation compound. The volume of insula­
tion and encapsulation needs to be minimized. Single insulation of magnet wire occupies 
about 20% of the volume of the typical conductor used for these devices.
Packing efficiency has been recognized as another critical factor. The highest possible 
local packing density of large coils with round conductor wound in quincunx is 90.69% 
and layer winding reaches a maximum of 78.5%. Most common windings have a packing 
density under 60%, which consequently yields a copper density under 50%.
Two technologies have been developed to improve the copper packing density as well as 
the thermal impedance of galvanometer coils. One technique compacts the coil and is best 
described by Hodges6 and Houtman.7

They recommend first preforming a coil with conventional single insulation round wire 
plus self-adhesive. This preformed coil is then compressed to conform to its final shape 
and achieve a higher packing density. A suitable choice of insulation and ductile conductor 
can improve the copper density by 20%, comparable to a quincunx winding. That indicates 
that when the base coil has a random winding, an increase in copper density from 50% to 
70% copper density is possible.7
A slightly higher copper density can be achieved with low aspect ratio ribbon conductor. 
This construction in addition offers the best thermal impedance and a simpler construc­
tion. Figure 8.3 compares conventional coil and ribbon coil constructions with about equal 
resistance. This construction can yield a coil with thermal conductivity four times higher 
than can be obtained with a conventional random wound coil and 50% higher than can be 
achieved with a compressed coil construction.
8.2.1.1.3  Heat Dissipation
The heat dissipation constant is a critical parameter as the temperature rise of the scan­
ner has numerous consequences with possible thermal runaway and catastrophic conse­
quences as described earlier in this section. The elements directly affected by a temperature 
rise are:
	
1.	The coil temperature as its resistance increases with temperature rise as:

where  T represents the temperature change from the 25°C resistance value.
	
2.	The thermal conductivity of the coil has major consequences for the temperature 
of the magnet as it is located at the center of the coil. The average coil temperature 
rise may be modest, but it may not be representative of the temperature at the cen­
ter of the coil and the temperature of the magnet.

3.	The temperature stability of a hard magnetic material is inversely proportional to 
its energy product. The ALNICOs are the most stable, followed by the samarium 
compounds and finally the NdFeB alloys. Most scanners are built with the most 
energetic NdFeB material with a high negative temperature sensitivity such that, 
as a first approximation, the magnetic field can be derived, from Reference 3 data, 
for 22–85 °C from:

4.	The thermal coupling of the position transducer and the torque motor. Symmetry 
and mounting designs are critical to minimize transducer drift. One manufacturer 
effectively separates the torque motor from the transducer with the suspension.
Manufacturers give particular attention to the heat dissipation coefficient of scanners for 
competitive reasons. It is advisable to obtain from the vendors the mode of measurement 
and judge if it applies to the application at hand.
The dissipation coefficient is frequently specified as “coil to case” because the best 
numbers are obtained when the change in coil temperature is derived from its change 
in resistance, as the device is being powered and held in a large fixed-temperature heat 
sink. Treating the galvanometer stator as an oven where a thermistor is located within a 
simulated armature yields the most meaningful values. The heat dissipation coefficient 
obtained in this manner may be half that of the coil to case values.
8.2.1.2  Position Transducer
The simplest and most economical position transducer is a torsion bar. The torque motor 
pushes against the torsion bar and positions the mirror. This forms a second-order system 
where bandwidth and position accuracy must be traded off. These units are best built as 
moving iron devices typically with very stable ALNICO magnets. They typically exhibit 
good temperature stability, around 150 ppm/°C.
Most high-performance scanners are closed loop servoed systems. They also must 
deliver bandwidth and positioning accuracy. High-energy magnet torque motors are very 
powerful and can deliver the bandwidth but the magnetic material, NdFeB, is temperature 
sensitive and they depend upon the position transducer to deliver the accuracy.
8.2.1.2.1  Gain and Pointing Stability Considerations
Galvanometric scanners applications can be divided into two groups: image/position 
acquisition and pointing/designation/laser micromachining. In both cases, systems 
need to be calibrated and drift needs to be compensated. This becomes evident in the 
tolerance budget of some advanced positioning systems demanding absolute beam 
positioning.
For example, as the technology advances, the density of the biology carriers in GeneChips 
is increasing from the present 4000 pixels per scan line to 10,000 and the number of scans 
per chip from 4000 to 10,000. Each one of the pixels must be correctly located.
High-precision laser micromachining systems used in the manufacturing of flat panel 
displays or silicon devices such as DRAMs or the trimming of batches of MEMs (such as 
air bag accelerometers) or trimming of resistors on circuits on silicon need highly accu­
rate and stable gain and pointing performance. These applications commonly demand 

404 
Handbook of Optical and Laser Scanning
addressability errors to be of the order of 1/20,000 or 50 ppm of the field of view and spe­
cial application can be two or four times more demanding.
The addressability error has a number of sources:
	
1.	It may not be possible to accurately locate the work in the field of view with respect 
to the scanners’ axis of reference. It is common practice to imbed fiducial marks for 
optical alignment and calibration.
	
2.	The environment and application may not permit a structural design sufficiently 
rigid.
	
3.	Scanner/transducer drifts may exceed acceptable tolerances for certain applica­
tions. In such cases it may be necessary to close the loop around the drift.
The two applications listed above cannot be satisfied with scanners built with only “open 
loop drift transducers.” This becomes apparent upon the analysis of the temperature reg­
ulation required to meet the necessary pointing accuracy. The following case illustrates 
this point.
Let us consider an application where the optical scan angle is 0.4 rad, ptp, and the scanner 
exhibits a gain drift of 50 ppm/°C as well as a null (or zero) drift of 50 ppm/°C (20 μrad/°C 
over 0.4 rad excursion) or a total uncertainty for each measurement of 100 ppm/°C. Because 
two measurements are required to point the beam, one to define the system’s references 
and one to point at the work, the uncertainty is 200 ppm/°C.
The DRAM application would demand that the scanner be held in an environment 
controlled to less than 0.25 °C and the BioChip example could tolerate twice that. These 
are extremely demanding conditions, specially for aperiodic operation. For these rea­
sons, closed loop drift compensation or closed loop drift position transducers are 
required.
8.2.1.2.2  Transducer Drift
Most high-accuracy capacitive position transducers are derivatives of Rohr’s8 design and 
built with a ceramic vane mounted on the armature of the scanner, which rotates between 
two stationary conductive plates as depicted in Figure 8.4. A circuit creates a drive signal 
and detects changes in capacitance. The combined demands of high system bandwidth 
(0.5–5 kHz) and resolution (1–10 μrad) as well as stability (5–50 ppm/°C) are extremely 
difficult to achieve in an analog environment and, so far, no manufacturer offers a digital 
system able to approach this suite of specifications.
These transducers are complex analog devices with multiple sources of drift, both 
mechanical and electrical, induced by small changes of thermal or other origins includ­
ing aging and hysteresis. A typical transducer with a 2-cm diameter ceramic butterfly 
vane can resolve better than 1 μrad in less than 1 ms. Under these conditions the tip of the 
ceramic vane has moved less than 0.01 μm. It is quite an achievement.
Unfortunately the stability of the same transducer is two orders of magnitude lower per 
°C. Scanner manufacturers specify short-term temperature gain drift as well as null drift 
and occasionally uncorrelated drift of the position transducer. Those quantities are diffi­
cult to quantify and it is valuable to know under which condition they were derived, as 
these may not be representative of the conditions where the scanners may be used.
Normally only gain drift is measured and the null or pointing drift value is derived 
from gain values measured at two extreme representative positions. The null drift quoted 
may be more representative of asymmetry in the gain drift.

Galvanometric and Resonant Scanners 
405
Measurements are made with the scanner held and stabilized in a constant tempera­
ture oven as the controller is kept at room temperature. This is rarely representative of the 
operating environment of optical scanners. More common is a burst of energy to rapidly 
reposition the mirror then followed by rest time when part changes take place.
It is recommended to structure a representative drift test within the environment and 
process of the scanner application. If this is impractical, drift performances should be der­
ated from the quoted values by at least a factor of 2.
8.2.1.2.3  Closed Loop Drift Transducers
It is frequently necessary that the beam be located with similar or greater precision than 
the resolution required for the task the instrument is to perform. To define location or 
correct for drift, reference points, known as fiducial marks, are commonly used. This 
approach, familiar in astronomy, is also frequently applied to recalibrate gain and null of 
galvanometric scanners.
It is important to keep in mind that most scanning systems are designed to the limit of 
the resolution capabilities achievable with the assembled elements: scanners, lasers, mirror 
size and flatness, focal length, and so on. Commonly, the optical elements performing the 
task are optimized for dynamic performances as well as optical performances. The addi­
tion of other scanner mounted optical sensors or the purpose of absolute position recon­
naissance can substantially limit overall performances.
A number of optical techniques have been adopted to recalibrate gain and drift in pro­
cess. Most of them use split cells—or fiducial marks—located in the work plane, beyond 
the angular reach of the work area. Weiss and colleagues9,10 and others report the analyses 
of these techniques.
A different technique11 to correct for drift is described by Montagu and colleagues. It 
takes advantage of the high-resolution capability of the capacitive transducer to incor­
porate capacitive fiducial features within the transducer proper. The leading edge of a 
step or a pulse is used for periodic recalibration. In this method, the fiducial features 
may be positioned on the inside of the operating range of the transducer or beyond. In 
most applications, this technique offers performances comparable to that obtained with 
fiducial marks in the work plane and can reduce drift errors by more than an order of 
magnitude.

8.2.1.2.4  Optical Transducers
Optical position transducers offer the attraction of low cost, low inertia, and small vol­
ume, as well as low power consumption and an analog signal in an analog environment. 
Unfortunately the same features are at the root of the difficulties to reach high tempera­
ture stability, good signal-to-noise ratio, and good linearity simultaneously.
Optical transducers have recently dramatically improved and the data listed in Table 8.1 
lets us compare recent and older designs. Still, the performances of the best optical trans­
ducers fall short of those of the best capacitive units. From Tables 8.1 and 8.2 we can see 
that typical capacitive detectors have stability 50% better than the best optical transducers 
and their repeatability is about an order of magnitude better. The capacitive transducer 
also exhibits better linearity: one-quarter the nonlinearity.
Figure 8.5 shows the conceptual construction of three optical transducers from References 
12 through 24.
8.2.1.2.5  Capacitive Transducers
All capacitive transducers have a common concept where a movable ceramic element 
rotates between a driving plate and a pair of sensor plates wired in series according to the 
design of Robert Abbe.15 The moving element can have two lobes (“butterfly” type) or four 
lobes (“iron cross” type). Figure 8.4 depicts the basic design mounted at the front end of 
a flexure-mounted scanner. This symmetrical construction is preferably located between 
the mirror and the torque motor to simplify the servo loop if the torque motor and the 
mirror lack a rigid coupling.
The previous sections have addressed the critical issue of stability. Numerous attempts 
to bring drift within the range of the resolution16–18 have yielded limited commercial suc­
cess. The use of fiducial marks in the field of regard has been the only reliable solution for 
the system designer. Although galvanometers with integrated fiducial marks have been 
commonly in use for military application, only recently have economical designs become 
commercially available.
8.2.1.3  Bearings
Chapter 5 of this book is devoted to the design of bearing suspension for rotary scanners 
and the material addressed is applicable here. The design or selection of bearing suspen­
sion is critical for both galvanometric and resonant scanners. Galvanometric scanners are 
built with either ball bearing suspension or flexure bearing suspension. Resonant scanners 
are built with a variety of suspensions such as cross flexures or torsion bars.
Armatures as well as bearing tolerances of galvanometer scanners are similar to those 
encountered in the manufacturing of rotating polygons. Oscillating scanners benefit from 
the periodic motion and a suitable preload should ensure that all elements of the bearing 
will retrace their path. This should limit wobble to 2 or 3 optical μrad.
Moving magnet torque motors, common to galvanometric scanners, are built with large 
air gaps—where the drive coil is housed—and consequently impart negligible radial forces. 
In addition, a properly balanced load should not induce any radial forces. It is therefore 
practical to preload the ball bearing axially, which is compatible with conventional bearing 
design. In addition it is possible to use cross flexure bearings, which inherently have low 
radial rigidity. Torsion bar suspension of resonant scanners may also be employed for the 
same reasons.

Galvanometric and Resonant Scanners 
407
8.2.1.3.1  Ball Bearings
Ball bearings should preferably be selected for their ability to operate at high speed. It 
is critical to prevent the balls from skidding. To that effect, the choices of lubricant as 
well as the magnitude of the preload are the major consideration. These are well within 
conventional bearing standards for scanners operating over a few degrees of motion. 
Periodic high-frequency continuous small motions, typically under 1 or 2°, are known 
to cause rapid catastrophic failure, a condition known as “false brinelling” or “fretting 
corrosion.”
Bearing wobble. A typical ball bearing supported spindle, as for a polygon, exhibits 20–50 
μrad of wobble normal to scan. This represents spindle-only errors and does not include 
any sagittal errors of the polygon reflective surface. A typical galvanometric scanner using 
the same ball bearings on the same spacing will exhibit wobble an order of magnitude 
lower, and typically under 2 μrad.
The components of a bearing, the inner and outer races as well as the balls, have speci­
fied tolerances. The same goes for the bearing seats and the shaft. Errors in excess of 1 μm 
are associated with each interface and the accumulation of all imperfections defines spin­
dle wobble. Polygon inaccuracies must be added to these.
The armature construction of a well-designed galvanometric scanner has the same toler­
ances and imperfections as any spindle. The one mirror surface, however, is forced to keep

Handbook of Optical and Laser Scanning
a constant periodic relationship to all the bearing and other components, so the mirror 
repeats its sagittal behavior scan after scan and virtually no wobble is present.
The design of galvanometric scanners and mirror systems considers this periodicity 
as critical to their performances. The sections “Dynamic Imbalance” and “Mechanical 
Resonances” provide information for analysis of dynamic radial imbalances and confirm 
the importance of armature mirror balancing.
Bearing preload. The conventional method of achieving radial rigidity of a spindle is to 
have axial preload for the bearings following bearing manufacturers’ recommendations. 
Moving magnet scanners exhibit extremely low radial forces and are normally preloaded 
axially. Scanner suspensions have benefited from the improvement of bearings, lubricant, 
and mounting technology developed for reliable spindles for torque motors that index 
magnetic heads of CD-ROMs. Ball bearing selection and installation are now well under­
stood and must be tailored to the application and address the following considerations to 
assure proper life:
	
1.	Preload forces.
	
2.	Radial play and ABEC tolerance number.
	
3.	Lubricant.
	
4.	Acceleration (acceleration greater than 500 g results in sliding ball condition and 
early failure).
	
5.	Bearing rigidity.
	
6.	Material selection. The choice of ceramic ball is preferred for high speed or high 
acceleration applications or to minimize fretting corrosion encountered when 
scanning very small excursion at high frequency.
8.2.1.3.2  Cross-Flexure Bearings
Cross-flexure bearings were incorporated in oscillating scanners quite early. Their low 
radial rigidity to angular rotation ratio has limited their use to angles of only 1 or 2° as they 
were built with moving iron architecture. The torque motor redesign with high-energy 
magnets has very much expanded their use. A thorough study of properties and designs 
of flexure bearings has been conducted by Wittrick19 and Siddall.20 It should be noted that 
radial motion of the axis of rotation is eliminated when the axis is located at one-third of 
the length of the flexure, as shown in Figure 8.6.
Figure 8.7 is a section of a commercial cross-flexure bearing unit built inside a cylindri­
cal housing. These units come close to the size of a ball bearing. Most scanners are built 
from photo-etched flexure assembled on a box-like armature designed for minimum iner­
tia and maximum rigidity. Flexures must be stress-free at assembly to avoid catastrophic 
stress failure.
Figure 8.4 shows a scanner with an armature supported on cross-flexure bearings. Cross-
flexure pivot suspensions are totally free of jitter. Flexures are for oscillating scanners what 
air bearings are for polygons, but at a cost lower by at least one order of magnitude. Both 
flexures and air bearings have a common weakness however: low radial stiffness.
The advantages of flexure bearings are:
	
1.	Freedom from wobble and jitter
	
2.	Nearly unlimited life in noncorrosive atmospheres

Fortunately, most of the shortcomings of flexure pivots can be circumvented by trade-
offs in scanner design and installation procedures.
Cross-flexure bearings are the preferred suspension for applications with a need for 
extremely critical repeatability and low wobble. They are also the only solution for small 
angle excursions, under 4° optical. Small motion does not permit proper ball bearing lubri­
cation, leading to “fretting corrosion” and catastrophic failure in short order. Clearing 
moves every few seconds in order to assist lubrication may mitigate the damages.
8.2.1.4  Mirrors
Many scanning problems can be attributed to mirror problems. If mirrors could be made 
infinitely rigid, flat, and reflective, and have negligible inertia, the design and operation 
of scanners would be extremely simple and there would be less demand for this text. No 
material able to fulfill these ideal requirements comes to mind; however, available materi­
als do offer practical design solutions.
The facets of a polygon scanner are often viewed as the last link in the chain of com­
ponents of a scanning system and so burdened with all the system’s faults. The mirror 
of a galvanometric or resonant scanner, however, is rarely perceived in the same fash­
ion and receives comparatively little attention. Actually, they both must meet the same 
requirements for reflectivity, balance, thermal and dynamic deformation, mounting, 
and so on.
The condition of the mirror of an oscillating scanner is of concern for that portion of 
its movement in which optical data is transmitted. Control of dynamic deformations is 
commonly associated with resonant scanners. Fabrication and installation requirements 
are commonly associated with galvanometric scanners. Thermal conductivity becomes 

Galvanometric and Resonant Scanners 
411
an issue with the use of high-power lasers (and galvanometric scanners), which tend to 
induce temperature gradients.
In oscillating scanning systems, the design and installation of the mirror must be able 
to preserve the essential system features under all operating and storage conditions. Low 
wobble, low jitter, precise pointing or scanning accuracy, and long life are typical require­
ments that have to be addressed.
8.2.1.4.1  Mirror Construction and Mounting
Several guidelines for mirror design and mounting associated with scanning perfor­
mances have been mentioned previously. These are:
	
1.	The mirror mass must be a minimum.
	
2.	The mirror inertia must be a minimum.
The mirror must be mounted as close as possible to the front bearing of the scanner 
in order to lower cross-axis resonances. All moments of inertia with respect to the axis 
of rotation must be balanced in order to minimize wobble induced by angular accelera­
tion and by environmental perturbations. Balancing is most imperative for resonant scan­
ners with torsion bar suspension. Three other performance issues associated with mirror 
design and installation—alignment, mirror bonding, and mirror clamping/mounting—
must be addressed.
Alignment. One consequence of mirror cross-axis misalignment is beam-positioning 
error, frequently expressed as a “smile” or a “frown.” Limited compensation is possible for 
a line scan, but a precise area scanner, or designator, may require accurate mirror angular 
positioning. In addition, mounts may need to be electrically as well as thermally isolated. 
Alignment or balancing must be verified for each mirror along both axes to prevent imbal­
ance and wobble.
An effective way to minimize problems with both alignment and bonding is to preci­
sion machine both the mirror’s reflective surface and its shaft mounting hole from a single 
piece of metal to make an integral mirror. Mirror design criteria for high-resonance fre­
quency and mounting stress isolation must be considered.
Mirror bonding. It is extremely difficult to bond a mirror to a mount and have it aligned 
with an accuracy of 1 mrad. For mirrors smaller than 1 cm the alignment tolerance can be 
as high as 5 mrad unless optical autocollimation methods and great care in bonding are 
used.
An improper bond process or mount design can cause mirror deformation when the 
adhesive cures or temperature changes during shipping or use with higher power lasers. 
These thermal stresses may also cause the mirror to break or become unbonded.
The elasticity of the bond can cause dynamic pointing errors as well as undesirable 
resonances that could reduce the system’s bandwidth. The rigidity of the bond can cause 
mirror stresses and deformation when mounting to the shaft of the scanner.
Mirror clamping and mounting. Reiss21 gives a brief overview of recommended mounting 
procedures. Clamp-like mirror mounts allow for repositioning and possible removal for 
replacement. By contrast, both integral and shaft bonded mirror mounting methods are 
semipermanent conditions.
The most successful removable clamps are a form of collet that provides isolation of the 
mirror substrate from clamping stress. A disadvantage of the collet approach is poten­
tial loosening of the collet clamping forces, with a resulting drift of catastrophic failure. 

412 
Handbook of Optical and Laser Scanning
Collet clamps, if not overtightened, induce only compressive forces that produce no bend­
ing movement and thus no distortions in the mirror facesheet. One collet clamp technique 
is to mechanically isolate the shaft by relieved regions so that the distortions imposed by 
the clamping screw are not transmitted.
Fastening a mirror mount onto a shaft with setscrews is not recommended, as they can 
deform the shaft. When setscrews are properly fitted, removing them is nearly impossible. 
When not fitted properly, they act as a hinge, allowing wobble excitations. Set screws can 
fatigue and loosen.
Dynamic deformations. The accelerating torques imparted to a scanning mirror can pro­
duce significant mirror surface distortions. This is particularly true in scanners driven 
with a sawtooth waveform and in high-frequency resonant scanners. Brosens’22 analysis of 
the deformations induced by accelerating torques yields the approximate formula

where f is the maximum deflection from the original mirror shape; s the width measured 
across the axis of rotation; E Young’s modulus of the mirror material; h the thickness; l the 
length in the axial direction, and T the applied torque. The torque is related to the angular 
acceleration a by

(8.8)
This expression points to the desirability of keeping mirrors as narrow as possible. For a 
glass mirror 1 cm in diameter and 1 mm thick, the resulting deflection at an acceleration of 
106 rad/s2 is about 1/25 of the sodium D-line wavelength. Since the inertia of such a mirror 
is 0.011 g cm2, the above acceleration corresponds to a torque of only 11,000 dyne cm. The 
actual mirror deformation may be smaller when a substantial portion of the width of the 
mirror is cemented to a mount.
Thermal deformations. When a scanning mirror is exposed to radiation, a substantial part 
of the radiation that the reflecting surface absorbs is transferred in the form of heat to the 
rear surface. This heat is discharged by conduction to the mount and by radiation and con­
vection to the surrounding atmosphere. The conduction of heat to the rear surface causes 
differential expansion and, if the incident radiation is particularly intense, significant dis­
tortions can occur. Such distortions can be estimated by assuming one-dimensional heat 
transfer to the rear surface.

For a glass mirror of width 1 cm conducting 0.1 W/cm2 to the back surface, the resulting 
camber is 0.5 μm, or about 1 wavelength.
Erosion. When a scanner mirror is moved through air at high speed, the collision of dust 
particles with its surface can cause gradual erosion of its reflective coating. Experience 
shows that for any coating the process of erosion does not occur below a critical impact 
velocity. It is believed that surface erosion occurs when the stress developed at the impact 
interface between the coating and the dust particle exceeds a value that is characteristic of 
the coating.
The stress developed by the impact of a rigid body against an elastic mass was ana­
lyzed by Timoshenko and Goodier.23 The stress wave generated by impact is given by the 
formula

(8.13)
where E is Young’s modulus of the substrate, V is the relative speed at impact, and c is the 
velocity of wave propagation (sound velocity) in the substrate.
Experimental evidence shows that AISIO coatings on fused silica degrade through ero­
sion at all points where the speed of motion exceeds 3 m/s at any instant during the scan 
cycle.
Users of high-speed scanners should take precautions to minimize the presence of sus­
pended dust particles near scanning mirrors. Where such protection cannot be provided, 
hard coatings should be used in combination with substrates of low Young’s modulus.
Material selection. All scanner applications do not have the same performance require­
ments, so there is no optimum mirror material. The selection of a substrate is application 
dependent and has to satisfy some or all the performance requirements reviewed earlier.
Table 8.4 lists the properties of materials suitable for mirror substrate as well as mounts. 
The figure of merit for resonant scanners, E/d3, has been derived by Brosens and Vudler.22 
This is to be used as a comparative guide for a given geometry. One should keep in mind 
that design, construction, heat treatment, coating, and installation can each have a domi­
nant influence on the performance of a mirror. The figure of merit for galvanometric scan­
ner mirror design is E/d. This is based on fabrication requirements only (for discussion, 
see Reference 25).
Cost, ease of fabrication, stability with time and environmental conditions (such as 
temperature and cyclic stresses), bonding capability, and mirror surface finishing are 

414 
Handbook of Optical and Laser Scanning
extremely important to the selection of a substrate material. Fatigue and yield strength are 
normally irrelevant.
Mirror surface finish. Definitions and specifications of available surface finishes and coat­
ings for glass mirrors can be obtained from numerous sources, including government 
specifications, and will not be reviewed here.
For metal mirrors, difficulties begin with the form of the metal stock and the machin­
ing process. Each case is different and presents its own problems. After a blank has been 
machined to finished dimensions, it has to be stress relieved and stabilized. Dynamic 
stressing can also be used. Thermal stabilization can be achieved with three or four cycles 
of processing from liquid nitrogen to boiling water.
The following processes are used for surface finishing when polishing the substrate is 
not acceptable.
Plating and polishing. All the surfaces of the mirror can be plated with equal thickness of 
hard nickel (typically 0.002–0.005 in) to avoid thermal deformation. Any material removal 
during polishing may need to be allowed for when plating, and additional thermal stabili­
zation may be required. Nickel can be ground and polished to a high-quality surface and 
then finished by conventional means.
Replication. This is a process in which a reflective surface and one or more coatings are 
formed by successive evaporation in reverse order onto a master, and then transferred 
together onto the substrate and bonded. The bonding agent is typically an epoxy layer 
with a viscosity of 100 centipoise and a thickness of a few micrometers. If the thickness 
approaches 25 μm, the process introduces alignment errors of 0.1–1 mrad or greater. There 
is limited usable temperature range due to “bimetallic deformation.” Weissman24 shows 
that a 1 fringe curl per 25 °C is to be expected for a disc with a 25:1 aspect ratio.
Additional limitations may be introduced by the power to be reflected from the mir­
ror. Brosens and Vudler22 calculate that the heat transfer coefficient of epoxy could limit

Diamond machining. This technology has proven to be exceptionally successful in the 
manufacture of high-volume low-cost aluminum polygon mirrors with sagittal tolerance 
<50 μrad. Diamond machining is less attractive for beryllium and coated steel substrates, 
or when reflectivity requirements necessitate additional processing.
8.2.1.4.2  Mechanical Protection of Mirror Substrates
Table 8.4 lists the material and thermal properties of various mirror substrate materials. It 
should be noted (last column) that beryllium has the highest figure of merit of all materials 
but for diamond.
8.2.1.5  Image Distortions
This section reviews the most common scanner-related image distortions. While it is 
important to identify the source of any error, only the most common imperfections deriv­
ing from scanner sources will be discussed here.
8.2.1.5.1  Cosine Fourth Law
Off-axis image distortions have been described by Smith.26 They occur even when there is 
no vignetting. The illumination is usually lower than for the point on the axis. Figure 8.8 
is a schematic drawing showing the relationship between exit pupil and image plane for 
point A on axis and point H off axis. The illumination at an image point is proportional to 
the solid angle that the exit pupil subtends from the point. It is apparent that for small val­
ues of f f

, and that OA = OH cos θ. Thus, the solid angle subtended by the pupil 
from H is reduced by a factor of cos3 θ from that subtended at A. Now the illumination so 
far has been considered in a plane normal to the direction of propagation; it is apparent 
that at H the energy is spread over an area that is proportionately larger than at A because 
the cone strikes the surface at an angle θ from the normal; thus, a fourth cos θ factor must 
be added, and we find that:

8.2.1.5.2  Index of Refraction of Air

and absolute temperature T. The pertinent relations are

where R is the gas constant and K is the Gladstone–Dale constant, an empirical value. One 
should keep in mind that the local air density is proportional to its local velocity. In prac­
tice this forces the designer to enclose the optical bench and prevent air motion.
Excessive wobble of single-axis or bending of two-axis scanning systems operating at a 
slow speed (a few scans per second) is frequently due to air motion and can be eliminated 
by proper baffling and occasional vigorous air stirring, such as with a fan.
Microphonic perturbations are due to the variability of the index of refraction of air.
8.2.1.5.3  Air Dynamics
As we have seen, air is not the ideal medium for light to travel through. Air also adds to 
scanning difficulties due to the damping effect of its viscosity and the buffeting perturba­
tions caused by its turbulence. These disturbances are pertinent for systems of high speed 
and high precision. At present they are frequently encountered with high-performance 
resonant scanners that are selected for their high frequency and large mirror capabilities. 
Many advanced systems being contemplated operate the scanners in partial vacuum or 
helium in order to minimize these disturbances.
There is no literature for low inertia scanners equivalent to that of Lawler and Shepherd27 
for polygons. Aerodynamic effects for low inertia scanners are complex due to the extremely 
low inertia and stored energy of the moving element compared to the effects of the aerody­
namic forces generated. The Reynolds number has been used by Brosens for the purpose 
of evaluation.28
The Reynolds number Re is a dimensionless quantity function of the fluid density d, vis­
cosity v, velocity V, and the mirror radius r.

(8.17)
At Reynolds numbers above 2000 the pressure forces proportional to mirror tip velocity 
add to the viscous losses and are the dominant cause of low Q for resonant scanners. This 
is the region where laminar flow changes to turbulent.
It is also these turbulences that induce jitter in resonant scanners, which can exceed 
5 μrad. This, more than any other effect, limits the dimensions and operating frequency of 
resonant scanners in air.
8.2.1.5.4  Mirror Surface Off Axis
For dynamic reasons, the reflecting surface of a scanner mirror is normally offset from 
the axis of rotation. This offset T causes an additional scan nonlinearity error. In order to 

Galvanometric and Resonant Scanners

minimize this effect, the beam should be centered below the axis of rotation by an amount 
K as shown in Figure 8.8. This error E function is

where α is the angle of the mirror to the normal of the work plane.

rotation added to the reference angles of 37° and 45°, respectively.
8.2.1.5.5  Beam Path Distortions

by path length variations for different portions of the beam. Portions of the image may be

blurred or may focus before or after the image plane. Alternately, portions of the image 
beam may be directed to an incorrect position in the image plane.
In focused laser systems, BPD frequently appears as elongated or distorted spots. These 
defects appear in different axes in the near and far focus about the optimum focus or as 
“lobes” of energy projecting from the focused spot.
In vision systems, the image is not always diffraction limited, particularly with the larger 
apertures. As much as or even 1 wave of distortion may be acceptable.
Mirror nonflatness in imaging systems is a common cause of BPD and is likely to impair 
the image astigmatically.
Vertical and horizontal axes do not focus at the same plane. This is seen in the two views 
of the image beam in Figure 8.10. The incorrect imaging position of certain bundles of light 
typically reduces contrast in the image.
Figure 8.10 shows the front and side views of an image beam reflected from a cylin­
drically deformed mirror. In the front view, because the beam’s convergence is reduced, it 
focuses at a farther point than the undisturbed focus cone in the side view. The spot dia­
grams show that, in this case, the spot takes on an oval or enlarged form; it never attains 
the correct size and shape, shown on the right.
Lens system defects, such as decentering, stress, and other manufacturing-related prob­
lems, can also cause image deformities. If image quality does not meet expectations, test 
the lens system without the scanner. Figure 8.10 shows common distortions.
F–θ lenses commonly exhibit more than 0.5% nonlinearity. Field-flattening lenses also 
have performance tolerances that need to be specified.
8.2.1.6  Dynamic Performances
Galvanometric scanners are servo-controlled devices and must obey all standard closed 
loop servo control requirements for stability. Servo system theory is a well-developed dis­
cipline and this section shall only review the scanner design features affecting scanner 
performances and the effect of some common drive profile signals.
As the cost of high-speed computers has come down, they have become an integral ele­
ment of scanner systems. Programs can be implemented that alter, on the fly, the drive 
signal to the power amplifier to optimize random addressing of scanners or laser beam in 
two or three dimensions. This may be used to circumvent amplifier saturation and high 
frequency excitations. System performances are strongly affected by the armature design 
as well as the driver amplifier and the algorithm chosen to drive the scanner.

8.2.1.6.1  Resonances
All mechanical elements have resonances. Galvanometric scanners should preferably 
be designed such that all elements and subelements be as rigid as possible. Ideally 
their lowest natural frequency should be higher than the highest frequency of the 
drive signal or any perturbing frequency that can be transmitted to it. This is rarely 
possible.
It is customary to identify offending resonances and exclude them from the drive signal. 
It should be kept in mind that scanners mounted on nonrigid lossy material, for isolation, 
may lose their registration to the work surface. Mirror installation is a frequent source of 
imbalance and should be executed with that in mind.
8.2.1.6.2  Dynamic Imbalance
A rotating body can be balanced, but never perfectly. It is necessary to qualify and quan­
tify resulting imbalance forces in order to assess their consequences and judge if they are 
acceptable for the application.
Bearings are built with some degree of radial play. When they are subjected to periodic 
eccentric forces that exceed the constraints of their preload, radial or axial, damage follows 
that can result in catastrophic failure.
Figure 8.11 is a schematic representation of a ball bearing mounted rotor from a gal­
vanometer with an unbalanced load m. The total system inertia is J and a drive torque T 
imparts an acceleration d2θ/dt2. The middle of the rotor is also subjected to a radial force F5, 
which is the bearing preload. The derivation uses the symbols of Figure 8.11.
All the torques and forces on the rotor must balance; consequently, the following condi­
tions must be satisfied. This will cause perturbations in the scan axis. Periodic compres­
sion and decompression of data will occur. If such a scanner is used to generate gray tone 
images, they will show lighter and darker waves normal to the raster lines.

The stability criterion is for the preload to be greater than the period eccentric forces. If it 
is assumed, according to Figure 8.11, that the eccentric mass represents the effect of the mir­

The most common mirror mounting technique is a mass balanced assembly with the reflect­
ing surface forward of the axis of rotation. Lateral mass balance is equally imperative.
Armature imbalance of resonant scanners causes wobble and excites the instruments’ 
chassis. Unacceptable audio coupling to the chassis can be minimized with massive con­
struction or soft mounting of the scanner. Both are costly and undesirable as compared to 
a properly balanced armature.
8.2.1.6.4  Mechanical Resonances
A perfectly balanced armature mirror assembly can still produce unacceptable oscillations. 
These are caused by the excitation of any possible natural frequency of one or more of the 
elements of the armature or occasionally the stator. These structures commonly have no 
damping and can be excited by a magnetic imbalance or external shocks and vibrations. 
Such oscillations are usually sensed by the control circuitry and amplified to cause system 
instabilities; it is necessary to design the armature so that its first resonance in any mode is 
substantially beyond the cutoff frequency of the amplifier or is properly damped.
This is the most common limiting factor to the speed of response of a small mirror gal­
vanometric scanner. Two familiar modes of oscillation are reviewed here.
Mirror on a limb. The mirror is overhung at the end of the shaft and behaves like a freely 
supported beam. With reference to Figure 8.12 it has a deflection angle θ expressed by

For a small mirror, the first cross-axis resonant frequency is the rotor resonance. This 
has been analyzed by Den Hartog.29 If the rotor can be represented by an iron cylinder, its 
resonance can be expressed by
	
w = 500 000

(8.25)
where ω is in radians per second, d is an approximate value of the diameter of the rotor, 
and b is its length between bearings, as shown in Figure 8.12 (d and b are both in inches 
here). Exciting this resonance will cause the mirror to wobble and/or render the servo 
unstable.
Torsional resonances. The rotor and mirror are two freely supported inertias connected by 
a shaft. The resonant frequency of such a system, with reference to Figure 8.13, is

This will cause perturbations in the scan axis. Periodic compression and decompression 
of data will occur. If such a scanner is used to generate gray tone images, they will show 
lighter and darker waves normal to the raster lines.
8.2.1.6.5  Armature Construction
The armature of galvanometric scanners is a mass-spring system. The scanner’s dynamic 
performance—step response—is limited by the first uncontrollable resonance. Most 
attempts for compensation beyond the first uncontrolled mechanical resonance have been 
so far mostly ineffective. The armature is made as rigid as possible and consequently exhib­
its very high Q resonances. These resonances are known to shift slightly with changes in 
temperature of the device or as a function of its mode of operation. This renders analog 
compensation extremely difficult and digital compensation is limited to slow operating 
systems. It is imperative to have very rigid constructions to minimize the number of pos­
sible resonances and raise all resonances preferably one order of magnitude beyond the 
desired system bandwidth.
Two armature architectures are commonly encountered and schematically exemplified 
in Figure 8.14a and 8.14b where the bearings are omitted. Both designs can have the same 
components but produce very different servo system responses.

Handbook of Optical and Laser Scanning
The construction of Figure 8.14a is more common as it is simpler to build. The mirror 
and the transducer are located at either end of the torque motor, beyond each bearing. 
Unfortunately, in order to satisfy the need for a high torque to inertia, the magnet is long 
and thin and adds one spring to the servo loop. This may also add a low cross resonance 
that may couple into the transducer signal. This may be inconsequential for a raster scan­
ning application operating at a single frequency where these resonances may be excluded 
from the drive signal.
The construction of Figure 8.14b offers a simpler servo system and consequently poten­
tially a better response, but it is more complex to assemble because one shaft carries both 
the transducer armature and the mirror. This construction offers an efficient mounting 
where the scanner is held near the mirror and also serves as an efficient heat sink. It may 
be noticed in Tables 8.1 and 8.2 that scanners that have adopted this architecture also claim 
better thermal stability.
8.2.1.6.6  Drive Signals
It is imperative that the frequency content of the drive signal and the magnetic forces is kept 
away from exciting secondary resonances of the armature. For example, when designing 
a vector scanning micromachining system with a 0.2 ms small step response, one would 
desirably see that all secondary mechanical resonances be beyond 50 kHz.
Using Equation 8.25 it can be shown that the resonance of a magnet 0.5 in in diameter 
and 2 in long, held on bearings at both ends, has a cross-axis resonance of about 10 kHz, 
which should be excluded from any drive signal.
Vector scanning. The shortest step response for a given excursion can be derived from 
the equation of motion of a second-order system under the assumption that current, volt­
age, resonances, and electrical time constants are negligible. This is an idealized model 
and should be used with that understanding. Experience tells us that small steps, 1°, can 
be expected to approximate these theoretical values. In most cases full torque is limited 
by the power supply and the driver and is delayed by the electrical time constant of the 
circuits and the torque motor. These limiting conditions are most experienced when large 
angular jumps are made.
Small angle stepping time can approximate the condition derived from Newton’s law 
and depicted in Figure 8.15a. The minimum stepping time is derived as follows:

In actual cases it is imperative that the drive signal excludes known resonances of the

sine wave joining the two endpoints of the scan angle. This is known as “cycloidal wave­
form” and minimizes high-frequency components.

Handbook of Optical and Laser Scanning
The acceleration capability of moving magnet torque motors is extremely high and in 
some condition may cause the ball in the bearings to slip rather than rotate. This may lead 
to rapid catastrophic failure. For this reason, it is advisable to consider a drive signal other 
than the maximum acceleration condition described above. As expressed above, this con­
dition can be very detrimental with a scanner operating at small amplitude, under 1 or 
2°, which does not allow proper ball lubrication and leads to a condition known as false 
brinelling. A flexure bearing suspension is recommended for these applications.
Raster scanning. The critical points to be attended to for raster scanning are scanner over­
heating and drive signal-induced vibrations as well as bearing damage as described in the 
above paragraph. A judicious drive signal design can avoid most of these difficulties.
Two types of raster modes are commonly used: saw tooth and triangular tooth signals.
Saw tooth drive signal. Saw tooth drive signal yields a simpler overall architecture but 
makes much more demands on the scanner in the turn-around critical points. The fastest 
possible fly back time can be derived from Equation 8.30 and is often referred to the “con­
stant acceleration” drive signal. Frequently, amplifier and power supply saturation as well 
as inductance and other phase delays will cause the turn-around time to be longer than 
calculated. Also, caution must be taken to avoid exciting on-axis or cross-axis resonances 
that may couple through the transducer and the drive amplifier with positive feedback. 
Cross-axis vibration can couple into the elements of the transducer to induce an errone­
ous output. If these resonances are known they should be excluded from the frequency 
spectrum of the drive signal. The most desirable fly back signal, and frequently the fastest, 
is shaped as a segment of a sine wave where both the start and ending of the sine wave 
segment match the slope of the linear part of the signal as described in Figure 8.15a.
The relevant parameters of a saw tooth drive is illustrated in Figure 8.15a. The linear 
segment of the signal has duration p and slope V. The efficiency η can be expressed as a 
function of the frequency f of the signal in Hz according to

(8.31)
The fly back signal is a sine wave in order to minimize the system’s bandwidth. The sine 
wave and the linear segment join at an equal slope at time T somewhat longer than one-
fourth period of the sinusoidal signal at time π/2. The angular position θ of the shaft is 
therefore expressed as

Triangular tooth scanning. Triangular tooth scanning normally yields a system running at 
more than twice the repetition rate with the same power consumption. The coding/decod­
ing software must take into consideration phase shifts and possible lack of symmetry or 
linearity of the position transducer. Again the turn-around signal should be structured to 
minimize power consumption, to limit heating and undesirable frequencies. Again, the 
preferred drive signal is a segment of sine wave that matches the slope of the linear portion 
of the signal as described in Figure 8.15b, yielding a more robust system than the “constant 
acceleration” signal. The analysis of this model given in Equations 8.38–8.41 can readily be 
adapted for saw tooth drive.
If p is the linear segment of the signal with slope V and the efficiency is the magnitude of 
the overshoot, a can be derived for a sinusoidal turn-around waveform signal as outlined 
below according to the symbols of Figure 8.15b.

8.2.1.7  Evaluation Parameters
The accompanying tables list only scanners built as inside–out d’Arsonval movements. 
These are moving magnet designs with a large air gap in the magnetic circuit. This archi­
tecture is preferred for optical scanners as it best meets the list of desirable features listed 
in Section 8.2.1.1. Earlier optical scanners were built with torque motors incorporating iron 
in the stator or with moving coil armatures. These devices are reported in Reference 1. To 
the knowledge of the author no advanced scanner has come from any further development 
of these two technologies.
As all these units are of similar torque motor design, the figure of merit of the torque 
motor reflects the coil copper packing density as well as its thermal conductivity. This fea­
ture may prompt the unit choice when the scanner is worked hard, such as in raster scan­
ning, or if thermal drift is a critical element.
The choice of position transducers, capacitive and optical, is normally guided by the 
tolerable error in repeatability dictated by the application as well as by the duty cycle 
of the application. A low duty cycle with high peak power demand shall not permit the 
transducer to reach a stable temperature and therefore the actual drift parameters may 
need to be verified experimentally in the application or the use of fiducial marks should 
be considered.
The dynamic performances listed are to be used as references only as different stan­
dards are used for the various parameters. Dynamic performances also depend on the 
armature construction, the load, the load attachment, as well as the sophistication of the 
driver amplifier and often also the drive signal that is used.

tia. All the data is derived from published material from the following manufacturers:

8.2.2  Resonant Scanners
The armatures of resonant scanners are low-mass, high-rigidity, and high-Q structures. 
Large excursion can be achieved with a low-torque simple drive motor. The major advan­
tage of the resonant scanner is its simplicity, small size, long life, and in particular its low 
cost. Its major disadvantage has been its sinusoidal motion, and sensitivity to external as 
well as self-induced perturbations. This deficiency corroborates the scarcity of low-fre­
quency resonant scanners. The induced moving coil of Figure 8.16 is an older but simple 
low-frequency design that is commercially available.
8.2.2.1  New Designs
Taking advantage of new materials, Dean Paulsen30–32 developed new concepts for the 
design of resonant scanners:
	
1.	The use of a high-energy permanent magnet, minimizing radial forces
	
2.	The location of anchor points at vibration nodes of the armature
	
3.	The use of highly lossy material, such as “Sorbutane” at the anchor points in order 
to damp out external as well as self-induced perturbations

8.2.2.2  Suspension
Figures 8.17 and 8.18 exemplify these concepts as counterrotating resonant systems. The 
anchor point or points are located at nodes of the resonant armature that do not experience 
any movement. This is analogous to holding a musical tuning fork at its base. No energy is 
lost. High-frequency devices can be built with one support. Low-frequency devices need 
two supports to be insensitive to orientation or external perturbation. One can also note in 
Figure 8.17 two orthogonal coils. One is the drive coil and the other the tachometer coil. As 
they are orthogonal, their fields do not interact, but each coil interacts with the permanent 
magnet of the armature.
Resonant scanners can also be built with cross-flexure suspensions. Dean Paulsen has 
also designed the ISX family of resonant scanner at General Scanning.33
Tunable resonant scanners have also been built. This author, in References 1 and 34, 
evaluates two designs. Low-frequency large-aperture resonant scanners are frequently 
built with cross-flexure suspensions. A common design can be found in Reference 1.
Table 8.5 presents performances of a number of commercial resonant scanners.
8.2.2.3  Induced Moving Coil
Two of the deficiencies of moving coil devices, lack of rigidity and moving electrical con­
nections, can be bypassed by having a single turn coil energized by induction.35,36 This

technology is applicable to resonant scanners. A resonant scanner implementation is illus­
trated in Figure 8.16. One of the most novel resonant low-inertia scanners to have been 
introduced is the balanced torsion bar design with an induction torque driver. The mirror 
is suspended by two torsion bars in a fully symmetrical arrangement designed to be mass 
balanced, so that accelerations along the three principal axes of translation will not cause 
torsional excitation of the mirror.
The drive coil and the armature are magnetically linked in a transformer-like fashion by 
a soft iron core. The armature is a single-turn, rectangular drive loop with an edge colin­
ear with the torsion current in the drive loop. This current interacts with the return path 
of the flux of a permanent magnet to create the drive torque:
	
T
ANIBlr
LR

(8.46)
where μ is the permeability of the iron core, A is the cross section of the iron core, N is the 
number of turns of the drive coils, I is the driver coil current amplitude, B is the field of 
the permanent magnet, l is the length of the drive loop in the magnetic field, r is the drive 
loop acting radius, L is the length of the iron core path, and R is the resistance of the drive 
loop. In this manner a moving coil driver is obtained without having to provide leads or 
brush contacts to the moving armature. The motion of the armature induces a voltage and 
current, which are sensed by a pick-off coil. The actual voltage measured is the sum of this 
induced voltage, which is proportional to velocity, and of the portion of the drive coil volt­
age induced by transformer couplings. It is expressed as:

where ω is the resonant frequency. The transformer coupling component is easily sub­
tracted electronically. This velocity sensor permits extremely good, simple, and external 
amplitude control with drift below 100 ppm/°C of the peak-to-peak excursion. The reso­
nant frequency is stable to ~160 ppm/°C. A derivation of Equations 8.46 and 8.47 can be 
found in the appendix of Chapter 5 of Marshall.1
8.3  SCANNING SYSTEMS
Scanning systems can be treated analytically, but they involve a number of disciplines, 
most of which are treated superficially in this chapter. In laser machining applications the 
system performance also frequently requires a good understanding of the interaction of 
the work and the wavelength, radiation duration, and power of the laser, as well as pos­
sible damage to the optical elements of the scanning system. A number of manufactur­
ers offer predesigned scanning packages also known as “scan heads.” These are typically 
two- or three-axis vector scanning systems that include all scanning functions less the 
laser and the work surface. One of the valuable aspects of these packages is the matched 
driver-amplifier matched to the inertia of the mirrors. This is frequently the most econom­
ical and expeditious manner to construct a vector scanning system such as used for micro­
machining. The goal of this section is to present the numerous available choices.
The scanning applications may be divided into two major classes: raster and vector 
scanning. The former frequently involves a galvanometric scanner or a resonant scanner 
sweeping the fast axis and a stepper motor driving the slow axis—frequently moving the 
workpiece as this minimizes the size of the lens of a pre-objective scanner configuration. 
The latter demands that both axes have preferably identical dynamic behavior and is cov­
ered in Section 8.3.2. The former is exemplified in Section 8.5.2, “Microscopy”, which looks 
at three raster optical scanning architectures, fixed objective, pre-objective scanning, and 
flying objective scanning.
8.3.1  Scanning Architectures
Scanning systems can be split into two categories, namely the beam moving category and 
the moving objective lens category. The two are interdependent but can be described sep­
arately. First we will explore the fixed objectives choices.
8.3.1.1  Post-objective Scanning
In this configuration the scanners are located between the objective and the work. This 
demands an objective with a long focal length to accommodate the scanning mirrors; 
the focal point will approximately paint a sphere. If the work area is flat, this restricts 
the scan to a small angle where the depth of field can approximately intersect a plane. If 
large angular excursions are required, the objective lens is normally translated on a linear 
stage to accommodate the need. The bandwidth of the translation mechanism needs to be 
twice that of the fastest scanner, but less accurate position control is required. A galvanom­
eter is frequently the best choice to drive the translation stage37 and a number of scanner 
manufacturers offer such an assembly.
When used in microscopy with comparatively fast optics, this arrangement operates at 
small angles and consequently cosine fourth law aberrations26 are negligible. Also this 

Galvanometric and Resonant Scanners 
431
construction benefits for a comparatively small and low-cost objective where chromatic 
aberrations can be minimized.
This configuration is best applicable to long focal length objectives such as found in laser 
radars, range finders, and designators.
8.3.1.2  Pre-objective Scanning
This architecture locates the objective lens between the scanners and the work. It is the 
most common choice for laser micromachining as it permits a comparatively small spot 
size with high energy density. It is also the primary choice for conventional laser scan­
ning confocal microscopes and Section 8.5.2.2 depicts the original design of Minsky.38 The 
Handbook of Biological Confocal Microscopy39 carries numerous examples of this concept.
A number of lens manufacturers offer off-the-shelf lenses for this application configured 
for YAG or CO2 lasers. Multiple wavelength telecentric field-flattening objectives of this 
type, capable of yielding a diffraction limited small spot focus, are frequently the most 
expensive component of the entire scanning system, including the laser.
All the beam steering systems described in Section 8.3.2 are suitable for use as pre-
objective systems.
8.3.1.3  Flying Objective Scanning
This scanning architecture demands that the work be moved in one axis while the beam 
is moved in the other axis. It is extremely advantageous for microscope raster scanning 
and is the preferred choice for biochip scanners as described in Section 8.5.2.3. It is also 
used for random axis scanning in the semiconductor industry for DRAM repairs. It offers 
a very low-cost system with multiple wavelength telecentric flat-field, diffraction limited 
small spot performance.
8.3.2  Two-Axis Beam Steering Systems
Oscillatory scanners are best suited for large excursion systems, over a few hundredths 
of a radian. Single-mirror or small motion two-axis beam steering (TABS) systems have 
been hotly pursued for SDI applications, and the SPIE Proceedings, Vol. 1543 as well as the 
IR/EO Handbook40 examine a number of them. Conventional gimbal systems, where the 
torque motor for the second axis is transported on the structure mounted on the first axis 
are reviewed in Section 8.5.2.
Sections 8.3.2.1 through 8.3.2.6 illustrate some of the most common architectures of two-
dimensional scanning systems. They fall into two major classes: vector scanning and ras­
ter scanning. Vector scanning applications require that both axes have equal properties 
and normally they have two galvanometric scanners. Raster systems frequently have a 
more diversified architecture. Some use a polygon or resonant scanner for the fast or ras­
ter scan and a galvanometer, motor, or a linear transport for the other motion. The LR/EO 
Handbook40 describes a number of such systems.
8.3.2.1  Single-Mirror TABS
The device symbolically described in Figure 8.19 is capable of 1 rad motion in both axis. 
The drivers and encoders for both axes are stationary. The torque capabilities, range, and 
angular resolution are dissociated from the inertial load. The optical system behaves like a 

432 
Handbook of Optical and Laser Scanning
true point source with double pincushion distortions. The central block is on the origin of 
all three coordinates. The floating “L” bracket is necessary to prevent bearing lock.
8.3.2.2  Relay Lens TABS
This construction guarantees that both mirrors and scanners have equal performances. It 
is penalized by the added two optical elements with their associated cost and/or distor­
tions. The distortions are again in the familiar pincushion pattern and can be compen­
sated for in the design of the objective lens or the computer program. Transmission optics 
are frequently used, but when chromatic aberrations are critical, reflective optical elements 
are preferred, as shown in Figure 8.20. It should be noted that the two axes need not be 
perpendicular.
8.3.2.3  Classic Two-Mirror Construction
Figure 8.21 is a generic model of this construction and is used to derive image distortions 
and focus variations. In this configuration the two mirrors have different inertia. In order 
to minimize their difference, the X galvanometer can be mounted at 15–20° from its per­
pendicular axis. This allows a closer packing construction and a smaller Y mirror. The 
incoming beam must be parallel to the axis of the Y scanner.
In this configuration, a is the center of the X mirror, b is the center of the Y mirror, and 
c is the point at coordinates (0, Yi); d is the length from b to (0, 0) and e is the length from a 
to b. The optical scanner angles are θx and θy and the coordinate (Xi, Yi) is any point on the 
target field. It can be seen that when Xi = Yi = 0, then θx = θy = 0. The equation that relates 
Yi to θy is derived from the triangle of points (0, 0), (0, Yi), and d. Solving for the length (0, 0) 
to (0, Yi), which equals Yi we obtain

The determination of the X equation is somewhat more complex and is best illustrated by 
projecting the target image onto the virtual image position of the Y mirror, as shown by 
the phantom lines and phantom coordinates (0, Yi), (Xi, Yi), and a in Figure 8.21. By solving 
the triangle of points a, (0, Yi), (Xi, Yi), for the length (0, 0) to (0, Yi), which equals Xi, we have

8.3.2.4  Paddle Scanner Two-Mirror Configuration
In applications that need large excursion angles, high speed, and high precision, the sin­
gle-mirror two-dimension scanner techniques described above exhibit handicaps. Paddle 
scanners are of great interest because they simulate a two-dimensional fulcrum. Figure 8.22 
gives a symbolic representation.
FIGURE 8.22
Paddle scanner configuration.

Galvanometric and Resonant Scanners 
435
The inertia of the paddle is greater than the inertia of the other mirror. This configu­
ration adapts well to raster scanning. The second scanner can be either a resonant scan­
ner with sinusoidal, triangular, or saw tooth motion, or a rotating polygon. It should be 
remembered that at all high angular speeds, the loads should be statically and dynami­
cally balanced in all axes.
The first mirror is mounted on a paddle-like arm and intersects the incoming beam at 
45°. The mirror rotation, the size of the beam, and other geometric constraints determine 
the magnitude of this motion. The magnitude of lateral motion of the reflected beam at its 
pupil is small and is analyzed in Figure 8.23.
Note that the axis of rotation of the X scanner, the frame scanner, is within the plane of 
the mirror. In the drawing, the rest position of mirror OM is at 45° of the incoming beam. 
Radius ON is normal to incoming beam AN. Figure 8.23 also shows mirror OM rotated by 
an angle α and the reflected beam OM′ is rotated by the angle 2α to line Aa. Lines OB and 
OD are normal to the reflected beams at the two positions of the mirror. It is evident that 
point B is on the circle of radius ON. We shall show that point D is also on that circle.
From the above we can write:

As angle NAD = NAO + OAD = 2NAO, we can conclude that angles NAO = OAD. The two 
rectangular triangles ONA and ODA have three equal angles and one common side, there­
fore they are equal and segments ON = OD and point D is on the circle centered at O and 
passing through point N and B.
It is therefore possible to derive the amount of translation the beam has on mirror Y as 
mirror X rotates. It is represented by the segment BC. Considering the triangle OCD, we 
can write

It should be noted that the cosine does not change sign when the angle does and that d is 
always positive.
For an optical system where the distance between the mirrors is 10 mm and the angle of 
rotation of the frame mirror on the Y scanner is ±0.15 rad, the beam walk d on the Y mirror 
is 0.33 mm.
8.3.2.5  Golf Club Two-Mirror Configuration
The diagram of a two-dimensional scanner known as a golf club scanner in Figure 8.24 has 
similar features to the paddle scanner. The inertia of the page mirror and its mount is typi­
cally double that of an equivalent paddle for the same mirror distance. Since some rotation 
and geometric constraints make this geometry desirable, it is reviewed here.
The defining feature of this arrangement can be seen in Figure 8.24. In a raster scan 
application, the beam strikes the frame mirror first, the Y-axis, which is held at 45° from the 
incoming beam. This mirror is mounted on an arm whose axis of rotation intersects and is 
normal to the reflected beam at the rest position. The axis of rotation of the second mirror 
(the X mirror with reference to Figure 8.25) is in the plane formed by these two lines. It is 

Galvanometric and Resonant Scanners 
437
located approximately halfway between the point of incidence of the beam on the Y mirror 
at rest and its axis of rotation.
We shall show now that as the Y mirror oscillates, the reflected beam passes through the 
pupil location X in Figure 8.25. We shall also derive the magnitude of “walk” st of the beam 
on the X mirror as a fraction of the radius of rotation P1Y = r of the Y mirror.

8.3.2.6  TABS with Three Moving Optical Elements
The dominant feature of the design in Figure 8.26 is the emulation of a perfect fulcrum with 
both axes having approximately the same dynamic capability. The “conditioner” scanner 
carries a glass wedge and is synchronized to the Y scanner. It translates the incoming 
beam onto the Y mirror so that the reflected beam always strikes the X mirror in its center. 
Despite the added cost, this is the preferred design for achieving high speed with large-
beam wide-angle vector scanners, especially when focusing optics are needed. The details 
of this design can be found in Goodman, U.S. patent no. 4,685,775.
8.4  DRIVER AMPLIFIER
High-performance servo amplifiers for galvanometric or resonant scanners are very spe­
cial products. They are critical to extract the performance of the galvanometer. They are 
as critical a system component as the galvanometer or the resonant scanner themselves. 
Commercial drivers are offered by scanner manufacturers and quoted performances are 
normally guaranteed only when the associated driver is used.
The design of these amplifiers is beyond the scope of this chapter. The list of elements 
to be addressed is also beyond the scope of this chapter and this author strongly suggests 
that anyone considering such a task should first refer to Reference 41, where the param­
eters that need to be addressed to design a high-performance analog servo amplifier are 
reviewed.

Handbook of Optical and Laser Scanning
At this time, all commercial galvanometer driver amplifiers are analog systems. Digital 
servos are commercially available to drive servo motor-based systems. The numerous 
attempts to design a high-performance digital equivalent have failed to meet the com­
parable bandwidth resolution product demanded by optical galvanometer scanners. The 
potential benefit of a full digital system continues to tempt and elude designers. Hope 
springs eternal.
Two critical features of these servo amplifiers are:
	
1.	Low noise. It is common to demand system resolution of 1 part in 100,000. 
Consequently each component in the system needs to perform five or ten times 
better. The design of analog circuitry of that quality is an art in itself.
	
2.	Frequency response compensation/filtering for the galvanometer/mirror resonances.
8.5  SCANNING APPLICATIONS
The earlier edition of this text2 carries numerous examples of applications that have shaped 
the development and performance of optical scanners, both galvanometric and resonant. 
Here are two categories that have seen vigorous development in the past decade. These are 
laser micromachining and confocal microscopy.
8.5.1  Material Processing
The market for laser-based material processing has grown enormously in the last decade 
and has segmented itself. This is the result of a number of factors:
	
1.	New high-tech applications with no practical alternative solutions
	
2.	Penetration into the commercial market, pencils, and kitchenware
	
3.	Reliable lasers with a choice of wavelengths and sufficient power
	
4.	Scanners with sufficient precision
	
5.	Software packages complete with a powerful low-cost PC
The general system architecture has not changed appreciably. Single lasers, multiple heads, 
and fiber optic laser light distribution are more common. In general, the market is divided 
into marking and micromachining.
In the laser-marking field, the CO2 laser dominates and as the need to ensure good mark­
ing visibility suggests large spot size and consequently small scanning mirrors as beam 
diameters between 10 and 20 mm cover most applications. High scanner speed is desir­
able to produce high throughput. Since the industrial waveguide laser was developed in 
the early 1980s—10–50 W originally, and now as much as 200 W—its low cost and reliable 
design have stimulated this segment of the industry.
The CO2 laser is also the preferred choice to mark packages on the fly or erode plastic 
packages to indicate and facilitate opening.
The YAG laser competes in marking applications for plastics, glasses, and paints that 
incorporate titanium oxide powder. This chemical exhibits very visible and permanent color 
changes when exposed to 1.06 nm wavelengths. It is frequently used for kitchenware.

Galvanometric and Resonant Scanners 
441
The micromachining segment of the industry addresses a variety of applications where 
different technologies compete. Scanning systems dominate applications where large areas 
of precisely located features need to be created or where a threshold of power/energy is 
required. Materials such as metals, polymers, and ceramics are commonly machined in 
this manner. Typical applications are:
	
Nozzles for ink jet printing: 1- or 2-micron feature tolerances with submicron posi­
tioning and concentricity are required.
	
Screens/sieves/membranes for filtering inks, biomedical fluids, gas separation, 
and so on. It is common to punch thousands of holes 15 microns in diameter, 
20 micron on center, in 10-micron Kapton sheets for such applications.
	
Via drilling for printed circuit boards or microchip modules or green ceramic.
	
Probe cards for circuit autotesters may have 2000 to 3000 contact wires piercing a 
2-in-square support.
In order to reach industrial applications, lasers need to be reliable and easy to main­
tain. A number of technologies have reached this stage. High-power diode pumped YAG 
lasers are now available at the following wavelengths: 1060, 532, 473, and 351 nm. The 
shorter wavelengths, pulsed or CW, compete efficiently with Excimer lasers for most poly­
mer or organic micromachining applications and are also used to stimulate optochemical 
reactions.
8.5.2  Microscopy
In the last decade scanners have participated in the expansion of microscopy. First came 
confocal microscopy and more recently large field-of-view microscopy. In these applica­
tions, images are assembled on a computer.
The development of confocal microscopy in the early 1950s by Marvin Minsky38 has 
opened an array of applications for scanners. In this concept, the image of the work is 
constructed from single pixels acquired sequentially. This minimizes the demand on the 
optical design and offers major imaging benefits. Among these are sectioning capability, 
akin to tomography and the direct digitization of the image. In his original design, Minsky 
moved the work on a motorized XY stage under a conventional microscope. His invention 
gave images with greater resolution than had been available before, but the images were 
composed on a computer monitor and a number of decades had to pass before the tech­
nique was accepted.
Confocal microscopes are now commonly used either to improve resolution or to cap­
ture a large field in a single file without stitching a number of small fields of view. Scanners 
are most frequently incorporated in both classes of instruments. For simplicity, this review 
will address only the large field-of-view (centimeters square) model, as they encompass 
concepts found in all designs used to image arrays of biological material.
Arrays of biological material consist of large number of features such as dots or squares 
bonded to a glass substrate and labeled with fluorescent molecules. The role of imaging 
systems is to view the entire array in a single image and present it for analysis to a special­
ized software program. High-density arrays may carry as many as one million separate 
10 microns square. Low-density arrays have 400 spots per square centimeter; here each 
spot may be 150 micron in diameter, placed on a 200–300-micron grid. Large arrays are 
typically 22 × 66 mm square. Three basic technologies are used to expand the reach of 

442

conventional confocal fluorescent microscopes to meet the needs of biochip imaging and 
in all cases galvanometer scanners are the preferred actuator.

The target typically measures 1–2 cm square and the resolution needs to be between 
2 and 10 microns. Fluorescence is an extremely inefficient phenomenon, so the image 
quality is extremely dependent upon the energy collection capability of the instru­
ment. All of these instruments are epifluorescent pseudoconfocal laser scanning 
microscopes.
8.5.2.1  Pre-objective Scanning
Conventional laser scanning epifluorescent microscopes are thoroughly described in 
the Handbook of Confocal Microscopy39 and have been commercially available for the past 
25 years. Zeiss, Nikon, BioRad, and Olympus are common names in that field. They are 
all built from conventional microscope objectives. Because fluorescence is a very low-
energy phenomenon, a high numerical aperture is preferable. This yields a very small 
field of view, well under 1 mm square, so that multiple images are required to cover 
the large field of view associated with microarrays. By limiting the spectral range to 
1 or 2 wavelengths and accepting a lower NA, it is possible to design, on this model, an 
instrument with a larger field of view (up to 10 mm). The Avalanche from Molecular 
Dynamics/Amersham, symbolically depicted in Figure 8.27, is a scanner of this con­
struction. It has a nine-element objective designed for a 10-mm field of view with a com­
paratively low NA, approximately 0.25. A similar instrument made by Agilent (formerly 
HP) has a 15-mm wide field of view. In order to make best use of the lens, the biochip 
or the microscope slide is translated under the objective and the beam scanned on the 
other coordinate.

8.5.2.2  The Marvin Minsky Confocal Microscope
The Minsky design shown in Figure 8.28 can be built with a commercial microscope objec­
tive. The working clearance of high-power objectives is quite small and the slide needs to 
be held reliably to avoid catastrophic interference in a dynamic environment. The slide is 
mounted on a motorized XY stage. An optical scanner is preferably used to drive the high­
speed scan stage as it outperforms a DC motor. The slide anchor mechanism must also be 
light enough to permit a reasonable scan rate without excessive vibration.
8.5.2.3  Flying Objective Scanning Microscope
The flying objective architecture transposes the difficult requirements posed in designing 
a large flat field-of-view lens by replacing it with a relatively simple objective lens, which 
is moved across the sample area. In other words, instead of moving the slide and its hold­
ing device in the fast axis, the beam of light is moved instead. This approach requires that 
good mechanical alignment be maintained throughout the entire range of motion, and 
carries the additional benefit from the use of a much larger numerical aperture objective 
lens. It also offers a high degree of measurement uniformity across the field of view as all 
pixels are acquired in an identical manner so that field flatness is not a problem.
Two basic designs are used: one design oscillates an objective lens mounted on a lin­
ear rail, and the other design oscillates an objective lens mounted at the end of a rotating 
arm.
8.5.2.4  Rectilinear Flying Objective Microscope
Hueton42 describes this architecture. As shown in Figure 8.29, the objective is translated 
on a linear stage and it is optically “tromboned” to the stationary optical elements. The 
objective can be driven by a linear motor, a voice coil, a stepper motor, but again, optical 
scanners offer the fastest drive mechanism. The scanning system offered by the Virtek 
Instrument oscillates a lens using a scanner to drive a stage in a similar construction.

8.5.2.5  Rotary Flying Objective Microscope
An alternative method to create a rapidly scanning beam of light is the rotary architecture 
described by Overbeck and shown in Figure 8.30.46 It offers both speed and a constant 
optical path length. A periscope couples the scanning objective to the stationary elements 
of the microscope and thus keeps the light path length constant as it oscillates to scan the 
light beam. As the arc covering the width of the slide is in polar coordinates, the resultant 
image is instantly converted to Cartesian coordinates by the instrument’s computer, so 
the image is then directly correlated with the sample spot pattern. A micro, aspheric, one-
element lens is carried on a counterbalanced arm that extends perpendicular to the shaft 
of an optical scanner. The arm also carries mirrors that receive laser light on the axis of 
rotation via a periscope, send it out the length of the arm, and down through the lens. The 
optical axis is always normal to the biochip.

8.6  CONCLUSIONS
This chapter has described the current state of the art of optical scanning galvanometers as 
well as recent development of resonant scanners. These devices have developed over the 
past 40 years as part of the general electro-optic revolution.
All components of the electro-optic industry have witnessed a drastic price reduction in 
conjunction with a dramatic increase in demand. Galvanometric and resonant scanners 
may be a rare exception to that pattern of evolution. Prices have grown with demand.
The elements used to construct these oscillating devices are the same as those found in 
the head movers of every computer hard drive or in CD players or high-quality motors 
that can be purchased for a few hundred dollars.
High-volume applications have stimulated the development of other technologies: rotat­
ing polygones, MEMS, LIC scanners, and so on.
Presently the total worldwide annual sales of oscillating scanners lies between $20 mil­
lion and $30 million with an additional $15 million to $20 million of annual sales of subsys­
tems integrating scanners with their driver amplifiers and some optical elements.

GLOSSARY
This short list of definitions is offered so that it may help the reader. It is a subset of termi­
nology recorded by Alan Ludwiszewski,43 and is commonly accepted in this industry.
Accuracy: The maximum expected difference between the actual and commanded posi­
tion. This includes any nonlinearities, hysteresis, noise, encountered drifts, reso­
lution, and other factors.
Bandwidth: The maximum frequency for which a system can track a sinusoidal input 
with an output attenuated to no less than 0.7 (−3 dB point) of the command. For 
open loop frequency responses with a phase margin of 90°, the open loop cross­
over frequency will equal the closed loop bandwidth. For other phase margins the

relationship is not as straightforward. A complete treatment of these relationships 
can be found in any control theory text.
Drift, Mechanical Null: The drift of the steady-state position of an unpowered scanner 
when the armature is restrained with a torsion bar. This drift can occur with time 
and with temperature. Drift is usually specified in terms of the change in optical 
angle per amount of correlated influence, such as time or temperature.
Drift, Position Detector: The change in relationship between the output of the position 
detector and the position of the output shaft. It consists of the sum of the gain drift, 
null drift, and others.
Drift, Position Detector Gain: The change in scale factor of the position detector. Since the 
absolute magnitude of this change is dependent upon angle, it is specified in terms 
of the ratio of the change in output over the output per unit time or temperature 
(that is, ppm/°C or %/1000 h). This takes into account that the effect is seen most 
at extreme angles where the output is greatest.
Drift, Position Detector Null: The drift of the electrical zero of the position detector with 
time and temperature. Drift that occurs with temperature change is specified in 
units of angle per degree temperature (that is, µrad/°C). Drift that occurs with 
time is specified in units of angle per units of time (that is, µrad/1000 h).
Drift, Uncorrelated: Drift that cannot be attributed to a change in a particular external 
condition, such as time or temperature. Often caused by mechanical ratchetting or 
noncatastrophic damage to the system due to overstress.
Jitter: Nonrepeatable position error fluctuations caused by velocity perturbation in a scan­
ner. Generally described in units of optical scan angle and often expressed as the 
standard deviation of the maximum jitter error observed in each scan line of a 
large number of consecutive scans. Some applications may require specification of 
the frequency as well as the magnitude of acceptable jitter.
Nonlinearity, Best Fit Straight Line: This method of quantifying nonlinearity involves 
finding a first-order linear function that is the closest approximation to the mea­
sured data. The nonlinearity is then calculated as the maximum observed devia­
tion from this line. This will result in the smallest measurement of nonlinearity.
Nonlinearity, Pinned Center: Pinned center nonlinearity uses a straight line that inter­
sects a given datum point, such as the mechanical or electrical null of a scanner, 
and has a slope that best approximates that of the measured data. Sensor nonline­
arity is then calculated from this reference.
Null, Electrical: The zero output point of the position transducer.
Null, Mechanical: The steady-state position of an unpowered scanner. This position is 
determined by the torsion spring, if any, and the magnetic spring of the scan­
ner. In many scanners without a torsion spring, the magnetic spring is not of 
great enough magnitude to overcome frictional forces and make this an absolute 
position.
Repeatability: The inaccuracies in final position encountered while implementing a series 
of identical command inputs.
Repeatability, Bidirectional: The inaccuracies in final position encountered while attempt­
ing to return to a position from different directions.
Resolution: Resolution is the ability to discern individual spots in the target field. This 
is not to be confused with accuracy, which includes gain and offset drift, noise, 
resolution, and other factors. Dependent upon system design, the limit to resolu­
tion may be due to optical considerations, digital resolution, or position detector 
signal-to-noise ratio and drift.

Galvanometric and Resonant Scanners

Resolution, Optical: The optical resolution of a scanning system can be described as the 
number of separately resolvable spots that can be produced. For diffraction limited 
optics, this is dependent upon the aperture width in the scan direction, the aperture 
shape factor, the wavelength of the source, and the total scan angle. These factors are 
related through the scan equation, which can be found in many optical texts.
Resolution, Scanner: Scanner resolution is limited by the noise and drift of the position 
detector. The RMS signal-to-noise ratio will determine the statistical resolvability 
of a given level of command in a given frequency range. Filtering can improve 
low-frequency resolution, but drift factor will also come into effect.
Resonance, Cross Axis: Structural resonances that cause motion perpendicular to the 
scan axis are referred to as cross-axis resonances. These resonances may be accen­
tuated by poor mirror design and will cause periodic wobble, possible system 
instabilities, and may be a limit to achievable system bandwidth.
Ideal distribution of pixels along a scan line
Jitter
Distribution of pixels with jitter error
Jitter: Error from average pixel position, measured in the scan direction
Wobble
Distribution of pixels with wobble error
Wobble: Error from average pixel position, lmeasured in a direction 
                perpendicular to the scan direction
Resonance, Torsional: An on-axis resonance that appears in scanners due to the distrib­
uted masses on a compliant rotor shaft the flexible coil of a d’Arsonval system. 
These resonances can appear as periodic jitter and may cause controllability diffi­
culties due to the resonant peak created in the scanners’ transfer function. Mirror 
design and mounting will have a significant effect on torsional resonance.
Response Time: The response time of a scanning system is defined as the tracking error 
divided by slew rate. Owing to the characteristics of the controller, stage satura­
tion, aerodynamics, and other nonlinearities, response time will not necessarily 
be a constant. Although not a constant, at least for vector tuned controllers it is 
approximately so, if slew rates are neither driving the tracking error to near zero 
nor approaching the maximum slew rate. Response time is an indication of the 
relative speed of a scanner and the ultimate performance obtainable with a given 
load and tuning.

9.1  INTRODUCTION
The memory is the knapsack of the mind. When setting out on a journey, particularly one 
that promises to be long and challenging, it is better to fill it with maps and recipes, fish­
hooks and twine, matches and a few candles rather than tinned goods. These things are 
more useful, and are sure to last far longer. For those of you who cannot resist the quick 
fix, we hope that there are a few chocolate bars scattered about as well.
Flexures are quite ancient, and their use as pivots is also ancient. Long before the use of 
the most primitive bearings, leather strap flexures were used as trunk lid hinges and the 
like. Early war engines, for example the ballista of the Romans, the limbs of technically 
advanced hand bows, such as those attributed to the Turks, and the crossbows of the 14th 
century all employ flexures as their enabling technology.
Many pendulum clocks suspend their pendula by means of a flexure. The mechanical 
metronome, a specialized inverted form of clock, relies heavily on the flexure suspension 
in its design. It is at least arguable that the tuning fork is a pair of coupled flexures, and the 
music box comb is a set of flexures tuned to self-resonate at desirable frequencies.
All of these examples, and of course there are many others, exploit the flexure pivot 
because of its simplicity, reliability, lack of internal clearance, long service life, ease of 
construction, and often, its high mechanical “Q.” The flexure pivots used in scientific 
instruments, including optical and laser scanning equipment, exploit these very same 
attributes.
Given the great attention devoted to flexure pivots during the 1960s and 1970s as a result 
of the need for rugged, reliable, light-weight, unlubricated pivots and bearings for space 
exploration applications, and the fact that the best and brightest were naturally attracted to 
what was undoubtedly the biggest science of its time, so much progress was made in flexure 
pivots and suspensions that one might be tempted, like Charles H. Duell, Commissioner of 
U.S. Office of Patents, who urged President William McKinley to abolish his office in 1899, 
to conclude that everything useful had already been invented.
However, as the second section of this chapter suggests, flexure technology may yet again 
provide one of the enabling elements in mankind’s next leap of technological advance­
ment, universal connectivity by means of light. Of course, like the flexure itself, this is an 
old idea, widely practised on a small scale for many centuries. The Romans communicated 
between the watch towers along the borders of their far-flung empire in this way, and the 
indigenous people of North and South America did so as well.
The organization and content of this chapter are intended to reflect the contrast between 
the rather settled state of macroscale flexure pivots, and the as yet entirely unexplored

space of the microelectromechanical flexure scanners (MEMS) flexure pivot. In the case of 
the former, the primary author has chosen to dwell largely on the details of manufactura­
bility, which are the fruit gained from many years spent extracting the stones from the fer­
tile soil of the garden of flexures—the practicum, as it were, of the craft. This is the sort of 
information that is not generally gained through textbooks, and, in the end, differentiates 
a possible mechanism from a practicable, not to say elegant one. In the case of the latter, 
the primary author has endeavored to present the theoretical underpinnings of integrated 
benders, as well as the fabrication and characterization of high-speed, large-angle optical 
scanners constructed with them.
9.1.1  Introduction to Macroscale Flexure Pivots
First, let us begin by defining what we shall mean by the term “pivot.”* We must begin by 
modifying the term “pin,” because flexure pivots sometimes have virtual pins or axles. 
A good working definition of pivot in this context might be “A device which defines a vir­
tual axis of rotation, over a limited angle, while fixing the other five degrees of freedom. 
A device which is able to resist moments except in one axis of rotation, and may be able 
to resist relatively small moments in that as well.” In general, these pivots are of interest 
in instrument quality or scientific applications, as opposed to things like lorry fifth wheel 
applications, where they would work, but would have no particular advantages over the 
more common commodity sorts of bearings, such as sleeve, ball, roller, and the like.
What then are the attributes that equip flexure pivots for instrument and scientific appli­
cations? In no particular order, they are:
	
1.	Low mass
	
2.	Zero clearance
	
3.	Intrinsic restoring force
	
4.	Infinite life
	
5.	No lubrication
	
6.	Low hysteresis
	
7.	No viscous losses
	
8.	No friction (at least none in the usual sense)
	
9.	No pariculate generation
	 10.	No outgassing
	 11.	No intrinsic temperature limit
	 12.	Extremely high load capability
	 13.	Extremely high force linearity over small angles
	 14.	Flexibility in design configuration, in the sense that the pivot members may be 
pierced to permit transparency, or even to permit the passage of solid mechanical 
parts or objects (in contrast with conventional bearings, which are pretty much 
impenetrable three-dimensional solids)
	 15.	Low design and tooling cost
	 16.	Very low part cost

	 18.	The ability to withstand high shock and vibration loading
	 19.	Short lead time
	 20.	Others for very specific applications
The choice of material for a flexure is driven by conflicting requirements. For example, it 
is often the case that the precision of location of the pivot point is secondary to some other 
requirement, such as long life, low operating force, or high strength, or all the above. It 
may be that linearity of operating force over the desired angle of motion is also unimpor­
tant. There are often operating environment considerations. It may be that easy replace­
ment of a damaged pivot is required. The choice of leather for trunk lid flexures results 
from meeting requirements such as these.
On the other hand, the designer of a bow limb has the opposite requirement that the 
operating force be large. Because, however, he must deal with stresses in one direction 
only, unlike the trunk lid flexure designer, he will exploit that difference to his advantage, 
and construct a flexure that is a composite. The front or tension side of his limb will be 
constructed from horn, which is quiet stiff in tension, while the belly, or compression side, 
will be constructed of sinew, which is stiff in compression. He will rightly conclude that 
the respective stresses in this structure are controlled by their separation from the neutral 
plane, and will provide a “filler” of wood properly shaped to maximize the stresses in the 
working “skins” of his bow without precipitating failure.
This pair of examples is designed to illustrate the broad range of potential applications 
of flexure pivots, and in particular the degree to which clever design is able to cope with 
many-order-of-magnitude differences in an application-specific parameter. Leather is able 
to store only a few tenths of a Joule per kilogram, whereas the best Turkish bows store over 
750 Joules per kilogram, eclipsing steel and rivalling the best of the modern composites. 
The attribute of energy storage, related to the density, strength, and Young’s modulus of 
the materials, may be of critical importance, required to be very high or very low, or of no 
importance at all in a particular application.
The absence of mechanical noise is a benefit of flexure pivots as well. Flexures are inher­
ently low-noise pivots. Because they have no loose parts, it is unnecessary to preload them 
to remove clearances. As they are monolithic structures, they display very little “noise” in 
their force versus displacement curves. Other pivot types, comprised as they are of loose 
parts, make some mechanical noise during operation, and as they wear and the clear­
ances increase, the noise level rises. Any particulates released during the wear process, of 
course, can cause sudden changes in the position and parasitic torque of the pivot, as well 
as mechanical noise, if they jam between the moving parts. Bearing “rumble” is widely 
recognized and even quantified as an inherent characteristic of ball bearings. In many 
cases, the presence of this bearing noise places an upper limit on the allowable noise band­
width of any servo system associated with the pivot.
The possibility of a pivot design with inherently low mechanical loss is an area where 
flexure pivots shine. All other types of pivots known are lossy. Losses resulting from lubri­
cant viscous friction and ball and race deformation energy not only place upper limits 
on the speeds at which these devices can operate, but also consume energy, limiting the 
mechanical efficiency of all known moving-element bearings to a low value.
Flexures, on the other hand, have no lubrication requirement, and are limited only 
by the internal energy of deformation. Mechanical “Q” approaching 3000 is regularly 
achieved, even in very high speed designs. This attribute of flexures makes possible 

Flexural Pivots for Oscillatory Scanners

resonant scanners operating above 10 kHz at very low power levels. Of course, the absence 
of lubrication is itself a benefit in applications in optical instrumentation, spectroscopy, 
space research, medicine, and semiconductor processing, where even minute contamina­
tion levels are an issue.
Flexures work extremely well for small-angle applications, where stiction, traction, surface 
finish limitations, mechanical tolerances, lubrication distribution requirements, and so forth 
put demands on other pivot types which they cannot meet successfully. Flexures are, of 
course, free of any looseness or play, so there is no “backlash” whatsoever associated with 
their use; moreover, because they rely on molecular stretching, their intrinsic hysteresis over 
small angles near the neutral position is always less than the unbalanced forces resulting 
from unavoidable asymmetries in their mountings (which produce some hysteresis in real­
izable designs; hysteresis levels of less than 0.1% are difficult to achieve, but possible). On the 
other hand, unlike other pivot types, flexures are not capable of continuous rotation. While 
several hundred degrees of rotation seem plausible, the authors know of no application of 
flexure pivots designed to operate over 90°, and most designs are for much smaller angles.
Other precision pivot types, such as ball bearings and jewel (“watch”) bearings are lim­
ited in their geometrical precision by the limits of accuracy that their respective manu­
facturing processes impose on them. For example, the best class of bearing balls, class 3, 
has an allowed out-of-roundness of 3 × 10−6 in. If averaged in a bearing with nine balls, 
the best error in “wobble” of the whole assembly will be about 9 × 10−2 less, or about 1 
µin. If two such bearings 1 in apart support an axle, then the axle will have a wobble of 
about 2 µrad, not including errors in the concentricity of the bearing rings, axle to ring 
mounting, and so on. This kind of error in pivots, that is, error that is associated with geo­
metrical features on the parts, tends to be coherent with the motion of the pivot, and so 
is periodic. As a result, these errors give rise, in raster scanning systems in particular, to 
undesirable moiré patterns. Moirés are vastly more noticeable by human observers than 
are nonperiodic or random errors, and can sometimes lead to rejection of a scanner that 
actually meets its design requirements for wobble. This effect is particularly noticeable 
in systems designed for printing applications, where the eye is sensitive to moirés gener­
ated by periodic angular errors in the 1/10 µrad range. Flexure pivots have none of these 
sources of error. Production printing engines using flexure scanners in a raster mode built 
at the authors’ factory regularly achieve a level of periodic error below 1/10 µrad, and were 
developed specifically to solve the moiré problem.
There is a tendency for conventional pivot bearings to become more fragile as the level 
of precision required of them is increased. This is not surprising, because the accuracy of 
the pivot is established by careful dimensional and geometrical control of several loose 
parts. The single 1 µin dent in a bearing ring, which is undetectable in a 10 µrad applica­
tion, becomes the limiting factor in a 1 µrad application. Flexures, on the other hand, are 
extremely robust, impervious to dust and other mechanical and most chemical contami­
nation, and are very insensitive to shock and vibration. In most cases, a flexure pivot will 
survive indefinitely in a factory-floor or outdoor application in which other pivot types 
have very limited service life, if they operate at all.
Lastly, flexure pivots have inherently infinite life if operated at a peak stress level below 
the fatigue limit for the material from which they are made. Some care is required in elim­
inating any sort of stress riser in the design, and also in determining the effective fatigue 
limit for the material. Cambridge Technology (Lexington Massachusetts) regularly war­
rants its flexure products for 5 years of operation in any environment, at any duty cycle, 
with no statistically significant failure rate. For an 8-kHz scanner operated continuously, 
this amounts to more than 1012 cycles. (Of course, ball bearings won’t operate at 8 kHz in 

454 
Handbook of Optical and Laser Scanning
an oscillatory mode. However, by contrast, in applications below 1 kHz where they will 
operate satisfactorily, their life is generally limited to between 1 and 5 × 10*9 cycles.)
Of course, flexure pivots are not perfect. In general, the transverse stiffness of the flexure 
pivot is inferior to that achievable with ball bearings, resulting in unintended cross-axis 
motions in the presence of significant environmental stimuli, or in gyroscopic reaction to 
very large accelerations of the axle. It is also more difficult to achieve very large scanning 
angles with flexure pivots, for the reason that the curl of the flexures at extreme angles 
reduces even further their transverse stiffness. The allowable stress limit at the extreme 
angle legislates in favor of quite thin flexures, further reducing their stiffness. While flex­
ure scanners with scan angles up to 80° optical have been produced, their tolerance of 
environmental vibration and axle acceleration is low because of these effects, particularly 
when equipped with the very thin flexures required to obtain extremely long lifetimes.
Flexure pivots generally are designed to constrain the minimum number of degrees of 
freedom required by the application. Often, for example, a translation of the axle parallel 
to its axis is allowed, although even when the translation is not obnoxious optically, it has 
the potential to set up undesirable vibrations, and, in the limit, catastrophic mechanical 
positive feedback. With crossed-flexure pivots, it is possible to construct a geometry with 
zero axle shift, and practical to expect such a design to produce translation of the axis of 
less than a few microns over a small angle of rotation.
9.2  FLEXURE DESIGN
The possible combinations and permutations of flexures in a design approach for an arbi­
trary application is so vast that no attempt will be made here to cover any but the simplest 
form of flexure, the single leg. In the case of symmetrical designs, the easiest approach is 
to multiply the width of a single leg by the total number of flexures to model the flexure 
as a unit. In the case of asymmetric designs, other approaches to fit the circumstances 
will require invention. The formulas below in Section 9.2.1 assume fully reversed stress; 
that is, that the flexure is bent symmetrically through the same angle on both sides of the 
neutral position. As in the case of the Turkish bow, unreversed, or partially reversed stress 
provides an opportunity for clever design and perhaps nonmonolithic flexure materials. 
In fact, the definition of “fatigue limit” as it is used here, “That stress which represents 
the maximum stress which will allow the flexure to operate indefinitely without failure 
under a particular set of circumstances,” is a hotly contested topic, and those who believe 
they have a suitable answer guard their secret with the most intense passion. The case of 
the partially reversed stress is an even more volatile subject. Obviously one of the corner 
stones of flexure design is an understanding of the safe upper limit of flexure stress. In the 
absence of reliable published data, and for the purpose of designing for a standard labora­
tory environment, it is the considered opinion of the authors that, for ferrous material, a 
value of 35% of the ultimate strength is safe under dry operating conditions.
9.2.1  Useful Formulas
The primary parameters of interest to a flexure pivot designer include the rotational spring 
rate of the pivot, the maximum scan angle achievable under some maximum stress level, 
the maximum stress applied to a flexure bent through some scan angle, the allowable

thickness for a flexure whose fatigue limit, length, Young’s modulus, and angle of opera­
tion are known, and the first resonant frequency of the axle–pivot assembly.
It will be obvious that these formulas are a first-order approximation. It has been found, 
however, that the errors produced are small enough so that minor variations in the density 
of the materials used, the actual effective length and thickness of the flexures, and so on, 
dominate the result, and any application that requires very precise control of a particular 
parameter, such as the frequency of a mechanical resonator, will require some “tweaking” 
mechanism for final tuning on an individual basis.
These formulas also assume that the flexure mountings are infinitely rigid, support the 
flexure completely and uniformly, introduce no stress risers, and allow no relative motion. 
Except for the rigidity, these conditions are usually met satisfactorily by careful design. 
The first-time designer would be well advised to do a careful finite element analysis (FEA) 
of the mounting rigidity, or allow for an iteration or two in the design schedule. The for­
mulas are given as follows for constant-section flat springs:

There is an extensive bibliography on the subject of detailed design of flexure pivots, of 
which several are listed in the reference section.
9.2.2  Flexure Materials
It will be noticed immediately from inspection of the relationships among the physical 
constants pertinent to flexure materials that the stress is directly proportional to Young’s 
modulus. The allowable stress is proportional to the fatigue limit of the flexure material, 
which most workers agree is itself proportional to the ultimate strength of the material. 
(Since it is now generally agreed that the so-called proportional limit, or yield strength, 
is not a useful concept, we shall avoid using it here.) The natural conclusion from this 
train of reasoning is that one could rank flexure materials by a figure of merit that is the 
result of dividing the material’s fatigue limit by its Young’s modulus. Because the exact 
value of the fatigue limit is unknown, or at least unpublished for the materials of inter­
est, we shall use the ultimate strength instead, since the two are believed to be directly 
proportional.
Leaving for those who follow us those exotic materials whose currently available form 
or lack of observable malleability or other defect make their use questionable, we can con­
struct Table 9.1.
There are some applications in which weight, or minimizing it, are paramount. In this 
case, specific strength, rather than ultimate strength, can be used in the construction of a 
figure of merit list, which might look like Table 9.2.
As one would expect, aluminum and titanium have moved up the list, but little else 
has changed. One could, of course, construct other lists for other specific purposes, such 
as minimization of inertia. Since the inertia of the flexures themselves is rarely signifi­
cant construction of this list is left to the interested reader. The units of inertia are mass × 
radius squared, so dividing specific strength by dynamic stiffness would produce such a 
list (dynamic stiffness is Young’s modulus divided by density squared to account for the 
radius squared term).
However, there are two caveats. First, most engineering enterprises are constrained 
by commercial goals, and so the use of exotic materials is quite properly frowned upon 
unless there is robust technical or other justification for their use. To the knowledge of the 
authors, precious metal alloys such as BeAu and spring gold are used almost exclusively in 
the manufacture of very high quality fountain pen nibs. In this application, they are justi­
fied because the unique combination of fatigue resistance, corrosion resistance, wear resis­
tance, appearance, and “feel” enhance the marketability of the end product. Secondly, the 
fact is that very little is actually known, or at least published, about the long-term fatigue 
resistance of nonferrous alloys. This is partly the result of the fact that ferrous alloys have 
been in use for a very long time, and their overall combination of characteristics have rec­
ommended them for so many demanding applications that they are both well studied and 
in ready supply. One could argue that copper alloys have been in use longer, and while 
that is true, these alloys were generally eclipsed by their ferrous brethren as soon as they

became available. The stainless steels have replaced bronzes where corrosion resistance is 
important, and BeCu and phosphor bronze for springs except for applications where mag­
netic susceptibility or electrical or thermal conductivity are issues.
In fact, it seems from the published literature on the subject that nonferrous metals have 
disappointingly low fatigue limits.1 Experimental work at Cambridge Technology with 
BeCu flexure materials reinforces this view.
However, the primary reason for their use is probably simply that ferrous materials 
make very good flexures, and except for very unusual circumstances, the apparent techni­
cal superiority of the “other” material, if actually realizable, would require the investment 
of such large development or other resources that return on the investment might well 
be negative. As a case in point, Cambridge Technology has abandoned the “stress-proof” 
steels, number 8 on the list, in favor of 302SS, which is last in both Tables 9.1 and 9.2. While 
the manufacturer of air compressors has available to him thicknesses of material appropri­
ate to his flapper-valve needs, no one stocks the thin foils needed for flexures. This mate­
rial cannot be rerolled, and so a new thickness requirement calls for a mill run minimum 
at a cost of $25,000 or more and 2 years wait, and which yields a supply of material which is 
vastly in excess of the needs of any flexure product lifetime yet known, and must be stored 
carefully, inventoried, and so forth for many, many years against possible future demand, 
or else expensed and discarded.
Of course, not all pivots are required to last indefinitely. It is likely that an exploratory 
scientific mission to Mars, for example, might require only a few hundred thousand actua­
tions. In circumstances such as these, since low weight and high reliability are much more 
important than life, it is probable that resources can be saved by designing a limited-life 
flexure. It is easy to think of other applications in which this may be true, and the author 
designed and flew successfully flexure systems required to operate only a few tens of 
cycles during atmospheric testing of atomic weapons.
Unfortunately, it appears that the borderline between indefinite life and finite life is 
clifflike. It is fairly easy to predict accurately life versus stress for small to moderate 
cycle lives, because testing to validate the model is practical. As an example, the Bendix 
Corporation (Utica, NY) published graphs2 showing life versus cycles for their standard 
flex pivots under various conditions of loading. These graphs show load lines at 35,000 
cycles, 220,000 cycles, and indefinite life. These curves cover a factor of 2 in angle, and 
0%–100% loading. Interpolation is possible, but as one approaches indefinite life, small 
errors in actual loading and angle can cause one to fall off the cliff, with disastrous results. 
Testing a device to demonstrate “indefinite” life takes a very long time, and various forms 
of accelerated testing should be approached with caution. That said, many manufactur­
ers of flexures have developed accelerated testing methodology. They, like Cambridge 
Technology, protect these methods as trade secrets. A rule of thumb, in keeping with the 
most widely accepted theory of fatigue failure, is that a flexure design that passes 3 × 107 
cycles without failure is destined to operate indefinitely in a dry environment at this or 
lower level of stress.3
As the next section discusses, there are some hidden requirements for the qualities of 
the raw material form that should be understood before extravagant expense is lavished 
on the development of a material whose soundness of internal structure and finishability 
are questionable. That said, whenever an exotic, hard-to-work, expensive, material has sig­
nificant technical justification, then it is worth exploring. The example of the folks who 
succeeded in bringing diamond phonograph styli to the mass market should be firmly 
held in mind.

9.2.3  Stress Risers
If the failures of flexures were ranked by cause, it would be found that, except for instances 
that resulted from exceeding the design stress, all failures resulted from either stress risers 
or corrosion or a combination. The next section deals with the germane corrosion issues. 
Here we will deal with the problem of stress risers, which generally arise from poor finish 
on the surface of the flexure foil, nicks in the edges of the flexure as manufactured, mount­
ing defects, or inclusions in the flexure material itself, in about that order of importance. 
The sections on flexure manufacturing and flexure mounting deal in some detail with the 
avoidance of stress risers resulting respectively from manufacturing and from mounting.
A stress riser is anything that raises the stress in the flexure, either locally or globally, 
above the value that the designer intended that it have at that point. Because most flexures 
of interest to this discussion are made from rolled material, it is important to note that such 
materials are not really isotropic in their mechanical characteristics, the “grain” having 
been elongated more in one direction (the direction perpendicular to the axis of the rolls) 
than the other; in other words, the grain is longer in the length direction than it is in the 
width direction. As a result, the fatigue resistance of the material is anisotropic as well, 
being higher across the grain than it is parallel to the grain. It is therefore necessary to 
specify the direction of the grain when flexures are produced from the sheet of foil, and if 
the as-rolled coil is cut up into smaller sheets, the direction of rolling must be marked on 
each sheet in order to preserve the grain direction information. Since fatigue resistance is 
paramount in flexures, it is usual to specify that the flexure be cut out of the sheet in such 
a way as to cause the bending in operation to be across the grain.
The stress risers most prevalent in oriented flexures are the result of scratches in the sur­
faces of the rollers used to produce the foil. While it may be nonintuitive, the flexure stress 
is increased in the regions where the thickness is greater. The best quality rolled finish 
obtainable is none too good for flexure material, particularly when the flexure is thin. For 
example, a flexure 0.001 in thick, made from material with a standard mill finish of 32 µin 
roughness average (RA), is allowed to have scratches on both sides that are up to 0.0001 in 
deep. If two of them lie on top of each other, then the local thickness of the flexure is 0.0008 
in. If the scratches extend to the edge of the stressed part of the flexure, the 20% reduc­
tion in area is very likely to act like a notch and induce a crack. On the other hand, if the 
rolls which made the foil have scratches, the foil will have inverted scratches, that is raised 
areas which have the effect of increasing the thickness locally. Using the same exemplar 
dimensions, because the stress is proportional to the cube of the thickness, the local stress 
will exceed the designer’s intent by 95%, and is likely to cause failure. Of course, an inclu­
sion of microscopic size will produce the same effect.
Cambridge Technology specifies 4RA or better finish for its rolled flexure strip. For crit­
ical applications, it is well to have the rolled sheet 100% X-rayed to find any inclusions or 
cracks or voids or other defects inside the material.
The last important item is not associated with the quality of the raw material, but is one 
of the most easily overlooked elements of a stress riser free design. Nearly every flexure 
has one or more radical changes in width, usually associated with attachment. It is abso­
lutely critical that these section changes are made with a stress-distributing fillet or radius 
in the corner. Otherwise, failure cracks will inevitably originate at these locations.
Figure 9.1 is a drawing of one of the flexure assemblies in current production at Cambridge 
Technology. This part is actually two flexures joined together by a bar (the horizontal part 
along datum “B”). Making a pair of flexures this way ensures the utmost in symmetry, 
since they are made at the same time from nearby regions of the same piece of metal. Also, 

460 
Handbook of Optical and Laser Scanning
the “self-fixturing” feature of the bar eliminates the necessity for adjusting their parallel­
ism and individual effective lengths during assembly.
Attention should be paid to the specification legend in the upper left-hand corner, as 
well as to the grain-defining arrows and the corner radii at every section change.
9.2.4  Corrosion
It is assumed here that the flexure designer will take into account the environment in 
which the equipment will live, and take suitable precautions against atmospheric or envi­
ronment corrosion. We will discuss here only the forms of corrosion that result from the 
highly stressed conditions of the flexures during use, the effects of galvanic couples, and 
the hydrogen embrittlement associated with electroplating.
Corrosion in flexures is intimately connected with stress risers, because most of the cor­
rosion effects encountered begin in cracks and crevices either caused by stress cracking 
or enhancing to stress cracking. However, there is one area of corrosion difficulty encoun­
tered that is not directly associated with stress, but is instead a form of electrolytic cor­
rosion resulting from the contact between metals far enough apart on the electromotive 
series. This effect is not significant in very dry conditions, but the presence of an electro­
lyte can cause rapid erosion of the anodic member of the couple. Even atmospheric water 
held in cracks by capillary action can be a powerful electrolyte under conditions of stress. 
It is up to the designer to decide which member of the couple he would prefer to be dis­
solved; in general, it is preferable to protect both to the extent possible. Theoretic galvanic 
couples are presented in Table 9.3.
In general, MIL-STD-186 allows adjacent groups, or, in some cases, metals two groups away 
from each other to be coupled. This does not mean that galvanic action does not take place. It 
just means that for most purposes the rate of corrosion is so slow as to be unimportant.
At Cambridge Technology, standard product joins group 5 flexures with group 14 mount­
ing materials using group 13 fasteners with satisfactory results. Because the aluminum is

quite anodic to the flexures, it is slowly dissolved, but the more sensitive flexures are unaf­
fected. For demanding applications, all the ferrous parts are tin plated before assembly, 
and the aluminum is anodized.
In this context, it is useful to discuss a side effect of electroplating of high-strength steel, 
the so-called hydrogen embrittlement. During electroplating, the electrolyte, if aqueous, 
contains hydrogen ions, which are hydrogen atoms stripped of their electrons. These very 
small ions are able to squeeze into the grain boundary lattice structure of the steel, where 
they can produce pressures approaching 13,000 atmospheres. Under conditions of stress, 
the combined forces of the hydrogen and the external stress rupture the metal. It is one 
of the cruel jokes of nature that the very high strength steels such as those used for flex­
ures are severely afflicted by this process, and that the heat treatment required to drive out 
the hydrogen severely limits the strength that can be obtained in precipitation-hardened 
stainless steels such as 17–4PH. This is one of the reasons for choosing an age-hardening 
grade of steel such as 302 for flexures that might require electoprocessing.
The theory of stress-corrosion cracking favored by the authors is the electrochemical the­
ory.4 According to electrochemical theory, galvanic cells are set up between metal grains 
and anodic paths are established by heterogeneous phases. For example, the precipitation 
of CuAl2 from an Al–4Cu alloy along grain boundaries produces copper-depleted paths 
in the edges of the grains. When the alloy, stressed in tension, is exposed to a corrosive 
environment, the ensuing localized electrochemical dissolution of the metal, combined 
with plastic deformation, opens up a crack in the metal. Supporting this theory is the exis­
tence of a measurable potential in the metal at grain boundaries, which is negative with 
respect to the potential of the grains. Once the crack exists, capillary forces aid the delivery 
of electrolyte to the tip of the crack, and it propagates. Figure 9.2 is an illustration of this 
concept.

9.3  FLEXURE MANUFACTURING
9.3.1  Manufacturing the Material
Flexures have been manufactured by every conceivable process, but for the purposes of 
small precision pivots, carefully rolled sheet or foil produces the best densification, uni­
formity of metallurgy, and surface finish. In addition, many work-hardenable materials 
come off the rolls with the proper temper for use. It cannot be overemphasized that sur­
face finish is critical to the performance of thin flexures. No process now known is able to 
improve over the uniformity of thickness, flatness, freedom from scratches, and the consis­
tency of temper of ferrous materials precision rolled on machines specially designed and 
constructed for the purpose. However tempting it may be to obtain experimental stock 
by grinding and polishing or etching down existing material, whether chemically or in 
combination with ion impact, these processes will change the performance values of the 
material. Unless one is prepared to make all the required flexures by an identical process 
stream, likely extremely uneconomical, the experimental flexures should be made from a 
material process exactly as the production flexures will be processed. In fact, considering 
that 100 pounds of flexure material such as type 302 stainless can be obtained as a min­
imum run from a reputable reroller for under $3000, and 100 lb of foil will make many 
tens of thousands of flexures, there is hardly any reason not to make the experimental 
parts from the production material, and there are several reasons why this is the best 
approach.
First, the process of arriving at the desired thickness, for the sake of argument 0.00500 in 
thick ± 0.000020 in, at the required as-rolled temper, usually requires that the reroller start 
with carefully annealed material whose thickness is the nearest standard thickness above 
ten times the finished thickness, in this case, probably 1/16 in. Even so, the finished tem­
per of the material will vary by a few percent run-to-run, the thickness will vary by 10 to

20 millionths run-to-run, and the cross-sheet crown will also vary by a few millionths 
run-to-run. As a result, even if the edges of the sheet are trimmed off the material used for 
flexures, which is good practice, for the best uniformity flexure-to-flexure, it is best to buy 
all the material needed for the product lifetime in one mill run. If this is not possible, or 
if product demand exceeds all expectations, it is best to requalify each succeeding flexure 
material run, and to make adjustments in the flexure width to compensate for any varia­
tions in modulus of elasticity or spring constant discovered. The stiffness of the flexure is 
linear with width, and a new photo tool is only a few hundred dollars, and so adjusting the 
width is a reliable and economical way to titrate the flexure stiffness.
It is also worth the expense, for critical applications at least, to 100% X-ray the material to 
find any inclusions, cracks, or voids.
9.3.2  Cutting Out the Flexures
Flexures may be cut out of sheet or foil by punching, conventional machining of stacked 
blanks, laser, water jet, or E-beam cutting, or chemical etching of photolithographically 
produced patterns in photo resist. The last process is the standard process at Cambridge 
Technology, and is that preferred by most workers under most circumstances, because it 
is universally applicable, widely available, accurate to microinch tolerances, repeatable, 
fast, localized to the area to be cut, the photoresist protects the sensitive surfaces, and the 
process is inexpensive.
The other methods cause, or can cause, performance variation as the result of modified 
metallurgy in the zone near the cut. These potential modifications include heat effects, 
work hardening, and changes in the composition or phase of the alloy. Changes in the 
thickness of the flexure locally, and the introduction of stress risers, invariably accompany 
the relatively large-scale, relatively uncontrolled motions of mechanical machining and 
punching, including fine blanking, and are also associated with jets of abrasive or abrasive 
in water, laser cutting, and E-beam cutting.
It is also difficult to provide adequate surface protection during processing by these 
methods.
Even photoetching produces artifacts that have the potential for undesirable effects. For 
example, the edge pattern left by double-sided etching is a double cusp that is irregular, 
sharp, and full of stress risers. Figure 9.3 shows such an edge.
Also, the position of the attachment points between the flexures to be and the parent 
sheet should be specified in such a place, usually on an unstressed tie bar or mounting 
tab, that the stresses associated with their disconnect are not obnoxious. The best way to 
remove the cusps and their associated stress risers is by tumbling in appropriate media, 
chosen to batter rather than to scratch, so that the cusps are beaten down, but the surfaces 
are not scratched. The edges of the flexures should be 100% inspected under suitable mag­
nification, and any flexure with a nick or scratch visible at 20× should be rejected.
9.3.3  Corrosion Protection
Most of the materials usually chosen for flexure material have intrinsic resistance to labora­
tory or office environments which is adequate protection. However, in shop floor, marine, 
outdoor, or specialized applications, further protection is often desirable. Such protections 
include sealing and purging the entire mechanism. When this approach is not practi­
cal, then the flexures themselves (and, if necessary, their mated parts) can be protected. 
Of course, with the flexures in particular, the protection should not interfere any more

than necessary with the underlying functional performance of the part. At Cambridge 
Technology, hot-oil reflowed tin plating of the ferrous parts, including clamps and screws, 
is the protection method used. Tin has excellent protection in very thin layers, is anodic to 
the type 302 flexure material, has a very small Young’s modulus, is a lubricating film, helps 
to distribute the clamping forces uniformly, and has low mass. It is, however, cathodic 
to 5, 6, and 7000 series aluminum, as well as type 355 and 356 cast aluminum. It is, of 
course, extremely cathodic to magnesium and its alloys. The answer here is anodizing of 
any aluminum or magnesium mated parts, brought to completion, and sealed with a suit­
able material such as sodium silicate. Although MIL-STD-186 allows tin in contact with 
magnesium, the best practice is anodization of the magnesium, or, in the case of fairly 
porous castings, vacuum impregnation of the casting with epoxy or equivalent followed 
by anodization.
9.4  FLEXURE MOUNTING
The careful mounting of flexures is essential if the full potential of careful flexure design 
is to be reached. There are three aspects of mounting that deserve thought. The first is the 
transition from the flexure itself to the mounting provision for that flexure, whatever it 
may be. For example, flexures may have integral mounting tabs intended to be supported 
with reenforcing loose clamps, clamps attached by adhesive or solder to the flexure tab, 
flexures without tabs intended to be clamped or soldered or cemented into a slot, flexures 
with or without tabs intended to be welded in place, and so on. Whatever the method used, 
it is essential that the distribution of stress from the highly stressed operating region to the

mount is gradual, controlled, and without stress risers. In general, neither the mounting 
area nor the body of the mount can be made to carry the concentrated stress loads that the 
flexure itself carries. Typically, the flexure is flared out in the region of the mounting so 
that the stressed region is increased in cross-sectional area, and the intensity of the stress 
is reduced thereby to a level low enough to prevent fracture of the mounting region before 
the main flexure. While any of the above methods may be used, the standard practice at 
Cambridge Technology is to produce a flared tab design similar to that in Figures 9.1 and 
9.2. The corner radii are essential to achieving a transition without a stress raiser in the 
corner.
Of course, the presence of a radius in the corner raises the question of just where the 
effective region ends, and where the mounting region begins. It has been found by exper­
iment that if the effective length of the flexure is taken to be the distance between the 
points of tangency between the constant-width section of the flexure and the radii at the 
ends, plus one radius, the error in the result will be dominated by tolerances on the flexure 
thickness.
Secondly, alignment of the flexure(s) to the stationary and moving members must be 
thought out. It is often the case that a multiplicity of flexure pairs or sets positioned along 
the axis of rotation is required in order to resist the cross-axis moments of the system. 
Thus, as many as four or six individual flexures may require individual alignment in a 
typical system. In this case, it is convenient to manufacture the flexures attached together 
by means of a tie bar, which may either be left attached or removed after assembly. This 
reduces the number of alignments required by at least two. Such a tie bar is illustrated in 
Figure 9.3.
Thirdly, the designer must decide whether or not to try to make the flexure mountings 
on the fixed or on the moving or both elements indefinitely stiff. If he succeeds, then the 
design formulas given earlier will produce predicable results. If not, then some iteration 
may be required before satisfactory performance is obtained.
However, before leaping to a conclusion here, the designer should take into consider­
ation the fact that the economical materials of choice for the rotor and/or stator are often 
not high fatigue strength materials, and may not even be highly qualified materials and 
so may have relatively loose, or unknown specifications of physical parameters such 
as Young’s modulus and strength. In addition, it may well be that some other param­
eter is of more importance to their overall function than fatigue strength. One might 
posit thermal conductivity for the stator, and low inertia for the rotor. Whatever the 
reason, it is often desirable to allow the flexure-mated parts to be made of less intrinsi­
cally stiff material than is the material of the flexure itself. One then has the option of 
increasing the cross-sectional area of the mounting region appropriately. However, if 
the reason for using, say, an aluminum–magnesium alloy for the rotor had to do with 
inertial minimization, then bulking up the extreme-from-the-axis parts (where the flex­
ure ends inevitably attach) to increase their stiffness is not likely to find favor. It may, in 
fact, be a better overall solution to allow the mountings to bend a little under load, and 
recalculate the flexures, if necessary, to compensate. It should be recognized that some 
deflection of the flexure mountings is required anyway, because if they are as stiff as 
or stiffer than the flexures, the clamping loads will be at least partially transferred to 
the flexures, potentially overloading them at the worst possible location, the mounting 
transition region. In this context, it is well to pay as much attention to the flatness and 
surface finish of the flexure-contact pads as to that of the flexures themselves. For this 
reason, slots are discouraged because good surface finish on the sides of slots is difficult 
to achieve, and inspecting them is next to impossible. A carefully machined and lapped

pad, with a loose, lapped clamping plate under the screw heads to distribute their local 
loading is much better, and less costly in the long run. A layer of tin or indium foil or 
adhesive between the flexure and its mating surface on each side is advised as a method 
of filling microscopic voids and the valleys between the peaks on the surfaces, as well as 
providing corrosion protection at the interfacial joints. Care in mounting flexures can­
not be overemphasized, particularly when attempts have been made to make the mating 
structures extremely stiff.
9.5  CROSSED-AXIS FLEXURE PIVOTS
9.5.1  General Introduction
Of course, there are many uses for flexures, and many flexure types. Flexure hinges, 
previously mentioned, are perhaps the most ancient. Straight-line motion mechanisms, 
arguably the most difficult bearing types to design, have reaped great benefit from flex­
ure technology. The author spent 20 years designing and building bearings for scanning 
Michaelson interferometers, including diaphragm-flexure, “porch-swing” parallel-flexure, 
Bendix pivot porch-swing, and others. Because these straight-line motions are not gener­
ally considered pivots, they will not be discussed in detail here. The reader interested 
primarily in straight-line motions is recommended to References 4 and 5. Flexures of the 
torsional type are discussed in detail elsewhere in this book.
There is, however, a very interesting flexure pivot type whose design is due to the late 
Niels Young, and is illustrated in Figure 9.4. This pivot began life as a straight-line mecha­
nism for a scanning Michaelson interferometer. The diaphragms, instead of being corru­
gated or plane, were pierced by a number of quasi-radial curved slots. These slots increased 
the axial compliance of the diaphragm considerably without materially decreasing the 
FIGURE 9.4

radial stiffness, or introducing a departure from the straight-line motion. It was discov­
ered, however, that if two of these diaphragms were mounted to their separating pillar 
with the slots aligned, a small rotation of the pillar accompanied translation. This was, 
of course, undesirable in the application, so the diaphragms were mounted reversed with 
respect to each other, and the rotation was restrained thereby.
Somewhat later the author having need of a very tiny precisely adjustable rotation in 
order to align an optical component, recalled the “defect” of the Young flexure, seized 
upon it as a virtue, and succeeded in putting it to good use.
Since the 1960s it has been generally recognized that the crossed-axis flexural pivot 
has the most widely applicable characteristics of any single-flexure pivot type. This wide 
adaptability was so compelling that the Bendix Corporation designed and manufactured 
a family of self-contained flexure pivots in various materials and sizes, and was so suc­
cessful in its implementation that this type of pivot has come to be known worldwide as 
the Bendix pivot.
9.5.2  The Bendix Pivot
The Bendix “free-flex” pivot was introduced to the world in November 1962 in a semi­
nal paper in Automatic Control magazine, entitled “Considerations in the Application of 
Flexural Pivots.”6
Available still from Lucas Aerospace, these high-quality, standardized, well-quantified 
pivots should be considered whenever there is space to include them, and the product 
envisioned will be produced in modest quantities. Much time and effort, particularly in 
qualification testing, can be saved by using these devices. Made in both single-ended (can­
tilever) and double-ended types, Figure 9.5 shows the general principle of construction.7
This general form of layout, the 90° symmetrical cross, has become the standard of con­
struction, and the departure point for many specialized designs. However, this layout 
has the defect that translation of the axis of rotation takes place during angular motion 
of the pivot. This motion is neither linear nor small, and while many optical applications

are quite tolerant of translation perpendicular to the plane of a mirror, the speed of the 
system may be limited by vibration produced by the translation of significant mass. As 
mentioned in the introduction to this chapter, it is possible to design a zero translation 
crossed-axis flexure pivot, and in principle possible to construct one, although the preci­
sion of assembly required is very high. The amount of translation, and the shape of the 
angle versus translation curve is dominated by the ratio of the leg lengths of the flexure. 
In the Bendix design, the leg lengths are equal, and the point of crossing, which lies on 
the axis of rotation, is initially central to the mounting tube. As the pivot is rotated, the 
axis of rotation departs from the center along a curve whose cusp is central and sym­
metric, but whose shape depends on the ratio of lengths of the flexure arms at intersec­
tion. Since the axis of rotation is usually a line fixed in space with respect to the rest of 
the mechanism, the axle is constrained by its load, and the flexures must cross on this 
axis, the only convenient way to change the ratio of the flexure arms is to extend the arm 
from the axis toward the stator (leaving the arm length between the axis and the rotor 
attachment point fixed) until the desired arm ratio is obtained. This inevitably has the 
effect of increasing the diameter of the stator flexure attachment point with respect to 
the axis of rotation. Since the ratio of arm lengths required for theoretical zero transla­
tion is 12.5% to 87.5%, this can become a big deal, so most designs find a compromise 
that is workable.
9.5.3  Cambridge Technology Crossed-Flexure Design Example
Figures 9.6 through 9.9 show the successive stages of assembly of a flexure-pivot optical 
scanner mechanism, which represents the state of the art at Cambridge Technology.
This scanner, designed in 1995 and still in production, is used in a high-quality large-
format printing engine to produce multicolor magazine illustrations. It produces 30° opti­
cal scans of an elliptical 30-mm aperture mirror at 160 Hz, with line straightness of a few

microradians. Every feature of design and construction highlighted in this text as pre­
ferred is illustrated in the design. Of the several thousand of these scanners delivered, of 
which many have more than 20,000 h of operation at 160 Hz (4 × 109 cycles), none has ever 
been returned for any reason.
Figure 9.6 shows the assembly of the flexures to the rotor. Note the radii in the mount­
ing transition region of the flexures, the tie bar 5, and the lapped loose clamps 6 under 
the screw heads. These flexures are photo-etched, tumbled, 100% edge inspected under 
20× magnification and tin plated. Figure 9.7 shows the assembly of the rotor and its 
flexures into the stator. There are registration notches on the mounting pads on both the 
stator and the rotor, which position the ends of the flexures and their clamps, assuring 
equal effective length of the flexures and parallelism between the axis of the rotor and 
the axis of the stator. Notice that the flexure mounting pads are islands, which can be 
machined, lapped, and inspected easily. Once assembled to the stator sector, the entire 
pivot mechanism is complete, and can be inspected and tested easily without unneces­
sary obstruction. Once qualified, it is mounted into the final housing, such as the one 
shown in Figures 9.8 and 9.9.
An interesting variation of this design is illustrated in Reference 8. This scanner was 
required to operate in a mechanism that was quite sensitive to microscopic levels of vibra­
tion and other mechanical noise. Since crossed-axis pivots operated at high speeds pro­
duce a periodic translation of the axle, they have the potential to transmit vibration to 
the rest of the mechanism through their mounting means. In this case, the stator–rotor 
assembly, instead of being bolted directly to its housing, is supported on a set of flexures 
that permit an additional small rotation between the stator and the mounting. These flex­
ures allow the pivot assembly to oscillate torsionally and transversely with respect to the 
housing. The second flexures therefore isolate the pivot assembly from the housing, and 
allow the housing to be bolted to the optical system without imparting an undesirable 
level of vibration in it. The second set of flexures allow the stator to rotate in response to 
the reaction torque from the rotor. The rotor and the stator counterrotate, and the rela­
tive amplitude of the angular oscillations of the rotor and the stator is approximately in 
inverse proportion to their respective inertias. A typical ratio of inertias for the rotor and 
the stator is 1:150, so that the angular deflection of the second set of flexures is approxi­
mately 1/150 as great as that of the rotor flexures. The second set of flexures also allows 
the stator to translate in response to the oscillatory translations of the rotor’s center of 
FIGURE 9.7

gravity, which result from the translation of the rotor as it rotates. The forces required to 
dynamically accelerate the rotor and the stator largely balance each other. The amplitude 
of the residual translation force, compared with the translation force of the same pivot 
assembly bolted directly to the housing, is given approximately by the ratio of the pivot 
assembly mass to the housing mass, typically 1:15 or greater. One could, of course, apply 
ever more stages of isolation by this means of flexure pivots within flexure pivots if one 
had the need to do so.
9.6  LOW-COST CANTILEVER SCANNER
The discussion of the previous section was devoted to the details of construction of a 
typical very high performance scanner where the unique attributes of the flexure pivot 
are devoted to solving issues unmanageable by any other known bearing type. On the 
opposite end of the spectrum of suitable applications, flexure pivots lend themselves 
to the construction of very low-cost scanners which yet are rugged, long-lived, and 
precise.

9.6.1  General Features
Figure 9.10 shows a cantilever flexure scanner designed for a digital radiography appli­
cation. It operates at 50 Hz +/− 1 Hz over a peak-to-peak optical scan angle of 40°. The 
mirror aperture is designed to accommodate a 12-mm diameter beam at a nominal angle 
of incidence of 45°. Figure 9.10 shows a plan and an elevation view of the scanner. Figure 
9.11 shows a picture of the flexure itself. Figure 9.12 shows an exploded view, where 1 is 
the flexure, 2 is the mirror, 3 is the flexure clamp, 4 is the flexure support, 5 is a counter 
mass, and 6 is the drive magnet. Referring now to Figure 9.10, the elevation view has an 
arrow which indicates the motion of the mirror. Cantilever scanners pivot the mirror a 
long way from the center, and so the mirror “walks” on the beam during the scan; the 
cross-axis dimension of the mirror is long. The elastic curve of the flexure depends on the 
way the drive is applied. In this particular design, the drive is by means of a small magnet 
attached under the center of the mirror at the tip of the effective length of the flexure. The 
magnet dips into a pair of coils in the stator block, wound at 90° to each other and mutu­
ally at 45° to the axis of the magnet. One of the coils provides the drive flux, and the other 
serves as a velocity coil for feed back. (This coil construction is intended to minimize the 
transformer coupling between the drive and feed back coils.) This kind of drive coupling

is a combination of point loading at the tip and loading as a moment around the tip. As a 
result, the slope of the tip of the flexure, and therefore the slope of the mirror surface does 
not obey either the −PL*2/2EI or the −ML/EI textbook expressions, but instead a combina­
tion, which is sensitive to the exact relationship between the magnet and the back iron 
which makes prediction of the slope uncertain. Of course, other more predictable drive

coupling methods are possible if prediction of the slope is important to the design. In 
any case, the fact that the flexure assumes a curve has the effect of reducing the magnet 
deflection required for a particular scan angle compared to that of a simple hinge, and this 
means that the peak stress, which occurs at the clamped end of the flexure, is reduced. 
It also means that, while the motion of the mass-spring is sinusoidal, the motion of the 
deflected beam is partially linearized. In fact one could depart from the simple constant-
section rectangular flexure in favor of a triangular flexure, or a rectangular flexure tapered 
in thickness in the form of a cubical parabola, both of which have as their elastic curve a 
circular arc, and more completely linearize the velocity of the reflected beam. Both of these 
variations have complexities which increase the cost, and so are inappropriate for a design 
which is intended, as this one is, to be low cost.
9.6.2  Design example
It is useful to begin with the inertia of the moving parts, since in general the size of the 
mirror and the scan angle are defined a priori. The essential moving parts are the mirror 
and the drive coupling, in this case a magnet. The inertia of the flexure may usually be 
ignored; however, including one-third of the flexure inertia produces a rigorous result. 
There are usually ancillaries to the required rigid connection between the flexure, the mir­
ror, and the drive which add inertia, in this case an aluminum spool, a flexure clamp (not 
shown, but essentially identical to part 3), and three small screws. In addition, this design 
includes provision for tuning weights. This is not essential, because conventional dimen­
sional control of the flexure and moving parts, once the desired frequency is established 
empirically, is adequate to assure high yield in production even with fairly tight frequency 
specification (+/−2% in this case). However, the provision of tuning weights means that the 
empirical frequency “tweak” is straightforward, and furthermore, the weights permit the

basic scanner to be configured for a variety of other mirror sizes and resonant frequencies 
simply by changing the weights at final assembly.
9.6.3  Motor Size Required
Assuming a conservative mechanical “Q” of 1000, the motor will need to deliver about 
1/1000 of the stored energy per cycle. The stored energy is given by U = fd/2. As pointed 
out above, we don’t know exactly what the value of the displacement will be, but a con­
servative estimate is given by ignoring the fact that the flexure will bend in an arc, and 
assume a deflection given by the multiplying the length of the active part of the flexure 
times the peak scan angle in radians. Let us assume a flexure length of 0.5 in, a spring rate 
of 6 lb/in, and a peak mechanical angle of 10° or 10/57.3 rad. The displacement is then 0.5 
× 10/57.3 = 0.087 in, the force is 0.522 lb, and U = 8.3 × 10−2 in lb. The minimum motor size 
required then will be such as to supply 8.3 × 10−2/1000 = 8.33 × 10−5 in lb to the drive. To put 
this all in perspective, the power of the minimum-size motor in this case is 8.33 × 10−5 × 50 
= 4.2 × 10−3 in lb/s or 1.3 × 10−7 Watts. Inevitably there are I*2R losses and windage losses, 
and the scan angle will take some time to build up with a minimum-size motor, so it is 
usual to make the motor somewhat oversize. That said, it is evident that such low-power 
scanners make possible long-life battery powered equipment.
9.7  VIBRATING-WIRE SCANNER
Figure 9.19 shows the general lay out of a vibrating wire scanner. Using the expression 
F = √T/LW, well known to string musicians, and dating from around the year 1300 we can 
design a scanner to use two strings vibrating 180° out of phase to tip a mirror.
  F = Desired frequency of vibration
  T = wire tension
  L = length of wires
W = mass of moving parts
The spacing between the wires is arbitrary. The mirror is fastened to the midpoint of 
each wire as shown, and the drive is attached to the underside of the mirror between the 
wires. In general, the weight of the wires may be ignored, since the mirror and drive are 
the major source of mass, but again, adding one-third of the weight of the wires is rigor­
ous. Both ends of the pair of wires are clamped, and some means of adjusting the tension 
of the wires must be provided. Rearranging the expression, T = LF*2W in appropriate 
units. The drive may be arranged as with the cantilever scanner, and all the “Q” and power 
considerations described in that section apply. This scanner, with suspension support at 
both ends, is more resistant to vibration than the cantilever scanner, and is suitable for a 
wide range of operating frequencies, just like the Piano.
9.8  MICROELECTROMECHANICAL FLEXURE SCANNERS
Microelectromechanical scanners (MEMS) integrate flexures and electromechanical actu­
ators to yield small scanners of high performance and low cost. These are interesting in a 
number of applications but none more than optical switching in telephony.

Flexural Pivots for Oscillatory Scanners 
475
The scanning mirror may be formed direct onto the MEMS carrier, or it may be a sepa­
rate component bonded to the mechanical assembly. Its aperture is typically between 0.1 × 
0.1 mm and 3 × 3 mm. Currently, optical scan angles up to 20° are practical. Resonant fre­
quencies are typically in the range 10–40 kHz and are dependent on system design, mirror 
size, and maximum scan angle.
There is a huge body of expertise in the manufacture of precise, small structures from 
silicon or on silicon substrates. It is fortuitous that silicon possesses attractive properties 
for small flexures, so we can exploit the existing semiconductor manufacturing infrastruc­
ture to make MEMS. This same manufacturing technology is well suited to the fabrication 
of the piezoelectric actuators.
9.8.1  MEMS Design
Piezoelectric bimorphs consist of two strips of piezoelectric elements joined over their long 
surfaces, provided with electrodes in such a manner that when an electric field is applied, 
one strip elongates and the other contracts. This results in a bending motion of both strips. 
The motion of the tip can be considerable, which is what makes these devices such use­
ful tools as converters of electrical energy to mechanical energy and vice versa. They are 
used in different applications such as ultrasonic motors,9 laser beam detectors,10,11 fans 
for cooling electronics,11 numeric displays,12 filters,13 accelerometers,14–16 optical choppers,17 
and more recently as the legs of microrobots.18 They are suitable as converters of electrical 
signals into sound (speakers) and similarly as pickup elements for the detection of sound.19 
They are also used as the control element to reduce vibration in space-borne structures 
such as solar panels and in the walls of offices for the reduction of sound transmission.20 
While there is a huge variety of concepts that could be realized, we confine this discussion 
to a relatively simple layout as represented in Figure 9.13.
The two piezoelectric actuators are of a form that has been used for the last 70 years or 
more.9 This “bender,” as we shall refer to it, has various names in the literature, including 
“piezoelectric bimorph,” a term not strictly accurate in this case. It comprises two bars of

piezoelectric material, typically PZT, having opposite polarities and sandwiched between 
two electrodes as indicated in Figure 9.14. A voltage applied to the electrodes results in a 
field that causes the length of one bar to increase and that of the other to reduce. This pro­
duces curvature of the structure similar to the bending of a bimetal structure as a result of 
a temperature change. In our case, the benders are, strictly speaking, monomorphs; that is, 
there is only one active layer of piezoelectric material.
The free ends of the two benders are connected by torsion bars to the mirror substrate. 
The benders are driven by equal and opposite polarity so their motion is equal and oppo­
site. The mirror substrate rotates about a central axis. This geometry has been studied in 
depth by Smits.
When using PZT material, an electric field is applied across two plates separated by 
poled ferroelectric material. PZT ceramics are isotropic and not piezoelectric prior to pol­
ing. Upon poling, they become anisotropic and display directionally dependent piezo­
electric and mechanical properties. Poling is accomplished by heating the material to its 
Curie temperature and applying a DC field to the crystal, which then aligns its previously 
randomly oriented dipoles parallel to the field. Upon cooling, the dipoles maintain this 
preferred arrangement. As a result, there is a crystal distortion that causes growth in the 
dimension parallel with the field and also in the dimension perpendicular to the field. The 
axial strain resulting is typically small (0.2%) and is accompanied by hysteresis.
The displacement of the PZT material in the actuators when an electric field is supplied 
is the source of the bending moment of the “J” arms connected to the mirror platforms. 
When the electric field is applied, the material has displacement in two directions: parallel 
to the field and at a right angle to the field. The parallel and perpendicular displacements 
are opposite in sign so that when the film expands in parallel with the field it contracts 
its dimension perpendicular to the field and vice versa. The polarity of the parallel dis­
placement is determined by the direction of the electric field with respect to the domains 
of the material. (The directions of the domains were established during the polarization 
process.) If the polarization and electric field are opposed, that is, the domains are in the 
opposite direction to the applied electric field, the material will expand parallel to the field 
and shrink perpendicular to the field. Opposed domains are stable in the sense that they 
are already arranged to cancel the applied electric field. If the domains and electric field 
are parallel, then the material will shrink as the electric field gets stronger until 50% of the 
domains have switched their direction to be opposed. This is effectively repolarizing the

material. When more than 50% of the domains have switched, the material will begin to 
expand again.
The amount of displacement caused in the case of the opposed situation can be esti­
mated by the following formula:

where D3 is the displacement in the “3” direction, (the “3” direction is perpendicular to the 
capacitor plates), V3 is the applied voltage between the plates of the capacitor, and d33 is the 
coefficient for displacement parallel to the field, typically 7 × 10−12 m/V2.
9.8.2  MEMS Manufacture
Exploitation of the existing silicon fabrication technology leads naturally to the manufactur­
ing process represented by Figure 9.15. Each MEMS module is typically 4 × 4 mm. The 
modules are produced in arrays on a silicon wafer to yield 50 to several hundred modules 
per wafer.
The correct operation of the MEMS depends on symmetry of the performance of the two 
benders in the assembly. This symmetry and repeatability of performance from module to 
module are achieved only through precise dimensional, process, and material control.
The fabrication process is as follows:
	
1.	A silicon wafer with a buried oxide layer is oxidized (Figure 9.15a).
	
2.	Front- and backside alignments are applied in photoresist (not shown).
	
3.	The wafer is etched in BOE (buffered oxide etch), removing the oxide layer, leav­

9.8.4  Material Properties
The properties required of the driving materials are a reasonably high coefficient of strain 
versus applied field, low or predictable hysteresis, and high repeatability. The properties 
required of the support materials are ease of fabrication, very high stability, and a high 
fatigue limit. These are met satisfactorily in the silicon mechanical material chosen: it was 
in fact, these demonstrated characteristics of silicon that led to its choice as a basis mate­
rial. On the other hand, while the PZT material has a satisfactory coefficient of strain, these 
constraints remain. Although these materials are excellent for submicron positioning, they

have inherent hysteresis and creep, and so they lack the level of repeatability required in a 
practical open-loop positioning device. Long-term creep can approach 15%, and hysteresis 
can approach 12%.
9.8.5  Static Performance
9.8.5.1  Hysteresis
Hysteresis appears as apparent “backlash” upon reversal of the direction of motion, but 
unlike the backlash of conventional mechanical systems and stiction, which can largely 
be predicted and compensated, hysteresis depends on the recent history of motions and is 
difficult to model, predict, and compensate. The creep is, at this time, completely unpre­
dictable. As a result, open-loop piezoelectric devices are limited to applications in which 
repeatability of 10% is satisfactory. Of course, when combined with a position feedback 
system, this defect can largely be overcome, but the cost of this level of control is dispro­
portionate to the economics of the production of MEMS.
9.8.5.2  Linearity
Linearity of motion over mirror angles of 10° mechanical is in the range of 2%, smoothly 
changing, monotonic, and predictable. This characteristic is considered satisfactory for 
most laboratory uses. However, PZT has a rather large strain sensitivity to temperature, so 
that linearity of motion can be compromised by changes in temperature.
9.8.5.3  Uniformity
Uniformity of performance scanner to scanner within a wafer is entirely a question of pro­
cess control, and is not expected to pose long-term problems. Standard levels of production

process control are also expected to address wafer-to-wafer performance uniformity issues 
satisfactorily. At the moment, we are achieving uniformity of characteristics of about 10% 
across the wafer and wafer to wafer in a pilot production phase.
9.8.5.4  Yield
Yield is an issue that falls into the process control purview as well. At the moment, we are 
achieving yields above 80%, with most of the dropouts the result of mirror defects.
9.8.6  Dynamic Performance
9.8.6.1  Dynamics
These scanners have a first torsional resonance typically well above 20 kHz with integral 
mirrors. As a result, the dynamics permit full-scale (10°) steps in well under 100 μs. With 
high-quality mirror flakes 150 microns thick cemented over the integral mirror, the res­
onant frequency falls to about 8 kHz, which is satisfactory for most microscanning pur­
poses. The flatness of the present examples of integral mirrors is poor, as is the surface 
finish, but attached flakes achieve any required surface quality. Testing has verified that 
150 micron thickness is adequate to preserve quarter wave or better flatness over the 1.8 × 
2.6 aperture of the standard scanner because of the underlying silicon support ring.
9.8.6.2  Life
Life testing has revealed no observable damage after 1010 60° optical scans when driven by 
an 8-kHz oscillator. Flexure stress is expected to be below the endurance limit for silicon 
at all angles of operation up to 30° mechanical.
9.8.6.3  Degradation Processes
No degradation process is known, other than excessive voltage breakdown inside the PZT 
crystal, and heating above the Curie point. High-speed operation (above 20 kHz) has the 
potential to encounter impact degradation of the tips of the bender arms and the edges of 
the mirror if operated in open air. The standard packaging presently envisioned for indi­
vidual scanners is a hermetically sealed TO5 package.
9.8.7  Application Rules
9.8.7.1  When and When Not to Use MEMS
The current state of the art in PZT open-loop scanners has limited repeatability and “star­
ing” positional stability because of creep and hysteresis. As a result, MEMS scanners 
should not be specified for applications in which positional precision better than 10% of 
full scale is required unless some form of active position feedback is anticipated. On the 
other hand, the device behaves as though it were a pair of capacitors of a few nanofarads 
capacity. Therefore, self-heating even during aggressive scan profiles is not an issue, and 
cooling is not required except in environments above 100 °C. Because the thermal trans­
port path from the mirror through the structure is long, the effect of power coupled from 
the scanned beam may be significant. In this case, it is desirable to provide a direct mirror 
cooling path through a suitable gas, such as helium, directly to the scanner case.

482 
Handbook of Optical and Laser Scanning
Vibration and inertial forces applied to the scanner are likely to cause deformation of 
the flexure structure, and, since the system is very poorly damped, are likely to produce 
long-lasting settling periods (Figure 19.9). Otherwise, these scanners have no particular 
susceptibility to environmental stimuli such as temperature, barometric pressure, humid­
ity, magnetic and electric fields, and so forth.
9.8.8  Anticipated Developments
It is anticipated that electrostrictive actuators may replace piezoelectric actuators in MEMS 
in the near future. A typical electrostrictive material, such as lead–magnesium–niobate 
(PMN), should provide an order of magnitude improvement over PZT in positional 
stability.
For PMN materials, the change in length is proportional to the field voltage squared, 
so the coefficient is a factor of two higher than PZT. Unlike piezoelectric materials, PMN 
crystals are not poled. Positive or negative voltage changes result in an elongation in the 
direction of the applied field, regardless of its polarity. Because PMN is not poled, it is 
inherently more stable than PZT, resulting in a reduction of long-term creep from 15% to 
3%. Also, PMN materials have better hysteresis than does PZT. While PZT exhibits 12% 
hysteresis, PMN displays only 2%.
Two properties of PMN contribute to its thermal stability. First is the strain sensitivity to 
temperature. The PMN is much more robust than PZT in this regard, especially over large 
temperature ranges. Secondly, the coefficient of expansion of PMN is twice that of PZT.
9.8.9  Conclusions
It is clear that MEMS have not yet grown from infancy. Unlike their mature brethren, the 
macroscale flexure scanners, the only conclusion one could legitimately draw at this time 
is that the future is bright for small scanning and pointing devices that draw little power, 
pack closely together, demonstrate extreme reliability, and offer a price–performance 
index beyond the capability of any macroscale device. It seems certain that these attributes 
of MEMS will be exploited. Just how MEMS will look in their maturity years hence is any­
one’s guess.

9.9  CONCLUSION
It seems that flexure pivots have come of age. They have been used in a great diversity 
of products where their attributes of sensitivity, accuracy, and repeatability are enabling. 
They are also low cost, lubricant-free, low mass, high “Q,” and capable of storing consid­
erable energy. They can be cascaded to provide vibration isolation. There are standalone 
commercial versions to suit many purposes. The published data on detail design rules 
are considerable, and no competent engineer should have unusual difficulty in producing 
a workable pivot on the first try. It is the hope of the authors that the information in this 
chapter will help neophytes to avoid most of the impediments to success that lurk in the 
mysteries of material selection, processing, and the mounting of flexures and that many 
more useful applications of flexure pivots will be found and pursued with success.

10.1  INTRODUCTION
Significant changes have occurred in the field of laser scanning since the first edition of 
this book was published over 10 years ago. Specifically, visible laser diodes (VLDs) have 
become the laser light source of choice in the scanning industry, allowing scanners to 
become much smaller, in the form of hand-held and wearable scanners. Holographic scan­
ning, however, does not yet have a very significant presence in these applications.
In the first edition, much attention was given to supermarket scanners and most of the 
examples were given in reference to such designs. Over the past decade, however, a great 
deal of growth has occurred in the industrial scanning market, and the adaptability of hol­
ography has helped it grow into this market more significantly. Accordingly, more exam­
ples are given in this edition with respect to the industrial scanning market.
The fundamentals of scanning, however, have not changed. Neither has the presence 
of several decades of barcode and scanner design specifications and laser standards been 
diminished. For example, printing specifications of barcodes are based on reflectance 
properties at the wavelength of helium–neon lasers, predominantly used years ago but no 
longer in scanners today. As such we will begin with a basic discussion of barcodes.
A barcode is a sequence of dark bars on a light background or the equivalent of this 
with respect to the light reflecting properties of the surface. The coding is contained in the 
relative widths or spacings of the dark bars and light spaces. Perhaps the most familiar 
barcode is the universal product code (UPC), which appears on nearly all of the grocery 
items in supermarkets today. Figure 10.1 is an example of a UPC.
A barcode scanner is an optical device that reads the code by scanning a focused beam 
of light, generally a laser beam, across the barcode and detecting the variations in reflected 
light. The scanner converts these light variations into electrical variations, which are sub­
sequently digitized and fed into the decoding unit, which is programmed to convert the 
relative widths of the digitized dark/light spacings into numbers and/or letters.
The concept of barcode scanning for automatic identification purposes was first pro­
posed by N. J. Woodland and B. Silver in a patent application filed in 1949. A patent, titled 
“Classifying Apparatus and Method,” was granted in 1952 as U.S. Patent No. 2,612,994. 
This patent contained many of the concepts that would later appear in barcode scanning 
systems designed to read the UPC.
10.1.1  The UPC Code
In the early 1970s, the supermarket industry recognized a need for greater efficiency and 
productivity in their stores. Representatives of the various grocery manufacturers and 
FIGURE 10.1

supermarket chains formed a committee to investigate the possibility of applying a coded 
symbol to all grocery items to allow automatic identification of the product at the checkout 
counter. This committee, the Uniform Grocery Product Code Council, Inc., established a 
symbol standardization subcommittee, whose purpose was to solicit and review sugges­
tions from vendors for a standard product code to be applied to all supermarket items.
On April 3, 1973, the Uniform Grocery Product Code Council announced their choice. 
The code chosen was a linear barcode similar to a design proposed by IBM. The character­
istics of this barcode, the now familiar UPC, are described in detail in the article by Savir 
and Laurer.1
The UPC is a fixed-length numeric-only code. It consists of a pair of left guard bars, a 
pair of right guard bars, and, in the standard version A symbol shown in Figure 10.1, a pair 
of center guard bars. Each character is represented by two dark bars and two light spaces. 
The version A symbol contains 12 characters, six in the left half and six in the right half. 
Thus, a version A UPC symbol will have 30 dark bars and 29 light spaces, counting the six 
guard bars—left, right, and center. The first character in the left half is always a number 
system character. For example, grocery items are given the number system 0, which often 
appears on the left of the symbol. The last character on the right is always a check charac­
ter. This sometimes appears to the right of the barcode symbol.
The remaining five characters in the left half of the version A UPC symbol identify the 
manufacturer of the product. For example, the left-half number 20000 represents Green 
Giant products. This left-half five-digit code is assigned to the various manufacturers by 
the Uniform Product Code Council.
The remaining five characters in the right half of the version A UPC symbol identify the 
particular product. This right-half five-digit code is assigned by the product manufacturer 
at his discretion. For example, Green Giant has assigned the right-half number 10473 to 
their 17 oz. can of corn. Therefore, the complete UPC code for the Green Giant 17 oz. can of 
corn, ignoring the number system character and the check character, is 20000–10473.
There are a number of other properties of the UPC code and symbol that are significant 
relative to the design and use of equipment for reading the code. First, the left and right 
halves of the version A symbol are independent. That is, each half can be read indepen­
dently of the other half and then combined with the other half in the logic portion of the 
reader to yield the full UPC code. Furthermore, as shown in Figure 10.2, each half of the 
UPC symbol is “over-square.” That is, the symbol dimension parallel to the bars is greater 
than the symbol dimension perpendicular to the bars. The aspect ratio of the barcode is 
vital in the determination of a minimum scan pattern for reading the code, as we will see 
in a later discussion.
FIGURE 10.2
Two UPC half-symbols.

Handbook of Optical and Laser Scanning
It should be noted that the original “over-square” design of the UPC code is not always 
adhered to by product manufacturers. Often they will truncate the height of the code. 
These truncated codes, while discouraged by the Uniform Product Code Council, are often 
used by manufacturers to maximize the space available for product information. That, in 
turn, has meant that scanner designs must be more complex and the decoding algorithms 
more sophisticated.
Each character of the code is represented by two dark bars and two light spaces. 
Individual bars and spaces can vary in width from one module wide to four modules 
wide. (Note, on all UPC codes, the guard bars are always one module wide and sepa­
rated by a one-module-wide space.) The total number of modules in each character is 
always seven. The left-half characters are coded inversely from the right-half characters. 
As shown in Figure 10.3, for example, if we let white = 0, and black = 1, then the code for 
the number 2 in the left half is 0010011 while in the right half it is 1101100.
The fact that each character is always seven modules wide leads to a second major prop­
erty of the UPC code: it is self-clocking. Therefore, absolute time measurements are unim­
portant. What is measured is the time that is required to go from the leading edge of the first 
black bar to the leading edge of the third black bar (i.e., the first black bar of the next char­
acter). This time interval is then divided into seven equal intervals, and the relative widths 
of the two black bars and the two white spaces are then determined for decoding purposes. 
Thus, the total width of a character—black-white-black-white—is measured, and the relative 
widths of the two black bars and the two white spaces are determined for decoding.
This self-clocking feature is very important in the design of scanners for reading the 
UPC code. It means that the velocity of a scanning light beam for reading the code does 
not have to be constant across the full width of the code. The velocity only needs to be rea­
sonably constant across a single character. This means that the UPC code can be read by 
moderately nonlinear scan patterns, such as sinusoidal or Lissajous patterns. It also means 
that the code can be read on curved surfaces. Furthermore, the scan lines reading the code 
do not have to be perpendicular to the bars and spaces in the code. As originally designed, 
satisfactory reading of a UPC code can be obtained with scan lines that pass through the 
code at any angle relative to the bars and spaces so long as a single scan line passes com­
pletely through a full half symbol, including the center guard bars and one pair of edge 
guard bars. More sophisticated decoding algorithms now exist that can “stitch” together 
three smaller, individually scanned pieces of a UPC code (or other symbol), and, as such, 
the process is commonly referred to as stitching. The use of stitching allows a slightly less 
thorough scan pattern to do as good a job as a better pattern and makes a good pattern 
even better; however, the UPC code was designed with only the left and right sides in 
mind. Stitching was a software adaptation developed later on.2 One of the factors driv­
ing its development was the occurrence of the aforementioned truncated codes, for which 
stitching is particularly useful.

A third property of the UPC symbol of significance to the scanner designer is the size of 
the symbol, which is allowed to vary from the nominal size (about 1.0 in × 1.25 in [25.4 mm 
× 31.75 mm] for the version A symbol) down to 0.8 × nominal and up to 2.0 × nominal. This 
size variation allows the use of small labels on small packages with good print quality 
and large labels on larger packages with poorer print quality. From the scanner designer’s 
viewpoint, the small label will establish the minimum bar width to be read and the large 
label will set a lower limit on the size of the scan pattern.
The minimum bar width established by the UPC specification, including tolerances, is 
0.008 in (0.2 mm). This number establishes the maximum attainable depth of field for the 
optical reader. In practice, the depth of field of the typical laser scanner designed to read 
the UPC code will easily meet, and exceed, the 1 in (25.4 mm) depth of field required by the 
early UPC guidelines. However, this 1 in depth of field did not take into consideration the 
manner in which the scanners would eventually be used. Depths of field of several inches 
(100 mm+) are required for today’s UPC barcode readers.
Finally, the contrast specification for the UPC symbol requires that the contrast be mea­
sured using a photomultiplier detector (PMT) with an S-4 photocathode response curve 
coupled with a Wratten 26 filter. This combination has a peak response at a wavelength 
of approximately 610 nm (24 μin), falling to zero at approximately 590 nm (23.2 μin) and 
650 nm (25.6 μin). This response includes, not coincidentally, the wavelength of the heli­
um–neon laser, 632.8 nm (24.9 μin), which was the preferred laser at the time that laser 
scanners were first being considered. While several of the inks used for printing UPC 
labels can provide acceptable contrast out to 700 nm (27.56 μin) there are many other inks 
in use that do not provide acceptable contrast beyond 650 nm (25.6 μin). These inks would 
preclude general use of longer-wavelength light sources. Today, nearly all UPC scanners 
use one or more diode lasers as their light source(s); however, the wavelengths of these 
lasers fall within the original UPC wavelength specification.
10.1.2  Other Barcodes
The UPC code is not widely used in the industrial environment (the manufacturing, ware­
house, and distribution applications). Here, the requirements are different from those of 
the supermarket, so the codes used are different than the UPC code. The preferred codes 
for the industrial environment are Bar Code 39, Interleaved 2 of 5, and Codabar.
The most common barcode in the industrial environment is the so-called Bar Code 39, or 
3 of 9 barcode. This code is fully alphanumeric and is self-checking. For a full discussion of 
Bar Code 39, as well as several other codes, and the definition of such terms as “self-checking,” 
see work by Allais.3 The code shown in Figure 10.4 is an example of Bar Code 39.
Bar Code 39 got its name from the fact that it originally encoded 39 characters: the 26 let­
ters of the alphabet, the numbers from 0 through 9, and the symbols -,., and SPACE, plus a 
unique start/stop character, the asterisk (*). Today it also encodes the four so-called special

characters: $, /, +, and %, for a total of 43 characters. However, it is still referred to as Bar 
Code 39. It is also often called the 3 of 9 code, because each character in the code is repre­
sented by nine elements (five dark bars and four light spaces), and three of them are wide 
with the remaining six narrow. In the primary set of 39 characters, two of the wide ele­
ments are dark bars. In the four special characters, the wide elements are all light spaces.
The 2 of 5 code is a subset of the 3 of 9 code. In 2 of 5, only the bars are used for encodation. 
Two of the five bars are wide, just as in the original 3 of 9 code. The spaces are not used. This 
code is strictly numeric. The basic 2 of 5 code is not widely used in the industrial environ­
ment, but a variation of it, called the Interleaved 2 of 5 code, is used extensively for manufac­
turing and distribution applications. This code uses the bars to encode one character in the 
standard 2 of 5 code and then uses the interleaving spaces to encode a second character in 2 
of 5 code. This allows more characters to be encoded in a fixed barcode length than either 3 
of 9 code or 2 of 5 code. This code is also only numeric, but, due to the interleaving feature, 
it can encode nearly 80% more characters per unit length than Bar Code 39, assuming both 
codes have the same minimum bar width. For this reason, the Interleaved 2 of 5 code is 
often used where space limitations will not permit the use of Bar Code 39.
A third code that is used extensively in medical institutions, and which was adopted 
as an early standard by the American Blood Commission for use in identifying blood 
bags, is Codabar. This code is also frequently seen in some transportation and distribution 
applications.
10.1.3  Barcode Properties
From the standpoint of the scanner, the important properties of any barcode are:
	
1.	Minimum bar width: generally specified in millimeters or mils (thousandths of an 
inch). And often referred to as the “X” dimension.
	
2.	Contrast: a measure of the reflectance of the bars and spaces. Contrast is generally 
expressed in terms of the print contrast signal (PCS), defined as
	
PCS
s
b
s
=
−
r
r
r
	
(10.1)
where rs is the reflectance of a space and rb is the reflectance of a bar. It should be noted that 
PCS is usually measured for one particular wavelength of light. In the majority of applica­
tions this wavelength is 633 nm (24.9 μin), the wavelength of the helium–neon laser, which 
was the most common light source for most of the early laser scanners. (Some applications 
allow PCS to be measured at 900 nm [35.4 μin], the wavelength of some infrared light sources 
used in some readers.) This is an important point to remember since PCS will vary drasti­
cally as a function of wavelength if colored inks or backgrounds are used. In practice, the 
most important reflectance property of the barcode is the absolute contrast, which is simply 
the space reflectance minus the bar reflectance (the numerator in Equation 10.1).
	
3.	Code length: the physical length of a barcode is determined by the density of the 
code (which is determined by the minimum bar width) and the number of char­
acters in the code. The physical length of the code determines how long the scan 
lines must be and, when combined with the code height, will determine how accu­
rately the scan line must be oriented with respect to the barcode.

Holographic Barcode Scanners: Applications, Performance, and Design 
491
	
4.	Code height: the height of the barcode (the dimension parallel to the bars) will 
determine the angular accuracy required in orienting the scan line relative to the 
barcode.
	
5.	Barcode quality: this includes both the quality of the printing or etching of the 
code itself and the quality of the surface on which the code is printed. Obviously, 
the better the quality of both, the easier it will be for the scanner to successfully 
scan and decode the barcode.
There is a great deal more that could be said about the barcodes themselves. However, 
a more detailed analysis of the fundamental properties of the barcodes is beyond the scope 
of this review and is not really necessary for the purposes of our discussion of barcode 
scanning.
10.2  NONHOLOGRAPHIC UPC SCANNERS
A block diagram of a typical laser scanner system for reading the UPC code is shown in 
Figure 10.5. The focused laser beam scans the UPC symbol on a package as the package 
passes over the read window of the scanner. The laser beam is reflected from the sym­
bol as it passes over the dark bars and light spaces. The diffuse portion of the reflected 
light is modulated by the reflectivity variations of the symbol (bars and spaces). This light 
modulation is detected by the photodetector, which converts the light modulation into 
electrical modulation. The electrical “signal” is then amplified, digitized, and transmitted 
to the “candidate select” block. This block acts as a filter, allowing only valid UPC half-
symbols to pass to the decoder. The decoder converts the signals for each half-symbol into 
characters and then combines the characters for the two half-symbols together to yield a 
complete UPC product identification code. The computer then searches its memory for a 
description and price of the item identified by this UPC code. This information is trans­
mitted back to the checkout terminal where it appears on the display and the customer 
receipt. Simultaneously, the store inventory is updated to reflect the sale of the identified 
item. All of this takes place in a few milliseconds.
The focused spot size of the scanning laser beam must be about 0.2 mm in order to be 
able to read the labels with the smallest bar widths while still yielding adequate depth of

field. This requires an optical f-number of approximately 250, which, when combined with 
scanner geometry, establishes the focusing optics’ requirements.
A number of technologies are available for deflecting the focused laser beam in a conven­
tional, nonholographic, UPC scanner. Cost and performance requirements limit the choice 
to mechanical deflectors—generally either rotating or oscillating mirrors, or a combin­
ation of these. The scan pattern created by the laser deflection mechanism must be capable 
of reading a full-size version A UPC symbol regardless of the orientation of the symbol 
in the scan window. In other words, the scanner must be omnidirectional. An omnidirec­
tional scanner will allow maximum freedom for the scanner operator when bringing the 
item across the scan window.
We have already seen that the two halves of the UPC symbol can be read independently 
of each other. We have also seen that each half-symbol is over-square. Therefore, the mini­
mum scan pattern that will allow omnidirectional scanning is a pair of perpendicular 
scan lines in the form of an X (see Figure 10.6a). As the UPC symbol passes over the scan 
window, at least one of the legs of the X will pass through the entire half-symbol at some 
point in the window. Figure 10.6a shows two extreme orientations of the symbol as it is 
passed over the window. These are the worst-case orientations in that they allow the mini­
mum time for scanning the symbol satisfactorily.
The amount that the half-symbol is over-square, when combined with the maximum 
item velocity of 2.54 m/s (100 in/s), determines the minimum pattern repetition rate to 
guarantee at least one good scan through the symbol as it passes across the scan win­
dow, regardless of its orientation. The pattern repetition rate, the total scan length, and the 
width of the smallest UPC module establishes the maximum video signal rate seen by the 
photodetector.
Although the pattern in Figure 10.6a is the minimum scan pattern required to yield an 
omnidirectional scanner for the UPC symbol, it is not an “optimum” pattern. The pattern 
repetition rate required to guarantee one scan through a UPC half-symbol moving across 
this pattern at 2.54 m/s (100 in/s), at the worst-case orientation relative to the scan pattern, 
is very high. This results in high scanning spot velocities and subsequently high video 
signal rates. A “better” scan pattern can guarantee one good scan at lower pattern repeti­
tion rates and lower scan velocities. An optimum scan pattern will minimize scan velocity, 
thereby minimizing video signal rates.
If one could increase the amount that a symbol is over-square (i.e., improve the aspect 
ratio), then one could reduce the pattern repetition rate, and the scan velocity, and still 
guarantee one good scan through the UPC half-symbol at maximum symbol velocity and 
worst-case symbol orientation. While the symbol itself cannot be changed, one can effec­
tively improve the aspect ratio of the symbol by using a scan pattern where the scan lines 
are separated by angles less than 90°. Thus, a scan pattern consisting of three scan lines,

for example, instead of two, could be repeated less often and still be able to read the UPC 
symbol under the worst-case conditions mentioned above. Increasing the number of scan 
lines has the effect of increasing the total linear distance scanned by the scan pattern, 
which, by itself, would increase the scan velocity of the scanning spot. However, the reduc­
tion in the pattern repetition rate is greater than the increase in the scan length. The net 
result is a better scan pattern, in the sense described above.
Can we continue to improve the scan pattern by adding still more lines? Unfortunately, 
the answer is no. The reduction in the required pattern repetition rate realized by using 
four scan lines is nearly offset by the increased scan velocity resulting from the greater 
distance traveled by the scanning spot. The small amount of gain is not enough to justify 
the increased cost and complexity required to generate the four-line pattern. Beyond four 
lines, there is no gain when scanning UPC symbols. (We will, however, see later that in 
certain industrial applications four- and five-line patterns can be quite effective, especially 
when scanning symbologies with extreme aspect ratios.) It appears, then, that for the UPC 
code the optimum scan pattern in the plane of the window would be one based on the 
three-line pattern shown in Figure 10.6b. This fundamental three-line pattern, which is 
still the basic criterion used in the design of UPC scanners in 2004, formed the basis of the 
first scanner designed to read the UPC code, the IBM 3666 scanner. The linear equivalent 
of the Lissajous scan pattern used in the IBM 3666 scanner is shown in Figure 10.6c.
10.2.1  Forward-Looking Scanners
Initially, all UPC scanners were conceived as “bottom scanners.” That is, the scanning 
laser beam pointed directly upward to read the UPC symbols on the bottoms of packages 
as they passed over the scan window. A major problem was encountered in the design of 
this type of scanner. UPC symbols printed on shiny surfaces were difficult to read because 
the specular reflection from the shiny surfaces contained no bar-space modulation in the 
specularly reflected light. In addition, the specular reflection created saturation problems 
in the photodetector because the specularly reflected light was so much more intense than 
the diffusely reflected light. In most scanners, the photodetector was located back along 
the general direction of the outgoing laser beam. Therefore, some solution had to be found 
that would keep the specularly reflected light from being directed back along the laser 
beam path.
One solution to this problem is shown in Figure 10.7a. The laser beam is tilted at an angle 
of approximately 45° relative to the scanner window. In this configuration, the specularly 
reflected light is reflected away from the photodetector, thereby eliminating the specular 
reflection problem.

(b)

A fringe benefit occurs when this scanner geometry is used. The tilted beam can be used 
to read UPC symbols on the front of packages without tilting the packages forward (see 
Figure 10.7b). Of course, this increases the depth of field required to read these upright 
labels, but the laser scanner has the capability to provide a depth of field of several inches 
(100 mm+), which is usually sufficient for side reading with the tilted beam geometry. 
Nearly all UPC scanners today employ some form of forward-looking, tilted-beam reading 
geometry.
10.2.2  Scan Pattern Wraparound
The next development in the evolution of the scan pattern was the introduction of scan 
pattern wraparound. Several scan patterns were introduced that took the basic three-line 
optimum scan element shown above and created it in such a way that the scan lines were 
directed at the items from points within the scanner that were slightly off to the sides of 
the package. In these scanners, horizontal lines were projected forward from immedi­
ately in front of the item and from directions slightly off to each side. Vertical lines were 
also projected from slightly off to each side. The pattern projected from the two sides was 
essentially a cross pattern, while the scan pattern projected from immediately in front of 
the item was a horizontal line, as shown in Figure 10.8. The overall pattern was created by 
using a rotating mirror deflector and an array of fixed folding mirrors.
This type of scan pattern was effective in reading the UPC symbol on the scan window 
because it employed the basic three-line optimum scan element. It was also effective in 
reading upright items because it projected a pattern of perpendicular horizontal and verti­
cal lines on the front of the items. Such a pattern is effective for upright reading because 
the bars in the UPC symbol will usually be either vertical or horizontal when the package 
is presented to the scanner in this manner.
The major advantage of this type of scan pattern is that it “wraps around” to the sides of 
the packages to some degree. This means that the operator does not have to align the item 
as carefully when he brings the item across the scan window. The UPC symbol can be on 
the bottom of the package, on the front of the package, or on the side of the package and 
still be readable by the scanner. This has a positive effect on operator productivity.
This concept of wraparound was further exploited in the development of “bi-optic” 
scanners, exemplified by the NCR 7875, the PSC Magellan SL, and the Metrologie Stratos.

The bi-optic-type scanner is currently becoming the most used type of scanner in super­
markets and other large-volume, point-of-sale applications. The bi-optic nature of the scan­
ner refers to the two separate scan windows it possesses, as shown in Figure 10.9. In this 
configuration there is a horizontal scan window and a second window at or near vertical 
orientation, depending on the specific scanner in question.
Improved performance is gained by employing the wraparound concept from both win­
dows. In the preferred package-presentation orientation, two of the six faces of an item 
directly face a scanner window and are seen by the primary three-line pattern. Two other 
faces, typically the faces in the direction of item motion (see Figure 10.9), are targeted by 
the wraparound patterns of both scanner windows. The package surface that faces away 
from the vertical window still potentially sees the wraparound pattern out of the hori­
zontal window. Finally the top surface of the package, which has the least exposure to the 
scan pattern, may still have some chance of being scanned by the wraparound pattern of 
the vertical window, depending on the package height and code orientation. The net result 
is effective scanning throughout the majority of the 360° horizontal orientation range and 
equally effective scanning through nearly 270° of vertical orientation. Such a wide range 
of acceptable presentation orientations means very little of an operator’s time needs to be 
spent paying attention to the position and orientation of a code on an item.
10.2.3  Depth of Field
The multidirectional, three-line scan pattern forms the basis for nearly all present-day 
UPC scanners, holographic and nonholographic. Unfortunately, the forward-looking fea­
ture increases the depth of field requirement considerably. As much as 150-mm (6-in) 
depth of field may be required to read some barcodes on upright items. Because the codes 
must, in many cases, be read by a tilted beam, the resultant spot ellipticity on the barcode 
will increase the effective scanning spot diameter. This will reduce the depth of field of 
the scanner.
Providing satisfactory scanning performance over such a large depth of field, with a tilted 
scanning beam, is a significant challenge to the scanner designer. Significant improvements 
in signal processing over the last decade have allowed smaller bar widths to be read with­
out reducing the actual size of the spot, helping to solve this problem and increase depth of 
field. Another means of easing the problem, without relying on electronic improvements, is 
to design a scanner that can provide more than one focal plane. Such a scanner could focus

some of its scan lines close to the scan window and some of its lines further from the scan 
window, thereby increasing the effective depth of field of the scanner.
Holographic scanning allows the scanner designer to add this additional degree of flexi­
bility to the scanner. The holographic scanning element essentially allows each scan line 
to be optimally focused to provide increased depth of field and increased flexibility in the 
placement of beam-folding mirrors for the creation of the scan pattern. This also allows 
for a more complex, and more effective, scan pattern. The need for greater depth of field 
and the desire for a more effective scan pattern led to the development of the holographic 
barcode scanner.
10.3  HOLOGRAPHIC BARCODE SCANNERS
The concept of holographic scanning has been around for three decades,4 and during this 
time many different applications have been suggested,5,6 but few have been demonstrated 
and an even smaller number have made it into the marketplace. A general review of holo­
graphic scanning and various applications can be found in the book by Beiser7 as well as 
in previous volumes of optical engineering.8
Holographic barcode scanners first appeared commercially in 1980 with the introduc­
tion of holographic UPC scanners by IBM and Fujitsu. Today, Metrologie manufactures 
holographic scanners primarily for industrial applications. Such applications range from 
large depth of field (greater than 1 m [40 in]) overhead scanners, to high-density, high-
resolution scanners for large aspect-ratio codes, to completely automated hands-off scan­
ning tunnels for bulk-mail centers.
10.3.1  What is a Holographic Deflector?
Photography is a light-recording process in which a two-dimensional light-intensity dis­
tribution incident on a light-sensitive medium is recorded by that medium. In contrast, 
holography is a light-recording process in which both the amplitude and phase distribu­
tion of a complex wavefront incident on the recording medium can be recorded by that 
medium.
Holography, therefore, differs from photography in that it is able to record all of the 
information that is needed by the eye, or any other optical system, to interpret the full 
three-dimensional nature of the object.9,10 This information is accessed when the record­
ing (the “hologram”) is illuminated by the proper light source—usually, but not always, 
a laser.
The most common form of hologram creates, when viewed, a three-dimensional image 
of a complex, three-dimensional object. The reduction of the three-dimensional object to a 
single point-source produces a special case of particular importance to deflection—a holo­
gram that acts as a lens to focus an incident laser beam. This type of hologram is referred 
to as a holographic optical element (HOE).
The concept of holographic recording and reconstruction—more importantly, how it 
deflects light—can best be understood with reference to Figures 10.10 and 10.11. In Figure 
10.10a, two wavefronts of equal intensity created from a laser are directed to overlap in 
some region of space where the recording is to be made. If the optical path difference from 
the point of beam separation to the region of overlap is within the coherence length of the 

Holographic Barcode Scanners: Applications, Performance, and Design 
497
source, the resulting interference pattern will be stationary in both space and time and will 
have high fringe contrast. The intensity distribution in these fringes can be exposed onto, 
or more properly into, a suitable photosensitive medium such as a photographic emulsion. 
After processing, the recording contains a variation in optical density, refractive index, or 
optical thickness—sometimes a combination of all three—and is the hologram. When this 
recording is repositioned and illuminated by one of the wavefronts, such as the diverg­
ing wavefront in Figure 10.10b, the structure at each point within the hologram diffracts 
the illuminating light and creates a new wavefront that is identical to the original second 
wavefront. In the case of Figure 10.10b the result is a converging and deflected wavefront. 
This simple HOE is the equivalent of a positive or converging lens in combination with 
a prism converting and deflecting light from a point object to a point image. The effi­
ciency and quality with which this wavefront conversion occurs are directly related to the 
recording configuration and selection of recording material. In Figure 10.10c we see that

the equivalent of a negative lens is realized by illuminating the same HOE with the con­
verging wavefront, thereby reproducing the original diverging wavefront. Holographic 
recording of complex multidimensional objects can be treated as the recording of a super­
position of individual spherical waves from all the points in the object field.
By using a combination of small area illumination and HOE translation, the reconstruc­
tion geometry of Figure 10.10 can be used to create simultaneous light deflection and focus­
ing. This is shown in Figure 10.11, where the HOE is initially located at position 1 and has 
a small subarea, on the right side, illuminated by a diverging wavefront that corresponds 
to the diverging reference-construction-beam of Figure 10.10a. The light is focused by this 
subarea of the HOE to the point in the image plane labeled “position 1” (Figure 10.11). This 
point in the image plane corresponds to the location, with respect to the displaced HOE, of 
the original convergence point of the converging construction wavefront in Figure 10.10a. 
As the HOE is translated, different subareas of the HOE are passed under the illuminat­
ing beam, and the reconstructed image point is caused to translate by the same distance, 
in this case to position 2. This is completely analogous to the deflection and focusing that 
would occur if a conventional lens were illuminated off axis with a collimated beam and 
the lens displaced normal to its optic axis. A continuous back and forth motion in either 
case produces the same motion in the focused spot.
In practice, however, a continuous rotary motion rather than a reciprocating motion is 
easier to implement. Higher scan speeds can be realized, and different holograms can be 
easily accessed. Consequently, most holographic deflectors consist of a number of unique 
HOEs placed circumferentially as sectors on a glass disc, as shown in Figure 10.12. Other 
materials can be used, and other geometries besides the disc geometry can be used,8 but, 
for simplicity, we will restrict our discussion to the glass disc, which is the most common 
medium and geometry used in holographic scanners today. It should be noted that plane 
linear gratings, producing prismatic deviation without focal power, must be rotated to gen­
erate scanning. Translation of a plane grating in one direction will not produce scanning.
A holographic deflector disc, when properly illuminated by a laser and rotated about its 
axis of symmetry, can produce a complex variety of scanning laser beams. The optical and 
geometrical properties of each of these beams can be distinctly different from all of the 
others. This is the most important feature of holographic scanning. It is the major feature 
FIGURE 10.12
A holographic deflector disc.

499
that distinguishes it from conventional laser scanning technology and, in a barcode scan­
ner, allows the introduction of capabilities that could not be readily achieved with conven­
tional technology.11
The holographic disc works in the following manner. Each sector, or facet, of the holo­
graphic disc is a unique HOE of the type previously described—the holographic equiva­
lent of a prism and lens combined. When a facet is illuminated by a laser beam, the beam 
is diffracted, or bent, by the facet and focused to some point in space (see Figure 10.13). The 
focal length and deflection angle are established during the holographic construction of 
the facet and may vary from facet to facet.
As the disc rotates, the deflected, focused laser beam scans. When the beam scans across 
a barcode, some of the diffusely reflected light will return to the facet that generated the 
scanning beam. The facet now acts as a light-collection lens, combined with a prism, to 
collect a portion of the reflected light and direct it toward a photodetector.12
10.3.2  Novel Properties of Holographic Barcode Scanning
The use of holography in barcode scanning allows the introduction of scanning concepts 
that are not available to the designer of conventional barcode scanners, at least not in any 
economically practical design. Such concepts as multiple focal planes, overlapping focal 
zones, variable light-collection aperture, facet identification, and scan-angle magnification 
allow holographic scanning to bring to barcode scanning some significant design and per­
formance capabilities.
A conventional barcode scanner contains a lens for focusing the laser beam, a device 
for deflecting the laser beam, and some optics for collecting a portion of the laser light 
reflected from the barcode and focusing it onto the photodetector. In a holographic scan­
ner, all of these properties—focusing, deflecting, and light collection—are contained in 
the holographic disc. As indicated earlier, these properties may be different in each sector 
of the holographic disc; thus, a 16-sector holographic disc, for example, would contain 
16 unique optical systems. Each of these systems would have its own focal length, scan 
angle, and light-collection aperture. One revolution of such a holographic disc would pro­
duce the equivalent of scanning with 16 different scanners.
Because each facet of the holographic disc may be different, with its own combination 
of focal length, deflection angle, and facet area, then one complete rotation of the disc 
will create multiple scan lines with multiple deflection angles, multiple focal lengths, and 
multiple light-collection systems. This enables the holographic scanner to introduce some 
novel operational characteristics.
FIGURE 10.13

Handbook of Optical and Laser Scanning
One of the major advantages of using a holographic disc in a barcode scanner is that it 
can provide a much larger depth of field than would be attainable with a conventional, 
single-focal-length, barcode scanner. In order to understand this point, we need to briefly 
review the subject of depth of field.
10.3.3  Depth of Field for a Conventional Optics Barcode Scanner
In barcode scanning, depth of field is the distance along the laser beam, centered around 
the focal point of the scanner, over which the barcode can be successfully scanned. The 
spot size profile of a laser beam along its direction of propagation is established by the 
beam waist diameter and the wavelength of the laser light source. The depth of field of a 
barcode scanner employing such a beam depends on the size of the minimum bar width 
in the barcode being read and also on the resolving ability of the scanner electronics. For 
a given resolving ability there will be a normalized spot-size definition, or resolution cri­
terion (C in Equations 10.3 through 10.5), based on the assumed Gaussian intensity profile 
of the laser beam. This resolution criterion simply defines the relative intensity level at 
which the beam diameter is measured. A commonly used criterion is the 1/e2 beam width 
(13.5% intensity level, C = 0.135). Typical resolving abilities of scanners range from the 50% 
to 70% intensity levels, or possibly even higher. Once all these beam, code, and electronic 
parameters have been established, there is little that can be done in a conventional barcode 
scanner to increase the depth of field.
Figure 10.14 illustrates the concept of depth of field. The lens in the scanner focuses 
the laser beam to a relatively small spot size at the focal point. The diameter of the beam at 
the focal point is determined by the focal length of the lens, the diameter of the beam at the 
lens, and the wavelength of the laser being used. When the optical system of the scanner is 
properly designed, the minimum spot size will be somewhat smaller than the minimum 
bar width and will therefore be able to successfully scan the barcodes. As one moves the 
barcode to either side of the focal point, toward or away from the scanner, the spot size 
increases as the beam becomes out of focus. Eventually, a point is reached where the out-
of-focus spot size is larger than the minimum bar width in the barcode. When this occurs, 
the barcode can no longer be successfully scanned by the beam. The distance between the 
two points to either side of the focal point where the limit of scanning capability occurs is, 
by definition, the depth of field.

The major factors determining the depth of field are the spot size at the focal point, the 
wavelength of the laser, and the minimum bar width. (For convenience, we will assume 
throughout this discussion that the minimum space width is the same as the minimum 
bar width.) Using the notation of Dickson13 for the variation in beam radius of a propagat­
ing Gaussian beam, the 1/e2 beam radius, r, at a distance, z, from a beam waist of 1/e2 radius

It can be shown that, for any resolution criterion, the depth of field given by Equation 
10.4 is maximized for a given minimum bar width when the focused spot size, as mea­

For example, if the scanner is optimally designed to read a barcode that has a minimum 
bar width of 8 mils (200 μm), the depth of field will be 7.7 in (200 mm). Note that the above 
equation tells us that the depth of field is strongly dependent on the size of the minimum 
bar width to be read. Therefore, a small minimum bar width is always accompanied by a 
small depth of field.
Furthermore, if the scanner is not optimally designed for the minimum bar width to 
be read, the depth of field will be smaller than it could be. This will be true whether the 
scanner is optimally designed to read either a higher density barcode or a lower density 
barcode. In addition, if the scanner uses a laser with a different wavelength, the depth of 
field will be multiplied by the ratio of the wavelength for which the design is optimized to 
the wavelength of the laser being used. (This assumes that the new laser has its minimum 
spot size focused to the same size as the original design.)
There is very little that can be done in a conventional barcode scanner to increase the 
depth of field. It is possible to use an autofocus scanner. Autofocus scanners have been 
designed and built for the industrial scanning market by Accu-Sort Systems (Telford, PA). 
However, a problem with such scanners is that the reaction time of the autofocus system 
has to be very fast to accommodate fast-moving items on a conveyor system. Because all 
autofocus systems today require mechanical movement of some of the optics of the scan­
ning system, the reaction time may not be fast enough, depending on the application. In 
addition, such systems will add cost and complexity to the scanner.
One could also add a supplemental optical element to the scanner that could move into 
position in the laser beam path to change the net focal length of the scanner. This moving 
element would allow, for example, two different focal lengths to be selected. In practice, 
this approach would allow only two or three different focal lengths to be selected, giving 
only a slight increase in the depth of field.
Furthermore, in either an autofocus system or a dual or triple-focal-length system, only 
the focal lengths can be easily changed. Ideally, one should also change the aperture of 
the scanner as the focal length is changed. This would maintain a constant level of light 
collection over the full range of focus, thereby optimizing the performance of the scanner 
over the full range of readability. However, rapid variation of the light-collection aperture 
is difficult to accomplish in a conventional barcode scanner.
10.3.4  Depth of Field for a Holographic Barcode Scanner
The use of holography in a barcode scanner would allow the introduction of a true mul­
tifocal-plane scanner with a variable light-collection aperture. The way this would be 
accomplished in a holographic scanner is illustrated in Figure 10.15.
Figure 10.15 shows focusing of the laser beam by two consecutive facets on the holo­
graphic disc. Each facet will exhibit a conventional depth of field as established by the focal 
length of the facet, the beam diameter at the disc, and the wavelength of the laser. Notice, 
however, that the two facets are focused at different distances from the disc. Therefore, 
while each facet has only a conventional depth of field, the combined depth of field of the 
two facets is twice as great as for either facet alone, assuming that the focal lengths are 
chosen so that the end of the depth of field for facet 1 coincides with the beginning of the 
depth of field for facet 2.
Thus, with only two focal planes, the holographic disc can double the depth of field of a 
conventional, nonholographic scanner.
If the disc is designed so that all of the facets are focused at different distances, then a 
much larger overall depth of field can be achieved. For example, if the minimum bar width

503
to be scanned is 0.2 mm (8 mils), a conventional, single-focal-length scanner would have a 
depth of field of approximately 200 mm (8 in). However, a properly designed holographic 
scanner could provide as much as 800 mm (32 in) depth of field for the same 0.2 mm min­
imum bar width code by using only four facets.
Even greater depth of field can be achieved with more facets; however, there are dimin­
ishing returns to this route to greater depth of field. Ideally, we would like to be able 
to control the focused spot size in each focal plane; however, this would require auto­
matic aperture adjustment of the outgoing beam (similar to autofocus), which would prove 
mechanically difficult and very costly. As a compromise, typically, the centermost focal 
plane is optimized for maximum depth of field, which causes the other focal planes to be 
close to optimum as well.
Another limit to the continuing growth of depth of field is the very large distances that 
are eventually encountered as facet focal lengths increase. While theoretically this is not a 
problem for the resolution of the outgoing beam profile, it does present a greater challenge 
to light collection, which will be discussed later.
10.4  OTHER FEATURES OF HOLOGRAPHIC SCANNING
There are other novel features of holographic scanning that are not as obvious as the abil­
ity to provide a large depth of field. The major features of holographic scanning are:
	
1.	Multiple focal planes
	
2.	Overlapping focal zones
	
3.	Variable light-collection aperture
	
4.	Facet identification and scan tracking
	
5.	Scan-angle magnification

We have already discussed the multiple-focal-plane feature and the large depth of field 
that it provides. Let us now examine the other features to see what they are, how they are 
produced by the holographic disc, and what capability they provide.
10.4.1  Overlapping Focal Zones
We showed in the previous section how holographic scanning can provide a large depth of 
field by designing the holographic disc so that the depth-of-field region of each successive 
facet was contiguous with the depth-of-field regions of the facets immediately preceding it 
and following it. This may not, in practice, be the best disc design. It may, in fact, be better 
to design the holographic disc so that the focal point of one facet coincides with the limit of 
the depth of field for the preceding and following facets, resulting in an overlapping focal 
zone design. The reason why this design may be superior is explained in the following 
paragraphs.
One of the major contributors to decoding problems in a barcode scanner is the existence, 
or creation, of noise in the so-called quiet zone, the white, or clear, region immediately pre­
ceding and following the barcode. One of the contributing factors to noise in this region, and 
throughout the barcode, is substrate noise, or paper noise. Paper noise occurs when the size 
of the focused spot of the scanning laser beam is about the same as the size of the granular­
ity of the substrate material. Paper fibers, for example, can be as large as 0.1 mm (4 mils). For 
very coarse paper or cardboard, the fiber size can be even greater. For nonpaper substrates, 
such as for barcodes etched into plastic or metal, the granularity can be greater still.
If a barcode on a noisy substrate is scanned at the focal point of a scanning laser beam, 
the small, in-focus spot will “see” the granularity of the substrate material. This will intro­
duce paper noise on the return light signal that will, in turn, lower the probability of 
achieving a successful read.
While noise could, in general, be reduced with low-pass electrical filtering, the filter 
properties would have to be altered for each facet to correct for the differences in spot 
velocity. That is, a low-pass filter designed to remove noise from the short-focal-length 
facets would, at the same time, filter out the barcode signals from long-focal-length fac­
ets. Electrical filtering does not appear to be a practical solution for large depth-of-field 
scanners.
The solution to this problem is to scan the noisy barcode with a slightly out-of-focus spot. 
This spot will be larger than the in-focus spot, but still small enough to read the barcode. 
This larger spot will, while scanning the barcode, act as a filter to smooth out the surface 
roughness, effectively lowering the paper noise and increasing the probability of achiev­
ing a successful read.
Figure 10.16 shows the analog photodetector signal for a noisy barcode when scanned 
(a) by an in-focus spot, and (b) by a slightly out-of-focus spot. The noise on the signal from 
the in-focus scanning spot, is apparent. The resultant reduction in the noise level due to 
scanning the same barcode with a slightly out-of-focus scanning spot is equally apparent.
By overlapping the focal zones of the individual holographic facets, as shown in Figure 
10.17, we can guarantee that all barcodes will be scanned by both an in-focus scanning spot 
and one or more slightly out-of-focus scanning spots. The slightly out-of-focus spots will 
be small enough to read the barcodes, but large enough to smooth out the substrate noise.
This in-focus/out-of-focus capability, which would be difficult to implement with con­
ventional scanning technology, is relatively simple to introduce with holographic scanning. 
One merely selects, during the master holographic disc design phase, the focal length for 
each of the facets that guarantees the desired amount of focal zone overlap.

10.4.2  Variable Light-Collection Aperture
There is more to successfully achieving a large depth-of-field scanner than simply provid­
ing multiple focal planes. If, for example, one designs a scanner with a 1-m depth of field 
where the optical throw (closest reading distance) is 200 mm (8 in) and the range (farthest 
reading distance) is 1200 mm (47 in), then the variation in the light level returned to the 
detector, for barcodes with identical reflection characteristics, will be 36:1, the square of 
the ratio of the far and near distances. This places a severe dynamic range requirement on 
the analog electronics in the scanner. The problem is worse in practice since other factors, 
such as label skew and label reflectivity variations, also affect the amount of light returned.

In order to reduce the variation in the light level of the return light in a multiple-focal-
plane scanning system, it would be desirable to vary the light-collection aperture to com­
pensate for changes in the distance to the barcode being scanned. One could then use a 
relatively small aperture for a near-focus scan line and a relatively larger aperture for a 
far-focus scan line.
Holographic scanning allows one to do exactly that. Figure 10.18 shows a holographic 
scanning disc designed for focus distances ranging from 1000 to 1680 mm (39.5 to 66 in). 
Notice that the light collection area of each facet is different. The facet with the shortest 
focal length has the smallest light collection area while the facet with the longest focal 
length has the largest light collection area. The light collection area of each of the remain­
ing intermediate facets is a direct function of its focal length.
This difference in light collection area for the near and far facets of the holographic disc 
allows the light collection to be approximately uniform over the total depth of field of the 
scanner. This is a major advantage in obtaining decoding accuracy over a large depth of 
field for a barcode scanning system.
10.4.3  Facet Identification and Scan Tracking
Note that the disc design shown in Figure 10.18 incorporates a gap in the outer annulus 
between two of the holographic facets. This gap may be transparent or opaque, depending 
on the application, and is referred to as the home-pulse gap. Because the outgoing laser 
beam is incident on the disc in this outer section, a detector placed in the proper location 
above the disc can sense this gap by measuring the laser power incident on the detector. 
As the gap passes over the laser the change in power recognized by the detector gener­
ates a home pulse in the analog signal. With this information embedded in the signal we 
can determine the rotational speed of the disc and, thereby, where on the disc the laser 
beam is currently incident. This knowledge can then be used to determine what facet is 
currently scanning, and even where in that facet the beam is located. This method of facet

identification can be used in several ways to improve the decoding accuracy of the scan­
ner, as well as provide for additional features.
If we knew, for example, that we were on a short-focus facet, we could decrease the elec­
trical gain in the analog electronics. If we were on a long-focus facet, we could increase the 
gain of the analog electronics. This electronic automatic gain control (AGC) would add to 
the already existing optical AGC, introduced by the variable light-collection aperture, to 
further improve the decoding accuracy.
We could also vary the internal clock rate from facet to facet to improve resolution. 
Because the scanner is an angular scanner, the linear velocity of the scanning beam will 
vary directly with the distance from the scanner. The bit rate seen by the detector while 
scanning with a long-focus facet would be greater than the bit rate seen when scanning 
with a short-focus facet, assuming that the code density is the same in both cases. By mak­
ing the clock rate vary from facet to facet to maintain the optimum clock rate for a given bit 
rate, we could, once again, improve the decoding accuracy of the scanner.
An additional capability made possible by this facet identification feature is scan track­
ing, for which several patents have been filed by Metrologie Instruments, Blackwood, NJ 
(U.S. patent numbers 6,382,515 B1; 6,457,642 B1; 6,517,004 B2; and 6,554,189 B1). Knowing pre­
cisely where the incident beam is striking each facet at each instant in time allows indirect 
determination of where the item being scanned is located in a given three-dimensional, 
spatial reference system. This knowledge is extremely useful in fully automated systems 
where little human interaction is desired, such as in scan tunnels in bulk-shipping centers. 
With the location of a scanned package identified, other automated mechanical systems 
can then redirect packages to their intended destination.
The reason holography lends itself so well to scan tracking is that the facets on a holo­
graphic disc are easily repeatable in the manufacturing process with high precision. 
Obtaining good repeatability of the deflector with mirrored scanning systems is more 
difficult.
10.4.4  Scan-Angle Multiplication
Holographic scanning discs used in barcode scanners are frequently designed to be illu­
minated with a collimated beam incident normal to the surface of the holographic disc. 
This illumination geometry provides a scanning spot that is free from aberrations across 
the entire scan line because the relative incidence geometry with respect to the hologram 
does not change as the disc rotates. This is a special case of the more general aberration-
free illumination geometry for rotationally symmetric systems in which the designed illu­
mination beam is a converging spherical wavefront, converging toward a point located on 
the rotational axis of the disc. (A normally incident collimated beam has a point of conver­
gence on the axis at infinity.) Under these conditions, the illuminating wavefront remains 
unchanged with respect to the hologram, always converging to the hologram’s design con­
vergence point even as the disc is rotated. Because the HOE was designed to produce 
an aberration-free diffracted beam when the incidence wavefront converges to that point, 
the diffracted beam remains aberration-free throughout the motion of the hologram. In 
essence, the playback (illumination) beam remains identical to the reference (recording) 
beam, which is the condition for zero aberrations.
If the holographic disc is designed to be illuminated with a collimated beam inclined at 
a non-normal angle, then some amount of aberrations will be introduced in the scanning 
beam. Each facet of the disc can be designed to still provide zero aberrations at the center 
of its corresponding scan line, but there will always be aberrations introduced as the disc 

508 
Handbook of Optical and Laser Scanning
rotates because of the resulting mismatch between the recording and playback wavefronts. 
The amount of the aberrations will be dependent on the amount of rotation away from the 
center of the facet and the amount of tilt of the collimated incident beam.
There is, however, one advantage to tilting the incident beam. It can be shown that a 
tilted, collimated reference beam will provide a greater scan-angle multiplication factor 
relative to an untilted, collimated reference beam geometry. A precise determination of the 
multiplication factor requires the use of a computer program because of the interdepen­
dence of the diffracted beam elevation angle (β in Figure 10.19) and the rotation angle (𝜙rot). 
A first-order approximation, accurate to a few percent for holograms whose construction 
geometry is not too extreme, can be obtained from the following simple relationship. The 
variable f represents the focal length of the holographic lens (facet). The other terms and 
the geometry are defined in Figure 10.19.

As an example of the effect of the tilted reference beam, consider a holographic facet 
with f = 350 mm (13.8 in), θskew = 40°, β = 66°, and r = 72 mm (2.8 in). For a normal reference 
(and incidence) beam (α = 90°), 𝜙scan = 0.605 𝜙rot, while for a tilted reference resulting in an 
incident beam tilted at an angle of 22° relative to the normal (α = 68° in Figure 10.19), 𝜙scan 
= 0.980 ørot. The relative multiplication factor obtained by using the tilted incident beam is 
1.62. This is a significant amount of scan-angle multiplication.
Scan-angle multiplication factors of this magnitude provide significant design flexibility. 
For a given scan length one could: make the disc smaller to produce a more compact unit; 
keep the disc the same size and add facets to provide more scan lines or to generate a more 
complex scan pattern; move the disc closer to the window to increase the light collection 
efficiency of the individual facets; or some combination of all three options. One may, of 
course, elect to use scan-angle magnification to just generate a longer scan line.
The incident-beam tilt angle, the aberrations, and the scan-angle multiplication factor are 
interrelated: the smaller the amount of tilt of a collimated incident beam, the smaller the 
aberrations; conversely, the larger the tilt, the larger the scan-angle multiplication factor. 
By careful selection of the tilt angle of the incident beam, one can get a significant amount 
of scan-angle multiplication while maintaining an acceptable amount of aberrations. The 
amount of aberrations introduced can be determined with a suitable ray tracing program.11 
Acceptable levels of aberrations are established by the individual application.
If, on the other hand, the incidence angle is dictated by some other mechanical constraint 
in the scanner system, the aberrations can be controlled, as alluded to before, by control­
ling the designed convergence of the incidence beam. The closer the convergence point is 
to lying on the axis of disc rotation, the less severe the aberrations will be. This, however, 
has the same trade-off as manipulating the incidence angle. As the convergence of the inci­
dence beam becomes shorter, the focal length, f, of the facet will become longer, perhaps 
even reaching or “passing” infinity and becoming negative. As this happens, the first term 
in Equation 10.8 gets smaller or, in the case of negative f, becomes negative, thereby cancel­
ing out some of the scan multiplication factor of the other two terms. Whether or not this 
is a disadvantage depends on what is more important to the application, scan-line length 
or spot quality.
10.5  HOLOGRAPHIC DEFLECTOR MEDIA FOR 
HOLOGRAPHIC BARCODE SCANNERS
All holographic barcode scanners today (2004) use a rotating circular disc as the substrate 
for the recording medium. Other geometries have been considered, but, for barcode read­
ing applications, the disc geometry offers a number of manufacturing advantages and is 
generally less expensive.
All of today’s holographic barcode readers also operate only in the transmission mode. 
It would not be impossible to develop a reflective holographic barcode scanner, but the 
transmission mode provides a simpler design, an easier manufacturing process, and less 
susceptibility to disc wobble.8
There are two general types of media suitable for recording HOEs on a disc surface for 
use in a holographic barcode scanner: surface-relief phase media, such as photoresist, 
and volume-phase media, such as bleached silver halide and dichromated gelatin (DCG). 
There are advantages and disadvantages associated with both types of media. For a 

510 
Handbook of Optical and Laser Scanning
more general review of the wide variety of holographic recording materials, see work by 
Bartolini14 and Smith.15
The major factors influencing the selection of the type of holographic medium are manu­
facturing cost, diffraction efficiency, and, as will be described, the scan pattern density.
10.5.1  Surface Relief Phase Media
There are only two significant surface-relief phase media presently being used for holo­
graphic scanning discs—photoresist, and plastic copies made either directly from photo­
resist or from intermediate copies of the photoresist. As will be discussed later, this latter 
type is probably the least expensive of all to manufacture in a high-volume process and, 
from a purely cost consideration, this medium would appear to be the best choice for a 
holographic deflector disc.
The major disadvantage of the low-cost surface-relief material is that when using a sim­
ple mechanical replication process the resulting diffraction efficiency will be relatively 
low, on the order of 30%. This is because a much larger grating aspect ratio (depth vs. spa­
cing) is required to produce high efficiency. Mechanically releasing such a high-efficiency 
copy from the master can be very difficult, often damaging the master and the copy. This 
is a major drawback in barcode scanner applications. The low efficiency means that a 
higher power laser must be used to get sufficient laser power onto the barcode symbol 
to obtain a good reading. The greater cost of the higher power laser may offset the lower 
cost of the disc.
It is possible to get high diffraction efficiency using a surface-relief medium for light 
that is incident on the disk in an S-polarized orientation.16,17 It is not possible at the present 
time, however, to mechanically replicate these high-efficiency surface-relief holograms 
because of the aforementioned aspect ratio of the relief profile. (An example of such a 
high aspect ratio is shown in Figure 10.20.) This means that original holograms, not inex­
pensive copies, would have to be used. In some holographic deflector applications, this 
is acceptable. In general, however, this is not an acceptable alternative for a holographic 
barcode scanner due to the higher cost of the discs and their greater susceptibility to phys­
ical damage. (Surface relief holographic discs cannot be protected by a cover glass since an 
index-matching adhesive would effectively eliminate the surface relief structure.)
The low diffraction efficiency of the mechanically replicated surface-relief material also 
means that the collected light will be low in a system employing the holographic facets of 
the disc in a retroreflective mode. This loss in collected light cannot be compensated by 
increasing the laser power further because of the limitations established by the federal 
laser safety standards. The only means left to compensate for the low diffraction efficiency 
in the collected light is to increase the size of the facets on the holographic disc. However, 
this reduces the total number of facets, hence the total number of independent scan lines, 
and the subsequent scan pattern density. In some barcode scanning applications, this may 
be an acceptable trade-off. In other applications, such a trade-off may be unacceptable.
For example, in supermarket/retail barcode scanning applications, the depth-of-field 
requirement is relatively moderate, so that a holographic scanner with as few as two focal 
planes can provide adequate performance. However, in industrial barcode scanning appli­
cations, the required depth of field may be as large as 1 m (40 in), or more, for medium 
density barcodes (barcodes with a minimum bar width on the order of 0.3 mm). This kind 
of depth-of-field requirement can only be met with a scanner that can provide a large 
number of focal planes. A holographic scanner can be designed to provide this capability, 
but the number of independent facets on the scanning disc must be as large as possible. 

Holographic Barcode Scanners: Applications, Performance, and Design 
511
Therefore, any reduction in the number of facets imposed by a low diffraction efficiency 
recording medium will reduce the depth of field.
For many retrocollection scanning applications even the “high-efficiency” holograms 
mentioned above do not have a high enough diffraction efficiency for good light collection. 
In order to eliminate specular reflection noise in a barcode scanner, a polarizer is often 
placed in front of the light detector. This is done so that one linear light polarization can 
be used for the outgoing, scanning beam while the other, perpendicular light polariza­
tion will return to the scanner, pass through the polarizer, and be detected. This presents 
a problem for surface-relief holograms in that an even higher aspect-ratio relief profile is 
necessary to diffract P-polarized light than is necessary to diffract S-polarized light. As a 
result, while the outgoing efficiency could produce a strong scanning beam, the light col­
lection ability would be relatively weak (or vice versa) requiring the same kind of trade-
offs as discussed above.
Even so, despite the relatively low diffraction efficiency of the holographic discs pro­
duced by mechanical replication, which is a surface relief process, the low cost of such 
discs make them very attractive in supermarket and retail barcode scanners in which com­
ponent cost is a major factor.
10.5.2  Volume Phase Media
Volume phase materials are capable of very high diffraction efficiencies, on the order of 
90% or more. Such high efficiencies means that the individual facets on the disc can be 
relatively small, even when the disc is used in a retroreflective mode. This means that 
there can be more facets on the disc, which, in turn, means that the scanner can generate 
more independent scan lines, resulting in a larger depth of field and/or a more complex 
FIGURE 10.20
Surface-relief hologram in positive photoresist.

512

scan pattern. The higher diffraction efficiency also means that a lower power laser can be 
used to generate the scan lines.
There are a number of materials that are suitable for use as volume phase materials in 
holographic scanners. The first material that comes to mind is bleached silver halide. In 
this process, the absorptive structure in a photographic emulsion hologram is chemically 
converted from metallic silver to a material having a refractive index different than the 
surrounding gelatin matrix.18–21 For example, the silver may be rehalogenated by exposure 
to bromine vapor. Holograms created with this material can have high diffraction efficien­
cies, on the order of 80% or more.22,23 Processing is relatively simple, and the holograms are 
reasonably stable. There are a few bleaches, however, that leave reaction products behind 
in the emulsion. Some of these products are photosensitive and exhibit printout effects, 
particularly when subjected to intense ultraviolet irradiation. Nevertheless, moderately 
efficient holograms can be realized, and the advantages of photographic emulsions, such 
as extended spectral response and speed, may be exploited. One practical disadvantage 
associated with this material is that the discs must be coated and sensitized by one of the 
major companies producing general photographic materials. Such companies are usually 
reluctant to stock odd substrate shapes (like discs) and coat them to a user’s specifications, 
in quantities that are, for them, relatively small. This creates a very real sourcing problem.
The next most attractive volume phase material is photopolymer.24,25 Cross-linking in 
these materials is produced when they are exposed to light of relatively short wavelength, 
blue to ultraviolet. When a photopolymer is exposed to a holographic fringe pattern at the 
proper wavelength, the periodic variation in light intensity of the fringe pattern produces 
a corresponding periodic variation in cross-linking in the polymer. When developed, the 
photopolymer will exhibit a periodic variation in refractive index corresponding to this 
periodic variation in cross-linking. These materials are relatively stable when exposed to 
normal levels of ambient light, heat, and humidity.
The main drawback to these materials has been their relatively small change in refractive 
index, Δn, produced by exposure to light and subsequent processing. This means that, in 
order to get high diffraction efficiency, the thickness of the photopolymer coating has to be on 
the order of 50 microns (2 mils). Such a large thickness would make the holographic deflector 
disc very sensitive to the Bragg angle. That is, very slight deviations in the angle of incidence 
of the reconstruction beam in the scanner would cause severe reductions in the disc diffrac­
tion efficiency. Deviations on the order of 1/4° (4.4 mrad) could cut the diffraction efficiency 
in half.26 This is generally unacceptable in a product where the total angular manufacturing 
tolerances could easily be this large. Furthermore, the anticipated mode of operation could 
cause the effective angle of incidence to vary by 1/4° (4.4 mrad) during disc rotation.
The DuPont27 and Polaroid28 photopolymers have exhibited refractive index changes that 
are much greater than those of previous photopolymers. Δn values approaching the values 
obtainable with DCG (nearly ten times as great as earlier photopolymer Δn values) have 
been obtained. These materials have great potential for use as a recording medium for 
holographic deflectors used in barcode scanners, since high diffraction efficiency should 
be achievable in relatively thin coatings, on the order of 5 microns (200 μin).
The volume phase material that has, up to now, been the most successful material for 
use in holographic deflectors for barcode scanners is DCG.29–31 The major advantage of this 
material, as a medium for holographic deflector discs, is that its diffraction efficiency can 
be very high (>90%) in a relatively thin (3–5 microns or 120–200 μin) coating because of its 
high Δn (0.10–0.15 or greater). This means that DCG can have, simultaneously, high diffrac­
tion efficiency and very low Bragg-angle sensitivity. This is a significant advantage from 
both a manufacturing and an application standpoint.

The major disadvantage of DCG is that it is extremely sensitive to moisture. Holograms 
made with DCG must be sealed to protect them from environmental moisture.
From the standpoint of the development of a barcode scanner, there is one other disad­
vantage to DCG. Although it has been around a long time, DCG is the least understood of 
all the holographic recording media. There are at least three theories that claim to explain 
the mechanism of image formation,32–34 and there are as many recipes for processing DCG 
as there are authors writing on the subject. Many of them start with gelatin that is already 
coated on photographic plates,35 a procedure which is unacceptable for the same reasons 
that bleached silver halide is unacceptable: the sourcing problem.
In most large corporations, one will also find considerable resistance to the use of DCG. 
Most chemists feel comfortable with well-understood inorganic materials, such as silicon, 
and the more traditional organics, such as photoresist, photopolymer, and so on. DCG is 
an organic material whose properties are poorly understood and relatively unpredictable. 
Gelatin is, after all, made from the skins, bones, and connective tissues of animals. Its 
properties can vary depending on what the animals ate or where they were raised.
Nevertheless, because of its excellent holographic qualities, DCG is one of the best 
recording materials for holographic deflectors used in barcode scanners. It is relatively 
stable when exposed to normal ambient temperatures. However, it is extremely moisture 
sensitive and must be sealed to protect it from normal ambient humidity.
DCG is generally sensitive only to the short wavelength portion of the visible spec­
trum, λ < 520 nm (20.5 μin), and although it is possible to sensitize it to the red end of the 
spectrum36–40 only moderate success has been achieved. The primary problem has been 
removal of the residual sensitizing dye to give a complete phase structure. For barcode 
scanning applications, where the light source in the scanner is generally a visible laser 
diode (VLD) with a wavelength somewhere in the red region of the spectrum, unsensi­
tized DCG cannot be used to make the master holograms at the operating wavelength. 
Because of this, the DCG holographic disc must be made as a copy of masters formed in 
one of two ways.
In the first method, the wavelength that will be used in the scanner is used to construct 
the masters with a material that is sensitive to that region of the spectrum, such as sil­
ver halide. This allows a relatively simple optical setup that will produce an aberration-
free hologram. Typically, DCG submasters (in the form of a submaster disc, or individual 
submasters) are made from the masters, providing greater efficiency to the production 
process.
In the second method, the masters are made directly in DCG using a wavelength within 
its spectral sensitivity range, such as 488 nm (19.2 μin), one of the high-power lines of 
an argon laser. The difference of the exposure wavelength from that which the scanner 
will employ requires some kind of aberration-compensating optics in the master-exposure 
setup. This makes the setup more complicated, but the result can be a higher-quality holo­
gram since the submaster step of the process is not needed, and the use of additional 
aberration-correcting optics will maintain the essentially aberration-free performance of 
the final hologram.
Whichever method is used, the DCG copy disc can then be made using any wavelength 
to which the DCG is sensitive. There will be no aberrations introduced in the copy process, 
regardless of the wavelength used in the copy process. We will have more to say about this 
in the section on disc fabrication.
DCG is processed in a sequence of alcohol/water baths of varying concentrations of alco­
hol and varying temperatures. Times, temperatures, and concentrations vary, depending 
on whose process is used.

Handbook of Optical and Laser Scanning
Diffraction efficiencies obtained with DCG approach the theoretical limits for volume 
phase materials. Efficiencies greater than 90% can be readily obtained. The only things 
limiting the diffraction efficiencies of a sealed DCG holographic disc are reflections off 
the glass surfaces and absorption and scattering losses in the gelatin. If antireflection (AR) 
coatings are not employed, the Fresnel reflections at the air/glass interfaces will cause the 
primary losses. This may limit maximum efficiency to about 70%, depending on polariza­
tion. If, however, good AR coatings can be applied, there will still be some minor Fresnel 
losses at the internal gelatin/glass interface and some small amount of scattering and 
absorption in the gelatin. If the film properties can be controlled enough to keep scatter­
ing to a minimum, then efficiencies of 95% are achievable. This control, however, is the key, 
and is sometimes easier said than done. Even so, efficiencies in excess of 85% are relatively 
easy to maintain.
10.6  FABRICATION OF HOLOGRAPHIC DEFLECTORS
10.6.1  The DCG Holographic Disc
One possible DCG holographic disc fabrication process using DCG masters (no submas­
ters) is shown schematically in Figure 10.21. Each facet of the holographic master disc is 
recorded individually using an argon laser and a vibration-isolated table. The facets are 
recorded on rectangular DCG holographic plates, which are then processed in the water/
alcohol baths. When a suitable efficiency is achieved, resulting in an optimum intensity 
ratio of diffracted to transmitted light, the facets are “capped” (sealed with another piece of 
glass using an index-matching optical adhesive) for moisture protection then cut to a size 
appropriate to an automated copy-exposure machine. They are then masked to provide 
the designed size and shape when exposed by the copy beam.
The DCG copy disc fabrication process resembles, but is not identical to, a photographic 
contact-copy process. All of the DCG masters are placed on a computer-controlled wheel 
in the appropriate sequence. When the exposure cycle is started, a DCG disc is brought in 
under the master wheel with a slight air gap between the disc and the master. Because of 
this gap the process is not a true contact-copy process and some settling time is required 
after the motion stops before the exposure can begin. In situations where relative motion 
between the master and the disc is not required (such as with a submaster disc), index 
matching fluid can be used between the master and the disc. This limits relative motion 
and also greatly reduces reflections at the interface. For air gap copying, AR-coated caps are 
recommended for the masters. During the exposure sequence each master facet swings into 
position and is then sequentially illuminated in a step-and-repeat exposure process, using 
an expanded beam from an argon laser. That beam may be collimated, divergent, or conver­
gent, depending on the desired characteristics of the copy HOE. The angle of illumination 
of the laser beam is modified from facet to facet considering each facet’s construction and 
the difference between the copy-exposure wavelength and the scanner wavelength.
Exposure of each master holographic facet creates an optically identical holographic 
copy facet in the DCG through the interference of the diffracted beam with the undif­
fracted zero-order beam. As long as the copy process is reasonably close to a contact-copy 
process there will be no aberrations introduced by copying, regardless of copy wavelength 
or exposure angle. The reason for this is that the recorded interference pattern in the 

Holographic Barcode Scanners: Applications, Performance, and Design 
515
hologram will accept any configuration of incidence beam and produce a corresponding 
conjugate diffraction beam. Because those two beams were created from that interference 
pattern, those two beams are the exact beams that will recreate that same interference pat­
tern, provided the recording medium is located in the same place as the master hologram. 
The more removed the recording medium is from the master hologram, the more the prop­
erties of the two will differ. For a very small space, the difference is insignificant.
When all of the facets of the DCG copy disc are exposed, the disc is processed in a 
sequence of water and alcohol baths. The process is essentially the same as the process for 
the DCG masters, although some of the timing may be different, and precise control and 
consistency are, ironically, more important in the production process than they are in the 
master process. This is because DCG can be reprocessed if the initial results are not satis­
factory; however, reprocessing leads to inconsistency and inefficiency, both of which are 
undesirable in a production environment. The details of the baths, the relative times, and 
the temperatures of the liquids, are proprietary.
A major objective in any DCG disc manufacturing operation is to establish a total expos­
ure and development process that provides consistent results and high yield. One of 
the more difficult problems encountered in attempting to do this is the problem of “gel

swell”—the tendency for the exposed and processed gelatin to be thicker than the unex­
posed, unprocessed gelatin. This residual gelatin swell causes a shifting of the Bragg 
planes within the thickness of the gelatin so that the angle of the Bragg planes, relative to 
the surface of the gelatin, is not the same after processing as it was during exposure (see 
Figure 10.22). This results in a decrease in diffraction efficiency when the reconstruction 
beam is at the designed incidence angle. Any attempt to increase the diffraction efficiency 
by changing the reconstruction beam angle will introduce undesirable aberrations.
A similar effect also occurs if the postprocessing bulk refractive index is different from 
that anticipated. A different refractive index causes the incident reconstruction beam to 
refract into the gelatin at an angle different from that expected and, thereby, meet the 
Bragg planes at the wrong angle. Because the bulk index in DCG is dependent on the 
amount of microscopic air voids present in the processed gelatin, the bulk index is sen­
sitive to changes in both the film preparation process and the water/alcohol process. In 
preparation, if the film is excessively hardened it will be more difficult to form voids and 
the bulk index will be higher. In general this also limits the range of the index modula­
tion, Δn. During wet processing, if the hologram is left too long in hot water the gel can be 
oversoftened, creating excessive voids and lowering the bulk index. This also can cause 
the problem of excess scattering losses since the voids can become larger and, therefore, 
make the gel appear less homogenous to the scanner wavelength.
Gel swell and bulk index changes are separate effects that can be separately mea­
sured; however, symptomatically they produce the same effect—reduction in efficiency 
due to “Bragg error.” Several methods of eliminating these undesirable effects have been 
described in the literature.35 Generally, these involve either some sort of postprocessing 
chemical treatment or some form of postprocessing baking of the hologram. None of these 
methods is predictable enough to be suitable in a manufacturing process. If, however, the 
gel swell is predictable and consistent, it can be compensated for in the copy process by 
reducing the calculated angle of incidence of the argon laser copy beam. This increases the 
Bragg plane tilt angle. After processing, the gel swell will raise the Bragg planes, decreas­
ing the tilt angle until it equals the original value. This process is described in greater 
detail by Dickson.42
If the processing methods are well controlled, so that the gel swell and bulk index are 
both predictable and consistent, then one can eliminate the Bragg error problem by alter­
ing the copy beam angle. Altering the copy beam angle, incidentally, has no effect on the 
optical properties of the holographic copy disc since these are fixed in the surface fringe

structure of the master. The copy process will always faithfully reproduce this fringe 
structure.
After the DCG disc is exposed and processed, several millimeters of the gelatin are 
stripped from the outer and inner edges to inhibit wicking-in of moisture in the sealed 
disc. The disc is then sealed with a glass cover disc for protection from moisture, using an 
index-matching optical adhesive. A metal hub is then bonded to the inner diameter of the 
disc and the disc is dynamically balanced.
The optical properties of each and every DCG copy disc will be identical to those of the 
master holographic disc. The optical characteristics of the holographic scanner are essen­
tially established at the time of the construction of the holographic master. While it is pos­
sible to modify these characteristics somewhat through variations in predisc or postdisc 
optics, this is generally not done in holographic barcode scanners.
10.6.2  The Mechanically Replicated Surface-Relief Holographic Disc
The other primary holographic recording material, photoresist, has a diffracting structure 
in the form of surface deformation or relief as shown in Figure 10.20.16,17 Consideration 
can therefore be given to using mechanical replication for mass production. This is not to 
imply that optical copying techniques cannot be used with surface relief, because they cer­
tainly can, either as master or copy or both.
Mechanical replication of surface relief is not new, having been developed decades ago 
for low-cost replication of mechanically ruled gratings. Today, it has become one of the 
primary manufacturing techniques of the production of high-quality gratings from holo­
graphic masters.43
Although replication of a surface relief hologram can be performed directly from 
the photoresist master, there is some danger that the photoresist may not stand up to 
repeated mechanical pressures, elevated temperatures, and/or the copy–master release 
process. Considering the difficulty and potential expense associated with master fabrica­
tion, a replication process that permits maximum replication volume is required. This is 
accomplished by the fabrication of a more durable submaster and usually results in the 
master itself being sacrificed. A very early technique, borrowed from the audiorecording 
industry uses a metal “stamper” to emboss or compression mold the relief into a vinyl 
thermoplastic.44,45
In the adaptation of this process,46,47 a very fine grain layer of nickel or gold is depos­
ited by evaporation or sputtering onto the relief to form a conductive conformal coating, 
typically a few hundred Angstroms thick. Nickel formation is then continued by other 
methods, such as electrochemical deposition, until a thickness of several hundred microns 
is achieved. At this point, the outer nickel surface has no significant relief and it can be 
attached to a rigid substrate. The sandwich is separated at the nickel/resist interface and 
residual photoresist dissolved away leaving behind a rigid metal replication of the relief. 
This structure is a negative of the original and can be used in hot pressing, injection mold­
ing, or epoxy replication processes, which will be discussed later.
An alternative method of submaster preparation is to transfer the resist relief down­
ward into its own substrate by radio frequency (RF) sputter etching or reactive ion etch­
ing (RIE) techniques.48,49 In these methods, the relief surface is removed at a uniform rate 
by bombarding the relief with accelerated ions or, in the case of RIE, with reactive atoms 
that react with the substrate molecules to form a volatile gas. The valleys of the resist pat­
tern disappear first and the underlying substrate is exposed and etching occurs. By the 
time the resist peaks have disappeared, the valley areas are deeply cut into the substrate. 

518 
Handbook of Optical and Laser Scanning
Proper choice of photoresist, substrate materials (such as silicon or quartz), and plasma 
parameters allows the surface relief to be accurately transferred into the substrate and the 
cross-sectional shape to be preserved.50 These processes result in a submaster having a 
positive replication of the original master in contrast to the negative shape of the previous 
nickel submaster.
Once fabricated, these more durable submasters may be used to generate multiple 
copies. One such method, thermal mechanical embossing or compression molding, is 
accomplished by pressing the relief into a heated and softened thermoplastic film such as 
polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA) or polyvinyl chloride (PVC). Bartolini and colleagues46 
rolled the submaster together with a vinyl strip between two heated cylinders. Gale et al.47 
used a conventional hot stamping press at 150 °C and 3 atm. to emboss into PVC sheets. A 
similar pressing technique was used by Iwata and Tsujiuchi51 with separation of the copy 
from the mold performed by sudden cooling and differential contraction.
Replication by pressing tends to introduce considerable strain and other inhomogene­
ities into the new substrate. These problems can be overcome by using injection molding 
techniques that have been developed for high-volume, high-quality fabrication of plas­
tic lenses.52 In this case, the submaster is one surface and an optically polished stainless 
steel flat is used as the facing, parallel surface. The appropriate polymer is plasticized to a 
more fluid state than used by compression molding and introduced into the temperature-
controlled mold under high pressure.53 Most of the materials in use are copolymers of 
PVC, polyvinyl acetate (PVA), and acrylic (PMMA) compounds. The acrylic material has 
an advantage over vinyl due to the lack of birefringence in the finished substrate, and the 
stability and ease with which it can be machined and polished.
The final alternative is to use a polymer that can be cross-linked by ultraviolet illumina­
tion.54 This technique eliminates the need for high-temperature processing and reduces the 
possibility of induced stresses and dimensional changes upon cooling/curing. An injection 
mold apparatus can be adapted for these purposes as long as one plate is sufficiently trans­
parent for the UV illumination. Depending on the use of release agents and relative adhe­
sion, the replica can also be attached directly to a rigid substrate in the same operation.
10.7  AN EXAMPLE OF A HOLOGRAPHIC BARCODE 
SCANNER: THE METROLOGIC PENTA SCANNER
As an example of a holographic scanner that uses most of the design techniques and meth­
ods discussed thus far we will now discuss the Metrologie Penta Scanner, an industrial 
application scanner that exploits many of the advantages of holography. First we will dis­
cuss the design of the scan pattern and then the means by which it is produced.
10.7.1  The Penta Scan Pattern
The Penta scanner was designed as a large-scale “pass-through” scanner. In general, it was 
designed to create an aggressive scan volume at some distance from the scanner through 
which packages would pass in a roughly uniform manner. Ideally, a large range of pack­
age sizes with barcodes of moderate resolution would be able to pass through the scan 
volume, either manually or automatically, and as long as the package was roughly facing 
the scanner it would be successfully scanned throughout a large depth of field.

Holographic Barcode Scanners: Applications, Performance, and Design 
519
This broad application definition places several requirements on the design. A large 
depth of field will require multiple focal planes. With no specification given to package 
orientation the scanner will have to read essentially all orientations. Also, the variety of 
package sizes requires a large scan pattern size coming out of the scanner. All of these 
requirements can be met, quite easily, with holography.
The name of the “Penta” scanner comes from the pentagonal configuration of the scan 
pattern, shown in Figure 10.23. The basic pattern is formed by combining five simple 
rasters (groups of parallel lines) of different angular orientation. The rasters are evenly 
spaced through an entire 360°, making this pattern omnidirectional. Omnidirectionality is 
an essential characteristic for a barcode scanner if it is desired that the operator not waste 
time trying to identify the proper orientation of the code for a good scan. In automated 
applications, where the highest efficiency is desired, packages often are presented in truly 
random orientations as they pass under the scanner on a conveyor belt.
Assuming a direction of package flow, as shown in Figure 10.23, the primary parameters 
that define the pattern are the scan line length, the line separation, and the number of lines 
per orientation group. These parameters must be combined in such a way as to provide the 
desired total pattern omniwidth (width over which full omnidirectional scanning is pos­
sible). At the same time enough overlap in the near-vertical fields must be maintained such 
that codes in the “ladder” orientation (i.e., codes travelling in the direction perpendicular 
to its own bars and spaces) cannot slip through the pattern unscanned.
This pentagonal pattern not only provides for omnidirectional scanning, but it is also 
very aggressive on codes with higher aspect ratios, which are more difficult to scan than 
square codes like the original UPC code. The smaller angle between adjacent scan-line 
groups means each group has a smaller angular range that it must cover, and, therefore, 
less code height is required. This also means there will be less reliance on software stitch­
ing algorithms, but such algorithms can still be employed to make the scanner’s perfor­
mance even better.
Once the optimum scan pattern is established, the task still remains to provide for a large 
depth of field. Since the optimum performance pattern has been determined, the logical 
conclusion is to repeat that pattern several times at different distances from the scanner.

Different focal planes are established providing acceptable overlap and producing a full, 
contiguous depth of field. For Penta four focal planes were chosen. A three-dimensional 
representation of the Penta scan pattern is shown in Figure 10.24.
10.7.2  The Penta Scanning Mechanism
The heart of the Penta scanning mechanism is, of course, a holographic disc. Also included 
are five scanning stations located around the periphery of the disc, each comprised of a 
VLD module prior to the disc and a folding mirror after the disc to direct the beams out 
the scanner window. A top view of the scanner with the cover removed, showing the five 
scanning stations, is shown in Figure 10.25.
A clearer view of the optics of a single scanning station can be seen from the side view in 
Figure 10.26. The dotted line in Figure 10.26 represents the outgoing beam path. The path 
starts at the VLD and is first roughly collimated by a conventional, aspheric lens. From 
there it reflects off a folding mirror, which directs the beam to the multifunction plate 
(MFP). The MFP is a multipurpose hologram, which, along with the VLD, lens, and mirror, 
finishes the subassembly of the “optics module.”
The VLDs used in barcode scanners today have certain inherent properties, some of 
which are undesirable. With the use of the MFP, however, some of the undesirable effects 
can be alleviated. The functions performed by the MFP include beam aspect-ratio modi­
fication, astigmatism reduction, and dispersion minimization. In fact, VLDs inherently

produce beams with an elliptical shape and a characteristic astigmatism. Both of these 
properties of the beam can be manipulated by a single MFP (or by more than one if a 
greater range of control is desired) by simply choosing the incidence and diffraction angles 
of the MFP properly. At the same time, the dispersion produced by the facets of the disc 
(natural to all diffraction gratings) can be minimized by the same MFP by countering it 
with its own dispersion.
Following the MFP the beam heads directly to the holographic disc, incident on it at a 
specified angle. This is where the primary pattern formation occurs. Each of the five ras­
ters in the pattern in Figure 10.23 contains four lines, and that pattern is repeated in four 
focal planes. This requires 16 unique facets on the disc, which were shown previously in

Figure 10.18. Each one of these facets has a different diffraction angle, θd, and a different 
focal length, f, which results in the beam being focused at a different distance, s. The result 
of combining all the different focal lengths and diffraction angles is shown in Figure 10.27. 
Choosing the right combination of focal lengths and diffraction angles results in scan lines 
that are laterally equidistant from the disc rotation axis, thereby reproducing the desired 
pattern at the different distances.
The solid lines in Figure 10.26 represent the path of the light reflected off a barcode as 
it makes its way to the signal detector. The light that is collected returns essentially along 
the same path by which it left the scanner, making the scanner a retrocollective system. On 
the way back the light has diffusely spread out to completely fill the aperture of the facet, 
after first being reflected off the large pattern-folding mirror. The light is then diffracted 
back towards the module; however, a collector mirror is in the path everywhere except for 
a small hole through which the outgoing beam passed.
This collector mirror generally has a parabolic or elliptical shape. The light incident on 
the collector is focused and directed upward to the signal detector; however, in order to 
get there it must, once more, pass through the disc. On this third pass, however, the desire 
is for the disc to not affect the beam in any way. In reality it is impossible not to have some 
losses occur, but if the disc is correctly designed and manufactured those losses need not 
be much worse than that of a plain piece of glass. This is due to the angular sensitivity of 
the diffraction efficiency of the holograms. A properly manufactured disc will only have 
high efficiency at the designed incidence and diffraction angles. Because the rays proceed­
ing from the collector to the detector are incident on the disc at angles far enough removed 
from the design incidence and diffraction angles, the resulting transmission of the disc is 
relatively high.

11.1  INTRODUCTION
It will be apparent to the reader of this book that there are a great variety of applications of 
lasers for which scanning devices are required, and that these applications include a wide 
range of performance requirements on the scanner. The basic specifications include speed, 
resolution, and random access time, and the choice of a scanner will be determined by 
these parameters. Acousto-optic (AO) scanners are best suited to those systems that are of 
moderate cost, since the cost of AO Bragg cells and the associated drive electronics are by 
no means trivial, and for which the resolution requirement is about 1000 spots. In addition, 
AO technology is most appropriate where random access times on the order of 10 μs are 
needed, or where it may be desired to perform intensity modulation on the laser beam, as 
in image recording. There are currently many systems employing AO scanners, perhaps 
the most familiar being laser printers, in which the scanner capability is an excellent match 
to the system requirements. Large-area television display was one of the first applications 
considered for AO scanners, and it performs this function very well, although such display 
systems are relatively uncommon. These, as well as other applications of AO scanners, will 
be described in detail in a later section.
The interaction of light waves with sound waves has in recent years been the basis of a 
large number of devices related to various laser systems for display, information handling, 
optical signal processing, and numerous other applications requiring the spatial or tem­
poral modulation of coherent light. The phenomena underlying these interactions were 
largely understood as long ago as the mid-1930s, but remained as scientific curiosities, 
having no practical significance, until the 1960s. During this period several technologies 
were developing rapidly, at the same time that many applications of the laser were being 
suggested that require high-speed, high-resolution scanning methods. These new tech­
nologies gave rise to high-efficiency, wideband acoustic transducers capable of operation 
to several gigahertz, high-power wideband solid-state amplifiers to drive such transduc­
ers, and the development of a number of new, synthetic AO crystals with very large figure 
of merit (low-drive-power requirements) and low acoustic losses at high frequencies. This 
combination of properties makes acousto-optics the method of choice for many systems, 
and is very often the only approach to satisfy demanding requirements. In this chapter,

the underlying principles of AO interactions will be reviewed, and this will be followed 
by a description of the materials considerations and the relevant acoustic technology. AO 
scanning devices will be described in some detail, including the important features of 
optical design for various types of systems.
11.2  ACOUSTO-OPTIC INTERACTIONS
11.2.1  The Photoelastic Effect
The underlying mechanism of all AO interactions is very simply the change induced in the 
refractive index of an optical medium due to the presence of an acoustic wave. An acoustic 
wave is a traveling pressure disturbance that produces regions of compression and rar­
efaction in the material, and the refractive index is related to the density, for the case of an 
ideal gas, by the Lorentz–Lorenz relation

where η is the refractive index and ρ is the density. In fact, this relation is adhered to 
remarkably well for most simple solid materials as well. The elasto-optic coefficient is 
obtained directly by differentiation of Equation 11.1:

where it is understood that the derivative is taken under isentropic conditions. This is gen­
erally the case for ultrasonic waves, in which the flow of energy by thermal conduction is 
slow compared with the rate at which density changes within a volume smaller than an 
acoustic wavelength. The fundamental quantity given by Equation 11.2, also known as the 
photoelastic constant p, can be easily related to the pressure applied, with the result

(11.3)
where P is the applied pressure and β is the compressibility of the material. The photoelas­
tic constant of an ideal material with a refractive index of 1.5 is 0.59. It will be seen later 
that the photoelastic constants of a wide variety of materials lie in the range from about 
0.1 to 0.6, so that this simple theory gives a reasonably good approximation to measured 
values.
The relation in Equation 11.3 follows from the usual definition of the photoelastic 
constant:

where ε is the dielectric constant (ε = n2) and e is the strain amplitude produced by the 
acoustic wave. From Equation 11.4 it is easily seen that the change in refractive index, Δn, 
produced by the strain is
	
Δn
n pe

(11.5)
where e is of the form e0 exp(iΩt) for an acoustic wave of frequency Ω. The magnitude of 
refractive index change typical for AO devices is not large. Strain amplitudes lie in the 
range 10−8 to 10−5, so that using the above expressions for Δn and p gives for Δn about 10−8 
to 10−5 (for n = 1.5). It may be somewhat surprising, then, that devices based upon such a 
small change in refractive index are capable of generating large effects, but it will be seen 
that this comes about because these devices are configured in a way that can produce large 
phase changes at optical wavelengths.
The relation defining the photoelastic interaction has been written in Equation 11.5 as a 
scalar relation, in which the photoelastic constant is independent of the directional prop­
erties of the material. In fact, even for an isotropic material such as glass, longitudinal 
acoustic waves and transverse (shear) acoustic waves cause the photoelastic interaction 
to assume different parameters. A complete description of the interaction, particularly 
for anisotropic materials, requires a tensor relation between the dielectric properties, 
the elastic strain, and the photoelastic coefficient. This may be represented by the tensor 
equation

where (l/n2)ij is a component of the optical index ellipsoid, ekl are the cartesian strain com­
ponents, and pijkl are the components of the photoelastic tensor. The crystal symmetry of 
any particular material determines which of the components of the photoelastic tensor 
may be nonzero, and also which components are related to others. This may be useful in 
determining whether some crystal, based only upon its symmetry, may even be consid­
ered for certain applications.
11.2.2  Isotropic AO Interaction
The most useful photoelastic effect is the ability of acoustic waves to diffract a light beam. 
There are several ways to understand how diffraction comes about; the acoustic wave 
may be thought of as a diffraction grating, made up of periodic changes in optical phase, 
rather than transparency, and moving at sonic velocity rather than being stationary. 
Thus, it is possible to analyze the diffraction as resulting from a moving phase grating. 
Alternatively, the light and sound may be thought of as particles, photons, and phonons, 
undergoing collisions in which energy and momentum are conserved. Either of these 
descriptions may be used to obtain all the important diffraction effects, but some are 
more easily understood on the basis of one or the other. It will be useful, then, to outline 
both of these approaches.
To examine the simplest case of plane acoustic waves interacting with plane light waves, 
consider Figure 11.1. Suppose the light wave, of frequency ω and wavelength λ, is incident 
from the left into a delay line with an acoustic wave of frequency Ω and wavelength Λ. If

the refractive index of the delay medium is n + Δn in the presence of the acoustic wave, the 
phase of the optical wave will be changed by an amount

if the length of the delay line is L. Some typical values οf Δ𝜙 can be obtained by assum­
ing L = 2.5 cm (1 in) and λ = 0.5 μm, with Δn reaching a peak value of 10−5. This yields a 
phase change of π rad, which is, of course, quite large. It is large because L/λ, the number of 
optical wavelengths, is 50,000, so that a very small Δn can still produce a sizable ∆𝜙. If the 
electric field incident on the delay line is represented by

We shall not give a detailed derivation of the resulting temporal and spatial distribu­
tion of the light field, but we can use intuition and analogy with radiowave modulation 
to arrive at the resultant fields. It is well known from radio frequency (RF) engineering 
that the spectrum of a phase-modulated carrier of frequency ω consists of components 
separated by multiples of the modulation frequency Ω, as shown in Figure 11.2. There is

a multiplicity of sidebands about the carrier frequency, such that the frequency of the nth 
sideband is ω + nΩ, where n is both positive and negative. The amplitude of each sideband 
is proportional to the Bessel function of order equal to the sideband number, and whose 
argument is the modulation index ∆𝜙. Although not shown by Figure 11.2, note that the 
odd-numbered negative orders are 180° out of phase with the others. The light emerging 
from the delay line is composed of a number of light waves whose frequencies have been 
shifted by nΩ from the frequency ω of the incident light. The relative amplitudes will be 
determined by the peak change in the refractive index.
In order to understand the diffraction of the light by the acoustic wave, consider the 
optical wavefronts in Figure 11.1. Because the velocity of light is about five orders of mag­
nitude greater than the velocity of sound, it is a good approximation to assume that the 
acoustic wave is stationary in the time that it takes the optical wave to traverse the delay 
line. Suppose that during this instant the half-wavelength region labeled η + ∆n is under 
compression and n − Δn is under rarefaction. Then the part of the optical plane wave pass­
ing through the compression will be slowed (relative to the undisturbed material of index 
n) while the part passing through the rarefaction will be speeded up. In this rough pic­
ture, the emerging wavefront will be “corrugated,” so that if the corrugations are joined 
by a continuous plane its direction is tilted relative to that of the incident light wavefronts. 
Because the optical phase changes by 2π for each acoustic wavelength Λ along the acoustic 
beam direction, the tilt angle will be given by θ ≅ λ/Λ.
The direction normal to the tilted plane is the direction of optical power flow and repre­
sents the diffracted light beam. Note that the corrugated wavefront could just as well have 
been connected by a tilted wavefront at an angle given by θ ≅ −λ/Λ. This corresponds to 
the first negative order, the other to the first positive order. At this point we will note that 
an important consideration in the operation of AO Bragg cells, or for that matter of most 
ultrasonic devices, is the ratio of the acoustic wavelength Λ to the transducer length L. The 
assumption that the acoustic energy propagates as a plane wave is valid when this ratio is 
very small or when there is little diffraction of the wave. However, when this ratio is not 
large, the acoustic propagation is more properly described in terms of the sum of plane 
waves, the angular spectrum of such plane waves increasing as the ratio increases. If we 
consider that partial wave which is propagating at an angle λ/Λ to the forward direction, 
then we see that the light that has been diffracted into the first order may be diffracted a 
second time by this partial wave into an angle 2θ = 2λ/Λ, and that the frequency of this 
light will once again be upshifted, for a total frequency shift of 2ω. If the angular spectrum

of acoustic waves contains sufficient power of still higher orders, then this process can be 
repeated again, so that light will be multiply diffracted into higher order angles, ηθ = nλ/Λ 
each with a frequency shift nω. A similar argument holds for the negative orders, so that a 
complete set of diffracted light beams will appear as shown in Figure 11.3, where the angu­
lar deflection corresponding to the nth order is given by θη ≅ ± ηλ/Λ and the frequency of 
the light deflected into the nth order is ω ± nΩ. The intensity of the carrier wave, or zeroth 
order, will be zero when the modulation index ∆𝜙 is equal to 2.4. The generally impor­
tant first order will have a maximum value of 34% of the input for ∆𝜙 = 1.8, decreasing for 
higher modulation. These phenomena were described by Debye and Sears1 and are often 
referred to as Debye–Sears diffraction. Similar observations were published almost simul­
taneously by Lucas and Biquard.2 An extensive theoretical analysis of the effect was given 
by Raman and Nath,3 and so it is alternatively referred to as Raman–Nath diffraction. A 
distinctive feature of this type of diffraction is that it is limited to low acoustic frequen­
cies (or relatively long wavelengths). The origin of this limitation lies in the diffraction 
spreading of the light beam as it traverses apertures formed by the columns of compres­
sion and rarefaction in the acoustic beam. If the length of the acoustic beam along the light 
propagation direction is large enough, the diffraction spread of the light between adjacent 
compression and rarefaction regions will overlap, so that the Debye–Sears model is no 
longer valid. To estimate the characteristic length L0 that bounds the Debye–Sears model, 
suppose the compression and rarefaction apertures are one-half an acoustic wavelength, 
Λ/2, so that the angular diffraction spread of the light is δ𝜙 ≈ 2λ/Λ. Then L0 can be defined 
as that interaction length for which the aperture diffraction spreads the light by one-half 
an acoustic wavelength,

The interaction length is sometimes expressed in terms of a ratio known as the Raman–
Nath parameter (often referred to as the Klein–Cook parameter) Q, as

Devices with interaction length Q < π are said to operate in the Raman–Nath regime, while 
devices with Q > 4π are said to operate in the Bragg regime. For typical values of L = 1 cm 
and λ = 6.33 × 10−5 cm, Q = 1 for Λ = 0.0159 cm (0.006 in), which corresponds to a frequency 
of 31.4 MHz for a material whose acoustic velocity is 5 × 105 cm/s (2 × 105 in/s).
In the Bragg regime, the thin grating approximation no longer holds. If the incident light 
beam is normal to the sound beam propagation direction, the higher diffraction orders 
interfere destructively beyond L0, eventually completely wiping out the diffraction pat­
tern. In order for constructive interference to take place, the angle of incidence must be 
tilted with respect to the acoustic beam direction. To better understand what conditions 
must be satisfied for this, it is easier to think of the light and sound waves as colliding par­
ticles, photons, and phonons. In this description, the light and sound take on the attributes 
of particles, and the dynamics of their collisions are governed by the laws of conservation 
of energy and conservation of momentum. The magnitudes of the momenta of the light 
and sound waves are given by the well-known expressions

of as one in which the acoustic phonon is absorbed by the incident photon to form the dif­
fracted photon. Thus, conservation of energy requires that

Because ωi lies in the optical frequency range, and Ω will typically lie in the RF or micro­
wave range, Ω << ωi so that ωd ≈ ωi. This results in the magnitudes of ki and kd being almost 
equal, so that the momentum triangle of Figure 11.4a is isosceles, and the angle of inci­
dence (with respect to the normal to K) is equal to the angle of diffraction. This angle of 
incidence is easily obtained from Figure 11.4a as

It is called the Bragg angle because of its similarity to the angle of diffraction of X-rays 
from the regularly spaced planes of atoms in crystals. The configuration of these vectors in 
relation to the delay line is shown in Figure 11.4b. In order for diffraction to take place, the 
light must be incident at the angle θB, and the diffracted beam will appear only at this same 
angle. In contrast to the Debye–Sears regime, there are no higher-order diffracted beams. 
In the full mathematical treatment of the Bragg limit (Q >> 1), light energy may appear at 
the higher orders, but the probability of its doing so is extremely small so that the intensity 
at higher orders is essentially zero. The diagrams in Figure 11.4 show the interaction in 
which the diffracted photon is higher in energy than that of the incident photon, but the 
reverse can also take place. If the sense of the vector K is reversed with respect to ki, then 
ωd = ωi − Ω, and the diffracted negative first-order results.
It is important to understand that the Debye–Sears effect and Bragg diffraction are not 
different phenomena, but are the limits of the same mechanism. The Raman–Nath param­
eter Q determines which is the appropriate limit for a given set of values λ, Λ, and L. Quite 
commonly in practice, these values will be chosen such that neither limit applies, and Q ≈ 
1. In this case, the mathematical treatment is quite complex, and experimentally it is found 
that one of the two first-order diffracted beams may be favored, but that higher orders will

Having obtained the angular behavior of light diffracted by acoustic waves, the next 
most important characteristic is the intensity of the diffracted beam. Again, the full math­
ematical treatment is beyond the scope of this book, but a very good intuitive calculation 
leads to results that are useful. Referring to the spectrum of a phase-modulated wave

from which it can be seen that, in general, the most important factors leading to high AO 
efficiency will be a high refractive index and a low acoustic velocity. This does not guar­
antee a large figure of merit, since the photoelastic constant may be very small, or even 
zero.
The other factors in Equation 11.25 have the following effect on the diffraction efficiency. 
The efficiency decreases quadratically with increasing wavelength, so that the power 
requirements for operation in the infrared (IR) may be hundreds of times that required for 
the visible. For high efficiency, it will be desirable to have a large aspect ratio, L/H, leading 
to a configuration as shown in Figure 11.5. It is difficult to make conventional bulk devices 
with H much less than 1 mm, so that aspect ratios up to about 50 can be achieved. Much 
higher aspect ratios can be reached in guided optical wave devices. A more exact calcula­
tion of the diffraction efficiency in the Bragg regime4 yields the result

If the remaining parameters are L = 1 cm and λ = 0.6 μm, then by assuming a maximum 
acoustic power density for CW operation of 1 W/cm2 (107 ergs/cm2 s), the maximum obtain­
able efficiency is 15%. We shall see later, however, that materials and designs are available 
that are capable of realizing higher efficiencies with lower power levels.
11.2.3   Anisotropic Diffraction
Optical materials such as glass, or crystals with cubic structure, are isotropic with respect 
to their optical properties; that is, they do not vary with direction. Many crystals, on the 
other hand, are of such structure, or symmetry, that their optical properties depend on the 
direction of polarization of the light in relation to the crystal axes. They are birefringent; 
that is, the refractive index is different for different direction of light polarization.
The theory of diffraction of light thus far presented has assumed that the optical medium 
is isotropic, or at least that it is not birefringent. A number of important AO devices make 
use of the properties of birefringent materials, so a brief description of the important char­
acteristics of anisotropic diffraction will be given here. The essential difference from dif­
fraction in isotropic media is that the momentum of the light,
	
k

(11.28)
will in general, be different for different light polarization directions. Thus, the vector 
diagram representing conservation of momentum will no longer be the simple isosceles 
triangle of Figure 11.4a. The momentum vectors for light that is ordinary polarized will 
terminate on a circle, as shown in Figure 11.6, while those for light that is extraordinary 
polarized will terminate on the ellipse of Figure 11.6.
To understand the effect of anisotropy on diffraction, it is necessary to mention another 
phenomenon that occurs when light interacts with shear acoustic waves, that is, waves 
in which the displacement of matter is perpendicular to the direction of propagation of 
the acoustic wave. A shear acoustic wave may cause the direction of polarization of the 
diffracted light to be rotated by 90°. The underlying reason for this is that the shear dis­
turbance induces a birefringence which acts upon the incident light as does a birefringent 
plate; in other words, it causes the plane of polarization to be rotated. This phenomenon 
occurs in isotropic materials as well as in anisotropic materials; however, in isotropic 
materials the momentum vector, k = 2πn/λ0, will be the same for both polarizations, so 
there is no effect on the diffraction relations. Suppose, instead, that the interaction occurs 
in a birefringent crystal in a plane containing the optic axis. Let us choose the example as 
shown in the index surfaces in Figure 11.6, in which the incident light is an extraordinary 
ray and the diffracted light is an ordinary ray. For this example,

and the angles of incidence, θi, and diffraction, θd, are in general not equal. The theory of

These angles are plotted in Figure 11.7 about that frequency fm, for which there is a mini­
mum in the angle of incidence. These curves, the general shapes of which are similar for 
all birefringent crystals, have a number of interesting characteristics that are useful for 
several types of AO devices. The minimum frequency for which an interaction may take 
place corresponds to θi = 90° and θd = −90°, for which all three vectors will be collinear, as 
shown in Figure 11.8. It is easily shown that for this case, since the vector equation for con­
servation of momentum can be written as a scalar equation,

In fact, the roles of the two curves in Figure 11.7 would be reversed by interchanging ni 
and nd.
Another interesting region of anisotropic diffraction occurs at the minimum value in the 
curve representing θi, at which frequency θd = 0. This frequency, fm, is obtained by setting 
the quantity in brackets in Equation 11.31 equal to zero:

The significance of this point is that the angle of incidence of a scanned beam is relatively 
insensitive to change over a very broad range of frequencies. This frequency has important 
implications for the design of scanners because the bandwidth can be much greater than 
for a comparable isotropic scanner. Because the incident beam angle reaches a minimum 
value while the diffracted beam angle passes through zero at this point, and increases 
approximately linearly with frequency, the Bragg angle matching can be maintained over 
a large range, as will be described later. It will be seen that it is very difficult to achieve an 
interaction bandwidth this large by any other method.
The description of the interaction of light with sound we have given above is perhaps the 
simplest in terms of giving an intuitive understanding of the phenomena. Other descrip­
tions, with totally different mathematical formalisms, have been carried out, and these 
lead to many details and subtleties in the behavior of AO systems that are beyond the 
scope of this book. Exact calculations have been carried out to extend the range of valid­
ity7 from the limits allowed by the Raman–Nath theory,8 and this has been experimentally 
investigated.9 Other studies have also been carried out to give accurate numerical results 
for the intensity distribution of light in the various diffraction orders.10 The diffraction pro­
cess has been reviewed and analyzed by Klein and Cook,11 using a coupled mode formula­
tion, and there is continuing recent interest in refining the plane-wave scattering theory 
to give explicit results for intermediate cases.12,13 Finally, the AO interaction can be viewed 
as a parametric process in which the incident optic wave mixes with the acoustic wave 
to generate polarization waves at sum and difference frequencies, leading to new optical 
frequencies; this approach has been reviewed by Chang.14
One of the most remarkable materials to have appeared recently for AO applications is 
paratellurite (TeO2).15 It has a unique combination of properties, which leads to an extraor­
dinarily high figure of merit for a shear-wave interaction in a convenient RF range. It will 
be recalled that the anisotropic Bragg relations of Equations 11.30 and 11.31 led to a par­
ticular frequency, given by Equation 11.35, for which the angle of incidence is a minimum 
and therefore satisfies the Bragg condition over a wide frequency range. However, typical 
values of birefringence place this frequency around 1 GHz or higher. Of particular interest 
in TeO2 is its optical activity for light propagating along the c-axis, or (001) direction; the 
indices of refraction for left- and right-hand circularly polarized light are different, so that 
plane polarized light undergoes a rotation of its plane of polarization by an amount

Just as acoustic shear waves can phase-match two linearly polarized light waves, they 
can also phase-match two oppositely circularly polarized light waves. Thus, shear waves 
propagating in the (110) direction, with shear polarization in the (110) direction, will dif­
fract left- or right-hand polarized light propagating along the (001) direction, one into the 
other. The anisotropic Bragg relations apply to crystals with optical activity, where the 
birefringence is interpreted as

and the value of δ obtained from specific rotation is wavelength dependent. For the light 
and sound wave propagation directions described above, the acoustic velocity is 0.62 × 105 
cm/s (0.24 × 105 in/s) and the figure of merit, M2, is 515 relative to fused quartz. The fre­
quency for which the Bragg angle of incidence is a minimum, as evaluated from Equation 
11.35 for λ = 0.633 μm, is f = 42 MHz, a very convenient frequency. For other important 
wavelengths, the minima occur at 36 MHz for λ = 0.85 μm and at 22 MHz for λ = 1.15 μm.
The application of the anisotropic Bragg equations to optically active crystals was dis­
cussed in detail by Warner et al.16 They showed that near the optic axis the indices of 
refraction are approximated by the relations (for right-handed crystals, nr < n1)

The anisotropic Bragg angles (as measured external to the crystal) are shown in Figure 
11.9 for TeO2 at λ = 0.6328 μm. It is obvious that for frequencies around the minimum, it 
will be possible to achieve a much larger bandwidth for a given interaction length than is 
possible with normal Bragg diffraction; a one-octave bandwidth corresponds to a variation 
in angle of incidence for perfect phase matching of only 0.16°. A useful advantage of such 
operation is that large bandwidths are compatible with large interaction lengths, which 
avoids higher diffraction orders from Raman–Nath effects. For normal Bragg diffraction, 
on the other hand, large bandwidths can only be reached with interaction lengths that 
are so small that significant higher-order diffraction occurs. This decreases the efficiency 
with which light can be directed to the desired first order, and also limits the bandwidth 
to less than one octave in order to avoid overlapping low-frequency second-order with 
higher-frequency first-order diffracted light. However, tellurium dioxide operating in the

anisotropic mode can always be made to diffract in the Bragg mode with no bandwidth 
limitation on length, so that this feature combined with the extraordinary high figure of 
merit leads to deflector operation with very low drive powers.
An important degeneracy occurs for anisotropic Bragg diffraction, which causes a pro­
nounced dip in the diffracted light intensity at the midband frequency, where θi has its 
minimum. This degeneracy was explained by Warner et al.,l6 and is easily understood by 
referring to the diagram in Figure 11.10. Two sets of curves are shown in the figure; the 
solid pair represents θi and θd when the incident light momentum vector has a positive 
component along the acoustic momentum vector, and the dotted pair represents these 
angles when the incident light momentum vector has a negative component along the 
acoustic vector. In the former case, the frequency of the diffracted light is upshifted, and 
in the latter it is downshifted. The vector diagram for this process is shown in Figure 11.11. 
Light is incident to the acoustic wave of frequency f0 at an angle θ0, and is diffracted as a 
frequency upshifted beam, (v + f0), normal to the acoustic wave. This light, in turn, may 
be rediffracted; referring to Figure 11,.10, it can be seen that for a frequency f0 light that is 
incident at θ = 0° can be rediffracted to either θ0 or −θ0, In the former case, the light will be 
downshifted to the original incident light frequency v, and in the latter case it is upshifted 
to ν + 2f0. Note that this degeneracy can only occur at the frequency f0 where light incident 
normal to the acoustic wave is phase matched for diffraction into both θ0 and −θ0. How the

light is distributed in intensity between the three modes will depend upon the interaction 
length and the acoustic power level. The exact solution to this is found by setting up the 
coupled mode propagation equations under phase-matched conditions. The result of this 
is that maximum efficiency for deflection into the desired mode at f0 is 50%. At low acous­
tic power, the deflection of light into the undesired mode is negligible; at high powers the 
unwanted deflection increases so that, for example, if the efficiency is 50% for frequencies 
away from f0, it will be 40% at f0. The theoretical response of such a deflector is shown in 
Figure 11.12, and is in excellent agreement with experimental results.
11.3  ACOUSTO-OPTIC MODULATOR AND DEFLECTOR DESIGN
11.3.1  Resolution and Bandwidth Considerations
Resolution, bandwidth, and speed are the important characteristics of AO scanners, shared 
by all types of scanning devices. Depending upon the application, only one, or all of these 
characteristics may have to be optimized; in this section, we will examine which AO design 
parameters are involved in the determination of resolution, bandwidth, and speed. Consider 
an AO scanner with a collimated incident beam of width D, diffracted to an angle θ0 at the 
center of its bandwidth Δf. If the diffracted beam is focused onto a plane by a lens, or lens 
combination, at the scanner, the diffraction spread of the optical beam will be

where F is the focal length of the lens. The light intensity will be distributed in the focal 
plane as illustrated in Figure 11.13. As an example for diffraction-limited optics, the spot 
size for a 25 mm (1 in) wide light beam of wavelength 6.33 μm at a distance of 30 cm (12 in) 
from the delay line is 7.6 μm (3 × 10−4 in). There are, however, aberrations that prevent this 
from being fully realized, as will be discussed later.
The number of resolvable spots will be the angular scan range divided by the angular

where τ is the time that it takes the acoustic wave to cross the optical aperture. The result­
ing expression is the time–bandwidth product of the AO scanner, a concept applied to a 
variety of electronic devices as a measure of information capacity. The time–bandwidth 
product of an AO Bragg cell is equivalent to the number of bits of information that may be 
instantaneously processed by the system. For an acousto-optic modulator (AOM) that is 
strictly a temporal modulator, a time–bandwidth product near unity is generally desired 
as the goal is often to modulate as fast as possible and therefore to minimize the aperture 
delay time. In contrast, for an AOD the time–bandwidth product is generally desired to be 
as large as possible to produce a large number of resolution elements.
There are two factors limiting the bandwidth of an AO device: the bandwidth of the trans­
ducer structure and the acoustic absorption in the delay medium. The acoustic absorption 
increases with increasing frequency; for high-purity single crystals the increase generally 
goes with the square of the frequency. For glassy materials, on the other hand, the attenu­
ation will increase more slowly with frequency, often approaching a linear function. The 
maximum frequency is generally taken as that for which the attenuation of the acoustic 
wave across the optical aperture is equal to 3 dB. A reasonable approximation of the maxi­
mum attainable bandwidth is Δf = 0.7fmax, so that we may derive some relationships for the 
maximum number of resolution elements.

from which it can be seen that, in principle, it is always advantageous to make the delay

which is independent of the size of the aperture, being determined only by the material 
attenuation constant and the acoustic velocity.
In the next section we will review material considerations in some detail, and see what 
the performance limits are of currently available AO materials. As a numerical example, 
however, the highest-quality fused quartz has an attenuation of about 3 dB/cm at 500 MHz 
and an acoustic velocity of 5.96 × 105 cm/s (2.35 × 105 in/s) (for longitudinal waves), leading 
to Nmax = 560.
11.3.2  Interaction Bandwidth
The number of resolution elements will be determined by the frequency bandwidth of 
the transducer and delay line, but a number of other bandwidth considerations are also of 
importance for the operation of a scanning system. While a large value of τ leads to a large 
value of N, the speed of the device is just equal to l/τ. That is, the position of a spot cannot 
be changed randomly in a time less than τ. If the acoustic cell is being used to temporally 
modulate the light as well as to scan, then obviously the modulation bandwidth will simi­
larly be limited by the travel time of the acoustic wave across the optical aperture. In order 
to increase the modulation bandwidth, the light beam must be focused to a small width, ω, 
in the acoustic field. The 3 dB modulation bandwidth is approximately

It can be seen from Equation 11.58 that the modulation bandwidth for a diffraction-lim­
ited focused Gaussian beam can be very high; for example, for a material of acoustic veloc­
ity 5 × 105 cm/s (2 × 105 in/s) the bandwidth of a 0.633 μm light beam focused with an f/10 
lens is about 1 GHz. Such a system, however, is practically useless, because the diffraction 
efficiency would be extremely small.
In order for the Bragg interaction bandwidth to be large, there must be a large spread of 
either the acoustic or the optical beam directions, δθa and δθ0, respectively, or both. This 
spread may occur either by focusing, which in the case of the acoustic beam is achieved by 
curving the plane of the transducer, or it may be due simply to the aperture diffraction for 
both beams. It follows from fairly simple arguments that the optimum configuration for 
the most efficient utilization of optical and acoustic energy corresponds to approximately 
equal angular spreading, δθ0 ≅ δθa, as illustrated in Figure 11.14.
For an AOD, the angular spread of the acoustic beam should be made large enough to 
match Bragg diffraction over the frequency range of the transducer-driving circuit band­
width. As mentioned previously, this will result in some reduction in efficiency. To examine 
the relationship between bandwidth and the efficiency, we must first state another well-
known result of acoustically diffracted light. This is, as shown by Cohen and Gordon,l7 
that the angular distribution of the diffracted light will represent the Fourier transform of 
the spatial distribution of the acoustic beam. This Fourier transform pair is illustrated in 
Figure 11.15 for the usual case of the rectangular acoustic beam profile. It seems intuitively 
obvious for this simple case, in which the diffraction spread of the incident optical beam is 
ignored, that there will be components in the diffracted light corresponding to the acoustic 
field side lobes. It is shown in Reference 17 that the Fourier transform relationship holds 
for an arbitrary acoustic beam profile.
For the rectangular profile, the angular dependence of the diffracted light, illustrated in 
Figure 11.15, is

Other methods of achieving a large interaction bandwidth include transducer designs 
that steer the acoustic beam in direction in order to track the Bragg angle as it changes with 
frequency. A description of beam steering will be included in the section on transducers. 
Still another figure of merit was introduced by Dixon18 in connection with wideband AO 
devices. Because the power requirements decrease as the transducer height H decreases, it 
is advantageous to make H as small as possible. If there are no limitations on the minimum 
size of H, it can be as small as the optical beam waist in the region of the interaction, hmin.

Note that the optical wavelength appears as l0

operation at long wavelengths is relatively more difficult in terms of power requirements 
for configurations optimizing bandwidth as well as efficiency.
11.3.3  Deflector Design Procedure
The useful optical aperture of a Bragg cell is usually considered to be that length across 
which the difference in acoustic attenuation between the highest and the lowest frequen­
cies within the operating bandwidth of the cell is 3 dB. A particular application may dic­
tate either a bandwidth or a resolution, that is, a time–bandwidth product. In general, an 
optimized Bragg cell design will maximize the number of resolvable spots, as well as other 
transducer structure parameters.

Acousto-Optic Scanners and Modulators 
549
The number of resolvable spots, or the time–bandwidth product, will be determined 
by three key factors:19 the acoustic attenuation Γ, the optical aperture of the AO crystal D, 
the angular beam spreading of the acoustic wave, which is determined by the transducer 
length L, and the acoustic wavelength. The constraints placed upon the number of resolv­
able spots N by these three factors is given by the relations19

where Λc is the acoustic wavelength at the center frequency, Λ1 is the acoustic wavelength 
at 1 GHz, and Γ is the acoustic attenuation in dB per unit length, normalized to 1 GHz 
(under the usual assumption that the attenuation increases quadratically with frequency). 
Note that Equation 11.70 allows for a 3-dB attenuation. Once the center frequency and the 
bandwidth of the cell have been determined, the transducer structure must be designed. 
This will include the electrode length L and height H. The length must be chosen so that 
it is small enough to allow sufficient beam spread to satisfy the Bragg angle matching 
requirements over the desired bandwidth (for a fixed angle of incidence of the optical 
beam). At the same time, the diffraction efficiency will decrease as L decreases, so that we 
will want L to be as large as possible within the interaction bandwidth constraint.
11.3.4  Modulator Design Procedure
AOD and AOM have very similar design requirements and in some cases, one design may 
be suitable for either application or both. While the key design parameter for deflectors is 
typically the number of resolvable spots, the key design parameter for modulators is typ­
ically rise time or modulation bandwidth. These differing design parameters lead to the 
characteristic that, for deflectors, the optical aperture is typically made as large as possible, 
while for modulators, the optical beam is made as small as possible.
The rise time of an AOM is fundamentally limited by the acoustic velocity of the modulator 
material. When an acoustic pulse is transmitted from the transducer, diffraction will begin 
when the leading edge of the pulse reaches the optical beam. Full, diffracted beam power will 
not be obtained until the acoustic wavefront reaches the opposite end of the optical beam. The 
shape of the rising optical pulse will depend on the shape of the optical beam.
For a Gaussian optical beam, the time required for the acoustic wave to cross the 1/e2 
beam diameter is
	
t= D

(11.73)
where Va is the acoustic velocity. This beam width corresponds to a rise time from 2.3% to 
97.7%. The more conventional rise time from 10% to 90% is calculated as
	
tR = 0 64
.
t	
(11.74)

550 
Handbook of Optical and Laser Scanning
For video modulation applications, the rise time limits the frequency response of the 
modulator. The modulator bandwidth can be expressed as the frequency at which 3 dB 
roll-off occurs, which is estimated by the standard relation
	
f

(11.75)
In the case of square pulse video modulation, the modulation speed may be defined 
by a specific dynamic extinction ratio requirement. For square wave modulation at fre­
quency f0, the dynamic extinction ratio is approximately 10:1. For high extinction ratios on 
the order of 1000:1, the maximum square wave modulation frequency is approximately 
f0/2. For a given rise time, the design beam diameter can be calculated using the above 
relations. Note that the optical beam cannot be made arbitrarily narrow because the beam 
must remain relatively collimated over the acoustic interaction length L. If the beam waist 
is too small, the beam divergence over the length L will result in a longer rise time than 
predicted based on the beam waist. The minimum value of L is constrained by the need to 
stay in the Bragg regime (Sec. 2.2) and achieve a specified diffraction efficiency (Sec. 2.3).
The above discussion of dynamic extinction ratio assumes that the static extinction ratio 
is not limiting. The limit of static extinction ratio is determined by the ability to discrimin­
ate the diffracted beam from undiffracted or scattered light. Scattered light is a function of 
the quality of the material and the surface finish of the AO cell and is typically the limiting 
parameter for static extinction ratio when the diffracted beam separation is made large 
enough. The beam separation between the zero- and first-order beams is given by
	
Δ
Λ
f
l
=
	
(11.76)
If the separation angle is made equal to the full divergence angle of the optical beam and 
a knife edge placed halfway between the zero- and first-order beams, approximately 2.3% 
of the blocked beam will pass the knife edge. This means the minimum static extinction 
ratio would be about 40:1. If the beam separation is increased to twice the beam angle, the 
optical power passing the knife edge is decreased to 0.003%. For most applications, this 
amount of beam separation is sufficient to make the extinction ratio limitation due to beam 
separation negligible. Using this condition with the formula of divergence of a Gaussian 
beam gives

Combining the above two equations gives the following condition for beam separation

Another consideration is that the angular acceptance window of the acoustic field should 
be large enough to allow Bragg interaction over the optical beam. If the angular acoustic 
field is too narrow, the optical beam will be apodized in angle, resulting in output beam

The null-to-null width is therefore 2πΛ/L. This width should be much greater than the

Remember that for Bragg interaction L cannot be made arbitrarily small. In practice, the

pression of higher orders, typically such that Raman–Nath parameter Q ≈ 12.
11.4  SPECIALIZED ACOUSTO-OPTIC DEVICES FOR SCANNING
11.4.1  Acoustic Traveling Wave Lens
Most AO applications are based on diffraction effects, requiring interaction over at least a 
few periods sinusoidal index change in the acoustic media. However, it is also possible to 
use the index change over a fraction of a period to act as a lens to focus light by refraction. 
In this case, the index change produced by a segment of an acoustic wave can be viewed as 
a gradient-index cylinder lens moving with the speed and direction of the acoustic wave.
Consider a conventional scanning system with a single axis scan device, in this case an 
AO Bragg deflector, followed by a scan lens. The total number of resolvable spots in the 
scan is determined by the aperture size and scan angle of deflector, and can be determined 
approximately as the product of the bandwidth and the acoustic transit time (Equation 
11.50). The scan lens can be altered to change the scan length and spot size, but the total 
number of spots remains the same. However, the number of spots may be increased by 
adding a traveling lens after the scan lens as shown in Figure 11.16. In this case, the speed 
and timing of the deflector is synchronized with the speed and phase of the acoustic trav­
eling wave such that the input beam tracks the acoustic lens as it propagates in the scan 
direction. The acoustic lens reduces the scanned spot size but has no effect on the scan 
length, thereby producing spot gain.
11.4.1.1  Design Considerations
The sinusoidal index variation is approximately parabolic near the index minimum and 
acts as a focusing (positive) lens. A quarter-wave aperture centered on the index minimum 
will provide the lens with near diffraction-limited performance. The focal length of the 
traveling lens was derived by Foster:20

where Λ is the acoustic wavelength, n0 is the index of refraction, and ∆n is the peak refractive 
index variation. The focal length (F) in Equation 11.81 refers to the focal distance internal 
to the lens. It can also be viewed as the lens thickness required to produce a quarter-pitch 
lens. If the thickness of the lens is less than F, the effective focal length will be longer.
Foster also derived an expression for the f-number of the lens by considering the path of 
the extreme rays at ±Λ/8:

The above derivation uses the assumptions that the lens thickness is approximately equal 
to F and the input beam diameter (D0) is equal to Λ/4. In an application where the trav­
eling lens is the final scan lens, F is typically made less than the lens thickness such that 
the focus occurs outside the lens and with a back focal distance sufficient to reach the scan 
plane.
As an example, assume that a prescanner produces a linear scan of 50 mm with a 0.5-mm 
diameter beam of wavelength 633 nm. A traveling acoustic lens device made from dense 
flint glass (SF-59) will be added to provide a final spot size of 0.05 mm or spot gain of 
10. The required refractive index change (Δn) is determined to be 0.000157 from Equation 
11.84. The acoustic wavelength will be 4D0 or 2 mm, and therefore F is determined to be 
55.7 mm from Equation 11.81.

The length of the acoustic transducer (L), corresponding to the thickness of the lens, is 
chosen to be 45 mm, which is slightly less than F such that the focus can be outside the 
traveling lens device. The height of the transducer (H) is chosen to be 15 mm, such that the 
acoustic near field is longer than the scan length to prevent excessive acoustic loss along 
the scan direction due to diffraction spreading.
The amount of refractive index change is proportional to the square root of the acoustic 
intensity:

(11.85)
where M2 is the AO figure of merit and PA is the acoustic intensity. Using Equation 11.85, 
the acoustic intensity required is 2.6 W per mm2. The instantaneous power required is 
therefore 1800 W.
While the power requirement is very large compared to those for typical Bragg cells, 
the average power required can be reduced significantly by pulsing the acoustic signal 
once per scan line. Even so, the large instantaneous and average power requirements for 
traveling acoustic wave devices are a significant challenge to practical implementation. 
One way to reduce the power requirement is to narrow the AO cell height to a fraction 
of an acoustic wavelength to form an acoustic slab waveguide. The waveguide proper­
ties eliminate the acoustic diffraction spreading problem and associated need for a tall 
transducer.
11.4.2  Chirp Lens
In a typical AOD application, the transducer frequency is swept linearly over a range Δf to 
provide a linear angular scan (Δθ) of the output beam. This frequency sweep is referred to 
as a chirp. The equivalent length of the acoustic chirp is equal to the product of the chirp 
time and the acoustic velocity. If the aperture were large enough to cover the entire acous­
tic chirp, then the diffracted angle would vary over the range ∆θ along the chirp length as 
shown in Figure 11.17. Using the small angle approximation, the acoustic chirp acts as a 
lens with f-number inversely proportional to Δθ:

If the aperture is smaller than the chirp length, as is typically the case, then the f-number 
will be inversely proportional to the fraction of the chirp length covered by the aperture:

(11.87)
For a typical beam deflector application, the chirp length Tchirp is much larger than the 
acoustic aperture time T. In this case, the focusing power of the chirp will be much less than 
that of an f–θ lens, and can be neglected. For very fast scanners, where Tchirp approaches T, 
the chirp focusing effect may contribute to the number of scan spots. Note that if Tchirp = T, 
the chirp focusing effect is equivalent to the power of an f–θ lens. However, this arrange­
ment does not make a useful scanner, as the scan time is approximately the same as the 
access time.
By making the chirp smaller than the aperture length, the chirp can be used as a trav­
eling lens. The chief application of a traveling chirp lens is to employ it as a post scan lens 
as described in the previous section. The traveling chirp lens is diffractive, and does not 
require the high instantaneous acoustic power needed to produce the refractive quarter-
wave lens with comparable f-number. It also allows more flexibility with lens aperture, as 
the lens size is a function of chirp time and not a function of acoustic frequency. Unlike the 
refractive lens, the chirp lens is subject to diffractive losses and the diffraction efficiency 
may not be uniform across the aperture. Another disadvantage is that the quality of the 
lens is a function of the linearity of the chirp signal, such that phase error in the chirp sig­
nal will translate into aberrations in the lens.
11.4.3  Multichannel Acousto-Optic Modulator
AOMs are often used in conjunction with a scan beam to produce a raster scan. The scan 
line rate may be limited by the response time of the AOM, the exposure time, or the scan 
rate of the scan generating components. One way to increase throughput for a raster scan 
is to use multiple beams in a parallel scan arrangement. The beams may pass through a 
common set of scan elements, such that the final scans are identical except for position 
offset at the scan plane. Although scanned together, each beam must have its own modula­
tion sequence. This can be accomplished by using a multichannel AOM.
Multichannel AOM can be fabricated using the same number of steps as single-channel 
modulators, with the main difference being that an array of electrodes is deposited on the 
transducer substrate instead of a single electrode. In application, a parallel array of beams 
is registered to the transducer array of the modulator as shown in Figure 11.18.
The effect of one channel upon another is of particular concern for multichannel devices, 
especially as larger numbers of channels are integrated in a single device. Cross talk 
between channels can occur through a number of mechanisms including electrical cross 
talk in the feed circuitry or electrodes and acoustic cross talk between adjacent channels. 
Another cross-talk mechanism is thermal, where the heat load added from turning on one 
or more channels causes a thermo-optic or strain-optic effect that alters the output of an 
independent channel. Electrical cross talk is controlled by using good RF design practices 
including use of controlled impedance microstrip lines and providing good ground con­
tinuity from the feed circuitry to the transducer. Acoustic cross talk is dependent on the 
location of the optical aperture and the spacing between electrodes. Because the acous­
tic field in isotropic materials will spread once it propagates beyond the near-field zone 

Acousto-Optic Scanners and Modulators 
555
adjacent to the transducer, the amount of acoustic overlap is generally greater if the optical 
aperture is placed further from the transducer.
The degree of acoustic overlap between adjacent channels can also be manipulated 
through the electrode design. For an electrode with a simple rectangular shape, the acoustic 
intensity will have a sinc2 angular distribution, which has side lobes 13 dB down from the 
main lobe. Other shapes, such as diamond or Gaussian envelope, can produce much lower 
side lobe values, although sometimes at the expense of faster spread of the main lobe.
11.5  MATERIALS FOR ACOUSTO-OPTIC DEVICES
11.5.1  General Considerations
We have seen in the preceding section that two important criteria for choosing materi­
als for AO scanning systems are the AO figure of merit and the high-frequency acoustic 
loss characteristics. Other properties that determine the usefulness of a material are its 
optical transmission range, optical quality, availability in suitable sizes, mechanical and 
handling characteristics as they may pertain to polishing and fabrication procedures, and 
chemical stability under normal conditions. As with most components, cost will be an 
important factor, even when all the other factors may be positive, if competing techniques 
are available.
One of the limitations on the use of AO scanners before the late 1960s was the avail­
ability of materials with reasonably high figure of merit. As we have seen, fused quartz, 
which is used as the standard for comparison, has a figure of merit so low that only a few 
percent diffraction efficiency can be obtained for scanners of typical dimensions, and with 
RF powers that can be applied without causing damage to transducer structures. Water is 
a fairly efficient material, with a figure of merit about 100 times larger than fused quartz 
and has actually found use in some scanning systems. As with most liquids, it cannot be 
used at frequencies higher than about 50 MHz, so that large numbers of resolution ele­
ments cannot be achieved. Since the late 1960s, many new materials have been synthesized 
and existing ones were found to have excellent properties. Materials can now be found for 
most scanning applications from the UV through the intermediate IR where high band­
width is required.

The selection of a material for any particular device will be dictated by the type of oper­
ation under consideration. In general, it is desirable to select a material with low-drive-
power requirements, suggesting those with large refractive index and low density and 
acoustic velocity. If, however, high-speed modulation is of paramount importance, then a 
low acoustic velocity may lead to slower than required speeds. In the following section, we 
will review the factors and trade-offs involved in the selection of materials for various AO 
applications. Whatever the particular material requirements may be, there are also a num­
ber of practical considerations that dictate several generally important material properties 
whatever the application: (1) the optical quality must be high so that not only absorption 
but scattering and large-scale inhomogeneities are small; (2) good chemical stability is 
required so that protective enclosures are not needed to maintain integrity; (3) good mech­
anical properties are required so that the device can be cut and polished without extraor­
dinary procedures and can be adjusted and used with normal handling techniques; (4) the 
availability of crystal growth methods for obtaining suitably large, high-quality boules 
with reasonable cost is needed; and (5) a low-temperature coefficient of velocity is required 
to avoid drift of scan properties.
11.5.2   Theoretical Guidelines
There is no simple microscopic theory of the photoelastic effect in crystals. Therefore it is 
not possible to predict the magnitude of the photoelastic constants from first principles. 
However, Pinnow21 has suggested the use of certain empirical relationships between the 
various physical properties in order to systematize and group AO materials. It is well 
known that such relations exist, for example, for the refractive index and the acoustic vel­
ocity for such groups as the alkali halides, the mineral oxides, and the III–IV compounds.
A large amount of data has been collected on the refractive indices of crystals, and gen­
erally good agreement is found with the Gladstone–Dale22 equation
	
n
q E
i
i
i
−
= ∑

r
	
(11.88)
in which Ri is the specific refraction of the ith component and qi is percentage by weight. 
Reliable values of Ri have been determined from mineralogical data over many years. From 
the expression for the AO figure of merit, it is apparent that a high value of refractive index 
is desirable for achieving high diffraction efficiency. It is not, however, possible simply to 
select for consideration those materials with high refractive index, as even a casual survey 
shows that such materials tend to be opaque at shorter wavelengths. This trend was exam­
ined in great detail by Wemple and DiDomenico,23 who found that the refractive index is 
simply related to the energy band gap. The semiempirical relation for oxide materials is
	
n
Eg
2
1
15
=
+
	
(11.89)
where Eg is the energy gap (expressed in electron volts). For other classes of materials 
the energy gap constant will be different, but the same form holds. It can be seen from 
Equation 11.89 that the largest refractive index for an oxide material transparent over the 
entire visible range (cutoff wavelength at 0.4 μm) is 2.44. Higher refractive indices can be 
chosen only by sacrificing transparency at short wavelengths.

Pinnow21 has found that a good approximation to the acoustic velocity for a wide range 
of materials is obtained with the relation
	
log n
r
⎛
⎝⎜
⎞
⎠⎟= −
+
bM
d
	
(11.90)
where M  is the mean atomic weight, defined as the total molecular weight divided by 
the number of atoms per molecule, and b and d are constants. Large values of d are gener­
ally associated with harder materials, while b does not vary greatly for oxides. Thus, in 
general, low acoustic velocities tend to be found in materials of high density, as is intui­
tively expected. Another useful velocity relationship has been pointed out by Uchida and 
Niizeki;24 this is the Lindemann formula relating the melting temperature Tm and the mean 
acoustic velocity vm,
	
nm
m
cT
M
2 =
	
(11.91)
in which c is a constant dependent upon the material class. This relation suggests that 
high-efficiency materials would likely be found among those with large mean atomic 
weight and low melting temperature, that is, dense, soft materials.
In order for an AO material to be useful for wideband applications, the ultrasonic attenu­
ation must be small at high frequencies. An attenuation that is often taken as an upper 
limit is 1 dΒ/μs (so that the useful aperture will depend upon the velocity). Many materi­
als that might be highly efficient and otherwise suitable are excessively lossy at high fre­
quency. A microscopic treatment of ultrasonic attenuation was carried out by Woodruff 
and Ehrenreich.25 Their formula for the ultrasonic attenuation is
	
a
g
k
rn
=
2

5
Ω
T
	
(11.92)
where Ω is the radian frequency, γ is the Griinneisen constant, κ is the thermal conductiv­
ity, and T is the absolute temperature. This formula would suggest that the requirement of 
low acoustic velocity and low attenuation conflict with each other, since α ~ υ−5; it is quite 
unusual for materials with low acoustic velocity to not also have a high absorption, at least 
for the low-velocity modes.
The determination of the photoelastic constants of materials is essentially an empirical 
study, although a microscopic theory of Mueller,26 developed for cubic and amorphous 
structures, is still referenced. For both ionic and covalent bonded materials the photoelas­
tic effect derives from two mechanisms: the change of refractive index with density, and 
the change in index with polarizability under the strain. Both of these effects may have 
the same or opposite sign under a given strain, and one or the other may be the larger. It 
is for this reason that the magnitude or even the sign of the photoelastic constant cannot 
be predicted, since the effects may completely cancel each other. It is possible, however, 
to estimate the maximum constants for groups of materials. This has been done for three 
important groups with the result

In general, the photoelastic tensor components corresponding to shear strain will be less 
than those corresponding to compressional strain because there is no change, to first order, 
of density with shear; only the polarizability effect will be present. It is always possible 
that exceptionally large values of shear-related photoelastic coefficients may be found, but 
in no case could they be expected to be larger than the estimated value of Pmax . The maxi­
mum values of photoelastic constant are shown in Table 11.1 for a number of important 
oxides and other materials.
11.5.3   Selected Materials for Acousto-Optic Scanners
Among older materials, those that have been shown useful for AO applications are fused 
quartz, because of its excellent optical quality and low cost for large sizes, and sapphire 
and lithium niobate, because of their exceptionally low acoustic losses at microwave fre­
quencies. For IR applications germanium27 has proven very useful, as has arsenic trisulfide 
glass, where bandwidth requirements are not high. Among the newer crystal materials, 
very good AO performance has been obtained in the visible with GaP28 and PbMoO4.29,30 
One of the most interesting new materials to be developed within the past several years is 
TeO2,31 which along with PbMoO4 has found wide use in commercially available AO scan­
ners. More design details for devices employing this material will be given later. Among 
the new materials that have been developed for IR applications, very high performance 
has been reached with several chalcogenide crystals.32 Particularly important members of 
this group of materials include Tl3AsS4
33 and Tl3PSe4.34 The compound Tl3AsSe3
35 is partic­
ularly interesting beyond its possible use as an IR AOM material. Since Tl3AsSe3 belongs 
to the crystal class 3m, its symmetry permits it to possess a nonzero p41 photoelastic coef­
ficient, and it is suitable for use as a collinear tunable AO filter, a device first realized by 
Harris,36 using lithium niobate. Tables 11.2 through 11.4 summarize the properties of some

of the materials that have been studied for AO applications. The acoustic attenuation con­
stant in these tables is defined as
	
Γ = a
f 2
	
(11.93)
which supposes that the attenuation increases quadratically with frequency. This will be 
the case for good-quality single crystals, but not for polycrystalline, highly impure, or 
amorphous materials. For the latter, the constant given in the tables is a rough estimate, 
based on measurements at the higher frequencies. The light polarization direction is des­
ignated as parallel or perpendicular according to whether the light polarization is par­
allel or perpendicular to the acoustic beam direction. Table 11.2 lists some of the more

important amorphous materials, which may be useful if large sizes are desired or very low 
cost is required, but none of which can be used at frequencies much above 30 MHz. Table 
11.3 lists the most important class of materials, crystals that are transparent throughout 
the visible with very low acoustic losses. Table 11.4 lists high-efficiency crystal materials 
that are transparent in the IR and have reasonably low acoustic losses.
An overall summary of a few outstanding (in one or another respect) selected AO mate­
rials presented in these tables is shown in Figure 11.19. Using figure of merit and acoustic 
attenuation as criteria of quality, it is clear that a trade-off between these two parameters 
exists, and that the selection of the optimum material will be determined by the system 
requirements.
11.6  ACOUSTIC TRANSDUCER DESIGN
11.6.1   Transducer Characteristics
The second key component of the AO scanner after the optical medium, is the trans­
ducer structure, which includes the piezoelectric layer, bonding films, backing layers, and 
matching network. Recent advances in this area have made available a number of new 
piezoelectric materials of very high electromechanical conversion efficiency, and bonding 
techniques that permit this high conversion efficiency to be maintained over a large band­
width. Furthermore, the design of high-performance transducer structures utilizing this 
new technology has been facilitated by new analytical tools37,38 that lend themselves to 
computer programs for optimizing this performance.
The most elementary configuration of a thickness-driven transducer structure is shown 
in Figure 11.20. It consists of the piezoelectric layer, thin film or plate, excited by metallic 
electrodes on both faces, and a bonding layer to acoustically couple the piezoelectric to the

The electromechanical analysis is generally carried out in terms of an equivalent circuit 
model, first proposed by Mason.39 Several variations of the equivalent circuit have since 
been developed, but the one due to Mason is shown in Figure 11.21. The fundamental 
constants of the transducer are permittivity s, acoustic velocity v, and electromechanical 
coupling factor k. The other parameters are transducer thickness l and area S. With these

the coupling constant κ are used, it is possible to achieve large fractional bandwidths with­
out the necessity for electrical matching networks. As an example of the results obtained 
with this formalism, several plots of the frequency dependence of transducer loss for dif­
ferent values of the coupling constant are shown in Figure 11.23.
11.6.2  Transducer Materials
The piezoelectric material itself is perhaps the single most important factor governing the 
efficiency with which electrical energy can be converted to acoustic energy, this through 
the electromechanical coupling factor κ. The coupling efficiency is equal to κ. Prior to the 
discovery of lithium niobate, quartz was the most commonly used high-frequency trans­
ducer material, although its coupling factor, even for the most efficient crystal orientations, 
is rather small. The very-high-efficiency transducers were introduced with the discovery 
of various new ferroelectrics, such as lithium niobate, lithium tantalate, and the ceramic

PZT materials, lead-titanate-zirconate. While the PZT transducers have among the highest 
values of κ, up to 0.7, they are not suitable for high-frequency applications since they can­
not be polished to very thin plates. The most suitable piezoelectric transducer materials for 
high-frequency applications and their important properties are listed in Table 11.5, which is 
based on a compilation of Meitzler.41 In order to produce transducers in the high-frequency 
range, say larger than 100 MHz, the piezoelectric crystal must be very thin (<20–30 μm). 
There are three well-established techniques for fabricating such thin transducers. In the 
first method, the piezoelectric plate is lapped to the desired thickness by the usual optical 
shop methods and then bonded to the delay medium. This method becomes impossibly 
difficult for transducers of even small area as their frequency increases, because such thin 
plates cannot be manipulated. A much more convenient technique is to bond the piezo­
electric plates with a convenient thickness, say several tenths of a millimeter, to the delay 
medium and then lap the plate to the final thickness. In both methods, one electrode is first 
deposited on the delay medium, and in the case of thinning the piezoelectric after bond­
ing, the second electrode and back layers are deposited as the final step. Care is required in 
lapping the bonded transducer so that the base electrode is not damaged by the polishing 
compound. If a chemically active compound, such as Cyton, is used, the delay medium as 
well as the electrode may be attacked and must be protected by some appropriate coating, 
such as photoresist. The final electrical connection to the top electrode must be made in 
some fashion that does not mass-load the transducer and distort its bandpass characteris­
tics, or be so small as to cause hot spots from high current densities. The usual method is 
to bond thin gold wire or ribbon onto electrode tabs, as is done for electronic circuit chips. 
The most successful method for fabricating very-high-frequency transducers for longitu­
dinal wave generation is by deposition of thin films of piezoelectric materials by methods 
that yield a desired crystallographic orientation.42,43 The materials used are CdS and ZnO, 
whose properties are shown in Table 11.5.
Such piezoelectric thin films generally cannot be grown with values of κ as high as that 
of the bulk material, but in the best circumstances κ may approach 90%. Thin-film trans­
ducers with band center frequencies up to 5 GHz can be prepared by these techniques.

A problem that arises with large-area transducers, or even with small-area transducers at 
very high frequencies, is that of matching the electrical impedance to the source impedance. 
It is especially true for the ferroelectric, piezoelectric materials of very high dielectric constant 
that the impedance of the transducer may be so low that it becomes difficult to efficiently cou­
ple electrical power from the source to the transducer. This problem can be largely overcome 
by dividing the transducer into a series connected mosaic, as reported by Weinert and de 
Klerk.44 A schematic representation of such a mosaic transducer is shown in Figure 11.24. If a 
transducer of given area is divided into N elements, which are connected in series, the capac­
ity of the transducer will be reduced by a factor of N2. As an example, a 1-GHz lithium niobate 
transducer of 0.25 cm2 (0.4 in2) area would represent a capacitive impedance of only 0.038 Ω; if 
this area were divided into a 16-element mosaic, the impedance would be increased to 10 Ω. A 
40-element thin-film transducer is shown in Figure 11.25. The same considerations will apply 
at lower frequencies for transducers with large areas, about 1 cm2 or more. Because most 
ferroelectric transducer materials, such as the PZTs or lithium niobate, have high dielectric 
constants, the large areas will lead to very large capacitance values for frequencies far below 
100 MHz. Thus, large-area transducers are usually divided into multiple elements, which are 
then wired in series to obtain the desired 50-Ω impedance to match to the RF driver. A large-
area transducer that has been so wired is shown in Figure 11.26.

enlarging the interaction bandwidth is simply to shorten the interaction length in order 
to increase the acoustic beam diffraction spread. This is generally not a very desirable 
method to increase bandwidth for systems in which the light to the Bragg cells is colli­
mated because it wastes acoustic power; only those momentum components of the acoustic 
beam that can be phase matched to incident and diffracted light momentum components 
are useful. Furthermore, as the interaction length shrinks, the transducer becomes increas­
ingly narrow, with a corresponding increase in power density. This increase in power

density may produce heating at the transducer, which can cause thermal distortion in the 
deflector due to gradients in the acoustic velocity and refractive index.
An ideal solution to this difficulty would be one in which the acoustic beam changes in 
direction as the frequency is changed, so that for every frequency the Bragg angle is per­
fectly matched. The first approximation to such acoustic beam steering was carried out 
by Korpel45 for a television display system. This transducer consisted of a stepped array, 
as shown in Figure 11.27. The height of each step is one-half an acoustic wavelength at the 
band center Λ0/2, and the spacing s between elements is chosen so as to optimize the track­
ing of the Bragg angle. Each element is driven π rad out of phase with respect to the adjacent 
elements, and the net effect of such a transducer is to generate an acoustic wave with corru­
gated wavefronts, which are tilted at an angle with respect to the transducer surfaces when 
the frequency differs from the band center frequency f0. For this transducer configuration, 
the acoustic beam steers with frequency but matches the Bragg angle only imperfectly.
To understand the steering properties of such an acoustic array, which was analyzed 
in detail by Coquin et al.,45 consider the somewhat simpler arrangement shown in Figure 
11.28, in which each transducer element is driven Ψ rad out of phase with respect to the 
next one, and Ψ may be electrically varied. This causes the effective wavefront to be tilted 
by an angle θe with respect to the piecewise wavefronts radiating from the individual ele­
ments. If θe is small, it can be approximated by

from which it can be seen that the phase must be a quadratic function of the acoustic

Most of the work done on acoustic beam steering has involved making various approxi­
mations to this condition. One such approximation is obtained by making Ψ a linear func­
tion of frequency, with Ψ = 0 at f0, the midband frequency. This was accomplished in the

A further improvement can be achieved by noting from Equation 11.115 that θe varies as 
1/f, whereas perfect beam steering should lead to a linear variation of θe with f. Therefore, 
the constants h, s, and θe may be chosen to agree with the perfect beam steering case at two 
frequencies, rather than only one, as shown in Figure 11.29. This first-order beam steering 
can yield substantial improvements in performance for systems requiring less than one-
octave bandwidth,47 but bandwidths larger than this require a better approximation to the 
quadratic dependence of the phase on the acoustic frequency. The next higher approxima­
tion to perfect beam steering was carried out by Coquin et al.45 for a ten-element array, as 
shown in Figure 11.30. If the phase applied to each transducer corresponds to that for per­
fect steering, Ψl = lΨp, and the element spacing is s = Λ0
2 l, the bandwidth extends from 0 
to about 1.6 f0, the high-frequency drop-off being determined by the finite element spacing. 
Coquin pointed out that the deflector performance is very tolerant of errors in the individ­
ual phases; for example, if the phase applied to each transducer is within 45° of the perfect 
beam steering phase, there is a loss of only 0.8 dB in diffracted light intensity. If the phase 
error is increased to 90°, the loss increases to 3 dB. Thus, for deflectors, in which this degree 
of ripple is permissible, the transducer array may be driven by logic circuitry that sets digi­
tal phase shifters. This requires prior knowledge of the input frequency, or analog phase 
shifters, which accomplish the same function without the need for logic circuits.
An entirely different approach to broadband Bragg AO interaction matching is the use 
of the tilted transducer array, first reported by Eschler.48 A tilted transducer array con­
sists of two or more transducers electrically connected in parallel and tilted in angle with 
respect to each other, as illustrated in Figure 11.31. Each transducer element in the array 
is designed to cover some fraction of the entire bandwidth, and its angle with respect to 
the incident light direction is chosen to match the Bragg angle at the center of its subband. 

Acousto-Optic Scanners and Modulators

For frequencies near the midband of any of the transducer elements, the incident light will 
interact strongly only with the sound wave emanating from that element; interaction will 
be weak from the other elements both because the angle of incidence will be mismatched 
and the frequency will be far from the resonance frequency of those elements.
On the other hand, for frequencies that are midway between the resonance frequen­
cies of adjacent elements, that is, (f01 + f02)/2 or (f02 + f03)/2, the contributions to the acous­
tic fields from both elements are about equal and the effective wavefront direction lies

midway between those of the components. Thus, the array behaves very much as if the 
acoustic wave were steering with frequency, although this is not true in a strict sense. 
The diffraction efficiency of the tilted transducer array is shown in Figure 11.32, in which 
the solid curves represent the efficiency of the individual elements and the dotted curve 
represents the overall efficiency. There will typically be about 1 dB of ripple across the full 
band, which is acceptable for most applications.
There are two additional advantages to the tilted array transducer. First, it is obviously 
relatively simpler to design a larger overall acoustic bandwidth, since each element of 
the tilted array need be only about one-third of the total bandwidth. Second, tilted-array

transducers can generally be operated more deeply in the Bragg mode, as the combined 
acoustic wavefronts from adjacent elements are twice the length of that from a single ele­
ment. If the second-order diffracted light is sufficiently low, then operation over a frequency 
range larger than one octave is possible. The elements of the array can be connected in 
parallel since they will tend to behave as bandpass filters, the power being directed to the 
element with the closest frequency range. In practice, it is generally necessary to provide 
impedance-matching networks, as indicated in Figure 11.31, because of the low reactance 
obtained with a parallel network.
11.7  ACOUSTO-OPTIC DEVICE FABRICATION
11.7.1  Cell Fabrication
The AO material is in most cases a crystal or an optical-grade glass. For crystalline materi­
als, specific acoustic and optic propagation axes are typically required and the crystallo­
graphic orientation of the material must therefore be identified and marked. A typical cell 
configuration is shown in Figure 11.33. The optical window surfaces are prepared on the 
faces perpendicular to the optical axis.
These surfaces are typically polished to a high-quality window surface with a flatness 
of λ/20 or better. Because the cells may be relatively thick (up to several centimeters) the 
homogeneity of the optical material may be a significant factor in the overall wavefront 
distortion. Therefore, the wavefront distortion may need to be specified for the cell in 
transmission.
Optical scatter is often a critical parameter for AO devices used in scanning systems. A 
portion of scatter from the zero-order beam will fall within the aperture of the deflected 
beam. This scattered light is unmodulated and may limit the extinction ratio in AOM 
applications. Scatter may occur at the surfaces due to contamination or imperfections or 
within the material due to defects or inhomogeneities.
Unlike most lenses and mirrors where the clear aperture is in the middle of the optic, the 
desired clear aperture of an AO device usually starts at the edge of the transducer face. For 
AOMs, the beams may be centered less than 0.5 mm from the edge of the cell. Therefore,

special care must be taken to achieve the surface flatness, polish, and antireflection coating 
required across the entire clear aperture.
In particular with AOMs, the laser beam is focused to a small spot at the AOM to achieve 
the desired rise time and can lead to high optical intensity. Therefore, antireflection coat­
ings often must be specified with high damage thresholds.
The acoustic transducer bonding surface is nominally parallel to the optic axis. This sur­
face is prepared for bonding typically by polishing to an optical-quality surface. In most 
applications, the face of the cell opposite of the acoustic transducer surface is cut or ground 
at an off angle so that acoustic waves will not reflect directly back to the optical aperture 
or acoustic transducer. This is to avoid modulation or intermodulation from acoustic echo. 
Other techniques employed to reduce back reflection are to bond an acoustic absorbing 
material to back surface or grinding a rough finish on the back surface to diffuse the back 
reflection.
11.7.2  Transducer Bonding
For transducers in the frequency range for which crystal plates are bonded to the delay 
medium, the bonding procedure is probably the most critical and most difficult step in fab­
ricating the structure. The bonding layer can drastically modify the transmission of acous­
tic energy between the piezoelectric and the delay media; this is because the bond layer 
must provide molecular contact between the two surfaces, which will otherwise result in 
incomplete transfer, and because the mechanical impedance of the bond layer may prod­
uce a large acoustic mismatch with low transmission. In addition to these considerations, 
if the bond material is acoustically lossy, further decrease in transmission will result.
Because of the special properties required, there is only a very limited number of known 
bonding materials available. For temporary attachments, a commonly used agent is “salol,” 
phenyl salicylate. It is easily applied as a liquid, which is crystallized by addition of a small 
seed. It is reliquified by gentle heating, and therefore is useful for various test measure­
ments, but does not yield wide bandwidth or efficient coupling. A more satisfactory bond 
is made with epoxy resin, mixed to a very low viscosity, which may be compressed to a 
layer less than 1 µm thick before setting. Such thin layers require a high degree of cleanli­
ness to avoid inclusion of any dust particles. Because of the low impedance of epoxy com­
pared with such transducer materials as lithium niobate, thicker bonding layers would 
cause serious impedance mismatch problems around 100 MHz, where this technique has 
been successfully used.
Good results can also be obtained with a low-viscosity, ultraviolet, light-cured cement. 
For frequencies higher than about 100 MHz, other techniques, capable of yielding still thin­
ner bond layers, which must be kept to a small fraction of an acoustic wavelength, must 
be used. Vacuum-deposited metallic layers are well suited for this purpose, because their 
thickness can be very accurately controlled down to the smallest dimensions, and imped­
ances much closer to those of commonly used piezoelectric materials are available. Very 
good results were first obtained with indium bonds,49 which are deposited to a thickness 
of several thousand angstroms on both surfaces, and without removal from the vacuum 
systems are mated under a pressure of about 100 psi. This technique yields a cold-welded 
bond, which has excellent mechanical properties with large acoustic bandwidth, if prop­
erly designed, and low insertion loss at frequencies of hundreds of megahertz.
The greatest fabrication difficulty is due to the necessity of maintaining the deposited 
films under vacuum to prevent oxidation. This requires a vacuum system with rather elab­
orate fixtures to bring the two surfaces together after film deposition and to apply the 

Acousto-Optic Scanners and Modulators

hydraulic pressure. The inside of a vacuum system in which this procedure is carried out 
is shown in Figure 11.34. The substrates are held on either side of the evaporation filament 
sources during film deposition and are quickly brought into contact before contamination 
can occur. Using this technique, compression bonds of indium, tin, aluminum, gold, and 
silver are routinely made. It is essential for these procedures to be carried out in a dust-
free atmosphere in order to avoid contaminating the interface with particulates. Even the 
smallest particles will prevent good acoustic contact between the transducer and the cell, 
so that fabrication must be carried out in a clean-room facility. A typical AO device clean 
room is shown in Figure 11.35.
In a modification of the indium compression bond,50 which allows the freshly depos­
ited indium surfaces to be removed from the vacuum system for handling, the work is 
then placed in an oven under a pressure of several hundred psi, raised in temperature to 
slightly below the melting point of indium (156 °C), and slowly cooled. This procedure 
forms a molecular bond in spite of the oxidation that may occur, and gives results similar 
to the vacuum bond. The principal drawback is that upon cooling, differential thermal 
expansion coefficients between the delay line material and the transducer material may set 
up unacceptable strains in the optical path. For some systems, this may not be a problem; 
for example, quartz or even lithium niobate transducers on fused or crystal quartz delay 
lines can be routinely made by this method. On the other hand, such crystals as tellurium 
dioxide require a great deal of care in handling, since they are extremely sensitive to ther­
mal shock and strains. Differential contraction between the crystal and transducer for a 
bond made in this fashion may easily be severe enough to fracture the crystal. Therefore, 
its applicability will depend upon the materials and sizes involved and upon the degree of 
freedom from residual strain required.

are then brought into contact.

Handbook of Optical and Laser Scanning
For frequencies approaching 1 GHz, the attenuation of indium layers may become exces­
sive, and better results can be achieved with metals with lower acoustic loss constants. 
Among such metals are gold, silver, and aluminum.
Although these are made by the vacuum compression method, they generally require 
higher pressure. Still another method that has been used with these, as well as indium, is 
ultrasonic welding.51 The chief advantage to be gained is that the procedure is carried out 
in normal atmosphere, since the ultrasonic energy breaks up the oxidation layer that forms 
on the surface. Some heating occurs as a result, but the temperature remains well below 
that required in the indium thermocompression method, with much lower residual strains. 
The technique requires the simultaneous application of pressures up to 3000 psi; this may 
be excessive for easily fractured or deformed materials or where odd-shaped samples are 
involved. A summary of the important properties of a few bonding materials, also used 
for electrodes and intermediate impedance-matching layers, is given in Table 11.6.
At lower frequencies, the effects of thin electrode and bonding layers on the perform­
ance of the transducer may be entirely negligible, but near 100 MHz, they become increas­
ingly large, and even for layers less than 1 μm thick the effect may not be negligible if the 
impedance mismatch to the rest of the structure is large. The effects of the electrode layer 
can be determined by setting Zb = 0 in Equation 11.107, and the entire effect of the back 
layers will be due to the impedance of the electrode zbl of thickness tbt, so the normalized 
impedance

and the matrix of Equation 11.107 becomes more complex.
The effect of the bond layer and front electrode is even more complex, but an interesting 
illustrative example of varying the bond layer thickness is shown in Figure 11.36. For this 
example, the normalized impedance of the bond layer is taken to be rather low, z = 0.1, 
and it can be seen that even for a fairly small thickness, the effect on the transducer loss is

quite marked. Such a low value of impedance would correspond to the nonmetallic bond 
materials, but for the metallic bond materials the impedance mismatch would not be as 
severe, and the curve of transducer loss would be correspondingly less influenced. This 
influence of intermediate layers on the shape of the transducer loss curve can be used to 
determine the bandpass characteristics of the transducer structure. Such impedance trans­
formers can be used, for example, to make the response symmetric about the band center 
f0 by making the intermediate layer thickness one-quarter wavelength at f0. By choosing 
other values for the thickness, the bandwidth can be enlarged, ripples smoothed, or vari­
ous distortions introduced. In general, however, any such objectives are achieved at the 
expense of increased transducer loss.
11.7.3  Packaging
AO device packaging must take into account needs for optical mounting and electrical 
connectivity and in many cases, thermal path management as well. Often it is desirable 
to attach the optical cell to a metal mount suitable for mechanical attachment in a larger

optical system. This is achieved by bonding one or more of the surfaces to the mount 
with adhesive. Low shear strength adhesives are needed in many cases to alleviate tem­
perature-induced strain between the metal and the optical material. This is because most 
metals have a thermal expansion coefficient significantly greater than that of glass or other 
optical crystals. For example, the linear expansion coefficient of aluminum is approxi­
mately 23 parts per million per °C compared to only 0.5 parts per million per °C for fused 
silica. If the cell is bonded with a thin layer of high strength epoxy, difference in expansion 
over temperature may cause significant strain birefringence in the optical cell.
For devices that use a watt or more of RF power, thermal management becomes impor­
tant. Most of the power input to the device will end up as heat either from electrical resis­
tive losses or acoustic attenuation loss. This heat must be transferred from the modulator 
efficiently enough to keep the operating temperature within desired limits. A significant 
fraction of the input power may be lost at the transducer surface of the AOM, including 
resistive losses from bond wires and electrodes, and acoustic losses in the transducer and 
bond layers. Localized heating from the transducer will form temperature gradients in 
the optical cell that can cause optical distortion due to the change in index with tempera­
ture. The effect may be reduced by attaching a heat sink to the back side of the transducer 
or by choosing an optical aperture further from the transducer. The remaining power is 
converted into acoustic power that dissipates inside the cell. Because most optic materials 
are poor thermal conductors, the cell may need to be intimately contacted with a good heat 
sink path on as much surface area as possible to keep temperature rise to a minimum.
For modulators operating with frequencies of hundreds of MHz or more, the transducer 
electrode is typically deposited as a thin film (less than 1 μm thickness) by vacuum depos­
ition. Electrical connection to the electrodes is made by bond wiring. Direct soldering to 
the electrodes may cause damage to the electrode and cause excess loading on the acoustic 
transducer. A circuit card may be used to bring the input RF from an external connector 
up to the acoustic transducer. The feed circuit typically includes a passive matching circuit 
to optimize the impedance matching, nominally 50 Ω.
11.8  APPLICATIONS OF ACOUSTO-OPTIC SCANNERS
11.8.1  Multichannel Acousto-Optic Modulator for Polygonal Scanner
AOM or AOD can be fabricated with many independent channels on a single monolithic 
device. This approach allows multiple parallel beams to be modulated with a single device. 
This approach is used in the Etec Systems ALTA 3000 mask writing machine, which writes 
semiconductor photomasks using a rasterized simultaneous 32-beam scan.
The scanner architecture of the ALTA 3000 system is illustrated in Figure 11.37. An argon-
ion laser generates a single Gaussian beam at a wavelength of approximately 364 nm. A 
beam-splitter subassembly creates 32 separate beams, referred to as the brush, that pass 
through the AOM, which can independently turn on and off each of the beams. The mod­
ulation of the beams is controlled by the data path subsystem by varying the RF power 
to each channel of the AOM. The scan is created by a rotating polygonal mirror, and the 
scanned angle is converted to a spatial displacement by an f – θ lens. The final image of the 
brush at the photomask is obtained after transmitting it through a 20×, 0.6 NA reduction 
lens. At the image plane, the FWHM diameter of the spot size is approximately 360 nm. 

Acousto-Optic Scanners and Modulators 
579
During the scan, a translation stage moves the photomask perpendicular to the direction 
of scan.
The AOM and other optics are made from UV-grade fused silica, which has excellent 
transmittance and resistance to radiation darkening at UV wavelengths. Unfortunately, 
the M2 value for fused silica is relatively low, making power requirements for the modula­
tor an important design parameter. A nominal drive level of 500 mW per channel at 200 
MHz is required to achieve a diffraction efficiency of 50%.
The brush used to print at the photomask is an image of the one first created at the AOM. 
Therefore, the arrangement of beams at the AOM is dictated by the requirements for the 
final print. In this case, this arrangement is two sets of 16 beams with each beam separated 
by approximately 3 1/e2 beam diameters. The size of the beams at the AOM is set at 144 
μm 1/e2 diameter based on the modulation bandwidth requirement of 50 megapixels per 
second, and the beam-to-beam spacing is 412 μm.
The design of the transducer electrode size and shape must consider the impacts on 
power efficiency, beam distortion, and channel-to-channel cross-talk. The limited aperture

width and angular acceptance window of this design distort the output beam to a net far-
field ellipticity of approximately 1.3:1, which is acceptable for this application. The modula­
tor also introduces astigmatism, which would be detrimental to the system performance. 
This problem is corrected by precompensating optics referred to as the stigmator on Figure 
11.37.
The tight channel spacing requires careful attention to the prevention of electrical cross 
talk in the feed network to the transducer electrodes. Radio frequency signals are fed to 
the modulator from the system electronics by an array of coaxial cables. The coaxial cables 
are connected to a printed circuit card with an individual trace for each of the 32 channels. 
Each trace ends with a land registering to one of the transducer electrodes. Bond wires are 
applied to make the final connection between the feed circuit and transducer electrodes.
When all 32 channels are on, this equates to 16 W of RF power. This creates localized 
heating in the AO cell near the transducer, also corresponding to the useful optical aper­
ture of the AOM. Because the index of the fused silica is temperature dependent, these 
localized temperature gradients correspond to index gradients in the glass that may cause 
several waves of distortion across the optical aperture. A temperature gradient across the 
aperture will have the effect of an optical wedge, causing the angular orientation of the 
beams to shift. To minimize these effects, a heat sink is applied to the back side of the 
transducer to keep the temperature rise at the transducer as small as possible. The AOM 
mount is also water cooled to carry the bulk heat away from the device and the surround­
ing optical system.
11.8.2  Infrared Laser Scanning
AO beam scanners for use with IR lasers have been under consideration in recent years 
by the aerospace industry in connection with laser radar and optical communications 
systems. Where system requirements place excessive demands on mechanical scanning 
methods, various electronic approaches become attractive. In general, the carbon dioxide 
laser, with wavelengths from 9 to 11 μm, is the most common one for long-wavelength 
operation. There are a number of electronic approaches to IR beam scanning besides AO, 
and all of them are quite difficult to implement, usually for reasons related to the long 
interaction length needed to achieve large optical phase excursion. For AO diffraction, we 
have seen that the RF power needed for a given diffraction efficiency increases quadrati­
cally with wavelength. At 10.6 μm therefore, 280 times the power for 0.633 μm is necessary. 
Clearly, there will be severe constraints on the available materials for such devices, and on 
their performance. Referring to Table 11.4, we can see that only a few materials that trans­
mit to 11 μm and have large AO figure of merit have been identified. The most common 
of these is germanium, which can be purchased in very large single crystals of excellent 
optical quality; germanium AO scanners have been commercially available for a number 
of years. They operate best in the isotropic mode, typically near 100 MHz RF. Another 
favorable IR material for use in the 9 to 11 μm range is thallium arsenic selenide, which has 
very recently become available on a commercial basis. This crystal is best used in an aniso­
tropic mode, as described in a previous section. The AO figure of merit is very high due 
to the low value of shear acoustic wave velocity. The low velocity produces another result 
that may simplify the design of scanner optics. The scan angles at IR wavelengths are quite 
large; the angular dispersion for 10.6-μm carbon dioxide wavelength for this Bragg cell is 
shown in Figure 11.38. For an RF bandwidth of 30% around 110 MHz center frequency, a 
scan-angle range of 16° is reached. For many applications, no magnification of the scan 
angle will be needed, as may be the case for AO scanners in the visible.

Acousto-Optic Scanners and Modulators 
581
One of the major problems associated with carbon dioxide laser beam scanners is heat­
ing, due both to absorption of optical energy and RF power heating. If very high laser 
beam powers are used, then even a small absorption coefficient in the scanner may cause 
unacceptable heating. For germanium and thallium arsenic selenide, the absorption coef­
ficients at 10.6 μm are 0.032 and 0.015 cm−1, respectively. The thermal conductivity of ger­
manium is much higher than that of thallium arsenic selenide, but design considerations 
may favor one or the other, depending upon the detailed effects of thermal gradients. 
High RF power operation is limited by heating at the transducer, which will eventually 
damage the transducer bond. Such thermal effects can be reduced by water or air cooling 
the RF mount and by heat sinking the transducer; a photograph of a high-power trans­
ducer with a matching sapphire heat sink, which also serves to make electrical contact, is 
shown in Figure 11.39. The resolution of such IR AO scanners will, in general, be limited 
by RF heating if high diffraction efficiency is to be obtained. This comes about because 
a large interaction bandwidth requires a small interaction length, so that high efficiency 
can only be achieved by high power. The relationship between resolution and acoustic 
power for the IR scanner materials is shown in Figure 11.40. If CW operation is required, 
it can be seen that no more than a few hundred spots can be obtained for an aperture of 
1 or 2 cm.
11.8.3  Two-Stage Acousto-Optic Scanner
AO deflection has been successfully applied to semiconductor photomask inspection. 
The KLA-Tencor 3000 series mask inspection machine checks photomasks for defects by 
scanning a focused spot across the mask and detecting the transmitted light (brightfield 
inspection). In this application, the feature sizes are very small (0.3 μm) compared to the 
size of the mask to be inspected (typically 6 in diameter). To achieve desired throughput, 
a net scan rate of 50 megapixels per second is required. The number of spots is too great 
to cover the photomask with a single scan, therefore the approach is to use a high-speed 
optical scanner to produce a lineal subscan, and use x–y mechanical translation to pass the 
photomask beneath the scan location. Significant control is required to provide the precise

translation required and register all the subscan data together such that the data for the 
entire photomask can be seamlessly reconstructed.
11.8.3.1  Scanner Optics
The lineal scan is produced by an AO scan pair and has no moving parts. A block diagram 
of the scan optical portion of the system is shown in Figure 11.41. The source for the scan 
beam is an argon-ion laser operating at 488-nm wavelength. The beam is passed through 
a spatial filter and then focused to a 400-μm beam diameter at the first AO device, the

predeflector. This device is made from SF-6 glass and operates in the longitudinal acoustic 
mode. The center frequency for the device is 90 MHz, and the operating bandwidth is 14.4 
MHz. This corresponds to a deflection angle in air of 12.5 mrads ± 1 mrads (Figure 11.42). 
Following the predeflector, prescan optics transform the deflector output into a telecen­
tric scan with magnification appropriate for the traveling chirp lens. The spot size at the 
input of the traveling chirp device is 12mm 1/e2, and is designed to overfill the traveling 
chirp lens.
The chirp lens is produced from TeO2, and uses the slow shear acoustic mode. Unlike the 
predeflector, the diffraction performance of a slow shear TeO2 is very polarization depen­
dent, and requires the input to be right circularly polarized. A wave plate is used to con­
vert the linear polarization from the laser to circular polarization ahead of the TeO2 device. 
The lens is formed from a linear chirp from 75 to 125 MHz over 7.5 μs. This makes the lens 
aperture in the scan direction 4.6 mm (7.5 × 0.616).
The aperture size in the cross-scan direction is controlled by the acoustic transducer 
height and is set to also be approximately 4.6 mm. The length of the scan is 14 μs or 8.6 
mm. Therefore, the traveling chirp cell must have a clear aperture of at least 12.2 mm in 
the scan direction.
A cylinder lens is placed immediately after the chirp device to focus the spot on the 
cross-scan axis. A scan plane occurs at one focal length from the chirp lens. This is the 
object plane that is relayed and demagnified to produce the final scan at the photomask. 
Using the approximation N = τΔf, the number of resolvable spots from the predeflector is 1.6. 
While this performance would be of little use in direct scanning applications, its purpose 
in this application is to track the traveling chirp lens and maintain optimal illumination.

The spot gain from the traveling chirp, also estimated from the time–bandwidth product, 
is 375. Therefore, the scan resolution is dominated by performance of the traveling chirp 
lens. The approximate scan size based on these approximations is 600 spots. However, due 
to limited aperture at the traveling chirp lens, the scanned spot is better approximated by 
an Airy disk function than a Gaussian, and the scan size based on the null-to-null spacing 
approximately 1000 spots.
11.8.3.2  Driver
Both AO devices are driven by analog electronics that consist of a voltage-controlled oscil­
lator followed by amplifier stages. Linear voltage ramps are generated by the system elec­
tronics and supplied to the drivers to produce the linear frequency chirps required by the 
AO devices. Both drive inputs are derived from the same clock to ensure synchronization 
is maintained between the two devices. Note that chirp linearity is not critical for the 
predeflector as it would be with an f–θ configuration. In this system, the scan linearity is 
controlled by the propagation of the traveling lens and the dominant concern is variation 
of acoustic velocity in the traveling lens cell due to changes in temperature. Chirp linear­
ity is critical for the traveling lens, as the nonlinearities in the chirp signal will appear as 
aberrations in the lens. Therefore, precompensation is included in the voltage ramp fed to 
the traveling chirp voltage-controlled oscillator to correct for inherent nonlinearities.
11.8.4  Applications of Acousto-Optic Devices and Acousto-Optic Tunable Filters
AO devices are used for a variety of applications and, depending on the area of spe­
cialization, comprise the following: AOM, AOD, frequency shifters (AOFS), tunable fil­
ters (AOTF), wavelength selectors (AOWS), and polychromatic modulators (PCAOM). 
Combining one of these AO devices with a mechanical scanner can produce scanning 
systems for laser printing, laser machining and engraving, wavelength-programma­
ble scanning, lasik, medical and cosmetic laser systems, and many more. Here we will 
describe the above mentioned devices to provide insight into their limitations and typical 
product configurations.

Acousto-Optic Scanners and Modulators

The AO effect is used in a variety of ways for controlling light. From the widely utilized 
modulation of laser beams, solid-state light scanning, and frequency shifting, to tun­
able filters and polychromatic light modulation. The basic scheme for all these devices 
involves the selection of proper AO materials and the optimization of the piezoelectric 
transducer to produce acoustic waves with efficient conversion of electrical power to 
ultrasonic power for the desired frequency range. Except in colinear tunable filters, all 
schemes utilize the propagation of acoustic and optical waves approximately at 90° to 
each other. The theory of individual devices from the list above appears earlier in this 
chapter, this section serves to discuss the major aspects required to produce the desirable 
product in each category.
11.8.4.1  Acousto-Optic Modulators
The basic requirement of an AOM is the highest-speed or wide-bandwidth modulation of 
light with the highest optical throughput and list amount of electrical power. Limiting fac­
tors are the acoustic transit time and the limited fractional bandwidth of the piezoelectric 
transducer and the inefficient interaction of acoustic waves with optical waves. Optical 
transmission, damage range, and the acoustic attenuation of the material may become 
hard to overcome as we push the envelope of the design. The highest bandwidth achieved 
for an AOM is about 2 GHz or ~0.5 ns rise/fall time, with a top efficiency of less than 20%. 
These parameters are considerably degraded as the optical wavelength increases toward 
IR wavelengths such as 10.6 µm. As a variation of a single AOM a linear array of transduc­
ers has produced an AOM device with up to 128 channels (Figure 11.43 through 11.46).
11.8.4.2  Acousto-Optic Deflectors
The function of an AOD is to move or scan optical beams electronically. The dependence 
of the optical diffraction angle on acoustic wavelength makes this possible. The desired 
parameters are the maximum number of resolvable spots, the highest optical throughput 
FIGURE 11.43

and the list electrical power. Here, the transducer bandwidth and acoustic attenuation 
of the material place severe limits on the achievable results. Speed of scanning and uni­
formity of optical throughput further reduce the performance. The maximum resolvable 
spots achieved are about 2000, with a scan time of about 10 µs or larger. Most AO materials 
have identical AO properties in orthogonal directions. This allows two-dimensional AO 
deflection with the same block of material.
AOD also serve another function in signal processing. The number of resolvable spots of 
an AOD scanner translates to the number of resolvable spectral components of the RF in 
AO spectrum analyzer applications and the number of corelations in AO corelator applica­
tions (Figure 11.47 and 11.48).

11.8.4.3  Acousto-Optic Frequency Shifters
The traveling-wave interaction between light and acoustic waves imparts frequency shift 
to the diffracted light. Though AOFS generally require a narrow frequency band to func­
tion, some applications may desire a wide bandwidth. When the bandwidth is large, AOFS 
and AOM lose their distinction. If the frequency range is small, then the bandwidth of the 
piezoelectric transducer and the AO interaction can be traded off to achieve higher optical

throughput at a much higher center frequency. AO frequency shift to 10 GHz has been 
achieved, at least for low-percentage optical throughput (Figure 11.49). 
11.8.4.4  Acousto-Optic Tunable Filters
The AO scheme is the only one available that allows electronically selectable imaging of 
narrow-band, multispectral optical components from a wide-spectrum light. In colinear 
propagating acoustic and optical wave devices, diffraction of one optical polarization to 
another can occur with Bragg matching k-vector supplied by the acoustic waves. Here, the 
interaction length can be very large resulting in narrow optical bandwidth diffraction. 
Using simultaneous multitone RF, many narrow optical bands can be diffracted. Moreover,

the angular sensitivity of the AO interaction is small, resulting in good image preserva­
tion. One drawback of the colinear interaction is the difficulty of separating the diffracted 
and undiffracted components.
In certain materials such as tellurium dioxide and crystalline quartz, a so-called “paral­
lel tangents Bragg matching condition” is possible. This condition allows orthogonal AO 
interaction and removes the difficulty of separating diffracted and undiffracted optical 
components (Figure 11.50 and 11.51).
The limitations of AOTF are set by the availability of large-size material, acoustic attenu­
ation, transmission range of the selected material, and RF drive power requirements.

11.8.4.5  Acousto-Optic Wavelength Selectors
In certain applications, the imaging function available in AOTF is not required. This relaxes 
several AOTF parameters that can be traded to reduce requirements for RF drive power 
and material size. In that case AOTF can function as AOWS. If a galvanometric or other 
mechanical scanner is placed after the AOWS, we could obtain a variable-wavelength opti­
cal scanner that may have wide-ranging applications (Figure 11.52).

11.8.4.6  Polychromatic Acousto-Optic Modulators
If the diffraction efficiency of an AOWS can be improved further such that almost 100% 
diffraction can occur with relatively low RF drive power in the range of 20–100 mW, then 
many RF tones approaching 16 can be used for the AOWS; this device is known as poly­
chromatic AOM. An argonion laser contains six to ten wavelengths in the visible spec­
trum. Polychromatic AO modulation has been widely used for laser projection and laser 
shows to produce vivid, full-color images for entertainment and planetarium applications 
(Figure 11.53).
Material degradation at high laser power and linear polarization restriction is of concern 
in some applications.
11.9  CONCLUSIONS
AO devices have been utilized in a variety of scanning applications from direct spatial or 
temporal modulation to predeflection or postscan lensing. For most applications of these 
devices there are significant design trades between modulation bandwidth, efficiency, and 
other performance parameters. AOD are often advantageous in applications where high 
precision is required over a relatively small angular scan. AOM are effective for pixelation 
of raster scans or video modulation when it is impractical to directly modulate the opti­
cal source. The ability to modulate light without moving parts should continue to make 
acousto-optics an attractive technology in the future.

12.1  INTRODUCTION
Electro-optic deflection systems are most typically considered in applications where high 
deflection speed is the paramount selection criteria. They can also have other attractive 
features, such as high optical efficiency and physical robustness, but these are usually sec­
ondary concerns after deflection speeds that can exceed 109 rad/s.
Requirements for great speeds are driven by advancements in two technical areas: lasers 
and computing. Progress in laser technology has resulted in reliable, low-cost compact 
sources with high power. Many applications, such as material marking, require a certain 
amount of energy to be delivered and are somewhat independent of the time period that 
the energy is delivered over. More powerful lasers can deliver the required energy dose in 
a short period of time, putting pressure on deflection system designers for higher operat­
ing speeds.
Advances in computing and communications have resulted in ever-higher data rates 
delivered to the laser deflection system. Data rates in applications such as displays now 
far surpass the control bandwidth of most mechanical systems such as galvanometers, 
piezoelectric deflectors, and microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) mirrors, which are 
limited by mechanical inertia effects. Relatively low bandwidth, usually less than 10 kHz, 
makes these systems a poor choice if a laser or other light source can deliver the required 
energy dose within a time period that matches the desired data rate, which often exceeds 
MHz speeds. In the realm of electrical circuits, electro-optic (EO) deflectors are essentially 
capacitors, which can be charged very quickly with appropriate driver circuitry and can 
operate at MHz speeds with ease.
The most common technical competition to EO deflection is acousto-optic (AO) deflec­
tion, covered elsewhere in this volume. Electro-optic systems are often faster and more

optically efficient than AO systems. They often can handle higher beam powers than AO 
systems because there is no need to achieve a tight beam focus in the device for maxi­
mum speeds. The AO systems can be designed to have much higher resolutions, offering 
hundreds or thousands of resolvable spots compared to 5 to 100 that are more typical of 
EO systems. Both EO scanners and many AO scanners have polarization-dependent char­
acteristics, which can limit their application. In general, the crystal and glass materials for 
AO devices are more readily available and have uniform high quality, unlike the materials 
for EO deflectors, which can be hard to procure or may have uncertain property charac­
teristics. Electronic drivers for AO deflection systems usually require higher input power 
than those for EO systems.
Examples of current applications where the combination of high-power compact laser 
sources and high-speed data delivery are driving the evaluation or adoption of EO deflec­
tion systems include: encoding image data onto printing plates in plate setting machines, 
controlling optical paths in communications switching systems, creating jitter-free laser 
projection displays, and maintaining alignment in free space communications systems 
over long distances.
Electro-optic deflectors or scanners can be configured to meet a variety of requirements. 
Choices of the optical material, typically a crystal, the drive electronics, and optical path 
can be made to address all of the following functional requirements:
	
1.	Error correction: high-speed (106 rad/s) and low deflection (order of milli-rad) 
characteristics can be used to provide facet-to-facet error correction of polygon 
scanners. The same characteristics can also be used to “debounce” a galvanome­
ter-based display system.
	
2.	Switching: high speed (<100 ns steps) and low deflection (order of 10 resolution 
spots) can be used to switch collimated light in fiber optic switches, optical back­
planes, and optical computers.
	
3.	Modulation: in cases where it is not possible to directly modulate a laser, as with 
some diode-pumped sources, a deflector can be used to modulate the beam by 
deflecting it toward or past a beam stop. Applications of this sort include displays, 
printing plate production, and marking.
There is a class of EO device that is sometimes confused with deflectors or scanners. 
This class uses the Kerr effect effectively to rotate the polarization of light traversing the 
device. Such devices can be used as modulators for polarized light sources by rotating 
the plane of polarization to be parallel or perpendicular to a polarizer downstream in the 
system. Such systems are commercially available, and have been used in some printing 
applications.
If a polarization-dependent mirror or beam splitter is used in place of the polarizer in 
the above system, the beam may be switched to one of two output positions by electro-
optically controlling the polarization of the beam. These devices may be cascaded to pro­
duce many output positions. These and related systems are not the focus of the current text 
and will not be covered further.
The present effort builds on the previous edition, authored by Clive L.M. Ireland and 
John Martin Ley.1 Much material has been carried over, especially that related to materi­
als properties and basic physics. New material has been added to cover domain-inverted 
scanner designs, which have recently been applied in commercial products. A new section 
was added to address some of the options and characteristics of electronic drivers suitable

for commercial applications. Experience has shown that this part of the system can be as 
difficult to realize as the optical elements. As with the material relating to optical materials 
and designs, the electronic driver material is intended to serve as a general reference for 
guiding development efforts, not as a definitive treatise on the subject.
12.2  THEORY OF THE ELECTRO-OPTIC EFFECT
12.2.1  The Electro-Optic Effect
The EO deflectors and scanners discussed below all rely on the EO effect evidenced to some 
degree by all materials. Only a few materials exhibit property changes with an applied 
electric field large enough to be exploited for use in deflecting and switching applications. 
The index of refraction of these materials, typically crystals, changes when an electric field 
is applied to such a degree that it can be used to usefully deflect a beam according to the 
rules of normal refractive optics.
In crystals, the direction of the polarization induced by an applied electric field may dif­
fer in direction from that of the applied field. Mathematically, this means that the relative 
permittivity must be represented by a second-rank tensor:
	
D
E
E
P
i
ij
j
i
i
=
=
+
e k
e
0
0
	
(12.1)
where ε0 is the permittivity of free space, κij is the relative dielectric tensor, and Ei and 
Pt are the ith components of the electric field and the induced polarization, respectively, 
and summation over repeated indices is assumed. We will restrict our discussion to crys­
tals that are essentially neither magnetic nor optically active, and that exhibit negligible 
absorption. In this case, κij is a real, symmetric tensor.
A convenient geometric representation of any symmetric second-rank tensor Sij is an 
ellipsoidal or hyperboloidal surface defined by
	
S x x
ij
i
j = 1	
(12.2)
Thus we can construct such a surface for κij, or its inverse (1/κ)ij. In contrast, the refractive 
index—given by the square root of the relative permittivity in isotropic materials—does 
not transform as a second-rank tensor. Since κ = n2 in an isotropic material, it is conven­
tional to adopt the following notation:
	
1
1
2
n
x x
ij
i
j
⎛
⎝⎜
⎞
⎠⎟
=
	
(12.3)
This ellipsoidal surface is called the index ellipsoid, or indicatrix. In the coordinate system 
in which (1/n2)ij is diagonal, Equation 12.3 reduces to

(12.4)
This surface has a simple geometric interpretation. The principal axes of the ellipsoid cor­
respond to directions in the crystal for which D is parallel to E, and the refractive indices 
for waves polarized along these directions are nx, ny, and nz.

12.2.2  The Linear Electro-Optic Effect
The crystal materials commonly used for EO devices do not possess inversion symmetry 
(see Stancil2 for a complete explication of the tensor properties of crystals), meaning that 
the application of an electric field induces a small change in the refractive index that is 
proportional to the field, and reverses in sign when the field reverses. This is known as 
Pockel’s Effect, or the Linear Electro-Optic Effect.
In the presence of a uniform electric field, the changes in the indices of refraction of such 
materials can be shown to be

(12.5)
where rij,k is the linear EO tensor, whose values are readily available from data published 
in the literature and from crystal suppliers.
As an example, consider the EO effect in KH2PO4, also known as KDP. In this crystal 
(and all crystals with symmetry 42m ) the only nonzero components of the EO tensor 
are r4l = r52, and r63. For simplicity, we will consider the case of a static electric field 
applied along the optic axis, E3. For further simplicity, for small Δn, which is normally the 
case, Δ(1/n2) = −2Δn/n3. Thus, the refractive index seen by an optical wave polarized along 
the 〈110〉 direction is approximately given by

(12.7)
The index along the optical axis 〈001〉 is unchanged (n3 = ne).
Note that the index change observed depends on the polarization of the light transiting 
the region with the applied field. This effect makes the performance of many EO scanners 
“polarization dependent,” where the deflection achieved depends on the polarization of 
the beam. This can result in splitting randomly polarized beams and is the reason that 
most EO scanners are used with polarized beams only.
12.2.3  The Quadratic Electro-Optic Effect
Refractive index changes proportional to the square of the applied field are permitted 
by symmetry in all materials. Besides crystals such as KDP and LiNbO3, liquids that are 
strongly polar are of particular EO interest since they can exhibit a high anisotropic, optic 
polarizability. By applying a strong external field, the molecules of these substances par­
tially align with the field, causing the bulk material to become biréfringent.
The component of a beam polarized parallel to the main polarizability of the molecules, 
usually nearly parallel to the dipole moment of the molecule, sees an increase in refractive 
index relative to that of the orthogonal polarization. This effect, which was observed by 
Kerr in glass and other materials, is generally described by the following equation:

Handbook of Optical and Laser Scanning
Here λ is the vacuum wavelength of the beam, B is the Kerr constant for the material, and 
np and ns are the parallel and orthogonal refractive index components, respectively, and E 
is the applied electric field.
A variety of Kerr materials and devices have been studied in the past, see Lee and 
Hauser3 and Kruger et al.4 At the time of this writing, late 2002, there do not appear to be 
any commercial devices or systems based on the quadratic EO effect in production.
12.3  PRINCIPAL TYPES OF ELECTRO-OPTIC DEFLECTORS
12.3.1  Basic Topologies
The EO effect can be utilized in a variety of basic ways, with details seemingly limited 
only by the imagination of very clever practitioners. The design problem is one of select­
ing a gross geometry that the beam can traverse, and then selecting the geometry and 
magnitude of desired index change. To provide some order, the following nomenclature 
is used:
	
1.	Shaping of gross geometry: at its simplest, an EO scanner can consist of a pris­
matic crystal element with electrodes covering both ends. As the potential across 
the element is changed, it acts like an electrically controlled prism.
	
2.	Electrically shaped fields: When a bulk prism would be too small for easy han­
dling, or if the field strength desired would result in electrical breakdowns across 
the side surfaces, electrical fields may be shaped. This is normally achieved by 
using shaped electrodes of constant potential. A less common approach is to use 
electrodes with finite or graded conductivity so that a varying voltage profile is 
obtained when a current is applied.
	
3.	Poled structures: some EO materials, such as LiNbO3 and LiTaO3, may be “poled,” 
a process that can result in geometrically precise crystalline domains within the 
bulk material. A uniform electric field applied to poled structures will result 
in equal and opposite changes in index within each domain according to its 
orientation.
12.3.2  Terminology for Describing Electro-Optic Scanners
Electro-optic scanners can be discussed using much of the same terminology as other 
types of scanners. The difficult trade-offs between size, voltage, and material properties 
create some nuances that are important to consider.
12.3.2.1  Beam Displacement and Deflection Angle
A schematic EO scanner is shown in Figure 12.1. In the presence of a linear index variation 
(constant gradient) across the width of the scanner, the trajectory of the center of the beam 
within the scanner is described by the parabolic relation5

where X(z) is the displacement of the beam center from the optical axis at position z, Δn is 
the total change in index across the scanner, n is the nominal index of refraction (in the 
absence of an EO shift), and W is the width of the scanner.
The deflection angle at a particular position z is given by the slope of the trajectory at that 
point, or the derivative of Equation 12.9:5,6

(12.10)
When the beam exits the material, the angle is increased by the factor n, owing to the 
small-angle form of Snell’s Law. The external deflection angle for the scanner is therefore 
obtained by evaluating Equation 12.10 at z = L and multiplying by n:

expressed as

(12.13)
This suggests that although the actual trajectory is parabolic, the output angle and dis­
placement are correctly given by assuming that the beam has an abrupt deflection of θin a 
distance of L/2 from the output plane.7 We call this the pivot point, and define it more gen­
erally as

Handbook of Optical and Laser Scanning
A scanner has a well-defined pivot point when LP,in does not depend on the magnitude of 
the index variation Δn.
When the beam deflection is viewed outside the scanner, the deflection also appears to 
have a pivot point, although displaced, just as an object on the bottom of a swimming pool 
appears to be displaced when viewed from outside the pool. From outside the scanner, the 
pivot point appears to be a distance LP from the output plane:

(12.15)
The existence of a pivot point is significant for the design of optical systems contain­
ing EO scanners. From the optical system point of view, the scanner can be repre­
sented simply by a mirror at a distance LP from the output plane that introduces the 
deflection θdef.
12.3.2.3  Resolvable Spots
Perhaps the best way to compare various scanner technologies is to use the number of 
“resolvable spots.” The deflection angle can be magnified or reduced with other optical 
elements, but the number of resolvable spots will remain constant. The number of resolv­
able spots is given by the number of beam diameters corresponding to the lateral displace­
ment at a certain distance, usually the far field. Clearly this number depends on the way 
that the beam diameter is defined. For our purposes, we will assume the beam is well 
described by a fundamental Gaussian beam whose 1/e2 intensity radius is given by the 
Gaussian beam waist w(z):

It is instructive to consider the case with the waist collocated with the pivot point (z0 = 
0) and the observation point arbitrarily far away. This limit results in the number of spots

is the far-field divergence (full angle) of the Gaussian beam. The displacement clearly gets 
larger the further away the observation plane is, but this does not result in an increase in 
spots since the beam divergence causes the spot diameter to increase at the same rate in 
the far field.
It is important to note that the maximum number of resolvable spots is achieved only 
in the far field. Many practical EO systems, such as deflection-based modulators, do not 
require operation in the far field. It is critically important to perform accurate simulations 
and ray tracings as part of the design process.
Other definitions of beam diameter are sometimes used, depending on the application. 
For instance, flat-top power profiles are useful for some laser machining operations. The 
effect of the diameter definition, and the correspondingly correct description of beam 
divergence, should be considered when discussing the number of resolvable spots that a 
particular system may exhibit.

In practice, the actual deflection about the mean is very small. For example, an equilateral 
triangle prism fabricated from lithium niobate and operated to ±1 kV/mm will undergo an 
index change of approximately ±0.0002, or 0.01%. This change is actually smaller than the 
accuracy bounds typically quoted by commercial crystal manufacturers for property values.
As discussed previously, the sign of the refractive index change reverses with the direc­
tion of polarization (usually coincident with the optic axis of the crystal). Thus a direct 
extension of the single prism implementation is to assemble several discrete prisms with 
alternating polarization as shown in Figure 12.4. With proper choice of optical polariza­
tion, crystal, and orientation, a voltage applied between conducting electrodes on opposing 
transverse sides of the assembly increases and decreases the index in alternating prisms 
generating the Δn required for scanner operation. The major disadvantage of this type of 
construction is the labor-intensive cutting, polishing, and assembly of the prisms.

An analysis of the energized multi-element assembly shows that it can be accurately rep­
resented by a band of material with linearly varying index of refraction.5 This leads to

two interesting design realizations: graded electrical fields with uniform crystal structure, 
covered in this section, and uniform electrical field and graded crystal structures created 
through domain inversion, covered in the following section.
12.3.4.1  Graded Index with Uniform Applied Voltage
One way to create a linearly varying spatial index profile is to apply a linearly varying 
electric field to an EO crystal. Most electrical circuits, especially those designed for low-
power operation, are designed to provide a single voltage across an electrode. However, if 
the geometric spacing between electrodes is not fixed to a single value, the electrical field 
between the electrodes will exhibit a spatial variation. If this variation is linear where the 
beam transits the crystal, a good scanner can be produced. A quadrupole field as shown 
in Figure 12.5 has the desired behavior near the origin.8,9 If the electrodes are shaped to 
follow the hyperbolae

Thus we see that both components of the electric field vary linearly with position. However, 
if a crystal with symmetry 42m  is oriented as indicated in Figure 12.5, then there is no EO 
effect for Ex, to the first order. Using the index expressions in Table 12.1 for KDP, the index

It is a difficult task to shape a crystal to accommodate hyperbolic electrodes as shown 
in Figure 12.5. Instead, Figure 12.6a shows a more practical geometry.10 The field inside 
the crystal has been computed using the Finite Element Method11 for KDP. Although 
the electrodes are not shaped precisely like hyperbolae, the field near the center of the 
crystal is still approximately linear, as shown in Figure 12.6b. Another approximation

of hyperbolic electrodes was developed by Ireland and Ley.12 In this case, cylindrical 
electrodes were used.
12.3.4.2  Graded Index with Constant Spacing
A second option for producing a linearly graded index of refraction depends on depositing 
a resistive electrode and a conductive electrode on opposite faces of a slab of EO material, 
as shown in Figure 12.7. When the voltage is applied at the leads, current flows across 
the resistive electrode, which is essentially a resistor, resulting in a graded electrical field 
within the device. The change in optical index, which is proportional to the electric field in 
the material, is thus graded according to the voltage.
The difficulties of producing this type of electrode have limited their consideration for 
use to very thin devices, on the order of tens of microns. The optical beams are not typically 
round in these scanners, since a relatively wide stripe is needed for the voltage gradient

electrodes. Difficulties of coupling optical beams into such wide and thin layers, and their 
great divergence on the output side add to the difficulties of this approach, although it has 
been proposed for optical switching for telecommunications use. Electrical heating due to 
the current flow is another limiting factor.
12.3.4.3  Graded Index with Constant Spacing and Single Voltage
A third approach to producing a gradient in the index of refraction is illustrated in Figure 
12.8. The portion of the beam that travels under the root of the conducting top electrode 
will traverse more material affected by the electrical field than a ray traversing only the 
tips. This technique suffers from the complex fringing electrical fields around the top elec­
trode. These fields give rise to out-of-plane distortion and other beam quality problems. 
A wide variety of electrode shapes and spacings are possible,1 some of which mitigate the 
effects of fringing fields to a degree.
12.3.5  Poled Structures
There are two ways of achieving an effective linear gradation in index: grading the elec­
tric field, or grading the material properties. The techniques covered above, except the

use of multiple discrete inverted prisms, all use device or electrode geometry to effec­
tively grade the electrical field. Grading the material properties is possible using the 
technique of “poling” or “domain inversion.” This process can be performed completely 
independently of the base material production, making it an effective tool for device 
fabrication.
One salient advantage of poled devices is that they are not typically affected by electri­
cal fringing fields. They are normally constructed with cover electrodes that are large 
enough to ensure uniform fields over the active region of the device, which may contain 
50 or more interfaces. The result is that the beam will have to pass through only two fring­
ing fields, at the entrance and exit, versus 100 or more in some field-graded devices. The 
poling fabrication technique is an outgrowth of research directed toward making quasi-
phase-matched second harmonic generating gratings.13–17 It was discovered that by using 
photolithographic techniques, domain patterns with virtually any shape can be realized in 
materials such as z-cut lithium niobate, lithium tantalate, and potassium titanyl phosphate 
and its isomorphs such as rubidium titanyl arsenate.
The basic process includes the following steps:
	
1.	Patterning: photolithographic techniques are used to pattern photoresist on one 
or both of the crystal surfaces with the shape of the final inverted region. Wafers 
are often used for greatest compatibility with standard semiconductor processing 
equipment.
	
2.	Apply poling electrodes: either metal or liquid electrodes are placed on the wafer 
surface.
	
3.	Poling: high electric fields, greater than the coercive field of the medium or on 
the order of 20 kV/mm for lithium niobate, are applied. Practitioners use voltage 
pulses, ramps, and quasi-DC waveforms—there does not appear to be an accepted 
standard practice at this time.
	
4.	Apply operating electrodes: this is often done using standard photolithography 
and thin film deposition. The operating electrodes are typically much larger than 
the poling electrodes to ensure uniform electric field in the poled region, but they 
may be limited in size due to the desire to minimize the device’s electrical capaci­
tance and therefore driver power requirements.
	
5.	Annealing: temperatures ranging from about 200 °C to over 1000 °C are 
used, with  the appropriate temperature and cycle profile determined by 
experimentation.
During the “poling” step, atoms are shifted in the crystal lattice, but only in the vol­
umes defined by the photolithographically applied patterns. This effectively “flips” the fer­
roelectric domains without having to cut, polish, AR coat, and reassemble the crystal.
Using electric field poling techniques, it is possible to drive the inverted domain regions 
completely through relatively thick substrates—up to 3 mm have been reported for devices 
fabricated with profile precision of a few microns in RTA (R. Stolzenberger, personal com­
munication, 2003). For more details on the physics of the domain inversion process, see 
Gopalan et al.18 Using such a process, confinement to a waveguide is possible, but not 
necessary, and scanners that work for any properly polarized beam passing through the 
substrate can be made (Figure 12.9).19 For applications not requiring compatibility with 
waveguide devices, these bulk devices offer easier coupling, lower coupling and propaga­
tion losses, and improved beam quality.

12.3.5.1  Prismatic Poled Structures
The first deflector of this type was a waveguide device fabricated in lithium tantalate, as 
shown in Figure 12.10.20 Domain inversion was achieved using patterned proton exchange 
followed by rapid thermal annealing. This process creates a domain-inverted region 
extending to a depth of 10–20 μm. The planar waveguide was subsequently formed by 
proton exchange in 260° pyrophosphoric acid. A 2000 Å thick layer of SiO2 was deposited 
as a cladding layer before deposition and patterning of the final cover electrode, to reduce 
optical loss in the waveguide. Cylindrical lenses were used to edge-couple light into and 
out of the scanner.
Improved deflection sensitivity can be achieved by using thinner substrates, or by selec­
tively thinning the substrate below the scanner using pulsed laser ablation.21 Selective

12.3.5.2  Rectangular Scanners
The simplest scanner geometry is that for which the prisms are enclosed within a rectan­
gular-shaped region. The general case is illustrated in Figure 12.11, where the active region 
is divided into an arbitrary number of variously shaped prisms. For θin ≪ 1 and Δn ≪ n, the 
result of applying Snell’s law at each interface is a cumulative deflection angle given by

where Δni, is the total index change across the ith interface, N is the total number of inter­
faces in the scanner, and ϕi is the angle the ith interface makes with the beam axis. Note 
that Equation 12.31 is valid regardless of the overall shape of the scanner, and each term 
in the sum is positive since both Δni and ϕi change signs from one interface to the next. For 
rectangular scanners with a fixed |Δni| = Δn at each interface, the scanning angle can be 
related to the width W and total length L of the device as follows:

Note that this is the same result as would be achieved for a scanner with a constant index gra­
dient, from Equation 12.11. We therefore have the somewhat surprising result that the scan­
ning angle does not depend on how many prisms are in the scanner, but only on the ratio 
L/W! To see why this is, note that as the number of interfaces increases, the angle of incidence 
becomes closer to normal thereby reducing the refraction at each interface. Consequently, 
the sum of the effects of all the interfaces is constant. The question of the effects of varying 
numbers of triangles is considered more closely below from a different point of view.
12.3.5.2.1  Optimum Number of Triangles in Rectangular Scanners

depend on the number of prisms or triangles. For a sufficiently large value of L/W, total

Handbook of Optical and Laser Scanning
internal reflection (TIR) can occur for one voltage polarity, but not the other. Consequently 
the scanning properties will be strongly asymmetric with respect to drive voltage polarity. 
On the other hand, if many interfaces are used, the incident angle at each interface will 
be sufficiently far from grazing that TIR cannot occur for practical values of drive volt­
age. Chen et al.20 have considered the scanning asymmetry as a function of the number of 
interfaces using ray-tracing simulations. As shown in Figure 12.12, the asymmetry in the 
scanning properties becomes negligible after about 10–15 interfaces.
Another consideration pertaining to the number of interfaces is the Fresnel transmission 
through the multiple interfaces. For small numbers of interfaces, the reflection at each inter­
face can be high owing to the near grazing incidence (even TIR is possible, as mentioned 
above). This reflected light is diverted from the optical path, resulting in low transmission 
through the device. In the opposite limit of very many interfaces, the beam approaches 
normal incidence at each interface. Thus the reflection at each interface approaches a finite 
value, while the number of such reflections continues to increase. Thus the total reflec­
tion increases for both large and small numbers of interfaces. An optimum number of 
interfaces can be found that minimizes the total reflection, or equivalently, maximizes the 
transmission through the device. For ∆n/n ≪ 1 and R ≪ 1, the normalized reflected inten­
sity R is approximately given by

Examination of this figure shows that although an optimum does exist, the reflected inten­
sity is negligible over the practical range of interfaces large enough to satisfy the symmetry 
condition discussed above. We conclude that as long as the number of interfaces exceeds 
10–15, it is satisfactory to assume that the properties of the scanner are independent of the 
number of interfaces.
12.3.5.2.2  Deflection Sensitivity for Rectangular Scanners
To obtain the deflection sensitivity for a rectangular device, we need only to substitute the 
expression for Δn into Equation 12.32. Using E3 = V/h in Table 12.2 for crystals of symmetry 
3m, the result is

where h is the thickness of the substrate, and the incident beam is polarized along the z-axis 
of the crystal (extraordinary wave). Bulk scanners will also work if the incident beam is 
polarized in the plane of a z-cut substrate (ordinary wave), but with reduced deflection. In 
this case, the deflection sensitivity is given by (Table 12.2):

It should be noted that Equations 12.35 and 12.36 are applicable to bulk devices; for wave­

This will result in a slight decrease in deflection sensitivity.

In practical geometries, there is usually a spacing s between the output plane of the scan­
ner and the edge of the crystal, as shown in Figure 12.14. This spacing provides a lon­
ger electrical creepage path around the end of the scanner, and allows for cutting and 
polishing operations to be performed without impinging on the active scanner area. In 
this case, the location of the pivot point as viewed from outside of the crystal is given by

12.3.5.3  Trapezoidal Scanners
One difficulty with the design of rectangular scanners results from the beam displacement 
within the scanner, as given by Equations 12.12 and 12.13. Clearly the width of the scanner 
must be increased to accommodate this displacement, but increasing the width reduces 
the deflection sensitivity. However, because of the shape of the trajectory, this increase is 
only needed at the output of the scanner. As discussed earlier, one way to address this is 
to focus the beam through the scanner so that the reduction in output beam diameter is 
comparable to the displacement. However, we saw that this technique reduces the number

12.3.5.3.3  Comparison of Trapezoidal and Rectangular Scanners
The increase in deflection sensitivity compared to rectangular scanners can be illustrated 
by considering rectangular and trapezoidal scanners with the same lengths, and the width 
of the rectangular scanner equal to the average of the input and output widths of the trape­
zoidal device. Thus, if WR is the width of the rectangular scanner and W0, W1 are the input 
and output widths of the trapezoidal scanner, we require

Assuming the same maximum index difference Δn Figure 12.16 shows the improvement 
gained by the trapezoidal geometry. The improvement is modest (<10%) for W0/WR > 0.5. 
Since the usual case is that the beam diameter is much larger than the output displace­
ment, W0/W1 and W0/WR are normally only slightly smaller than unity, yielding a typical 
improvement of a few percent.
12.3.5.4  Horn-Shaped Scanners
Since the scanning sensitivity is diminished as the width increases, the optimal solution 
is to increase the width gradually so as to track the beam trajectory. If the change in beam 
diameter through the scanner is neglected, the shape of the scanner can be obtained by 
simply adding a constant offset to the beam displacement, as shown in Figure 12.17a. The 
width of the scanner can therefore be written in the form

Remarkably, the fact that ∆n drops out of this equation means that a well-defined pivot 
point exists (i.e., LP,in does not depend on voltage), even in such a complex horn-shaped 
device.
12.3.5.4.3  Comparison of Horn-Shaped Scanners with Trapezoidal and Rectangular Scanners
The deflection sensitivity of a horn-shaped scanner with the same input width, output 
width, and length as a trapezoidal scanner is shown in Figure 12.16, normalized to that of 
a rectangular scanner with the same average width. The improvement over trapezoidal 
and rectangular scanners is clear.
A summary of the design equations for rectangular, trapezoidal, and horn-shaped scan­
ners is presented in Table 12.4.
12.3.5.5  Domain Inverted Total Internal Reflection Deflectors
Domain inversion in ferroelectric crystals can also be used to create relatively long, straight 
interfaces within a bulk crystal. Since the domains are antiparallel across the interface, an 
applied electric field will result in a step change in the index of refraction. If a light beam 
intersects this interface at very high angles (i.e., near grazing incidence) a state of TIR can 
result (Figure 12.19).
Eason and coworkers report an analysis of such a device,25 with an application 
to telecommunications switching in mind. Such a device would typically be oper­
ated in a digital fashion, ON or OFF, in order to steer a collimated beam into one or 
another optical fiber (with appropriate collection optics on the end of each fiber). Compared 
to a scanner composed of many triangles, such a TIR device will exhibit greater deflection 
for the same voltage and device size. This gives some advantage by shortening the package 
length since the two beams separate faster providing more room for the output fibers and 
their collimation optics. A further advantage is that TIR device performance may be engi­
neered to exhibit nearly polarization independent performance, while triangular prisms 
are strongly polarization dependent.
12.3.5.6  Domain Inverted Grating Structures
The component based upon patterned domains that has received the most attention in 
recent years is the quasi-phase-matched grating for second harmonic generation (SHG).13–17 
The frequency shifting effect occurs in a “periodically poled” region in the crystal, which 
is produced by forming many precisely spaced parallel domains in materials such as lith­
ium niobate or KTP.17 For instance, some early efforts were focused on producing blue light 
from IR laser diodes for use in data storage applications.
In SHG applications, the light propagates perpendicular to the poled stripes, and gen­
erally there is no applied electric field. By rotating the incident beam to near grazing inci­
dence and allowing for the application of an electric field, an EO Bragg grating is produced. 
This is analogous to an AO Bragg deflector where the electric field rather than the acoustic 
intensity controls the distribution of the light into the various orders.
Gnewuch and coworkers have designed and tested such a device operating at 633 nm.26 
Similar to the TIR device above, the incident light can be switched to two different posi­
tions. The advantage of this structure, however, is that it operates at approximately 25 
V, versus 500 V for a prismatic domain poled device operating with a similarly sized 
optical beam. This offers the potential for enormous electrical power savings during

­high-frequency operation. Without acoustic velocity issues, the EO version of the Bragg 
deflector can operate at high speeds and handle higher beam powers than an AO version 
could.
12.3.5.7  Other Poled Structures
The power of patterned ferroelectric domain inversion is that a wide variety of optical 
components can be fabricated by designing masks with appropriate shapes. For example, 
although patterning the optimal horn-shape photolithographically is straightforward, the 
fabrication of a horn-shaped scanner by assembling discrete prisms would be prohibi­
tively difficult. Further, with patterned domain inversion multiple components can be eas­
ily integrated on a common substrate.
As another example, EO cylindrical lenses can be formed by patterning oval, semicir­
cular, or circular inverted domains.27,28 Stacks of such lenses are readily combined with a 
prism scanner.29 An optical integrated system of this type could be used, for example, to 
collimate the light from a fiber before entering the scanner. It should be noted, however, 
that lenses made in this way are cylindrical lenses, and hence only focus in the plane of the 
substrate. This is of no consequence in planar waveguide devices, but must be considered 
if bulk operation is desired.
A periodically poled structure can also be integrated with prism scanners to realize 
a device capable of generating and steering blue light.30 The SHG conversion efficiency 
of this bulk integrated device was relatively low, however, since the optical intensity in

the grating was limited by the focused beam diameter. To achieve the highest conversion 
efficiency, the light must be confined to a channel waveguide.
The issue of low conversion efficiency encountered with the first SHG scanner device 
can be addressed by combining the above elements to form an integrated SHG grating, 
lens stack, and scanner, as shown in Figures 12.20 and 12.21.31 The channel waveguide in 
the grating keeps the optical intensity high to maximize the nonlinear frequency doubling 
efficiency. The output of the channel waveguide then opens into a planar waveguide, and 
the beam subsequently diverges. A lens stack is next used to collimate the beam before 
entering the scanner.
12.4  ELECTRONIC DRIVERS FOR ELECTRO-OPTIC DEFLECTORS
12.4.1  Overview
A primary consideration when applying EO deflector devices as part of a system, and 
an issue often raised by potential users, is the electronic driver. The driver is essentially 
an amplifier, converting a low-voltage control signal to the higher voltage required to 
achieve the desired optical index change. It is usually custom-designed for each applica­
tion, requires specialized circuit design skills and may present safety hazards. Depending 
on the specific system requirements, the design challenges can vary; however, the high-
voltage (HV) nature of these devices can be the single most restricting factor, as compo­
nent availability can restrict the design space. Also, the HV supplies required to power the 
driver(s) can be a considerable cost and design challenge.
Other parameters that can influence the design are: switching speeds; repetition rate; 
switch/component package density requirements; electromagnetic interference (EMI) and 
radio frequency interference (RFI) considerations; switching power efficiency; and ther­
mal considerations.
Significant strides in recent years in power field effect transistor (FET) and insulated 
gate dipolar transistor (IGBT) technology have alleviated many practical constraints and 
enabled power densities and performance that were not possible in earlier years. These 
devices, developed by Motorola, IXYS, International Rectifier, Toshiba, ST Microelectronics, 
and others, primarily for the motor drive/control industry, can be well suited for EO scan­
ner drive applications. Also, very fast HV diodes by these same manufacturers and surface 
mount HV capacitors from Johansson Dielectric and others have driven achievable perfor­
mance up considerably.
12.4.2  High-Voltage Power Supplies
Most EO scanner drivers rely on a constant high voltage supply as a subsystem. For 
instance, a modulator system can be realized by switching one electrode of an EO element 
between a high voltage and ground while the other electrode is held at ground. Benchtop 
HV power supplies are readily available from several manufacturers including Spellman, 
Ultravolt, Trek, and others. The market for application-specific HV supplies is not large 
and, as such, cost can often be quite high and standard packaging options somewhat lim­
ited. In many cases it is desirable to design a custom HV supply that suits the application.
There are several design topologies available for HV power supply design. Whether the 
input power is AC line voltage or a DC supply, a voltage boost converter of some type 

622 
Handbook of Optical and Laser Scanning
needs to be employed. A typical boost converter is discussed and then some higher effi­
cient topologies covered.
12.4.2.1  Conventional Boost Converters
Switching supply topologies, such as boost converters, can be utilized when a high voltage 
needs to be generated from a much lower one. Typical boost converters consist of a switch­
ing transistor (Q1), usually a FET, with an inductor (L1) connected between the drain and 
the low voltage supply. Current is transferred discontinuously at the switching frequency, 
and the stored energy amount and pulse duration are proportional to the output voltage 
feedback signal (Figure 12.22).
The load in a boost converter is usually fed through a rectifying diode. The current 
in the inductor I

/(
(
)). When the FET is turned off that energy is then 
transferred to the load via the rectifying diode. A portion of Vout is fed back through a 
pulse width modulation (PWM) converter to control the desired pulse width of the FET 
drive. Boost converters are typically only used in lower power applications of less than 
10 W.
12.4.2.2  Flyback Converters
In many HV applications with moderate to high power requirements, the size of the induc­
tor in the boost converter needed to store the proper amount of energy becomes unwieldy, 
and losses become high. In these cases, a transformer can replace the boost converter 
inductor. This topology is referred to as a flyback converter. A schematic example is shown 
in Figure 12.23.
The basic operation of a flyback converter is that when the FET is turned ON, current 
ramps up at a rate di/dt = (Vdc)/Lpm, where Lpm is the magnetizing inductance of the pri­
mary winding of transformer T1. When the FET is subsequently turned off the current has

where Np and Nm are the primary and secondary winding count. Using a higher voltage 
primary Vdc can help minimize transformer size and keep the Ipk to manageable levels. 
Also, one can employ multiple winding outputs to increase output voltage as needed or to 
select one of multiple output levels.
The flyback converter topology can be used for 5–150 W supplies for Vout ≤ 5000 V. A lim­
iting factor can be that the required current in the primary of the flyback transformer is not 
excessive while keeping within an acceptable, and realistic, transformer size. Efficiencies 
of the order of 85% and above are achievable.
12.4.3  Digital Drivers
Many EO systems such as telecommunications switches and display system optical beam 
modulators, can be realized using drivers with only two output states. The term “digi­
tal driver” is used here, although the voltages being considered can range to 1000 V and 
above, requiring far different components than digital logic circuits.
12.4.3.1  Simple Totem Pole Circuits
The simplest and highest speed driver for controlling a capacitive EO device is a “totem 
pole” or “half bridge” arrangement of FETs where the totem pole is connected across a HV 
power supply and the device is connected between the FETs to ground (Figure 12.24). Each 
FET is turned ON or OFF in turn to set the voltage across the output (load) EO device to 
either the high or low state. Both FETs are never turned ON at the same time—this would 
lead to a high current directly from the high voltage supply and would likely destroy the 
FETs unless proper limiting circuitry is used.

In some cases, the FETs would have resistors in series with them to dissipate some of 
the charge/discharge energy (without the resistors, nearly all of the energy is dissipated in 
the FETs during the switching transition, which can cause substantial heating). This will, 
of course, slow down the charging and discharging edges slightly. This straightforward 
totem pole results in a very high speed, although very lossy, method to drive the output 
capacitor, in this case, an EO scanner.
The high-side drive can be easily crafted from a p-channel FET where HV < 200 V. 
However, many practical applications can require a higher voltage, and such FETs are not 
available. As such, n-channel FETs are recommended for most applications and can be 
utilized with a floating high-side gate drive. A simple implementation of this would be a 
transformer-coupled FET gate drive circuit.
It should be noted that this high-side gate driver must be crafted such that in the “dwell 
ON state,” the gate drive must be able to keep the FET ON for the longest system dwell 
time, which may be an undetermined duration. If continuous (infinite) dwell is required 
then a refresh circuit should be added to the transformer-coupled FET gate driver circuit.
Gate drivers for the FETs can be crafted from discrete elements—many of those that were 
designed for the motor drive industry can be utilized. The main FETs must be selected for 
low junction capacitances rather than minimal Rds(on) as a primary constraint as these capac­
itances must be charged and discharged during the switching cycle and can be comparable 
to the load capacitance of the EO device itself and contribute significantly to circuit losses.
Devices such as the highly integrated totem pole driver ICs from International Rectifier 
(IR2213), ST Microelectronics (L6285), and others can be utilized for applications up to 1000 
V. Beyond that, IGBTs can be employed. These devices have Ton/Toff propagation delays 
and these parameters can drift significantly with temperature such that timing control cir­
cuitry must take it into account. Switching speeds on the order of 100 V/ns are possible.
The maximum voltage rating of most devices in the circuit can be cut in half, thus greatly 
increasing the component choices and safety factors, by utilizing a full bridge drive where 
two totem poles are set up to switch 1/2HV  each to the load. Efficiency benefits can also be 
realized as the loss from the two charge cycles can be less than one-half that of switching the

entire HV in one step. Further, this topology enables “adiabatic” switching to be utilized such 
that further efficiency gains can be realized—this concept is covered in Section 12.4.3.2.
12.4.3.2  Adiabatic Drivers
Inherent in traditional switching logic design is the CV2/2 of energy that is dissipated 
every time a transistor is turned on to charge or discharge a capacitive load. This dissipa­
tion is a direct consequence of the fact that, in traditional switching logic configurations, 
charge for the load is taken from a power or ground rail and that the device to be charged 
initially sits at a fixed potential very different from that of the rail.
In a simple totem pole application of charging and discharging a load C to a voltage V, 
the energy dissipated to flip the output is E
CV
= 1
2
2 . This energy does not depend on the 
needed time to switch, nor the clock rate, but is strictly related to the energy transfer pro­
cess. In fact, during the rising transition, the power supply delivers all the charge Q = CV 
at voltage V, while during the falling transition that charge is returned at zero voltage. So, 
actually, the energy E = CV2 is drawn from the HV supply, with half of the energy being 
stored in the load capacitor, and the other half being dissipated in losses.
Put another way, half of this energy is dissipated by the FET in the pull-up network 
(rising transition) and the other half by the pull-down network (falling transition), inde­
pendent of how fast the transitions are. To reduce the dissipated energy, only methods that 
reduce the load capacitances or the supply voltage can be applied, but in any case they are 
strictly limited by the load C and voltage V.
The term “adiabatic process” is most often applied to the thermodynamic cycle by which 
a gas, such as air, is heated or cooled by expansion or compression without an external 
source or sink of heat.
The energy transfer processes in the electronic driver can be done adiabatically if, dur­
ing the rising (or falling) transition, the power supply delivers (or recovers) the charge to 
(or from) the load at a potential close to that of the source/supply potential. In other words, 
in order to implement adiabatic processes in a switching circuit, the switching devices 
should be turned on only when the source-drain voltage is zero, and source-drain voltage 
should be changed only while the device is off; and, if possible, given the desired perfor­
mance of the circuit, any voltage change must be done as gradually as possible.
There are difficulties in implementing this solution, however. First, the logic must be 
designed so that switching transitions can occur only at suitable times (that is, only when 
there is no potential drop across the switching devices). Choreographing this timing can 
add considerable complexity as there are switching delays inherent in the FETs and gate 
driver elements. FET drivers and control circuitry also have temperature-dependent char­
acteristics. Secondly, zero energy dissipation only occurs with arbitrarily slow switching: 
with realistic switching rates, the energy savings might not be enough to make up for 
the additional complexity. Lastly, adiabatic design relies on the assumption that one can 
efficiently provide the moving supply (in fact a clock) to the circuit that it drives. This last 
characteristic is not achievable with HV applications and is more suited for logic level 
designs.
In Figure 12.25, note that the two half bridges are configured such that the “lo-side” −HV 
switch is referenced to the −HV rail. This is fairly easily implemented as will be discussed 
later.
The full bridge circuit operates adiabatically as follows. Start with the crystal dis­
charged, that is PH and NL are off (or open) while PL and NH are turned on. To charge 
the crystal, one of the grounded FETs, PL is turned OFF—this is adiabatic, in that it is 

626

done while no current is flowing (Vds ~ 0 V). Only a very short period of time is required 
for it to fully turn off, then immediately turn ON switch PH. Obviously PL must be fully 
OFF before PH can begin to turn ON to avoid a catastrophic shoot-through condition HV 
to GND. Note the basic totem pole circuit always switched with Vds at ~ HV, leading to 
losses in the FET.
This switch transition will result in the following: the +HV device, PH, will need to sup­
ply energy to charge the load and the parasitic capacitance of PL, CPL, which includes the 
capacitance of the protection diode, which is usually a significant component of the total 
load. Thus the energy required from the +HV supply is (Cload + CPL) (HV)2. Since each HV 
supply is one-half the voltage of what it was in the simple totem pole arrangement, this 
translates to (Cload + CPL)HV2/4 of energy drawn so far.
The next step, to fully charge the crystal, is to turn NH OFF (again while Vds ~ 0 V) and 
turn on NL. As before the −HV supply needs to charge up Cload + CNH. The required energy 
thus to turn ON the Cload is:

(12.50)
Since each HV in this case is one-half the voltage compared to the simple totem pole case, 
the energy is (Cload)(HV/4) + (Cload)(HV/4) or (Cload)(HV2/2), a saving of approximately half 
of the energy (minus that to charge the stray and parasitic capacitances of the additional 
switching device) for each cycle.
For the adiabatic discharge, NL is turned OFF, then NH is turned ON. This will force 
the recovery of half the charge in the crystal to go back to +HV supply (or Cload*HV2/4 
of energy is recovered). Also, the parasitic capacitance of Cp(NL) will be dissipated and 
Cp(NH) will be charged to Vy, requiring Cp(NH)*Vy*2 energy from Vy supply. This total 
energy is equivalent to Cp(NH)Vy*2/4. Finally, to completely discharge the crystal, we 
need to turn OFF PH and turn ON switch PL.

may be halved compared to a simple totem pole circuit. This can simplify some design tasks. This type of circuit 
can also be controlled to operate “adiabatically,” which offers significant power savings.

Of course, the HV supplies used in an adiabatic driver control scheme must be able 
to source and sink current—which is not true of most HV supplies. However, additional 
circuit elements can be added to the flyback converter to accommodate this requirement. 
Further gains in overall energy efficiency can be realized by making the HV power sink 
operate as an energy recovery system. One option for this is shown in Figure 12.26, where 
the energy pushed back to the HV rail is fed into a step-down DC–DC converter with the 
output connected to a system level low voltage bus.32
12.4.4  Analog Drivers
The wide variety of EO applications and elements leads naturally to a wide variety of 
drivers, especially for “nondigital” applications. Possible designs range from those using 
densely packaged hybrid circuitry to those using 4000 V, or higher, vacuum tubes for

control elements. A variety of IC op-amps are also available up to 600 V, allowing for 
essentially arbitrary waveforms within the bandwidth of the amplifier.
Analog drivers are generally specified by their operating voltage and bandwidth. The 
bandwidth of a driver is always specified in relation to the load; the usable bandwidth of 
the driver will decrease as the load capacitance increases. For this reason, the cabling or 
other connection between the driver and the EO element must be considered in addition 
to the actual EO element load when specifying the driver, since they can sometimes domi­
nate the overall system performance. Efficiency, single-ended or differential input, linear­
ity, and other factors may also be specified.
A sampling of the variety of designs possible is:
	
1.	Single ended: this is the simplest, most straightforward variety of driver. The 
driver is connected to one electrode on the EO device, with the other usually held 
at ground. Op-amps are typical single-ended drivers.
	
2.	Differential: some amplifiers work best in the middle of their output voltage range. 
A differential driver is constructed using two amplifiers, each connected to one 
side of the EO element and each biased to one-half the peak voltage. As the voltage 
on one is raised, the other is lowered. Differential topologies can be used where 
deflection in either direction from nominal is required. They also effectively act as 
a single-ended design but with twice the voltage—which may be useful if FETs at 
the desired voltage are not available.
	
3.	Resonant: since EO elements act as capacitors, they can be coupled with an induc­
tor and driven at the resonant frequency of the pair. Voltage amplification is pos­
sible, and standard techniques can be used to synchronize the circuit with other 
elements of the complete optical system.
	
4.	Transformer coupled: voltage amplification is also possible using a transformer. 
This type of circuit may be operated in a resonant mode, or to produce some 
other waveform. Transformer coupling is best suited to periodic waveforms 
since the bandwidth of a transformer can be limited, and special tuning and 
compensation techniques may be required for complex waveforms. Triangle-
wave drive voltages, useful for some display applications, can be done very 
effectively.
12.5  PROPERTIES AND SELECTION OF ELECTRO-OPTIC MATERIALS
12.5.1  General
The optical performance of an EO deflection system depends on the material chosen, the 
operating electric field, and the characteristics of the beam to be deflected (wavelength, 
diameter, divergence, M2 quality factor, and so on). Unfortunately for system designers, 
there is no one “best” material that meets most application requirements.
Most practical EO materials are crystals with anisotropic properties, and almost all of 
these are grown by crystal suppliers because they are not abundant in nature. Properties 
can vary by manufacturer and grade, making it important to work in concert with the 
material suppliers when selecting a material; they are also good sources of material prop­

erty information. Extensive lists of material properties can also be found in the literature.33 
Electro-optical properties of some common crystals are shown in Table 12.5.
Crystal purity, optical quality, internal strain, physical size, doping, domain structure, 
electrical conductivity, and other quality measures can vary widely from vendor to ven­
dor, from one boule to the next by a single vendor, and within a single boule as well. These 
and related factors have led the industry to focus on a few materials that are in relatively 
large-scale production, such as lithium niobate and ADP, which are covered in Section 
12.5.2. Other materials, such as lithium tantalate and KTP, are also covered since they are 
steadily increasing in quality and availability.
Materials with very high EO coefficients, such as bulk form strontium barium niobate 
(SBN) and PLZT in the form of deposited films, are starting to appear. Other “new” mate­
rials are doped forms of lithium niobate or tantalate, and stoichiometric lithium niobate 
and tantalate. Many of these materials still exhibit performance variations between sup­
pliers—it is best to discuss your needs with several crystal suppliers and perform multiple 
sample runs to ensure that the proper selection is made.

12.5.2  ADP, KDP, and Related Isomorphs
Relatively easy commercial growth processes make ADP (NH4H2PO4) and KDP (KH2PO4) 
popular materials for bulk EO devices. High optical quality crystals can be grown to over 
10 cm diameter, and can be cut, polished, and mounted without undue difficulty. In both 
materials, the hydrogen atoms may be replaced with deuterium. In this case they are 
referred to as AD*P and KD*P. This replacement results in an increase in the linear EO 
coefficients by a factor of ~2.5.
The resistivity of ADP and related materials is very high, typically > 1010 Ω cm when 
operated near room temperature. As operating temperatures approach the Curie tempera­
ture, CT, the loss tangent and the dielectric constant increase, leading to heating and high 
power draws on electronic drivers if operated at high speeds. Heating in the crystal also 
leads to beam distortion via the thermo-optic properties of the material.
One major drawback to using ADP and its isomorphs in EO scanning systems is that the 
materials are hygroscopic. They are typically housed in a hermetic package that is filled 
with a dry gas or an index matching liquid that also provides electrical insulation. Some 
of the liquids are toxic, although the packaging is generally reliable.
12.5.3  Lithium Niobate and Related Materials
A large class of ferroelectric materials have the form A1+B5+O3 or A2+B4+O3, and are related 
to the mineral perovskite (CaTiO3). Several of these materials are in mass production for 
devices based on their piezoelectric properties, such as LiNbO3 for surface acoustic wave 
filters, which are found in cell phones and a host of other signal processing applications. 
Czochralski growth is the typical practice, with boule diameters approaching 15 cm for 
LiNbO3, although 7.5 and 10 cm is more common. During the processing of crystal boules, 
they are typically poled to form a single domain throughout by heating to a point near 
the Curie temperature and then applying a DC electric field, which is maintained during 
the cooldown. This ensures that all crystal domains have uniform orientation—a critical 
consideration for good optical quality of the ensuing device.
The perovskite materials are not water soluble, eliminating some of the packaging prob­
lems encountered with ADP and similar materials. Another use of perovskites, in partic­
ular lithium tantalate, is as a pyroelectric detection element. If precautions are not taken 
in handling and processing, extremely high voltages can be generated between the faces 
of wafers. This charging can lead to electrical flashovers, which can damage electrodes or 
other coatings, or it can damage attached electrical equipment such as drivers or thermo­
couples. Wherever possible, controlled slow heating and cooling are recommended; the 
use of air ionizers in the work space also mitigates these effects.
The piezoelectric properties of the perovskites must be considered whenever the deflector 
will be operated at high speeds. The electrostrictive strain component of the index change 
can be as large as the EO component if a mechanical resonance is present. The mechanical 
performance of the entire device assembly—crystal, electrical leads, mounting adhesive and 
mounting base—must be considered early on, but careful testing is still a requirement.
Lithium niobate (LiNbO3) and lithium tantalate (LiTaO3) are the most common per­
ovskite materials in use. For reasons of producibility and quality, they are typically grown 
to be slightly lithium-rich—this is referred to as congruently grown niobate or tantalate. 
These congruent materials exhibit Curie temperatures of 1470 and 890 K, respectively, giv­
ing them stable EO properties at room temperature or slightly elevated temperatures. They 
are also commercially available with fairly consistent properties across several vendors.

Electro-Optical Scanners 
631
Recently, stoichiometric lithium niobate and lithium tantalate have been produced in 
commercially relevant sizes.l8,34 These materials exhibit lower coercive fields, which leads 
to easier fabrication of poled devices, and higher EO coefficients, as well as a broader trans­
mission range. Being relatively new, it is best to contact the crystal growers for detailed 
information on properties and processing practices for stoichiometric materials.
Various dopants can be introduced when growing lithium niobate or tantalate to alter 
properties for special applications. Magnesium is a common dopant for lithium niobate, 
added to mitigate photorefractive damage from short wavelengths. This variant of the 
material is often used when producing SHG or other nonlinear devices, typically in the 
visible spectrum.
Significant effort has been applied to the problem of domain inversion processing of 
lithium niobate and, to a lesser extent, lithium tantalate. These efforts were driven primar­
ily by interests in SHGs and related nonlinear devices, but the practices are transferable to 
the production of scanners, as mentioned previously.
Barium titanate (BaTiO3) and KTN (a solid solution of KTaO3 and KNbO3) belong in 
the perovskite group of materials. They have good EO properties, but have critical tem­
peratures near or below room temperature. This makes some properties very temperature 
dependent, and can result in creating or changing ferroelectric domains simply by han­
dling and processing the crystal. They are not in wide use at this time.
12.5.4  Potassium Titanyl Phosphate (KTP)
In 1976 the Du Pont Company reported35 on the growth and properties of the crystalline 
material KxRb1−xTiOPO4. The material is ferroelectric and has found use in the production 
of SHGs and other nonlinear devices. The material is relatively difficult to grow (compared 
to lithium niobate), although the situation is improving due in part to military interest in 
the material, with slabs over 40 mm square being produced.
Dopants and special processing are used to produce various grades of KTP, one must 
check with manufacturers for availability and detailed properties. It is difficult to produce 
domain-inverted devices in KTP since the coercive field and dielectric strength are very 
near each other. Problems have also been encountered with relatively high electrical con­
ductivity of the crystals, especially in large flux-grown crystals, further limiting its appeal.
12.5.5  Other Materials
12.5.5.1  AB-Type Binary Compounds
The main interest in these materials has been for EO devices in the infrared, particularly at 
10.6 μm for use in CO2 laser systems. GaAs, ZnTe, ZnS, CdS, and CdTe are among the most 
common materials that are available in large sizes. The EO coefficients of these materials 
are relatively small, only about 10% of lithium niobate, but their transmission beyond 10 
μm may make them useful in some applications, especially for military uses.
12.5.5.2  Kerr Effect in Liquids
Much attention has been paid in the past to Kerr effect liquids, especially nitrobenzene.1 
The attraction was due to the high purity of materials compared to most crystals, and the 
basically unlimited size of the resulting device.
Advances in crystal growth techniques have largely mitigated the perceived quality and 
size advantages a liquid material may offer. In addition, the liquids can exhibit heating, 

632

currents, turbulence, and other behavior that affects performance. They are not widely 
used or considered for application at this time.
12.5.5.3  Electro-Optic Ceramics in the (Pb, La)(Zr, Ti)O3 System
Lanthanum-modified lead zirconate titanate (PLZT) ceramic materials have been investi­
gated since 1969 for their EO properties, which can be tailored to a degree by controlling 
the precise chemical makeup of the material.1
These materials are not available in large single crystal form, limiting their application 
to scanning systems. Scanning devices based on thin films of PLZT have been proposed, 
but the problems of coupling into and out of such films are daunting.
12.5.5.4  Other Materials
Significant EO materials development is still ongoing, driven by the reality that almost 
all current EO systems could be improved by using materials with higher EO coefficients, 
higher optical damage limits, lower conductivity, or improvements in other technical 
parameters. Efforts can be roughly characterized as either creating new materials or modi­
fying existing ones.
An example of a relatively new material is SBN. The crystal is grown by the Czochralski 
method, with boule diameters typically under 50 mm. There are several, slightly differ­
ent formulations available, and quality and properties can vary even in modestly sized 
samples. Very high EO coefficients and relatively low Curie temperature make the mate­
rial attractive for future applications. It is best to contact the material growers for current 
specifications prior to developing a design with an SBN element.
An example of modifications to a standard material is the development of magnesium 
doped lithium niobate, available from a variety of suppliers. The doping raises the optical 
damage threshold in the short wavelength part of the transmission band—a characteristic 
important for SHG devices, among others.
Careful selection, specification, inspection, and qualification of materials are a key to 
successful EO system design. Given the continuous improvement in crystal growing prac­
tices, inspection techniques, and materials formulation it is imperative to work closely 
with the materials suppliers during the design process.
12.5.6  Material Selection
Currently, there are only a handful of materials suitable for use in commercial EO systems. 
In addition to optical transparency at the desired wavelength, the following factors are 
common to nearly all applications.
	
1.	High electrical resistivity: greater than 1010 Ω cm is desired. This requirement stems 
from the desire for no resistive heating when operating voltages (typically hun­
dreds of volts) are applied to the device. Ion migration can also occur, especially in 
the presence of DC fields, which can create substantial optical perturbations.
	
2.	High optical homogeneity: refractive index variations of less than 1 in 106 are 
desired. This requirement helps to preserve beam quality, and can also be a 
stand-in for crystal compositional variations.

Electro-Optical Scanners 
633
	
3.	Large EO effect: absolute index variations of at least 10−4 are desired, with reason­
able applied voltage. Excessively high voltages create packaging problems, long-
term drift due to ion migration and require high driver power when high-speed 
operation is required.
	
4.	Processability: standard handling and process operations should not impact mate­
rial quality or device performance. For reasonable cost, the materials must be able 
to be oriented, cut, polished, AR coated, and mounted with only minor (if any) 
departure from practices used for other optical materials.
If the device is going to be operated at high frequencies, the dielectric constant and loss 
tangent become important considerations, with thermal conductivity and temperature 
dependence of optical properties also needing to be considered.
If the device under consideration will be produced via a domain inversion process, other 
factors must be added to the list of considerations. Obviously it must be ferroelectric, which 
implies that piezoelectric and pyroelectric effects must also be taken into consideration. 
Also, the desire to pole the material will restrict the orientations available. Poled devices 
should also not be operated near to their coercive field or near the Curie temperature, 
which can be quite low for some materials, or there is a chance of depoling occurring.
12.6  ELECTRO-OPTIC DEFLECTION SYSTEM DESIGN PROCESS
Selecting a system design for a particular set of operating parameters is an iterative pro­
cess, likely requiring thorough analysis of multiple trial designs. The complex interplay 
of material properties, EO element geometry, electronic power consumption, operating 
speeds, and the realities of current fabrication methods does not lend itself to a closed form 
solution, nor are there large catalogs of standard alternatives to choose from.
The recommended process is:
	
1.	Verify that the speed, optical efficiency, or ruggedness of an EO deflector is 
required. If other technologies such as galvanometers or AO deflectors can be 
used, they are likely going to triumph in a head-to-head comparison of total sys­
tem cost and complexity.
	
2.	Consider the wavelength of the laser to be used. Few, if any, materials are optically 
clear across the entire spectrum of wavelengths available today. Also, many mate­
rial properties vary with wavelength so it is important to look at the properties of 
interest at the wavelength of interest.
	
3.	Consider whether the system can be built using a single linear polarization. If not, 
it is likely that beam splitting and recombining after deflection will be required, 
adding significant complexity and cost to the system.
	
4.	Review the operating environment in light of safety and reliability of high-voltage elec­
trical systems. If moisture and dust are present, the EO scanner will likely need to be 
placed in a sealed housing, adding length and additional windows to the optical path.

634 
Handbook of Optical and Laser Scanning
	
5.	Select appropriate design guidelines and safety factors such as electrical creepage 
distances, dielectric strength, and optical power per unit area on surfaces. These 
guidelines and safety factors may bound the design options.
	
6.	Generate and analyze trial designs. One aspect that is sometimes overlooked is the 
mechanical response of the EO material. All attractive EO crystals exhibit piezo­
electric responses to some degree. In some cases, high-speed electrical pulses can 
excite mechanical resonances that create a time-varying strain in the material, 
which can alter the deflection from that expected or contribute to beam losses.
	
7.	Verify that the selected design can actually be built by consulting with the appro­
priate material suppliers, electronics designers, optical designers, and engineers 
familiar with current practice for all manufacturing steps.
12.7  CONCLUSIONS
Electro-optic scanning systems can be very fast and optically very efficient. This perfor­
mance often comes at the cost of working near the cutting edge of materials, electronics, and 
processing technologies. The demands for speed are likely to continue increasing, how­
ever, as laser and computing technology continue to advance. To address these demands, a 
true systems approach should be used when designing an EO scanning system. The over­
lapping implications of decisions in areas as diverse as HV electronic drivers, mechanical 
isolation, temperature control, and beam size must be weighed carefully.
Large scale application of EO scanners has not yet occurred due to the difficulties and 
uncertainties discussed in this chapter. Recent advances in telecommunications switching, 
computer-to-plate printing, and biomédical imaging applications are driving development 
of EO devices and electronic drivers at a rapid pace. New EO materials, with new combina­
tions of properties, are also being developed. Such progress in each of the key areas of EO 
scanning system design and construction may eventually lead to their wider application.

13.1  INTRODUCTION
The piezoelectric effect is the production of positive and negative charges on the surface 
of certain types of crystalline structures in the presence of an externally applied force that 
changes the shape of the crystal. The converse is also true. When positive and negative 
charges are applied to the surface of these same crystals, forces are produced within the 
crystals which change its shape. This inverse piezoelectric effect has recently been used in 
micropositioning devices to good effect. In low voltage (<200 V) applications, a potential 
of −20 V to 150 V is applied to bonded stacks of such crystals so that they expand. With 
current piezoelectric stacks available commercially today, such expansion is on the order 
of 1 µm for every 1 mm of stacked piezoelectric crystal. Due to this rather small expansion, 
and the unpredictable trajectory of the crystal faces, flexure hinges are commonly used to

both amplify and guide the motion in a piezo stage. Major advances in stage design within 
the past 15 years have resulted in a large variety of scanning and fine positioning devices 
which take advantage of the rather unique properties of this type of drive mechanism.
Piezoelectric flexure drive mechanisms offer a number of advantages over traditional step­
ping and servo motor bearing guide stages. One of the main advantages of this type of drive 
is their very high resolution. Since the entire flexure mechanism is driven by the smooth 
expansion of a crystal, it is a friction and stiction free system with a resolution that is only 
limited by the electrical noise on the voltage potential being applied to create the inverse 
piezoelectric effect and the mechanical noise that may affect the flexure structure from the 
environment. This has been the driving factor behind the development of extremely low-
noise amplifiers and highly stiff, robust mechanical flexures with high resonant frequencies 
to keep outside vibrations that may excite the stage to a minimum. A second advantage of 
piezoelectric stages is the crystal’s ability to exert extremely high forces. A 25-mm2 area of 
PZT (lead zirconium titanate) can exert a force in excess of 1000 N. A third advantage of 
piezoelectric stages is their high resonant frequency. PZT preloaded stacks by themselves 
may safely operate up to 75 kHz and, when integrated into a flexure mechanism, 4 kHz is not 
uncommon for a tilting stage, making them very useful in laser scanning applications.
A number of obstacles present themselves in practice when using piezoelectric materials 
in a laser scanning system. These include a large hysteresis in voltage versus position, drift 
or creep, unpredictable force vectors during crystal expansion, temperature limitations 
due to the Curie temperature and reduction of the piezoelectric effect at low temperatures, 
environmental noise amplification by the flexure design, low tolerance for tensile forces, 
and electrical failure due to ion migration at the electrical contacts.
The object of this chapter will be to give a practical understanding of the use of these 
devices allowing the scientist or engineer to make the most of their inherent advantages 
while addressing the constraints they impose.
13.2  STRUCTURE AND DESIGN
Piezoelectric ceramics exhibit a Perovskite ionic lattice structure (AXO3). Below their Curie 
temperature these types of crystals exhibit an inherent polarization. This is caused by a 
deviation of the titanium ion from its center position within the crystal lattice which cre­
ates an electrical dipole.
Under normal conditions such a ceramic exhibits an anisotropic structure and all the 
dipoles within the material domains of the ceramic are oriented randomly. However, in 
the presence of a strong electric field these domains become ferroelectric. The dipoles all 
align in the direction of the electric field. This effect is long term. After removal of this 
strong electric field, the structure relaxes but remains strongly polarized (Figure 13.1).
Depending on the orientation of the electric field to the crystal structure, forces genera­
tion by the piezoceramic can be characterized as longitudinal d33, transverse d31 or shear 
d15. The transverse mode is used in bi-morph (bending) and tube piezoelectric actuators. 
Stacked-type actuators use the longitudinal mode for expansion. To somewhat limit the 
scope of this chapter, we will concentrate on theory and devices which take advantage of 
the longitudinal mode.
Modern piezo stack structures consist of hundreds of thin layers of PZT with a thickness 
of approximately 100 µm. Electrodes are arranged on opposite sides of the stack structure

with connections to deposited metallic film such that alternating charged and grounded 
plates are sandwiched between the crystal stacks (Figure 13.2). The very thin layers of PZT 
require relatively low voltages in order for all dipoles to become completely aligned. A 
reversal in the polarity of these plates and therefore the direction of the electric field can 
result in some contraction of the crystalline structure, but the majority of the motion can 
be achieved by expansion.
Imagine the domain dipoles as arrows which orientate along the direction of the electric 
field. Applying a high field means the arrow stands vertically, head on top (maximum 
stroke). Without the electrical field the arrow lays horizontally (minimum stroke). A rever­
sal of the polarity of the electric field lets the arrow stand also, but head on bottom (maxi­
mum stroke) (Figure 13.3).
This is caused by the essential deviation of the titanium ion. In reality the “arrows” 
rotate only a few degrees. Saturation may exist even when all “arrows” are not aligned 
exactly parallel to each other; most of the “arrows “ reached the maximum position early 
and some later, but the magnitude of the whole stroke remains the same for a given time 
period.
Many devices take advantage of the extended range offered by this contraction and 
hence most power supplies offer a voltage range which extends down to −20 V. Stack man­
ufacturers recommend upper voltage limits of 100 V to 150 V. This limit is imposed by 
the breakthrough field strength of the ceramic and is affected by the thicknesses of the 
layers.

The physical structure of these stacks—layers of charged metal plates sandwiched 
between an insulating material is, of course, the classical structure of a parallel-plate 
capacitor and, as you might imagine, these stacks have a quite large capacitance.
Solving for the capacitance of a parallel-plate capacitor we have the formula:
	
C = (εoεrA)/d
where A is the area of the plate, and d is the distance between them. The material spe­
cific relative permittivity εr takes into account the charge bonded by the ceramic material 
(dielectric) and greatly increases the capacitance.
From this formula the capacitance of a single layer of 5 mm × 5 mm PZT can be 
calculated:
	
C = (8.9E−12)F/m * 50E6 * (25E−6)m²/100(E−6)m
And therefore a 10-mm stack of 100 such disks would have a capacitance of appr. 1.0 µF at 
a 50-Hz measuring frequency.
One might think from this calculation that d is, in this case, a variable which depends 
on electric field strength which is directly proportional to the voltage applied to the metal 
plates within the stack. As the stack expands or contracts, this value will change accord­
ingly. However, the change in d for an application of 130 V is typically 0.1% (0.1 µm for a 
100-µm layer) and for calculations concerning electrical requirements, this value is too 
small to be significant and other factors such as temperature and strain dependence are 
much larger than this. It should also be noted that current production methods for PZT 
layers are such that the thickness can vary quite a bit. Tolerance on stack thickness (and 
therefore capacitance, and motion/V (sensitivity)) can be as high as 10%.
There are two different methods to prepare multilayer stacks. In the first method, discs 
are cut from a ceramic bulk, and then sandwiched between electrical contact films and 
epoxy glue. This is finished by a pressing process. In the second method the ceramic is 
powdered and applied to the contact film, layer by layer followed by sintering process 
(without epoxy). The tensile strength of the electrical contact/PZT bonds determines the 
tensile strength of the stack.

This tensile strength is relatively weak compared to the compressive load that the stacks 
can endure. Under high dynamical operation internal accelerations inside the stack can 
generate forces which exceed the tensile strength limit of the bonds resulting in a delami­
nating of the layers. To prevent this, it is necessary to apply a preload to the stack of suf­
ficient strength to overcome any internal force. A typical preload for a stack is 150 N. Even 
with this strong preload it is possible to damage the stack if it, or the mechanical structure 
of which it is a part, is driven at resonant frequency with a large amplitude. It is therefore 
important to determine the resonant frequency first and try to operate below it if pos­
sible. Operating above the resonant frequency is possible for low amplitudes (I would 
recommend <1% of the total motion), but of course the primary resonance will be excited 
in this case.
Since piezoelectric stacks are rather stiff and brittle it is important to take care when 
applying heavy loads or generating shock forces. The main concern here is to be sure that 
any load or force is applied directly on the same axis as the center of the stack. Off axis, 
shear loads or shock forces will typically crack the stack. A common strategy to minimize 
off-axis loading is to utilize a ball tip on the end of the stack or integrate the stack into a 
preloaded flexure which directs any outside force axially (Figures 13.4 and 13.5).

13.3  TEMPERATURE EFFECTS
Temperature variations play an extremely important role in micrometer scale positioning 
systems. Often a neophyte piezosystem user will complain that his system is “drifting all 
over the place” when, in fact, he is trying to measure on a scale where material expansions, 
invisible to the naked eye, are causing relatively huge shifts in position and he is simply 
witnessing his thermostat kicking the heat or air conditioning on and off.
Consider: The thermal coefficient of expansion for steel from 20°C–100°C is about 
16 µm/m °C. A simple piezo flexure stage may incorporate up to 50 mm of steel in its 
design with specified resolutions for closed loop systems of 10 nm or less. A variation of 
just half a degree will result in an expansion of the steel of 400 nm—or more than 400× the 
resolution of the stage!
To demonstrate this effect I measured the position of a parallelogram flexure design 
with an integrated PZT stack under static voltage conditions over an extended period of 
time with a michaelson-type interferometer. Temperature measurements of the air were 
taken simultaneously and the results are shown in Figure 13.6.
An interesting feature of PZT is that it has a negative coefficient of expansion at room 
temperature of −6 µm/m °C. The total displacement caused by thermal effects can be 
expressed by the following formula:
	
dltherm/dT = Lpiezo * αpiezo + Lmetal * αmetal
To see the effect of this on a stack type actuator we can use the example of a 50-µm stack 
which uses a combination of three 16-mm stacks in series (Table 13.1).
It is also possible to construct a simple temperature compensated block by selecting the 
proportionally correct amount of steel block and PZT and arranging them in series. So a 
stack that has a motion of 16 µm (16 mm in length) would require a steel block of 6 mm to 
make a temperature compensated simple actuator. Materials with a higher temperature 
extension coefficient will decrease the additional length, for example, brass.

Modern flexure designs utilize a variety of materials and methods for temperature com­
pensation. But not all systems take temperature into consideration.
For most applications (−10°C to 90°C) the piezoeffect is relatively constant. However, 
outside this temperature range the effect begins to decrease and at extremely low tempera­
tures (i.e., 4 K) the motion generated by an electric field on a stack can be as little as 6% of 
the motion generated at room temperature. The hysteresis curve of a stack which makes 
32 µm of motion is shown in Figure 13.7 for both room temperature and liquid helium 
operation.
Of course even this reduced motion can be very useful for many cryogenic studies and 
as you can see, the problem of hysteresis is reduced to the point where a closed loop system 
is often unnecessary.
13.4  PROPERTIES OF MOTION
Due to the discrete structure of a piezoelectric stack, its expansion is often a bit unpre­
dictable. Stacks have a tendency to exhibit all kinds of bad behavior such as twisting and 
tilting. Additionally, the expansion is nonlinear and exhibits a great deal of hysteresis.

Taken as a percentage of the full motion of the stack, this hysteresis can be as much as 
12%. To further complicate matters, this hysteresis is temperature and load dependent. At 
higher temperatures and under higher loads, this hysteresis will be even greater. Figure 
13.8 shows the typical response of a piezoelectric to a triangle wave function.
Piezoelectric stacks also exhibit some drifting in position or “creep.” This is an asymp­
totic decay toward a final position when given a step function which is a result of some 
crystal domains within the layers coming into alignment with the electric field more 
slowly. This creep is dependent on the expansion of the PZT, the external load, and time. It 
can be calculated as a logarithmic function with the following formula:
	
dL/dt = dL0.1 [L + γ lg (t/0.1s)]
L = length
t  = time
dL0.1 = change in length after 0.1 s after the step function
γ	
= drift constant (varies depending on loading, but typically 0.015)
A typical graph of creep over a period of 10 min is shown in Figure 13.9.

Creep exhibited by a PZT stack structure after given an electrical step function.

A simple strategy often used for minimizing this creep is to overshoot the desired posi­
tion by 5% or so and come back to it. This strategy brings the dipoles within the crystal 
structure more rapidly to their final rest state.
As you can see, the creep effect in piezosystems is long term and often negligible for 
dynamic operation. In fact, for high speed periodic signals piezosystems are highly repeat­
able. Although the function will still be subject to hysteresis, motion will follow the same 
track down to the noise of the system—often sub—nm. To provide an example, I drove a 
flexure stage capable of 240 µm at a frequency of approximately 1 kHz over a distance of 
1 µm with a sine wave function provided by a Tektronix function generator and amplified 
with a Piezosystem Jena power supply. Results were measured and graphed with a SIOS 
interferometric vibrometer system (Figure 13.10).
13.5  PROPERTIES OF STACK-FLEXURE STRUCTURES
The integration of piezoelectric stacks into solid state flexures has two major benefits when 
predicting behavior:
	
1.	The structure can be easily described with spring formulae of classical dynamics.
	
2.	Finite Element Analysis computer modeling can predict behavior under a variety 
of loading conditions.
For instance, we can estimate a change in natural resonant frequency when a stack-flexure 
structure is affected by an external load. Let’s take the example of a stack-flexure stage 
from Piezosystem Jena shown in Figure 13.11.
FIGURE 13.10

Handbook of Optical and Laser Scanning
The following specifications for this stage are given as:
	
Unloaded resonant frequency: 700 Hz
	
Stiffness: 1.1 N/µm
We can use the following formula to calculate the distributed mass moved or “effective 
mass” of the unloaded structure:
	
meff = cT/(2πfo
res)2
meff = effective mass
   cT = stiffness
fo
res = unloaded resonant frequency
So for this case we calculate an effective mass of 57 g.
Now we need to move a mirror with a mass of 200 g and determine the resonant fre­
quency of the system. We can use the following formula:
	
f

res

 = 
 
 + M
So for this case the resonant frequency has dropped from 700 Hz to 330 Hz.
Although a good order-of-magnitude estimate, things are actually not quite so sim­
ple since the stiffness cT is a variable dependent on the amount of expansion of the stack 
and the load. Also, off-axis loading may cross couple out-of-plane resonances. When very 
accurate determinations of resonant frequency are necessary, the best method for deter­
mining this is by applying load to the stage under the conditions of use and measuring 
the response of the structure to a mechanical spike impulse and allowing the structure to 
“ring” at its resonant frequency.
A simple way to generate a spike mechanical impulse to a stack-flexure structure is by 
giving the piezo an electrical step function. I loaded this stage with 200 g and measured 
the response of the stage with an interferometer (Figure 13.12). A bandpass filter has been 
applied to the frequency domain graph (Figure 13.13) to isolate the region of interest.
From this you can see the primary resonance is about 300 Hz. Rise times for these types 
of systems are dependent on the resonant frequency and can be estimated to be about

or in this case about 1 ms for the loaded stage.

13.6  ELECTRICAL DRIVES
13.6.1  Noise
The positional noise inherent to a piezoelectrical system is only limited by the voltage 
noise of the power supply that is used to drive it. Commercially available amplifiers built 
for piezoelectric stages today typically have voltage noise of <300 µV rms over a large 
bandwidth. Since piezoelectric stacks typically operate over a voltage range of 150 V this 
voltage noise can be expressed as a relative noise of 2E−6. So for a piezo stage capable of a 
total motion of 240 µm as in the previous example, we can calculate the rms noise contribu­
tion from the electronics as 0.5 nm. It’s pretty close to the resolution of the interferometer 
(0.3 nm in this case).
13.6.2  Current
The main consideration for current requirements of piezo stages is their large capacitance. 
Formulae for calculating bandwidth and rise times based on available current are simply 
those used for charging and discharging a capacitor with a very large resistance. So, you 
can imagine that if you charge a piezo stage to a potential of 70 V and leave it there it will 
draw almost no current from the amplifier. In fact, for many static applications a few mA 
will be sufficient. Let’s consider the case of a single axis tilting stage PSH 4/1 as shown in 
Figure 13.14.
This stage has a capacitance of 200 nF. Let’s say we have an amplifier capable of a max­
imum average output current of 50 mA and a peak current of 300 mA and we need to 
make small adjustments to the position to within 10 µrad to steer a laser beam. Based on 
the current we have, how fast can we do this? We can use the following formula for the 
time needed to charge or discharge a large capacitor:
	
dt = CdV/imax
dt	 =	change in time
C	
=	capacitance
dV	 =	voltage change
imax	= 	peak current available from the amplifier

FIGURE 13.14

Piezo Scanning 
649
For this case we estimate the voltage change as 10 µrad/4 mrad × 150 V = 375 mV and 
solving for dt:
	
dt = (200E−9F) (375E−3V)/300E−3A
	
dt = 0.25 µs
The limiting factor when considering whether or not to increase the current available to 
the stage in this type of application should be the mechanical rise time based on the reso­
nant frequency of the system. For this stage the resonant frequency is 6.5 kHz. Using the 
rise time estimation of dt = 1/3f we can calculate the maximum rise time limited by the 
mechanics to 50 µs. Therefore, increasing our current will not increase the speed of the 
stage for this application.
Now let’s consider the case with a large dynamical requirement. Let’s say we would like 
to scan the same laser beam by tilting the mirror over +/− 1.6 mrad at 4 kHz. How much 
current will we need from our amplifier? For a sinusoidal function we can use the follow­
ing formula for oscillating a large capacitor:
	
imax = πfCVpp  peak current required	
	
iaverage = fCVpp    average current required	
For this case we calculate the Vpp to be 3.2 mrad/4 mrad × 150 V = 120 V and the limiting 
factor here will be average current available
	
iaverage = (4000/s) (200E−9F) (120V) = 96mA
So we need a bigger amplifier.
These calculations are complicated by the fact that the capacitance of the stacks may 
increase by up to 200% due to changes in amplitude, strain, and temperature. So, for this 
case an amplifier with 200 mA should be sufficient under a variety of environmental 
conditions.
Some mention should be made here that driving piezo stacks with very large currents 
(>1 A) may result in heating of the stack due to the electrical power requirements. When 
the stack reaches its Curie temperature (around 170 C) it will depolarize and stop work­
ing. Once it cools, you can usually repolarize the crystal by cycling it a few times from 0 to 
150 V. Generally speaking I wouldn’t recommend this type of high-temperature operation 
for extended periods of time since it affects the lifetime of the PZT stack.
13.7  RELIABILITY
Stack-flexure piezo stages have no parts that move against each other. As friction-free sys­
tems, the mechanics exhibit no wear or fatigue as long as the deformation of the metal 
is kept below its elastic limit. Commercial stages have been operational for more than 
15 years of continuous use. The main mechanism of failure for a piezo stage is ion migra­
tion of the electrodes into the PZT which eventually causes a short circuit of the stack. This 

650

effect is accelerated by three conditions which should be avoided if possible:
	
1.	Constantly applied high voltage
	
2.	High-humidity conditions
	
3.	High-temperature conditions
I could put a graph in here showing MTBF for these conditions, but in my experience han­
dling and sealing play a big role in the environmental factors and cycling away from 150 
V a few times a day will do wonders for piezo health and well-being.
So be forewarned if you want to park your stack with greasy fingers at 150 V for weeks 
on end in the jungle!
13.8  TILTING STAGE DESIGN
There are a few varieties of tilt and tip-tilt stages commercially available. Usually they are 
temperature compensated for tilt, but not z. Since these are mainly used for laser scanning 
applications and are usually in direct competition with galvo type scanners, the design 
emphasis here is on high resonant frequency and stiffness. Often flexure hinges are dis­
pensed with in the interest of speed. Three or four piezos are directly preloaded against a 
top plate and either act independently or in a push–pull configuration. For the three piezo-
stack version, two tilting axes are arranged orthogonally to each other, while an optional 
third axis is oriented at 45°. A diagram of such a stage is shown in Figure 13.15.
X, Y, and Z shown as dashed lines above represent the tilting axes when the individual 
PZT stacks are actuated in the housing. When all three are given an equal applied voltage, 
the top plate will move in the z direction. Temperature changes will move the stage in z, 
but not affect the tilting angle. This particular stage design may offer tilting of 1 to 4 mrad 
with resonant frequencies in the kHz range. Disadvantages of this design are the location 
of the pivot point and the fact that it does not offer plus–minus tilting—each axis will tilt 
in only one direction.

When a tip-tilt stage with a central pivot point with plus–minus tilting is desired, a four 
stack push–pull approach is necessary. Once again, the stacks act directly against the top 
plate in order to maintain a high stiffness and high resonant frequency for the design. 
A diagram of such a stage is shown in Figure 13.16.
A larger tilting angle is possible with this push–pull approach and these stages are cap­
able of up to 10 mrad (+/−5 mrad) of tilt angle with resonant frequencies in the kHz range.
13.9  LINEAR STAGE DESIGN
Today there is a demand for nanopositioners capable of a variety of specialized tasks. This 
wide variety of applications has resulted in a number of innovative new designs based 
on flexure techniques. Powerful computer algorithms utilizing FEA optimization have 
resulted in systems specialized for high resonant frequency under load, and minimized 
tilting and cross-talk errors over relatively large motions (large for a piezo stage is a mm).
13.9.1  Cross talk
Single dimension flexure-stack translation stages use a parallel guidance design. They use 
flexing monolithic solid metal hinges to guide and amplify the motion of the stack they 
contain. Usually the metal structure is designed so that they must be flexed slightly prior 
to mounting the piezo into them to provide an integrated preload and an epoxy is used to 
permanently bond the stack inside. A diagram and picture showing the design of such a 
structure and its associated motion are shown in Figures 13.17 and 13.18.
The motion in the diagram on the left has been exaggerated so that we can clearly see the 
problem here; in addition to the motion in the desired direction, we also have two other 
types of cross talk. There is a lateral component and a rotational component. A typical 
asymmetrical piezo flexure design such as this may have lateral cross talk on the order of 
200 nm for a 100-µm stage. All four flexure hinges in the parallelogram design show this

phenomenon. This is caused by a parallel deviation which is exerted around a rotational 
center. Also, as mentioned previously, the stacks themselves exhibit motion vectors in all 
six degrees of freedom. Although the flexure hinges direct these force vectors through very 
small areas, thus minimizing the impact of the unwanted motion, some forces from the 
stack operate outside these stress areas and contribute to additional cross talk not inherent 
in the design. Also a residual mechanical asymmetry caused by asymmetrical stack point 
of contact contributes and so the total rotational cross talk component is typically 15 µrad 
for 100 µm of motion. The major advantage of such a simple four hinge parallelogram 
guidance design is the low inertia in combination with a suitable guidance behavior; it is 
well suited for fast nanoscanning applications.
13.9.2  Minimizing Cross talk
It is possible to minimize this stack-induced cross talk by carefully selecting well-behaved 
stacks and actively aligning them with an interferometer prior to permanent epoxy bond­
ing. This might reduce this type of cross talk by one-third, but cannot eliminate it alto­
gether and as you might imagine, is time consuming and expensive.
FIGURE 13.17
Guidance diagram for parallelogram stage.
FIGURE 13.18
Picture of a parallelogram stage F.

Piezo Scanning 
653
By applying meander ordered hinges we obtain an elegant solution to the problem of 
cross talk by allowing the hinges to compensate each other. Such a system is shown in 
Figure 13.19.
Of course there are tradeoffs here for improved performance. In this case, the number 
of flexure hinges has been increased from 4 to 16. This significantly weakens the mechani­
cal structure of the stage. Stiffness has now dropped dramatically and therefore results in 
significant reductions in resonant frequency for any laterally applied load to the system. 
Reduced resonant frequency means higher noise characteristics since a lower resonant 
frequency is more easily excited by ambient noise. However, for applications requiring 
highly accurate nanopositioning with light loads this solution works well and is free of 
parasitic cross talk.
13.9.3  Increasing stiffness
So how can we obtain the benefits of a symmetrical dual flexure structure and maintain 
our excellent noise properties?
One weakness of parallelogram flexure structure is that piezo stack provides a strong 
compressive force and stiffness, but we rely on the weak spring memory forces of the 
metal for our reset forces. One way to increase the reset forces of the flexure structure 
would be to increase the thickness, for example, reset force of the flexure hinge. This has 
the effect of making the entire structure more stiff and, unfortunately, since the desired 
DOF is blocked this increases parasitic rotational errors. Another way to increase the stiff­
ness of the stage is to apply a push–pull concept to the design. We integrate two stack 
actuators into a flexure structure in such a way that they act in concert with each other and 
provide both compressive and reset forces to the structure for the motion of the stage. For 
this design concept we can increase stiffness by up to ten times in the intended direction of 
motion and by up to two times for the whole system. Additionally the overdetermination 
of this design results in a high degree of inner preload that makes the stage much more 
robust against mishandling, off-center loads and high loads. All featured without increas­
ing rotational error as per Figure 13.20.
A main advantage of such a push–pull concept is the separation of guidance and gear­
ing. As opposed to traditional designs, the flexure hinges are exclusively responsible for 
trajectory tasks; they are not responsible for exerting reset forces. Also, the stacks, when 
FIGURE 13.19

654

arranged in alternating order, are able to accelerate and stop actively taking advantage of 
their huge pressure force potential. So this design offers a maximum of dynamical and 
guidance behavior. It is inherently temperature compensated and well suited for nanopo­
sitioning tasks as well as nanoscanning applications.
13.10  DAMPING
You can abstract a piezoactuator as a linear oscillating system consisting of spring, damper, 
and inertial mass, following the normalized mathematical description (force equilibration)

you obtain the response of the oscillating system to the external disturbing force (Figures 
13.23 and 13.24). Depending on the damping ratio the behavior is described as:

An increasing damping ratio decreases the resonance magnification and sharpness. That 
means the resonance appears at a lower frequency but its suppression is much higher.1–3
Because of the marginal electrical losses of the piezoceramic that could reduce kinetic 
energy from the system by transforming into heat, in practice the underdamped piezoac­
tuator is the usual one (Figure 13.25). The transient oscillation is described as

As said the damping behavior of a piezoactuator is marginal, well suited for ultrafast 
scanning applications and small loads. However, fast high load applications using the pro­
prietary outstanding stiffness of the piezoceramic can be optimized by implementation of 
fitted passive viscoelastic damping parts.

The critical damping (aperiodic case) shows the shortest settling time and no overshoot­
ing, but the damping ratio depends on the inertial mass. Therefore you are able to optimize 
for one load configuration only. Higher loads will settle much faster than in the undamped 
case otherwise small load scenarios will behave unnecessarily slow. So it’s recommended 
for versatile and robust use that the stage works in the underdamped range, close to the 
critically damped case.
But, how do you determine a well damped setup? For our assessment we use the damp­
ing ratio, that you can determine in such a way:
	
1.	First, you generate a rectangular wave. Due to the fact that such a waveform con­
sists of odd-numbered multiples of the fundamental frequency, the piezoactua­
tor’s resonances will be excited according to the following formula

2.	Next, you modulate the amplifier output signal and the piezoactuator oscillates in 
its resonances.
	
3.	Transforming the oscillation into a frequency spectrum via, for example, fast 
Fourier transformation (FFT) allows you to determine the damping ratio per for 
example bandwidth method (Figure 13.26).
As mentioned before damping ratio and resonance sharpness correlate to each other. So 
you can calculate the damping ratio using the equation

f1 = lower frequency @ mmax/ 2
f1 = upper frequency @ mmax/ 2
fr = resonant frequency
mmax = resonant magnitude
The longer the measured time (real or zero padded), the higher the frequency resolution 
and more accurate the resulting damping ratio calculation (Figures 13.27 through 13.30). 
Following the sample theorem (SHANNON/NYQUIST), the sample frequency has to be at 
least two times of the frequency that is to be measured.4
Using viscoelastic damping in open loop order offers a lot of advantages. Firstly, the 
settling time decreases significantly. The piezoactuator reacts much more robustly against 
high loads and dynamic forces, as well as mishandling and environmental oscillations. 
Also, the positioning noise caused by the noise of the amplifier is deeply suppressed. So 
you can perform subnanometer step scans in much smaller stepwidth, even at higher 
loads. However, the viscoelastic and piezoelectric intrinsic drift accumulates. Using visco­
elastic damping in closed loop, the drift doesn’t exist.5,6
13.11  CLOSED LOOP SYSTEMS
We’ve discussed a number of problems inherent to piezo technology for motion control. 
These include drift or creep, hysteresis, temperature dependence, nonlinear expansion, 
variance among individual stacks, cross talk, and rotational error. The simplest way to 
address many of these simultaneously is to characterize the piezosystem with an inte­
grated measurement device and integrate a closed loop feedback mechanism to control 
the position. In order to take advantage of the piezosystem’s capability for high resolution 
in the nm range and high dynamic capabilities it is important to select a type of sensor 
which is fast with nanometer accuracy. Clear choices that satisfy these requirements are 
capacitive sensors, strain gage sensors, inductive (LVDT) sensors, optical scales, and inter­
ferometric measurements. In order to somewhat limit the scope of the chapter we will con­
centrate on the use of capacitive sensors and strain gages in PID closed loop systems since 
these will be useful for a majority of applications which use piezos.
13.12  STRAIN GAGES
Strain gages can be applied directly onto a stack of PZT to measure strain that has been 
produced by the expansion of the PZT or onto the flexing hinges of the flexure structure.

Since the expansion and therefore strain of a PZT stack are inhomogeneous and the strain 
gage is applied to just a small part of a stack, it is much more accurate (usually at least 2×) to 
apply the strain gage to the flexure hinges—usually more than one. This effectively makes 
a measurement summation of all motion “prior” to the flex hinge, while ignoring any 
motion which occurs “after” the hinge. Therefore all PZT motions including temperature-
dependent ones are measured, but the strain gage system will not compensate for expan­
sion of the top plate of a stage. Special care must be taken for a proper bond to the PZT or 
metal so that adequate heat transfer occurs to minimize Johnson–Nyquist noise since strain 
gages are resistive devices. A variety of strain gages are commercially available which are 
specifically tailored to various material expansion coefficients and the proper gage must be 
selected for the stage material (i.e., steel, aluminum, INVAR). A typical strain gage is either 
a full or half wheatstone bridge with 5 KOhm resistors arranged as in Figure 13.31.

With a full wheatstone bridge expansion or contraction due to temperature variations 
do not affect the output signal of the sensor since all resistors will be affected equally. 
With a half-wheatstone bridge, expansion or contraction due to temperature variations 
will be measurable. I’ve run into very few situations where a half bridge is desirable. It’s 
important to make this distinction since both designs are used for closed loop feedback 
in commercially available piezosystems and you should be aware of the type of system 
you’re using. The typical safe bending radius for such a gage is about 1.5 mm which is far 
above the elastic limit of steel. Often a flexure can be damaged by applying excessive force 
and, as a result, it is bent beyond the elastic limit of the metal such that the strain gage still 
functions, but is permanently deformed so that the strain gage shows some permanent DC 
offset. In some cases it is possible to repair the stage by measuring the output of the strain 
gage while bending the flexure back until the DC offset is minimized and then performing 
a recalibration of the closed loop system. The response of a strain gage to motion is fairly 
linear. Figure 13.32 shows the voltage response of a strain gage when a flexure is actuated 
over a distance of 80 µm. The distance traveled was measured with an interferometer.
Often, nonlinearity curves follow parabolic functions and it is a fairly common practice 
to correct for these errors using polynomial fit algorithms or simple look-up tables.
13.13  CAPACITIVE SENSORS
Capacitive sensors use a charged flat metal plate of precisely determined area to make 
a noncontact measurement of distance based on formula for parallel plate capacitors. 
Although it sounds simple in theory, in practice this type of measurement can be quite 
complex due to the very small changes in capacitance that must be measured in order to 
achieve nm resolutions. Complex electronics must be modulated at specific frequencies

for various bandwidths and resolutions that are desired. Since changes in capacitances 
being measured are nearly on the same order of magnitude as cable capacitances, spe­
cially calibrated cables and connectors must be used. It is important to keep this in mind 
when selecting a capacitive measurement system for closed loop. Often it is not possible 
to change cable lengths or connectors for your system if the capacitive sensor electronics 
are built directly into the closed loop amplifier system. On the plus side, capacitive sensors 
offer the following advantages over strain gage systems: lower noise, higher bandwidth 
capability, and better linearity. Also, it is possible to arrange capacitive sensors such that 
they measure directly on the point of interest for the stage—or at least closer to it. Cross 
talk and temperature-dependent motion not measured by a strain gage are now measur­
able and correctable by a capacitive measurement system.
13.14  ELECTRONIC CONTROL ARCHITECTURE 
FOR CLOSED LOOP SYSTEMS
A simple diagram of a typical closed loop system is as shown in Figure 13.33.
Closed loop systems can be made completely analog, digital, or as a hybrid analog–
digital system (for instance an analog PID control system with digital potentiometers for 
programmability).
Variables which must be calibrated based on the individual system are as follows:
	
1.	Gain of the sensor
	
2.	Offset of the sensor
	
3.	Gain of the measurement interfaces (e.g., 0–10 V analog output, digital display, 
A/D interface for serial port)
	
4.	Total travel of the system over the full voltage range (gain of the positioning system)
	
5.	Gain parameters of the P, I, and D components of the system

Let’s take the example of a stage that specifies its total open loop travel as 100 µm under 
light load conditions. Since, as mentioned previously, PZT stacks can vary quite a bit 
the actual motion from such a stage could vary as much as 20 µm. For this example let’s 
assume the stage is capable of 110 µm for a voltage range of −10 V to 150 V. This intrinsic 
gain of the system will determine a number of factors in the final closed loop system since 
linearity, resolution, and repeatability are some function of the total motion amplification. 
Often, manufacturers will guarantee and characterize their system specifications as some 
percentage of total measured motion of the system in closed loop (i.e., a resolution of 0.05% 
for this system in closed loop would be 4 nm) even though it may actually be determined 
by the total motion the system is capable of making in open loop. In other words, taking a 
400 µm stage and calibrating it for 80 µm of motion in closed loop instead of 360 µm will 
not increase the resolution of your system.
As we saw before, a piezosystem will overshoot and oscillate at some resonant fre­
quency. Closed loop systems have the job of damping and controlling this behavior, but 
some overshoot and settling time, especially for step functions, is unavoidable. In order 
to allow for this behavior, closed loop systems are calibrated within a range of 80% of 
the full motion allowing 10% at the extremes of the travel range for overshooting (Figure 
13.34). Since piezos vary from system to system this range is often further reduced to 
allow for PZT stacks that may have less travel than others. For this particular case a travel 
of 80 µm would be calibrated into the system since the minimum specified travel range 
is 100 µm.
The speed of a closed loop system is determined by the loading and resonant frequency 
of the system. Introducing a high load to a system calibrated for light loads may cause it to 
become underdamped and it may begin to oscillate. The PID can be adjusted in such cases 
to damp out the oscillation, but the rise time will suffer as a result. In some cases noise 
due to oscillation of an underdamped system is tolerated in the interest of speed. As an 
example, a stage which moves 100 µm in open loop calibrated for 80 µm in closed loop is 
loaded with a microscope objective which weighs 300 g. At rest the PID closed loop begins 
to oscillate at a frequency of about 130 Hz as shown in Figure 13.35.
Rise time for the system is about 11 ms for a step of 0.6 µm and P_P noise is about 6 nm. 
We can eliminate the oscillation by overdamping the system with the PID closed loop with 
results as in Figure 13.36.
As you can see the problem with oscillation has been reduced by a factor of 3, but the 
settling time to a final position has been extended from 11 ms up to about 25–30 ms.
Final tuning of a closed loop system is specific to the particular application. In this case, 
which is optical microscopy, the depth of field of this particular microscope objective 
was well in excess of the 6 nm and settling time was of primary importance. Another

application (i.e., fine tuning the grating position for structured illumination) might require 
the lowest possible noise with no speed requirement. In most cases manufacturers can 
tune the system for a particular loading configuration, motion waveform, and desired 
resolution or speed.
Both types of sensors—strain gage and capacitive—have properties which will be 
unique to the stage system for which they are being used. Every strain gage and capaci­
tive sensor system will have different gain and offset parameters even for identical stage 
systems. For strain gages these parameters are determined by resistance tolerances and 
prestressing of the metal flexure. Capacitive sensors are affected by offset distance and 
angular alignment.
For OEM systems this is often problematic since parts of a system (i.e., stage, cables, elec­
tronics) cannot be interchanged and any failure in one part of the system would necessitate 
complete replacement of all parts or at the very least, a recalibration for gain and offset 
parameters by an interferometer. Therefore modern piezoelectric closed loop systems offer 
integrated precalibrated stage systems with some calibration data stored in the stage or 
stage-cable assembly. This may be as simple as using potentiometers to regulate the volt­
age outputs to more complete data-chip storage systems which include PID parameters for 
the closed loop system. The two architectures discussed are more easily understood with 
the following diagrams:

13.15  CONCLUSION
Piezoelectric flexure systems have unique properties that require special consideration 
when implementing them into a design. Specifically special attention should be given to 
hysteresis, drift, temperature influences, damping, and electrical drive considerations. 
They also offer numerous advantages over traditional motorized linear drives. These 
include:
	
High stiffness
	
High structural resonant frequencies
	
Sub-nm resolution
	
High speed
	
High load capacities
	
Large force generation
These advantages have made them indispensible in applications that require ultrapre­
cise positioning accuracies. Some examples follow:

14.1  INTRODUCTION
The aim of this chapter is to describe important aspects of optical disk recording and 
readout technologies, with a brief historical introduction and references for further study. 
The selected topics are based on the contemporary analysis and experimental results of 
general interest.
14.1.1  Progress in Optical Disk Technology
The fundamental concept of an optical disk dates back to 1961 when Stanford Research 
Laboratories developed a video disk using photographic technology. However, the low 
luminance of available light sources yielded reproduced images of low quality. Columbia 
Broadcasting System (CBS) announced the EVR (Electronic Video Recorder) system in 1967, 
but enormous costs ultimately forced them to discontinue development. The invention of 
the laser by T. H. Maiman et al. in 1960 provided the light source considered the most suit­
able for optical disks.
Lasers have good temporal and spatial coherence, which enables one to obtain the small, 
diffraction-limited beam spot necessary for high-quality information retrieval from opti­
cal disks. After many approaches were considered, the basic design of optical disks, the 
“bit-by-bit” recording method, was developed in the 1970s. The first optical video disk 
system for commercial use, the VLP (video long play), was released in 1973 by Philips of 
Holland and MCA (Music Corporation of America) of the United States. In early systems, 
the He–Ne laser was the preferred light source. The introduction of many new optical 
disk systems soon followed. The 12-cm diameter digital audio disk (DAD), later called 
the CD (compact disk), was announced in 1978. Standardized CD products from several

manufacturers became available in December 1982. CD players use semiconductor lasers to 
allow the design of small and lightweight players. In 1996, the digital versatile disk (DVD) 
for players was released. These playback-only systems marked the inception of optical 
disk products. Write-once optical disk systems were first introduced by Philips in 1978.
Development of rewritable optical disk systems accelerated in the 1980s as the perfor­
mance of reversible media progressed. Magneto-optical (MO) disks that utilize a magnetic 
field reversal for recording and the Kerr effect for playback were commercialized in 1988 
by Sony. In 1989, the first phase-change rewritable (PCR) disk, containing 470 megabytes 
user capacity and utilizing an amorphous-to-crystalline phase change1 for recording and 
playback was commercialized by Matsushita. In 2000, rewritable DVDs (DVD-RAM, -RW) 
were released and the development for higher density DVD media started.
14.1.2  Characteristics of Optical Disks
Optical disks are now used in various applications, including audio, computer memory 
devices, picture files, document files, and video files. The advantages of optical disks over 
other known memory devices are:
	
1.	Large capacity/high information density. The information capacity of a 120-mm 
diameter DVD disk is 4.7 Gbytes for single-layer ROM and RAM, and 8.5 Gbytes 
for double-layer ROM. The recording density of commercial products is about 
3.3 Gbits/in2 for DVD-ROM and 4 Gbits/in2 for DVD-RAM. Recent developments 
for next generation products show that an information density of more than 16 
Gbits/in2 can be achieved by using a blue laser and an objective lens (OB) of high 
numerical aperture (NA).
	
2.	Fast random-access library systems allow access to large mass memories. Changing 
mechanisms provide access within seconds to several petabytes of information.
	
3.	Reliability. The information surface of an optical disk is covered with a protective 
layer, which ensures a long archival life. Information retrieval is achieved without 
physical contact between the optical pick-up and disk, which increases the reli­
ability of stored information.
	
4.	Replication. Mass production using injection molding or other high-volume tech­
niques is possible. Replicated optical disks benefit from lower cost per bit than the 
rigid magnetic disk or tapes.
	
5.	Removability/ROM-RAM compatibility. A large quantity of data can be handled 
easily by exchanging disks. Compatibility between replicated and recordable 
disks and interchangeability between standardized drives provide this capability. 
These advantages lead to the ubiquitous uses of optical disk products in consumer 
and computer applications.
14.1.3  Principles of Optical Read/Write2–6
In many optical disks, as in the normal audio disk, information is recorded in a spiral 
groove referred to as the “track.” The information cells shown in Figure 14.1 are called 
“pits,” or “marks.” They are discontinuous small depressions, differential reflectivity pat­
terns or phase-shifting patterns, all showing differential reflectivity. Information signals 
(SGs)are derived from changes in luminance caused by diffraction of the laser beam by the 
pits or marks (which are about 0.3-μm2 diffraction cells). The laser beam emerging from 

672 
Handbook of Optical and Laser Scanning
the OB is focused to a spot on the disk. The spot size is proportional to the wavelength λ of 
the laser beam and inversely proportional to the NA of the OB.
The NA is given by the sine of the angle θ between the optical axis and the marginal 
rays:
	
NA
n
=
sinq	
(14.1)
where n represents the refractive index of the medium in object space. The full-
width-at-half-maximum (FWHM) intensity diameter of the beam spot (Ds) on the disk is 
expressed as
	
D
k Na
s =
l
	
(14.2)
where k represents a constant dependent upon the light amplitude distribution at the OB 
pupil. If the incident beam to the OB is plane wave, the value of k is 0.53. When the incident 
beam is Gaussian or contains some aberrations, k becomes larger. Since the information 
density of the disk is inversely proportional to the square of Ds, smaller k is more desir­
able. Supposing k = 0.53, λ = 0.405 μm (15.9 μin), and NA = 0.85, we obtain the beam spot 
diameter Ds = 0.25 μm (9.9 μin). More than 1.4 × 1011 information bits can be stored on one 
side of a 5.25 in optical disk using a beam of this size.
Figure 14.2 shows the playback optics for a reflective optical disk. The laser emission 
from the semiconductor laser (L) is reflected by a beam splitter (BS) and is incident on the

OB through a collimating lens (CL). The wavelength λ generally used for CD is in the range 
780–800 nm and for DVD, 635–660 nm. The NA of the OB is generally 0.45 when used for 
CD and 0.6 for DVD. Next generation optical disks will have a wavelength of 405 nm and a 
NA of 0.85. The OB aperture limits the spatial frequency response of the optical system.
The laser beam reflected from the disk is intensity modulated by the pits prior to a sec­
ond pass through the OB. Part of the return beam is transmitted through the BS and is 
incident on the photodetector (PD). The SG, focus error signal (FE), and tracking error sig­
nal (TE) are generated from the PDs.
Reflective or transmissive mode systems can be constructed, but the reflective mode 
is used in most optical disk systems. In the transmissive mode, a second optical pick-up 
with the PDs must be positioned on the other side of the disk, complicating the design of 
the drive. Another problem is that the pits must be very deep and replication becomes 
more difficult, which leads to degradation of signals during read. A third problem with 
the transmission mode is difficulty in obtaining a good FE with a satisfactory S/N ratio. 
Simple FE detection methods are easily achieved in reflective mode.
14.2  APPLICATIONS OF OPTICAL DISK SYSTEMS
14.2.1  Read-Only Optical Disk Systems
Four types of standardized players are available for read-only optical disks: video disk, 
audio disk (CD), data file disk (CD-ROM), and DVD. Among the advantages of read-only 
optical disks are: (1) mass replication; (2) a relatively simple optical layout as compared 
to write-once or rewritable system; and (3) ease of commercialization due to its use as a

stand-alone unit. Signals in read-only optical disk systems are generally encoded with 
pulse width modulation (PWM), resulting in high recording density.
14.2.1.1  Video Disk
Optical video disk systems have been commercially available for many years. They have 
the international standard name of LV (laser vision), and use analog signal recording. Two 
types of disks having diameters of 30 and 20 cm are utilized. Rotational speed is constant 
at 1800 rpm for the constant-angular-velocity (CAV) mode, and a variable rotational speed 
of 600–1800 rpm is used for the constant-linear-velocity (CLV) mode. LV has relatively low 
recording density and is now being replaced by DVD.
14.2.1.2  CD/CD-ROM
The DAD system has been standardized using the term compact disk. The diameter of the 
disk is 12 cm (4.7 in), and the thickness of the polycarbonate protective layer is 1.2 mm. 
The linear velocity can vary from 1.2 to 1.4 m/s (3.9–4.6 ft/s) in the CLV mode. The maxi­
mum playback time is about 75 min, long enough to accommodate a fairly long classical 
music selection on a single disk. Audio signals are quantitized using 16 bits, allowing a 
dynamic range of 96 dB in playback. CD is now dominant in package media and is widely 
used in the music market. Using the ordinary data signal coding of the CD system, com­
puter compatible data can be stored for use as a read-only memory of a personal computer 
(CD-ROM). More than 650 Mbytes of information can be stored on one side of a disk, 
enough to store the entire text of Encyclopedia Britannica on one side of a CD-ROM disk. 
Most personal computers are equipped with a CD-ROM, although DVD drives are rapidly 
replacing the CD drives in this application.
14.2.1.3  DVD
The successor to the CD is the integrated DVD optical disk system. The DVD specifica­
tions for Read-Only Disk were issued in 1996, followed by Rewritable (ver. 1.0) in 1997, 
Rewritable (ver. 2.0), and Re-recording (ver. 1.0) in 1999, and DVD-R for General (ver. 2.0) in 
2000. These DVD systems are all integrated into DVD for Multi. The DVD disk has a stor­
age capacity of 4.7 Gbytes, and more than 135 min of MPEG2 video signal can be stored on

and music videos.
14.2.2  Write-Once Disk Systems7–9
Write-once disks have been commercially implemented in applications such as archi­
val data memory devices for computers, document storage, and picture filing systems. 
Polycarbonate (PC) is being used to form injection molded disk substrates. The recording 
mechanism of the disk may be (1) phase-changing; (2) hole-burning; and (3) bubble-form­
ing. In Figure 14.3, the pits formed by these different recording methods are schematically 
shown.
Signal pits are recorded by irradiation with a semiconductor laser focused to a spot less 
than 0.3 up to 1 μm in diameter. This irradiation increases the temperature of the record­
ing medium to about 200–600 °C (392–1272 °F), and the recording takes place as the result 
of the consequent physical or chemical change of the medium.

14.2.2.1  CD-R
Write-once disk systems can be used for archival storage of large data files. The removabil­
ity of optical disks and the standardization of products provide a broad range of applica­
tion. CD-R is currently the most commonly used write-once disk. Typical specifications of 
CD-R disk systems are shown in Table 14.1.
14.2.3  Erasable Optical Disk Systems
Two major families of erasable media are available: PCR and MO. Data recording on PCR 
media is accomplished by inducing a transition from a crystalline phase to an amorphous 
phase. Differences in reflectivity of the two phases allow signal playback.
MO recording is accomplished by establishing the magnetization of a mark by heating it 
in the presence of a magnetic field. Read back utilizes the polarization change of the laser 
beam induced by magnetic modulation according to the Kerr effect. The principal charac­
teristics of erasable disks are shown in Table 14.2. The overwrite mechanism of a PCR disk 
is easy to design. However, reversibility is better in MO disks. The MO disk drive requires 
a complicated system for applying the write and erase magnetic fields, which have oppo­
site polarities.
14.2.3.1  PCR Disk7
Figure 14.4 shows PCR optical data file drives (DVD-RAM). Figure 14.5 shows the prin­
ciple of the direct overwriting mechanism for the PCR disk. The laser intensity at the disk 
is modulated, in correspondence with the pit pattern to be recorded, between the maxi­
mum level (A) and the intermediate level (B) as illustrated in Figure 14.5a. At exposure level 
(A), the material reaches a melting temperature of over 600 °C. Rapid quenching forces the 
material to remain in the amorphous phase, giving low surface reflectivity. Exposure level 
(B) heats the material to about 400 °C, allowing rapid crystallization to proceed, giving an 
increased reflectivity. Figure 14.5b is a schematic illustration of the overwriting operation.
14.2.3.2  MO Disk10,11
In MO disks, a light beam is directed at a magnetic material to record or erase information. 
The underlying principle is the utilization of a temperature-dependent change of magnetic 
properties. There are several methods, including Curie point recording and compensation 
point recording, which can be used for recording. Figure 14.6 is an elementary illustration 
showing the principle of Curie point recording. In this example the initial magnetization 
of the recording layer is uniformly oriented in a given direction, as shown in Figure 14.6a. 
When a limited area of the recording layer is irradiated with light sufficient in intensity 
to heat it to a temperature above the Curie point Tc, the magnetization of the local area

is lost, as shown in Figure 14.6b. When the exposure is discontinued, the temperature 
of the recording layer falls below Tc. The exposed area is remagnetized, but the direc­
tion of this magnetization coincides with the direction of the applied external magnetic 
field. Therefore, if the external magnetic field is applied in a direction opposite that of 
the original magnetization of the recording layer, as shown in Figure 14.6b, a magnetic 
domain different from the surrounding area remains, as shown in Figure 14.6c, enabling 
the recording of binary information. For reading the signal, the recording layer is irradi­
ated with a laser light of low power. The polarization rotations of the reflected beam from 
the signal surface and the land surface are in opposite directions, as shown in Figure 14.6c. 
These beams are detected with a polarization analyzer to obtain the read signal. To erase 
the information, a selected area is again heated to a temperature above the Curie point, as 
shown in Figure 14.6d. The direction of the external magnetic field is reversed from that 
for recording.
In signal readout, the linear polarization angle of the incident beam is set at θ. The Kerr 
rotation angle is given by ±Φk. Referring to Figure 14.7, the differential output  I of the 
analyzer between the x and y directions is given by

14.3  BASIC DESIGN OF OPTICAL DISK SYSTEMS
14.3.1  Pick-Up Optics
The many types of optical disks described in the preceding sections each have optimized 
optical pick-ups. The methods of design for the optics and mechanics of a writable optical 
pick-up will be described in this section.
The following factors determine the quality of read/write signals.
	
1.	Frequency characteristics of signals
	
2.	Cross talk from the adjacent tracks, which degrades read/write signals
	
3.	Carrier-to-noise ratio (CNR) of read/write signals
	
4.	Errors rate in read/write signals
Factors 1 and 2 are mainly dependent on the wave aberrations of the optics. Factor 3 is 
as much associated with the characteristics of elements such as the semiconductor laser, 
detector and electronics as with wave aberrations, and factor 4 is mainly dependent on 
defects in the disk.
14.3.1.1  Optical Layout
The schematic construction of the optics for a writable optical pick-up is shown in Figure 
14.8. In this example, the astigmatic method is used for detecting the focusing signal and

the push–pull (PP) method is used for detecting the tracking signal. The laser beam emit­
ted from the semiconductor laser (LR) has a near-field pattern elongated in the direction 
of the active layer of the laser and is polarized in the same direction. The beam waist in 
this direction lies within the laser, and the beam waist in a direction perpendicular to the 
above direction is situated at the end facet of the laser active layer. The beam emergent 
from the laser is therefore anamorphic, and its far-field distribution is elliptical in cross 
section with an ellipticity of 2 to 3. To correct this elliptical distribution, it is necessary to 
use a one-dimensional afocal system after the CL, consisting of two cylindrical lenses or 
a wedge prism. With a single wedge prism, the designed incident angle of the laser beam 
must be approximately 69–72°. Since the wedge prism has chromatic dispersion, a change 
of the wavelength of the laser results in an angular deviation of the beam. Taking this 
angular deviation as  q and the focal length of the OB as fo, the beam spot moves approxi­
mately by fo ⋅Δq on the disk (DC). Using a single BK7 wedge prism with the incident angle 
72°, an OB with focal length 4.5 mm and wavelength 0.78 μm, the beam spot displacement 
on the disk is approximately 0.073 μm for a change of 1 nm in wavelength. Therefore, the 
optics should be designed such that the direction of this movement will not cause a track 
offset. For this reason it is good practice to use two wedge prisms as illustrated in Figure 
14.8. In the case of the playback-only optical pick-up, the influence of the elliptical and 
astigmatic beam can be small at the cost of beam utilization efficiency.
In Figure 14.8, the laser beam transmitted through a polarizing beam splitter (PBS) as a 
p-polarized beam passes through the λ/4 plate (QP) to become a circularly polarized beam, 
which is incident on the OB. The beam emerging from the OB is incident on the disk (DC) 
to form a beam spot for recording and reproducing the signals. The beam reflected at the 
disk enters the OB and again passes through the λ/4 plate (QP) to become an s-polarized 
beam and is reflected to the detection lens (DL) by the PBS. The beam emergent from the 
DL is partially reflected by a half-mirror (HM) and incident on the detector (DT2) for PP 
tracking signal detection. Because the convergent beam passing the HM is astigmatic, it is 
received by a quadrant detector (DTI) to give a focusing signal. The data signal is retrieved 
by sum of the output from both detectors (DT1 and DT2). The astigmatic focusing and PP 
tracking methods will be described in detail later.
14.3.1.2  Influence of Intensity Distribution
The intensity distribution of the beam incident on the OB is dependent on the beam diver­
gence angle distribution of the semiconductor laser. With the OB aperture radius being 
standardized as unity and the intensity distribution of the incident beam assumed to be 
exp(

beam spot with various values of a . It is apparent from Figure 14.9 that when a = 1, the 
FWHM of the beam spot is increased by about 10% (relative to a = 0 ), and the peak of the 
side-lobe diffraction ring is made sufficiently small.
In order for the reproduced signal to have satisfactory frequency characteristics, the 
value of α in the signal direction must be in the range of a ≪1. On the other hand, in the 
direction perpendicular to the signal direction, the cross talk from the adjacent track must 
be minimized. This cross talk can be small by using α close to 1. Therefore, the spot on 
the disk need not be truly round, but an improved frequency characteristic is sometimes 
obtained when the beam spot is elliptical with an ellipticity of about 10%.

Figure 14.10 shows the relation between rms wave aberration and on-axis energy den­
sity. The on-axis energy density SD is a factor directly associated with reproduced signal 
SNR or record/reproduced signal SNR. The allowable rms wave aberration for the whole 
optical disk system is subject to Maréchal’s criterion that the rms wave aberration is 0.070λ 
when SD has decreased about 20% from the level at no aberration. The validity of the cri­
terion has been endorsed by read/write experiments. This allowable wave aberration for 
the whole system must be allocated to disk thickness error and tilt error, initial optical 
aberration, and defocus value.

14.3.2.1  Aberration Derived from Disk Substrate
The aberration originating from the disk substrate is composed of the aberration WST due 
to the error  t of substrate thickness t and the aberration WTL due to the inclination θ of the 
substrate. These aberrations, when small, are expressed by the following equations (also 
Equations 14.A11 and 14.A14):

where NA is the NA of the OB and n is the refractive index of the disk substrate. Figure 
14.11 shows the relation between disk thickness error  t and wave aberration WST with 
NA and wavelength λ as the parameters. Figure 14.12 shows the relation between disk tilt 
angle and wave aberration WTL with NA and wavelength λ as the parameter. In the usual 
recordable CD, the practical values are NA = 0.5, t = 1.2 mm, n = 1.51, λ = 780 nm, Δt = 40 
μm, and θ = 4 mrad. Substituting these values, we obtain WST = 0.011λ and WTL = 0.017λ. In 
the DVD optical disk, the values are NA = 0.6, t = 0.6 mm, n = 1.51, λ = 650 nm, Δt = 16 μm, 
and θ = 3.9 mrad for the same values of WST = 0.011λ and WTL = 0.0172λ. The plot for higher 
NA = 0.85 and short wavelength λ = 405 nm is shown as a reference. Thus the tolerance 
of the tilt angle for the DVD disk is almost the same as for the CD, as contrasted with the 
tolerance of the thickness being small.

14.3.2.2  Wave Aberrations of Optical Components
Because mass-produced items are used for the disk optical components, the influence of 
variations in wave aberrations cannot be disregarded. Of all the components of the optical 
pick-up, the OB and the CL have the largest wave aberrations. Both the OB and the CL usu­
ally are aspherical pressed glass (APG) available on a mass production basis. Figure 14.13 
shows an example of a mass-produced aspherical OB. Figure 14.14 shows the wave aberra­
tions of a typical APG OB as measured with a Fizeau interferometer. The wave aberrations 
of prism systems are generally small, but as the number of prisms increases, the allowance 
for the entire pick-up is consumed.
14.3.2.3  Aberration Due to the Semiconductor Laser
Semiconductor lasers are generally astigmatic, and as this astigmatism is propagated and 
focused on the disk, variations in frequency characteristics may occur according to relative 
directions on the disk, or there may be reduced focusing latitude. In the record-playback 
optics, the electromagnetic emission from a semiconductor laser is passed through a CL

to yield a beam of substantially parallel rays, which is then converted by an anamorphic 
beam expander to a beam having substantially isotropic distribution.
The correction for astigmatism is carried out concurrently in this stage. If stationary 
prism is used for correction, the astigmatism generated at an angle of 45° with the prism 
cannot be corrected. Therefore, when the semiconductor laser is mounted at an angle θ 
with the horizontal direction of the anamorphic expander prism, there occurs a residual 
astigmatism. The residual wave aberration WLA due to this astigmatism is expressed as

Handbook of Optical and Laser Scanning
For initial focus setting, the use of a diffraction grating having a spatial frequency near 
one-half of the cutoff frequency 2NA/l of the disk optics is advantageous, for the influ­
ence of defocus is then most pronounced. Because the track pitch of the optical disk is usu­
ally the space frequency in the vicinity, the position of best focus is where the modulation 
by the track is maximal. By this adjustment, the setting error can be reduced to less than 
±0.14 μm. Thus, with an optical disk of NA = 0.6 and λ = 650 nm and a defocus of +0.14 μm, 
the wave aberration is WDF = 0.011l.
14.3.2.5  Allowable Wave Aberration
Table 14.4 shows the typical wave aberration classified by causative factors. These wave 
aberrations can be integrated into the system allowance limit of 0.070λ rms as a totality. 
Since most of the factors responsible for wave aberrations are independent by nature, it is 
possible, in the actual design of an optical pick-up, that the allowable aberration value of 
each optical component is fairly liberal, as shown in Table 14.4.
14.3.3  Optical Pick-Up Mechanism
14.3.3.1  Optical Pick-Up Construction13,14
The optical pick-up generally consists of an optical base forming the optics assembly and 
an actuator for allowing the OB to follow the disk plane and tracking groove.
A typical optical pick-up construction for DVD is shown in Figure 14.16. Laser and PDs 
are combined on one silicon substrate. The beam emitting from the laser is initially par­
allel to the silicon surface and is then reflected by an engraved mirror to become perpen­
dicular to the silicon surface. A polarizing hologram, shown in Figure 14.17, is used as a 
BS. It is transparent for the p-polarized beam emitted from the laser and diffractive for the 
s-polarized beam reflected from the disk. The p-polarized beam becomes an s-polarized 
beam as a consequence of the double pass through the quarter-wave plate. PDs formed on 
the silicon surface are located on both sides of the laser, and receive the beam diffracted 
by the polarizing hologram. The environmental resistance and reliability of the system 
are greatly enhanced when the number of reflective surfaces is minimized throughout

the optical path from the laser to the OB. Thus the construction with the integrated laser 
detector unit (LDU) is advantageous for reliability. Figure 14.18 is a view showing a LDU 
for a DVD player.
The optical base has a three-point support structure that enables a two-dimensional 
adjustment of the tilt angle of the optical pick-up. The axis of the OB is aligned perpendic­
ular to the disk plane by mechanical adjustment, and the tilt of the optical base or the angle 
of inclination of the actuator must be adequately adjusted. The actuator and the optical

base are provided with a convex and a concave spherical surface, respectively, whereby 
tilt correction can be made in two dimensions by means of couple of screws and springs. 
When the center of the sphere is aligned with the focal point of the OB, there is no trans­
verse shift of the beam as it passes through the OB.
14.3.3.2  Actuator
The actuator has both a focusing drive mechanism for following the axial position of the 
disk and a tracking drive mechanism for following the track on the disk. The actuator 
must include a balanced combination of these two mechanisms, and must be designed in 
such a manner that there will be a minimum of interference between the mechanisms. The 
essential conditions that must be satisfied in the design of an actuator are:
	
1.	Satisfactory frequency characteristics
	
2.	High acceleration characteristics
	
3.	High current sensitivity
	
4.	Broad dynamic ranges for both focusing and tracking
Two actuator constructions satisfying these criteria are shown in Figure 14.19. The wire-
suspended actuator15 in Figure 14.19a is quite simple in construction and can be moved in 
the focusing and tracking directions by driving the center of gravity of its movable seg­
ment. Moreover, reliability is high because the four wires can be utilized as leads to the 
coils. The rotational actuator in Figure 14.19b is characterized by a small tilting angle of the 
critical axis and a large focusing dynamic range.

where K is a spring constant and m is a movable mass. As a rule of thumb, the dynamic 
frequency range of an actuator is approximately from the level of the basic disk rotation 
frequency to the peak level of high-order resonant frequency. The larger this dynamic 
range value is, the larger is the servo gain that can be obtained.

14.4.1  Laser Structure
14.4.1.1  Operating Principles of an Al–Ga–As Double Heterojunction Laser16
The energy band diagram of a double heterojunction semiconductor laser is shown in 
Figure 14.20. This laser consists of three layers having dissimilar energy gaps Eg, with 
increased energy gaps for the n-type and p-type cladding layers, which are on both sides 
of the active layer. As a photon hvg2 corresponding to the active layer energy gap Eg2 
(Eg2 = hvg2) passes through the active layer, the electrons in the conduction band drop into 
the positive holes in the valence band to trigger a stimulated emission in phase with the 
incident photon. As a current Ip in the normal direction is passed through this diode, the 
probability of the presence of electrons in the active layer 2 is increased by the energy bar­
rier  Ec, the conduction band. On the other hand, in the valence band, the probability of 
the presence of positive holes in the active layer 2 is increased by the energy barrier  Ev to 
cause a population inversion in the active layer 2. In the active layer, therefore, the conduc­
tion band becomes full of electrons normally absent at thermal equilibrium, and the prob­
ability of recombination of electron-hole pairs with stimulated emission is increased. An 
incoming photon into the active layer is thereby amplified. The feedback mirrors at both 
ends of the active layer constitute a resonant cavity, and as the amplification surpasses the 
losses within the resonance cavity laser emission takes place.

Figure 14.21. The RISA structure is characterized by an AlInP current blocking layer, which 
leads to small internal loss in the waveguide and substantially reduces operating carrier 
density. The resultant operating current for 950 mW continuous wave at 70 °C is less than 
100 mA. The RISA laser is produced by two steps of MOCVD growth. In the first MOCVD 
growth, an n-GaAs buffer layer, a cladding layer, the MQW active region, the optical con­
finement layer, the current blocking layer, and a nondoped GaAs (0.01 μm) are successively 
grown. Then, the stripe region for the current path is formed by chemical etching. In the 
second MOCVD growth, the cladding layer, buffer layer, and contact layer are grown. The 
cavity length is 500 μm. Front and rear facets are coated to obtain reflectivities of 4% and 
90%, respectively.

14.4.2  Astigmatism of the Laser
There are two categories of semiconductor lasers: gain-guided and index-guided. In a gain-
guided laser the direction of beam propagation is not perpendicular to the wavefront. This 
mismatch causes relatively large astigmatism. Some lasers classified as index-guided also 
have weak evanescent waves. As a result, the beam waist in the horizontal direction is 
situated inwardly by  L from the plane of beam emergence and thereby produces astig­
matism. Whereas this astigmatism  L is as large as 10–50 μm in the gain-guided laser, it is 
about 5–10 μm (0.2–0.4 mil) in the index-guided laser. Figure 14.22 shows a typical distribu­
tion of astigmatism in index-guided lasers. Generally speaking, the astigmatism of these 
lasers tends to decrease as the laser output increases.
14.4.3  Laser Noise18
Semiconductor diode lasers heat up during operation because of power dissipation aris­
ing from the injection current. The temperature increase induces mode hopping, which 
is a small shift in the wavelength of the output light. Figure 14.23 shows the temperature

dependence of a semiconductor laser. As the temperature of the laser increases, the longi­
tudinal mode of the laser is shifted toward longer wavelengths. Substantial noise accom­
panies this type of mode hopping. Figure 14.24 shows the relative intensity of noise (RIN) 
versus the laser heat sink temperature. Figure 14.24a shows the characteristic of the ele­
ment itself, and the broken line represents the allowable noise level for an optical pick-up.
If a small amount of the output beam is directed back into the output aperture of the 
laser, the laser emission will become unstable, exhibiting both mode hopping and exces­
sive amplitude noise. If the level of return light is about 0.5%, the relative intensity noise 
will be above the noise level allowable for an optical pick-up. Noise of this magnitude not 
only leads to a decrease in disk recording/reproduction SNR, but may also lead to insta­
bilities in the focus and tracking servos.
An optical isolator consisting of a λ/4 plate and a PBS is typically used in the optical path 
to minimize light reflections back into the laser output operations. However, the return light 
cannot be completely eliminated due to the birefringence in the disk and variations in isolator 
performance. As a consequence, the generation of noise caused by return light is inevitable in 
semiconductor lasers of longitudinal single mode. Within the constraints of the basic aspects 
of the optical pick-up design, return light noise can be best controlled by broadening the 
emission spectral line width of the semiconductor laser to reduce the coherence of the light. 
Introducing the multiple longitudinal modes can broaden the emission spectral line width.
In index-guided lasers, the transverse mode behavior becomes single mode at an emis­
sion output of 1 mW or higher, due to a confining effect on the transverse mode. In gain-
guided lasers, the transverse mode is confined by the gain corresponding to the carrier 
density and that generally results in multiple mode output. The influence of return light in 
a multimode laser is small and hence laser emission is unaffected. However, the inherent

noise level is higher than in single-mode lasers. As shown in Figure 14.24b, when the index-
guided laser operating single mode is modulated with high-frequency carrier, the longitu­
dinal mode becomes multimode with the result that the noise level is lowered. Figure 14.25 
shows the return-light noise levels of various lasers. Noise level RIN is calculated as:

bandwidth. When the high-frequency oscillation is set at 300–600 MHz and the modula­
tion level is set below the laser emission threshold, the light output becomes a pulse emis­
sion providing a multimode operation. Figure 14.26 shows an example of (upper curve) the 
read signal obtained without high-frequency oscillation and (lower curve) the read signal 
with high-frequency oscillation. The addition of the high-frequency oscillation improves 
the CNR of the carrier signal by about 5 dB.
14.5  FOCUSING AND TRACKING TECHNIQUES
14.5.1  Focusing Servo System and Method of Error Signal Detection
The laser beam in an optical disk system is focused on the disk surface while the disk 
rotates at a high speed. An optical disk spinning at a high speed typically exhibits motion 
in the axial direction of tens to hundreds of micrometers. It is necessary that the OB fol­
lows this motion to keep the focus position of the beam on the signal plane of the disk

within the allowable limits of defocus of the optical system. The focusing mechanism gen­
erally used for this purpose is a moving-coil actuator employing a magnet and a coil. The 
required frequency response of the system is from several Hz to more than 10 kHz. Figure 
14.27 shows a block diagram of the optical disk focusing system. The focusing servo loop 
comprises a focusing error signal detection unit, a circuit for amplification with phase 
correction of the detected error signal, and an actuator for driving the OB. This actuator is 
designed to follow the axial motion of the disk in response to a servo signal in the presence 
of external noise associated with the movement of the actuator and the interference from 
the tracking signal. In designing an autofocusing mechanism for the optical disk, external 
light noise must be reduced as much as possible. A balanced design must be employed 
and take into consideration: (1) interference from the tracking signal that occurs when the 
beam traverses the tracks; (2) mutual interference from motion of the focusing and track­
ing actuators; and (3) false focusing error signals associated with movement of the beam 
on the detector in the course of tracking.
Focusing errors are introduced by the axial motion of the disk, vibrations of the device 
and other causes. The focusing error information contained in the laser light reflected 
from the disk can be transformed into intensity or phase differences to derive an error 
signal. Each of the following beam characteristics can be utilized to generate a focusing 
error signal:
	
1.	Change of beam shape
	
2.	Movement of the beam position
	
3.	Phase of the modulated waveform of the beam
14.5.1.1  Beam Shape Detection Method
Two separate techniques can be used to detect the beam shape to obtain a focusing error 
signal. These are the astigmatic focusing detection method and the spot size detection 
method.
FIGURE 14.26

Figure 14.28 shows a basic optical system for the astigmatic focusing detection method 
using a tilted parallel plate. Although the conventional implementation includes use of 
a cylindrical lens, the tilted plate method is advantageous in the simplicity of the optics. 
The sensitivity of focusing error signal detection is dependent on the thickness and refrac­
tive index of the parallel plate assuming that the magnification of the OB is constant. The 
greater the thickness of the plate and/or the larger the refractive index, the larger the astig­
matism and, hence, detection sensitivity. Figure 14.29 shows a typical focusing error signal 
in the optimum design. When the detection sensitivity is relatively low, defocus becomes 
large due to false signals caused by dropouts in the disk or movement of the OB during 
tracking. When the detection sensitivity is too high, the dynamic range of the focusing 
servo is diminished and the stability of the servo is decreased.
14.5.1.2  Spot Size Detection Method
Figure 14.30 shows the operating principle of the spot size detection method. The central 
part of the beam is received in front of and beyond the focal point of the beam by two 
three-segment detectors. A focusing error signal is derived from the intensity difference 
on the central and outer segments. The beam shape detection method generally has a large 
allowance for detector offset and has good temperature characteristics and aging stability. 
Recent progress of holographic technology enables use of a holographic optical element 
(HOE) to detect focusing signals.13

14.5.1.3  Beam Position Detection Method
The beam position detection method converts the movement parallel to the optical axis—
such as axial motion of the optical disk—to a beam movement in a plane perpendicular 
to the optical axis to obtain a focusing error signal. This detection method uses relatively 
simple hardware construction for detection and gives a broad focusing dynamic range.
Figure 14.31 shows a focusing error signal detection system using a bi-prism. This is an 
example of the Foucault focusing detection method. As the distance between the disk and 
the OB decreases, the intensity on the inner side of the respective split detectors increases 
and an increasing distance between the disk and the OB results in increasing intensity on 
the outer sides of the split detectors.
Figure 14.32 shows a focusing detection system using the critical angle of a prism. 
The beam of rays reflected from the disk enters the prism as a divergent beam when the 
distance between the disk and the OB is small, or as a convergent beam when the dis­
tance is large. When the prism is set at the critical angle, and the rays are not parallel, the 
beam will be partially transmitted by the prism to establish differential intensities on the 
Diﬀerential output

detectors. In the case of a divergent beam, the near detector receives less light; in the case 
of a convergent beam, the far detector receives less light.
There are other methods for focusing detection, such as a skew beam focusing detection 
system, a system wherein the incident beam is eccentric with respect to the OB axis, a sys­
tem using a single knife-edge, a beam rotation focusing detection system, and others.

14.5.1.4  Beam Phase Difference Detection
There are two methods to detect beam phase difference: the spatial phase difference detec­
tion method and the temporal phase difference detection method. In the spatial phase dif­
ference detection method, illustrated in Figure 14.33, the phase of the beam located in the 
far-field pattern of the reflected beam diffracted by a given pattern in the optical disk (e.g., 
the pregrooved track pattern) is detected. This method is dependent on beam wavelength, 
and the dynamic range of focusing error signal is narrow. The temporal phase difference 
detection method is also known as the wobbling method. In this method, the focal point 
of the beam irradiating the optical disk is modulated along the optical axis with a wobbler. 
The phase of the modulated signal obtained with a detector is compared with the phase of 
the modulated drive signal of the wobbler to obtain a focusing error signal proportional 
to the phase difference.
14.5.2  Track Error Signal Detection Method
14.5.2.1  Detection Methods
The signal tracks on a DVD disk have a pitch of 0.74 μm, and the signal tracks on a con­
ventional CD disk have a pitch of 1.6 μm. The beam spot for reproducing the signal must 
follow this track within an accuracy of 0.04–0.1 μm. This tracking performance is achieved 
by driving the OB in a lateral direction with a voice coil actuator. The following methods 
are commonly used for optical detection of the TE:
	
1.	Detection using two auxiliary beams generated by grating (3-B or 3-beam 
method)
	
2.	Detection of the far-field distribution of the read/write beam reflected from the 
disk (PP method)
	
3.	Detection from the difference between two signal levels obtained with sam­
ple pits disposed at an offset of ±1/4 pitch from the track (SS or sampled servo 
method)
	
4.	Detection of the phase difference between the differential output from diagonal 
playback signal of quadrant detector and the sum output signal of quadrant detec­
tor (DPD or differential phase detection method)
	
5.	Detection of the phase difference between the playback signal obtained by a slight 
induced displacement of the beam in the direction perpendicular to the track and 
the phase of the corresponding drive signal (wobbling method)

14.5.2.2  3-Beam Method
The 3-beam method using auxiliary beams is shown in Figure 14.34. The two first-order 
beams obtained by passing the laser beam through a diffractive grating are aligned to 
positions on the disk of about plus and minus one-quarter of the track pitch apart from 
the track center (B1, B2). The reflected two beams are received by two detectors (D1, D2) 
to obtain a track error signal. The fundamental beam (B0) is used for SG detection by a 
central detector (D0). While this method is well suited to the read-only optical pick-up 
like CD, it must be carefully designed for use in read/write optics. In this case the beam 
intensity is increased during the writing mode, introducing the risk of harmful recording 
by the auxiliary beams.
14.5.2.3  Wobbling Method
In the wobbling method, the track error signal corresponds to the phase difference between 
a signal to the transducer that induces a slight displacement of the beam in the direction 
perpendicular to the track and a signal from the beam modulated by track edge diffrac­
tion. This method has only been implemented in certain limited applications. This is partly 
due to the poor stability of the wobbling frequency and partly due to the 0.1 μm wobble 
displacement required to obtain a TE with satisfactory S/N ratio. Wobble displacement of 
0.1 μm is close to the maximum allowable tracking error value.
14.5.2.4  Differential Phase Detection (DPD) Method
This method uses the quadrant detectors to detect the phase difference between the dif­
ferential output from the diagonal playback signal (D1 + D4) − (D2 + D3) of the quadrant 
detector and the sum output signal (D1 + D2 + D3 + D4) of the quadrant detector. The DPD 
tracking error detection is shown in Figure 14.35. This is the method recommended for 
playback TE detection in the DVD specifications.19

14.5.2.5  Push–Pull Track Error Signal Detection Method
The simplest method for obtaining a track error signal in read/write is called the “push–
pull method.” A split detector is inserted in the far-field of the beam in such a manner that 
the line of division of the detector is lined up with the track.
Figure 14.36 shows a basic optical system for signal detection using the PP method. The 
intensity pattern incident on the split detector is a combination of the zero-order and first-
order beams (due to diffraction caused by the track on the disk). The track error signal is 
derived from the difference in the signals from the two detectors. Figure 14.37 shows the 
far-field beam distributions according to the beam spot position on the track. The asym­
metry of the far-field beam intensity distribution and the track error signal level are maxi­
mum when the track groove depth is λ/8. (When the depth is λ/4 multiplied by an integer, 
asymmetry disappears and no track error signal is obtained.)
14.5.2.6  Slit Detection Method20
When the beam spot is located in the center of the track, the phase difference ψ between 
the zero-order beam and the two first-order beams in the PP system is dependent on the 
diffraction by the track and on the defocus ΔΖ and can be expressed as21

Figure 14.38 shows a typical far-field beam distribution in the presence of defocus. By uti­
lizing this property in the far-field, the control range of tracking with respect to defocus 
can be expanded. Thus, the defocus characteristic of the track error signal can be improved 
by providing slits symmetrically in the centers of overlaps between the zero-order beam 
and the two first-order beams as illustrated in Figure 14.39.
Figure 14.40 shows the change in track error signal level according to defocus at various 
slit widths. If the slit width is about 20% of the far-field pattern, the proportion of change 
in the track error signal due to defocus is improved by about a factor of 2. If the slit width

2.	Laser wavelength: L = 830 nm
	
3.	Track pitch: t = 1.6 μm
	
4.	Slit width: W = 0.8 and 0.4 mm
14.5.2.7  Sampled Tracking Method22
In a sampled tracking system, track error signal detection pits are periodically provided 
in lieu of the continuous groove in a conventional grooved disk. The sample pits consist of 
two pits displaced by about ±1/4 of the track pitch from the track center and one pit cen­
tered on the track. Figure 14.41 shows the principle of sampled track error signal detection. 
When the beam spot is (a) off-track upwardly from the track center, the first pit output is 
large and the second pit output is small. In the on-track condition, the first pit output level 
and the second pit output level are equal (b). If the beam spot is downwardly off-track, 
the first pit output is small and the second pit output is large (c). The off-track condition is 
diagnosed by comparing these pit output levels. The third pit is used for making a sam­
pling clock, and the track error signal detection is constructed from these outputs. Figure 
14.42 shows a block diagram of the detection circuit.
In the sampled tracking system, each set of pits provided for the track error signal detec­
tion uses a track length equivalent to that used to store 1 byte of information. The sampling 
frequency must be higher than about ten times the cutoff frequency of the tracking servo. 
This reduces the size of the usable data area, but the overall system performance improves 
because there is less degradation of data signals and interference effects on the focusing

servo caused by the track groove. Further, an inclination of the disk induces a track offset 
in the PP system, but not in the sampled tracking method. For example, a disk inclination 
of 0.7° of a 1.2-mm-thick substrate with NA = 0.5 and λ = 830 nm causes a 0.1 μm lateral 
shift in the quiescent operating position of the PP tracking servo. This type of systematic 
track error is decreased by about a factor of 5 when the sampled tracking method is used.
14.6  RADIAL ACCESS AND DRIVING TECHNIQUE
14.6.1  Fast Random Access
A critical aspect of an optical disk memory system is fast random access to the stored 
information. This random access is accomplished via two mechanisms: optical pick-up 
motion for rough positioning and the tracking actuator for precise positioning. A linear 
actuator is used as the coarse positioning means. To minimize access time, it is necessary 
to (1) develop a small and lightweight optical pick-up; (2) increase the resonant frequency 
of the linear actuator; and (3) develop a transfer mechanism with a minimum of friction. In 
the typical linear actuator designed for video recording applications, the transfer segment 
weighs only 78 g and has a thrust of 3.0 N/A. This linear actuator gives an average access 
time of 75 ms or less.9 The optical pick-up base is provided with roller bearings so that it

freely moves on the guide rods. The low-frequency component of the track error signal is 
fed to the linear actuator so that the center of drive of the OB will lie at the center of the 
tracking mechanism motion range.
Figure 14.43 shows the modes of access by the linear actuator/tracking actuator com­
bination23 First, the tracking actuator is disabled. Then the linear actuator is accelerated 
and decelerated at the maximum speed to position the optical pick-up in the vicinity of 
the correct track (A to B). The tracking actuator is reactivated and the track address is read 
(B to C). The number of tracks between the actual and desired address is calculated, and 
access is completed by executing a multitrack jump. Figure 14.44 is a block diagram of the 
tracking servo circuit and linear actuator circuitry. The track error signal obtained by the 
procedure described in Sec. 5.2 is fed to an amplification circuit, a switching circuit, and a 
drive circuit in succession to drive the tracking actuator. The tracking drive signal is also 
used to drive the linear actuator. During random access, the drive signal is removed from

the tracking actuator and a voltage corresponding to the access signal is generated and 
supplied to the linear actuator drive circuit. Two methods are available for ascertaining the 
actual position with respect to the target track. The first method involves calculating the 
number of tracks between the current and desired positions, then detecting and counting 
optically each pregroove as it is passed over in the radial scan. The scan is stopped when 
the correct number of tracks has been crossed.
Since this method counts the tracks themselves, the distance to the target track can be 
accurately computed. The track detection bandwidth must be broad enough to prevent 
miscounts of the tracks during the peak speed of the linear actuator. This method is less 
applicable when using sampled format disks; even track addresses can complicate the 
track-counting process in continuous format disks. A second method provides the optical 
pick-up with a position sensor for detecting the current position. This provides a stable 
position signal, and the access servo can be damped using the output signal from this sen­
sor. Examples of position sensors include linear scale sensors, optical position sensors, and 
slide resistance sensors. Figure 14.45 shows a typical optical position sensor.
14.6.2  Optical Drive System
The optical disk system consists of hardware comprising the disk, optical pick-up, access­
ing circuit, signal processing circuit, error correction circuit, microcomputer, and so on, 
and software for processing the various signals. The height of the 5.25 in optical disk drive 
is either full height (82 mm), half-height (41 mm), 1 in height, or half-inch height, corre­
sponding to standardized magnetic disk products. In the half-height drive, design goals 
include the use of a disk cartridge that is inserted and clamped and low profiles of the 
component parts for the access mechanism. The height of the optical pick-up must be less 
than 15–16 mm. For the thinner drive like those used in a notebook computer, the height of 
the drive is less than 12.7 mm. A height of the optical pick-up of around 7.5 mm is needed

and an ingenious design is required. Figure 14.46 shows the thin optical disk drive for 
a DVD-ROM. The removability of the optical disk affects differences in the amounts of 
eccentricity and undulation each time a disk is mounted. Moreover, since the disk sub­
strate is made of plastic, the amount of undulation increases with the age of the disk. The 
dynamic balance of the disk is affected by these factors, and vibrations are induced. It 
is necessary, therefore, to design the various actuators such that these vibrations do not 
degrade performance.

Thickness variations, index changes, and tilts of the disk substrate all cause wavefront 
aberrations. Here, we calculate the optical path differences Δ0 between two rays: the first is 
the on-axis ray, and the second is the outermost ray, which determines the NA of the OB.

15.1  INTRODUCTION
During the early 1990s a process called CTP (Computer to Plate) was developed to automate 
the production of printing plates and simplify the workflow of the printing plant. During 
the development phase of this technology, there were many companies producing CTP 
devices (platesetters). After the enthusiasm of early adopters waned and the technology 
matured, it became apparent that total market demand would not support 15 or 20 small 
platesetter companies and a consolidation of the suppliers took place. Ultimately between 
five and ten major suppliers of platesetters have had relative success. In recent years, CTP

Handbook of Optical and Laser Scanning
has been widely adopted in all types of printing plants: from small commercial shops to 
the largest newspapers. Also, with the continuing rise of the digital delivery of informa­
tion, what remains of the printing process will continue to be optimized—an understand­
ing of existing platesetters and their architectures becomes increasingly important for 
those involved in procurement and use of these devices. Platesetters employ a light source 
(most often laser(s)) with an optical scanning system to expose photosensitive printing 
plates. This article will briefly describe the different types of scanning systems that are 
used, a methodology that will show how the different scanning systems are paired with 
appropriate light sources and printing plates, and examples of platesetters that are cur­
rently in the marketplace.
15.2  DESCRIPTION OF TYPES OF SCANNING SYSTEMS
The scanning systems used in platesetters are not typically novel in design—most find their 
origin in other nonprinting applications. As with all product designs, a series of tradeoffs 
is made in the attempt to optimize the functionality of the platesetter. With CTP’s focus on 
streamlining the workflow of the printing plant, those tradeoffs often have occurred try­
ing to balance the complication and cost of the scanning systems with those of automatic 
plate handling mechanisms.
15.2.1  A Note about System Resolution and CTP
It is very important to recognize that while platesetter resolution and quality of the printed 
matter are directly related (i.e., higher resolution generally results in higher quality), res­
olution and productivity are inversely related. Therefore, typical resolutions for higher 
quality printed material (e.g., for magazines) are 2400 dpi and 2540 dpi (1000 cm−1) while 
newspapers commonly use 1270 dpi (500 cm−1) because higher peak productivity is of 
greater importance than printing quality in the newsroom.
15.2.2  Internal Drum Scanners
The internal drum scanner is a post-objective scanning system in which the printing plate 
is mounted on the internal surface of a cylinder with the photosensitive side facing the cen­
ter of the cylinder. Prior to CTP, this architecture was used in producing large format film 
negatives used in the exposure of printing plates (a process called Computer to Film [CTF]). 
This scanning system always uses a laser as its source because of the distance over which 
the beam must be focused to a small spot, usually with a FWHM equal to 1/Resolution of 
the system. The beam is first modulated temporally, and then focused through the objec­
tive. The beam then is aligned to a 45° mirror or right angle prism spinning on the axis 
of the cylinder. The reflector directs the beam toward the printing plate surface at normal 
incidence. These systems are sensitive to misalignment of the beam to the axis of the cyl­
inder. Typically, the waist of the beam occurs at the surface of the printing plate.
The internal drum format’s greatest strength is the relative simplicity of the optical sys­
tem. Its disadvantages are that the use of multiple exposure beams is difficult to imple­
ment and this format is inherently inefficient in its use of optical power. Since the plate 
doesn’t extend through the full arc of the cylinder, the overall efficiency is at most the angle

subtended by the plate divided by 360°. (For example, if the plate mounted on the internal 
drum subtends a 180° angle, the overall efficiency of the system is less than 50% when other 
losses are factored in.) Figure 15.1 depicts the scheme used by internal drum platesetters.
15.2.3  External Drum
The external drum architecture finds use in the widest range of applications for CTP. 
Its applications range from engraving rubber flexographic printing plates (hundreds of 
microns thick) with a CO2 laser to exposure of offset plates (with a 1-micron thick photo­
sensitive laser) with a near-IR or violet diode laser.
The external drum system is not a typical post-objective scanning system—the expo­
sure media is mounted on the external surface of a rotating drum and is scanned past the 
focussed beam. Temporal modulation of the beam can be by direct modulation of a laser 
source (e.g., a near-IR laser diode), by acousto-optic modulation of a laser source (e.g., a CO2 
laser) or by modulating a laser beam or some noncoherent source with a “light valve” 
or MEMS device. (This not only temporally modulates, but also spatially modulates the 
beam, splitting it into multiple exposing channels.) The light is then focused through an 
objective onto the printing plate.
One of the limiting factors faced by external drum systems is the maximum drum rota­
tion rate (this is dependent on drum diameter, weight and thickness of the plate, etc.). The 
maximum data rate (and thus the productivity of the system) may be severely limited 
unless multiple exposing channels are employed. As the drum spins, the exposure “head” 
(typically composed of light source(s) and the objective) travels axially along the length of 
the drum. When multiple exposure channels are employed, they are typically spaced by 
one pixel in the axial direction. This creates a spiral “swath” that is N pixels wide (where N 
is the number of exposure channels). The number of channels employed in external drum 
systems can vary from one to several hundreds.
Because the drum diameter can be tuned for the specific size of the media being exposed, 
very little non-imaging time is experienced during the exposure cycle. Another advantage 
of external drum systems is that the optical system is typically very simple, typically com­
prised of the light source(s), a means of temporal modulation, and the objective.

Handbook of Optical and Laser Scanning
The use of multiple channels somewhat complicates the manipulation of data and the 
optical system. Additionally, design of the plate handling system is challenging, since the 
printing plate must be mounted in register against the drum’s external surface.
Figure 15.2 depicts the exposure scheme of a single beam external drum system where 
the light source is not mounted on the exposure head—an example of this would be a 
platesetter used to engrave a flexographic printing plate. Though atypical, this is a more 
general example of the format (in comparison to a system where the light source travels on 
the exposure head) since it illustrates the requirement that the laser beam must be accu­
rately aligned parallel to the axis of the drum and the head drive screw. If this alignment 
is not very precise, significant imaging errors will occur along the length of the slow scan 
head travel.
15.2.4  F-Theta Scan Architecture
The F-Theta Scan system employs pre-objective scanning, that is, the scanning mechanism 
(usually a rotating polygon) occurs prior to the objective. The objective is designed so that 
the “focus” occurs in a plane, rather than on a curved surface. If the objective is telecentric, 
the objective must have a diameter that exceeds the “fast scan” dimension of the plate. 
(An important characteristic of the objective is that the position of the beam on the plate 
is proportional to the polygon angle of reflection, rather than to its tangent. The resulting 
velocity of the beam across the plate in the fast scan axis is nearly constant, which results 
in consistent plate exposure doses.) Because most CTP exposure media (i.e., offset plates) 
do not require a significant depth of focus, most systems that use an F-Theta Objective do 
not employ a telecentric design, resulting in incidence angles at the exposure plane that

may be in the tens of degrees. Because the light must be focused over significant distances, 
these systems always use a laser as a source. Figure 15.3 is a photograph of the F-Theta 
Objective (including the polygon) used in the MacDermid Printing Solutions Flexographic 
Platesetter. This nontelecentric implementation has a scan line length of more than 60 cm 
with a design resolution of 500 cm−1. (Note: The 12-in scale in the lower right quadrant of 
the photograph gives some sense of the size of the optical elements in this objective.)
The most significant disadvantage in using an F-Theta scan system is the cost and com­
plexity of the objective itself for high resolution, high efficiency systems. The MacDermid 
F-Theta objective in the photo above has a material cost of tens of thousands of dollars. 
Because capital cost is often a primary consideration for printers, this can be a significant 
marketing hurdle.
15.2.5  BasysPrint Platesetters
BasysPrint’s platesetters are a unique example of post-objective scanning and employ a 
process somewhat analogous to projection lithography. The Texas Instruments DMD chip, 
a MEM commonly used in projectors and TVs, is used as a spatial modulator to project an 
image of the appropriate bitmap onto the printing plate through an objective lens. During 
exposure, the printing plate is stationary while the objective, or “optics head,” is translated 
in three dimensions (translation in the z-axis is for focus). (Because the exposure head 
projects an image of the DMD onto the plate, the system is sensitive to defocus errors, so 
the design includes automatic focus correction.) Originally, a short arc lamp was used 
as the light source, but later versions have employed a 405-nm diode laser array coupled 
into a fiber bundle. Although the lasers are not coupled into single mode fibers (so the 
light emerges from the fibers incoherently), this option delivers significantly higher actinic 
power than the original arc lamp sources.
In its original version, the image was split into “minipictures”—the dimension of each 
minipicture was the size of the image of the entire DMD array. For a platesetter resolution 
of 1270 dpi (500 dpcm), the image of the 1024 × 768 pixel DMD had dimensions 2.048 × 1.536 
cm. The exposure consisted of the head traveling to the appropriate spot, exposing for a 
specified amount of time (DBasysPrint, in seconds), then traveling to the next spot approxi­
mately 1.5 cm away. This process was repeated hundreds of times per printing plate.

The more recent versions of BasysPrint’s platesetters use the same architecture and optical 
system, but the image delivery has been changed. The minipictures are now separated by 
just one pixel in the platesetter’s fast scan direction. The process of scanning to the correct 
position, exposing, traveling to the next position (albeit only one pixel away) while the image 
to be exposed is being updated, then exposing the next minipicture is fundamentally the 
same as in the original version of the machine. The difference is that the exposure head no 
longer stops between minipictures in the fast scan axis, but rather, exposes “on the fly.” The 
net result is that each pixel on the printing plate is exposed by the sum of the pixels used 
in the fast scan axis of the DMD. This type of exposure creates a “scrolling” effect and has

resulted in a significant increase in platesetter productivity since the time required to start 
and stop the head during the repositioning between minipictures is no longer required.
Figure 15.4 demonstrates how the scrolling effect is implemented. For the sake of the 
example, the DMD is reduced to an array consisting of five micromirrors in the slow 
scan axis and three in the fast scan axis. The image desired on the printing media (a “2”) 
is depicted at the top of Figure 15.4. The other pictures depict the DMD state (0 = “off,” 
1 = “on”) as the optics scrolls across the desired image position on the media, each succes­
sive picture separated from the previous one-by-one pixel in the fast scan direction. The 
bottom picture in Figure 15.4 depicts the integrated exposure of the image on the media.
The DMD has a maximum refresh rate of 40 kHz that is an inherent limit related to the 
mechanical nature of switching the mirrors on and off.1  To further increase the productiv­
ity of these platesetters, use of new generation DMD chips that are wider (i.e., in the slow 
scan direction) is being considered.
Because the exposure head moves in all three dimensions over the plate during exposure 
these platesetters are able to skip over areas where the image is blank. This has the poten­
tial to significantly increase the productivity of the platesetter, though the benefit of this 
feature is totally dependent on image content. BasysPrint has focused the design of their 
machines on exposing printing plates that historically have been exposed through a film 
negative in a vacuum frame. These plates tend to be less expensive than other CTP media 
and BasysPrint’s technology has been dubbed “Computer to Conventional Plate,” or CTcP.
15.3  METHODOLOGY FOR DETERMINING CTP IMPLEMENTATION
Several equations are derived in the following paragraphs in order to provide a basis for 
comparing the implementation of the different scanning architectures.
15.3.1  Productivity (plates per hour [pph]), X
Platesetter productivity must meet the printer’s peak plate production requirements—this 
is particularly important for printing plants for which the printed content is delivered just 
in time and the print run must be delivered under deadline—for example, newspapers. 
Productivity is a specification of great interest to printers and is typically specified for a 
given plate type of specific dimensions. The productivity, X (in plates per hour [pph]), is 
related to the exposure and plate-handling times by the equation:
	
X =
+
3600
0
t
t
exp
 
	
(15.1)
where τexp (the time to expose a plate) and τo (the time between successive exposures) are 
expressed in seconds. The sum of τexp and τo is the platesetter “cycle time.”
15.3.2  Plate exposure time, τexp
Product brochures do not typically specify the exposure time per plate, τexp, but this variable 
can be often be determined (with a few assumptions) by using Equation 15.1 and solving 
simultaneous equations for the different productivity scenarios listed in those brochures. For 

720 
Handbook of Optical and Laser Scanning
systems which scan continuously (internal drum, external drum and F-Theta), one can solve 
for τexp by using the fact that the exposure time is simply the exposure width Wslow divided by 
the “velocity” of exposure in the slow scan direction (derivation of Vslow is found later):
	
texp = W
V
slow
slow
	
(15.2)
15.3.3  Plate handling time, τo
The plate handling time clearly has a significant effect on platesetter cycle time (i.e., the 
elapsed time from the start of exposing one plate until the start of exposing the next plate) 
and thus, machine productivity. In fact, the time to eject the previously exposed plate and 
then load and position the next plate in register may exceed the time required to expose 
the plate. Once one has calculated τexp, Equation 15.1 leads directly to τo.
15.3.4  The Dose Equation
One simple equation relates the sensitivity of the exposure media, the required source 
power and the rate at which the media is exposed:
	
D
P
A
=
plate
’
	
(15.3)
D is the required plate exposure dose (in J/cm2), Pplate is the optical power measured at the 
exposure media, and A′ is the effective area scan rate (dA/dt). (It should be noted that D is 
a characteristic of the printing plate itself and, for our purposes, is better considered an 
estimate, since how the optical power is delivered [e.g., as a Gaussian beam or with a “top 
hat” profile] affects the final results on the printing plate.) Required exposure doses vary 
widely with the printing technology and plate type as is illustrated in Table 15.1.

15.3.5  Optical Source Power
Since Pplate is the power measured at the exposure media, the total optical source power 
must account for the optical transmission, T:
	
P
P
T

total
=
⋅
	
(15.4)
As optical systems increase in complexity, typically the number of optical surfaces 
increases, along with transmission losses due to imperfect optical coatings. For example, 
a system with 20 antireflection surfaces, with coating losses of 0.5% per surface suffers a 
transmission loss of approximately 9.5%.
Another significant transmission loss is due to the method of source modulation. 
Systems using diode lasers usually directly modulate them, totally mitigating this loss. 
Another common type of modulation scheme uses an acousto-optic modulator—losses 
due to these modulators are typically 10%–20%. According to their manufacturer, Texas 
Instruments, the DMDs used in BasysPrint platesetters have a transmission loss of approx­
imately 35%.1
15.3.6  Area Scan Rate
The maximum plate area to be exposed, A (in cm2), is as follows:
	
A
W
L
=
slow
fast 	
(15.5)
The “slow” and “fast” subscripts refer to the respective “slow” and “fast” scan axes of the 
platesetter. During each fast scan cycle there is a period of active exposure and a period 
of “dead” time (e.g., when the beam is transitioning from one scan line to the next). These 
periods of time can be used to define the duty cycle, e:
	
T

so that:

To find the rate at which the area of the plate is scanned, we first define the maximum area 
exposed by a single scan in the fast axis:

(15.7)
Lplate is the maximum plate length accommodated by the platesetter, N is the number of 
channels employed for exposure, and R is the resolution (in cm−1). The value N/R is the

width of the scan swath in the slow scan direction. Combining Equations 15.5 and 15.6, the 
average area scan rate, A′ (in cm2/s), is as follows:

and a width in the orthogonal axis:

while the value Lplate/e is the fast scan length accounting for the scan duty cycle.

is the average fast scan velocity while the value N/R is the width of the swath of expo­
sure beams in the slow scan direction. As noted before, the value Vslow (from Equation 
15.9) is especially useful in deriving the system productivity for platesetters employ­
ing continuous optical scanning (i.e., internal drum, external drum, and F-Theta 
systems).
15.3.7  BasysPrint Area Scan Rate
For the BasysPrint platesetter models, the area scan rate must be derived in a slightly dif­
ferent manner. The exposure head travels in a serpentine fashion over the plate: expos­
ing as the head travels in the fast scan direction across the plate until it reaches the end 
of the image, stopping, moving to the next scan line, and then exposing while moving 
in the opposite fast scan direction. The distance between fast scan passes is the image 
height of the DMD in the slow scan axis. BasysPrint expresses the exposure dose as 
“light time” (in this chapter it will be referred to as DBasysPrint). The BasysPrint fast scan 
velocity is simply the image height of the DMD in the fast scan direction divided by the 
“light time”:

where Nfast is the number of fast scan pixels used in the exposure. The DMD’s refresh rate 
can be expressed as:
	
f
N
D
=
fast
BasysPrint
	
 (15.11)

CTP Scanning Systems 
723
One design feature of the DMD is that the refresh rate, f, can be increased by using only 
part of the array (i.e., Texas Instruments has formatted the DMD into smaller blocks that 
have a maximum refresh rate of 40,000 Hz). This does not hold the advantage it once did: at 
one point in time, the refresh rate using all of the pixels (768) in the fast scan axis was only 
9700 Hz, producing a Vfast of 19.4 cm/s at a resolution of 500 cm−1. Texas Instrument’s most 
recent DMD brochure specifies a maximum refresh rate using all 768 of the pixels in the 
fast scan axis as 32,550 Hz, increasing Vfast to 65.1 cm/s (Texas Instruments Incorporated).3 
To use the higher refresh rate, the number of fast scan pixels, Nfast, is decreased. In the end, 
this is transparent to the user since the exposure dose is optimized empirically (i.e., the 
user does not request a dose of 0.1 mJ/cm2; instead a series of exposures is made to deter­
mine the appropriate “light time.”)
The BasysPrint area scan rate is simply the product of the image height of the DMD in 
the slow scan axis and the fast scan velocity, or:

(15.12)
This describes the area rate during exposure, and is used to calculate required source 
power. However, to calculate the platesetter productivity, one must also account for the 
time at the beginning of the scan to accelerate to the head exposure velocity Vfast, the time 
at the end of the scan to decelerate, and the time to reposition the optics head for the next 
scan. The value of this “dead” time (“dead” only in the sense that no exposure is being 
done) varies somewhat with DBasysPrint and, as will be demonstrated, significantly impacts 
productivity. For the calculations a value of Tdead = 0.6 s will be used.
To determine the productivity, one must determine the number of fast scan passes 
required, and the time required for each fast scan pass. The number of fast scan passes is 
the slow scan image length divided by the width of the DMD image, with n rounded up to 
the next integer since the platesetter cannot make partial passes in the slow scan axis.

The factor (n−1) occurs since Tdead occurs only between scans. (Actually we need to add one 
acceleration time for the beginning of the first scan and one deceleration time for the last 
scan, but in the larger scheme these are negligible and will be ignored.) Productivity of the 
platesetter can then be calculated per Equation 15.1.
15.4  SPECIFIC PLATESETTER SYSTEMS
The following section will apply and discuss one specific CTP implementation of each 
of the architectures. In order to make reasonable comparisons, a platesetter resolution of 
500 cm−1 will be used (though many platesetters have variable resolutions) and for pro­
ductivity calculations the standard plate size will be 34.3 cm × 60 cm (a typical newspaper 
broadsheet).
15.4.1  Fuji Saber V8-HS (Fujifilm Graphic Systems) (Internal drum)4
Using two 60 milliwatt laser diodes (405 nm output, with each laser comprising a separate 
exposure head), this platesetter is aimed at offset printers (though not specifically news­
paper printers) and uses printing plates with dose requirements of 10−4 to 10−5 J/cm2 (see 
Table 15.1). The product brochure states that it has a scan rate of 60,000 rpm (S = 1000 s−1). 
Using Equation 15.9, the slow scan velocity is S/R = 2 cm/s for each head.
From the product brochure, the load time can be found by comparing the productivities 
at two different resolutions: 47 pph at 2400 in−1 and 70 pph at 1200 in−1 (for an undefined 
plate width). Combining Equations 15.1 and 15.2:

A reasonable assumption is that the plate handling is constant for both resolutions. 
Solving the two equations simultaneously and using Vslow = 2 cm/s, yields W = 106.5 cm 
and τ0 = 26.3 s.
Returning to our comparison, τexp = 34.3 cm/(2 cm/s) = 17.2 s, and using Equation 15.1 the 
productivity per head is determined:

Assuming that two exposure heads are employed and two plates are loaded per exposure 
cycle results in a productivity, X, of about 166 plates per hour.
The longest plate that can be exposed by this platesetter measures 960 mm in the fast 
scan direction. If the scan duty cycle, e, is assumed to be 50% (remember that the fast scan 
duty cycle for the internal drum architecture is small compared to both the external drum 
or the F-Theta scan systems), the area rate per head, from Equation 15.8, is as follows:

If we assume that 90% of the total source power reaches the plate (the lasers are directly

This agrees nicely with the dose requirements found in Table 15.1 for offset plates that are

15.4.2  Kodak Generation News (Eastman Kodak Company) (External Drum)
The Generation News platesetter is aimed at thermal offset newspaper plates. Kodak’s 
Thermal News Gold offset printing plates have a sensitivity of about 0.1 J/cm2 for the near 
IR spectrum. The Generation News has two exposing heads and employs a diode bar emit­
ting at 830 nm in each head.
The product brochure (Kodak Generation News System Brochure)5 reports a produc­
tivity of 300 pph for 34.3-cm-wide plates and 140 pph for 89-cm-wide plates (the Z option 
figures). For the narrower plates, each head exposes one plate, so that there are 300/2 = 150 
exposing cycles per hour. Equation 15.1 yields:

If we assume that τ0 and Vslow are the same for both scenarios (using the same plate sensitiv­
ity and same plate handling system), we can solve simultaneous equations by substituting 
W/Vslow for τexp where W is the distance each head travels. This results in Vslow = 5.95 cm/s, 
τexp = 5.76 s and τ0 = 18.2 s. (Note that the plate handling is the dominant factor in the pla­
tesetter’s productivity.)

The product of NS is in units of channels/s and this value implies either a great number of 
channels or a very high drum speed. The Generation News (Z) actually uses 224 channels/
head which results in a drum rotation rate of approximately 13.3 revolutions/s.2
To find the laser power required per head, the area scan rate must first be found. 
Remember that the drum circumference can be tuned to maximize the fast scan duty 
cycle—the only nonimaging space on the drum is the mechanism required for mounting 
the plate on the drum. For a maximum plate length of 66 cm, a reasonably assumed 2 cm 
for the required plate mounting mechanism results in a fast scan duty cycle of 97%. Using 
Equations 15.8 and 15.9:

Substituting this into Equation 15.3 and using a dose requirement of 0.1 J/cm2, one finds 
that about 40 W per head must be delivered to the plate to expose the Thermal News Gold 
plates.
15.4.3  MacDermid Flexo Platesetter (F-Theta Scanner)
MacDermid’s Flexo Platesetter is aimed at newspapers using flexographic printing plates. 
These plates have a relatively thick layer of photopolymer (ranging from 0.25 to 0.40 mm 
in thickness) on a relatively thin (~0.17 mm) steel substrate. (The flexographic process uses 
raised areas on the plate to provide contrast between print and nonprint areas when ink 
is applied to the plate.) Because the uncured photopolymer layer is soft and the cut edges 
of the plate are slightly tacky, automatic plate handling is quite challenging—this factor 
pushed the design toward a flatbed implementation of CTP. The MacDermid platesetter 
employs a high power, quasi-continuous wave (modelocked) frequency tripled vanadate 
laser, emitting at 355 nm.
With a required dose of approximately 0.030 J/cm2, and 8 W of laser power in the UV (the 
highest power available at the time the machine was introduced), the process is photon 
limited (i.e., the productivity of the machine is limited not by mechanics of the exposure 
process but by the UV power available.) There are approximately 50 optical surfaces and 
the system employs an acousto-optic modulator. This results in a total optical transmission 
of about 50% and Equation 15.3 yields an area rate of A′ = 133 cm2/s.
The polygon has twelve facets and a fast scan duty cycle of approximately 85%. Using 
four channels to expose, Equation 15.8 yields a scan rate of:

The time to expose a plate (Equation 15.2) is calculated to be τexp=18.2 s and with a plate 
handling time of τ0 ~ 15 s, machine productivity, X, is calculated to be about 109 plates per 
hour.
MacDermid has found that the relatively dirty newspaper environment presents a 
significant challenge in keeping optics clean. With peak UV intensities of approxi­
mately 50 MW/cm2, purging the optics assembly with clean, dry air has proven use­
ful in reducing required maintenance and extending the life of expensive optical 
components.
15.4.4  BasysPrint Series 6 Platesetters (Punch Graphix International)6
Most of BasysPrint’s platesetters are aimed at offset printers, though flexographic news­
printers have also installed some of these machines. Assuming the exposure of a high-speed 
conventional offset plate, the required “light time” and source power will be calculated. 
For the productivity calculations, the product brochure does not provide enough informa­
tion to determine the plate handling time, so for the sake of our comparison, we’ll assume 
a plate handling time of 15 s.
From the product brochure, the platesetter productivity is 60 plates per hour for a plate 
measuring 60.5 cm × 74.5 cm. To be able to make a comparison with the other platesetters 
using a plate size of 34.3 cm × 60 cm, the required Vfast must be determined. Equation 15.1 
allows a calculation of τexp:

Assuming that the plate is oriented with the 74.5-cm dimension in the fast scan direction

15.5  SUMMARY
When one examines the equations that describe the CTP process it becomes evident that any 
of the architectures are adequate for the exposure of photosensitive printing plates. In most 
cases, the different platesetter architectures were developed because of specific require­
ments of the exposure media and the available source powers. The principle of keeping sys­
tems as simple as possible continues to rule, particularly when customer budgets are tight.
If one used a decision tree to choose successful CTP architectures one would probably 
end up on an External Drum branch. The External Drum architecture has a relatively sim­
ple optical design, with flexibility of choice both in the number of channels and the optical 
sources that can be used. As a result, one finds it in the widest variety of platesetters, from 
those exposing UV offset plates to those engraving thick flexographic printing plates with 
infrared wavelengths (10.6 microns).
By comparison, the Internal Drum format is simple, but is limited by the number of 
channels that can be used and requires the use of a laser with high beam quality that is 
used quite inefficiently. This tends to limit the use of the internal drum to low-power, low-
dose applications as is found with exposure of 405 nm or 532 nm offset plates.
The F-Theta architecture tends to compete with the External Drum in printing plants 
where peak productivity is valued. Plate handling automation is easiest with this architec­
ture, but because the source has to be a relatively high-quality laser beam, the architecture 
lends itself to low-power, low-dose applications. Both offset (sensitive at 355 nm, 405 nm, 
and 532 nm) and flexographic plates (sensitive at 355 nm) are exposed using this architec­
ture. The cost of a high quality F-Theta objective is a significant hurdle to its wider accep­
tance in these markets.
BasysPrint’s architecture finds its niche with printers desiring to expose lower cost 
media that has historically been exposed in vacuum frames through film negatives. The 
novel use of the Texas Instrument’s DMD with either an arc lamp or semiconductor laser 
array as optical source enables this type of exposure. BasysPrint platesetters have also 
found application in flexographic newspaper plants.

16.1  INTRODUCTION
The ability to observe objects underwater has been of great interest historically and many 
accounts exist in the quest to see “what lies beneath the surface of the sea.” Unfortunately, 
the physical processes of absorption and scattering from water molecules and suspended 
particulates hinder the ability to see at great distances, and mandate the use of specialized 
image formation techniques to extend or even make practical the use of underwater opti­
cal imaging systems.
Undersea imaging systems are classified primarily in two categories: conventional and 
advanced. Conventional systems utilize either ambient or artificial lighting and a film or 
video camera. Advanced systems typically require specialized lighting, for example a laser, 
and some method for eliminating light that is primarily scattered within the medium and 
not returned from the object of interest in the illuminated field of view. Film cameras, CCD

cameras strobe lights, arc lights, and, more recently, HDTV cameras with LED lighting con­
stitute conventional imaging systems. Advanced imaging system architectures have been pro­
posed long before the advent of practical laser systems, and have been implemented using a 
variety of geometric configurations to mitigate the effects of scattering and absorption.
Conventional camera systems using adjacent broad spectrum light sources for illumina­
tion are useful for imaging surfaces at imager to target distances of one to two beam atten­
uation lengths. An attenuation length is the distance light must travel to be reduced to 
1/e of its original intensity. It is typically 20 to 30 m in clear oceanic water, and can be less 
than 1 m in turbid coastal waters. It has been found that at imager to target distances of 
about three attenuation lengths, acceptable imaging can be provided by spatially separat­
ing the light source from the camera, that is, by using a flood light to illuminate the target 
region. However, as the scattering coefficient increases, the level of common volume scat­
ter increases, and this creates a loss of signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), contrast and resolution 
ultimately leading to a contrast-limited image.
Advanced imaging systems concepts using laser sources typically provide imaging at 
distances greater than three attenuation lengths. These extended range imagers are gen­
erally of two classes: the synchronous laser line scanner (LLS) class and the laser range 
gated (LRG) class.
Synchronous LLS is a serial imaging system that provides scanning capability over wide 
swath (up to 70°) usually with a continuous wave (CW) laser source which is continually 
tracked on the target over a scan line by a narrow instantaneous field of view (IFOV) single 
element detector (shown in the left hand side diagram in Figure 16.1) in order to reduce the 
common scattering volume. Based on results of controlled experimentation and analyti­
cal modeling, synchronous scanners have been found capable of operation at maximum 
distances greater than five attenuation lengths, believed to reach a limit due to shot noise 
from multiple near-field backscatter in turbid waters, whilst becoming forward scatter 
limited in clearer water.1–3 Such imagers have been under continued development for use 
aboard undersea vehicles, including towed bodies, manned submersibles, Autonomous 
Underwater Vehicles (AUVs) and Remotely Operated Underwater Vehicles (ROVs) to pro­
vide imagery for characterizing the sea floor for varied activities including military mis­
sions, scientific benthic survey, and inspection of oil and gas infrastructures (Figure 16.1).
Further improvement in imaging range benefits undersea operations by allowing 
increased vehicle speed and maneuverability and improved image resolution at greater

distances from target regions. The ability to more rapidly and reliably produce higher 
resolution images of targets and survey sites from greater distances will enable a more 
extensive and diverse set of applications for underwater vehicles. Depending on the size 
and complexity of surfaces in the target region, optical sensing may be the only effective 
means for characterizing features.
By way of example, in the exploration of unknown or dynamic environments, rapid 
topographical seabed variations can occur at rates greater than the vertical axis per­
formance of the AUV. It is therefore necessary to “fly” the vehicle at a sufficient range 
above the seabed to avoid potentially catastrophic collisions. Consequently, the design of 
underwater optical scanning systems must accommodate varying distances to the object 
plane.
It has also been shown by both simulation and experimentation that the class of laser 
range-gated (LRG) imagers (shown in the right-hand side diagram of Figure 16.1), that is, 
those imagers utilizing a pulsed laser source, are also capable of adequate underwater 
performance for imaging target regions at distances greater than five attenuation lengths, 
albeit through a narrower total swath than LLS. These systems minimize introduction of 
energy due to scattered light with divergent laser pulses synchronized with gated intensi­
fied cameras.4–7 One advantage of this approach over LLS is that it is not necessary to per­
form along-track image registration, since the entire FOV is imaged concurrently.
There have also been demonstrated efforts which utilize synchronous scanning with 
high repetition rate pulsed sources and single element gated detectors.2,8 Although these 
imagers ultimately become limited due to forward scatter between the source and the 
target, as well as return path attenuation, they can be more compact than CW LLS systems 
because a spatial offset between the source and receiver is not required to reject scattered 
light.
Summarily, both classes of extended range underwater imagers are hindered in per­
formance by the point spread and attenuation of the medium, as the laser beam travels 
from the source to the target region with only a small portion returning to the detector. 
Scattering and attenuation cause losses in contrast, resolution and SNR. These losses are 
particularly problematic at and near the range limit of operation.
As a consequence of the requirement to minimize the common scattering volume 
LLS system designs have a relatively small depth of field (DOF), typically no more than 
a few meters. This is particularly problematic when imaging in a dynamic undersea 
environment in which there is significant variation of optical transmission properties, 
seabed surface features or in which there is significant variation in platform altitude 
or attitude. Commonly, these factors can lead to unacceptable degradation in image 
quality or complete signal loss. As shown in Figure 16.2 the DOF is a function of the

source–receiver separation distance, the optical path length to and from the target 
(stand-off distance), beam divergence, and the acceptance angle of the receiver. Figure 
16.3 shows how the receiving aperture of the LLS system may be widened to improve 
DOF. Alternately, a fine adjustment of the optical focus may be slaved in accord with an 
on-board altimeter.
The optical resolution achievable with a LLS system is dependent on the laser beam 
diameter at the reflecting surface in the target region, and is also dependent upon the 
precision with which the receiver can resolve intensity information from the return sig­
nal as a function of the scan angle. Minimizing the IFOV, for example, by minimizing 
the receiver spot size at the target, reduces the scattering volume, which can improve 
the SNR. That is, the imaging range of the system can be improved by reducing the size 
of the scattering volume, albeit with a reduction in DOF. This is shown conceptually in 
Figure 16.3.
Reducing the IFOV reduces the target area per pixel, commonly measured in cm2 per 
pixel and, theoretically, improves image resolution. This is particularly desirable when 
imaging target surfaces having a high spatial frequency, as the combined effects of 
forward scattering and blurring, due to the limited DOF, further limit the achievable 
resolution.
The sections that follow describe the optical principles of two different synchronous 
LLSs. The first system, the concept of which was originally patented in 1973.9 has been 
used since the early 1990s in various packages.3,10 The model used in the raytrace anal­
yses in Section 16.3 uses a source–receiver separation of 40 cm. The second system has a 
smaller source–receiver separation (23 cm) and was developed to bench test alternate sys­
tem configurations of laser line scan that utilize pulsed and modulated-pulse laser sources 
which are believed to offer significant potential performance improvements over existing 
systems. The chapter is organized as follows. Section 16.2 provides a brief historical back­
ground to the development of laser line scan underwater imaging apparatus.
Section 16.3 introduces the optical design principals of two alternate types of laser 
line scan.
Section 16.4 continues a detailed technical discussion by exploring requirements for 
field-stop apertures in the focal plane to both maintain wide-swath operation and accom­
modate changes in focal distance.
Section 16.5 presents some recent test tank results generated with one of the featured 
synchronous line scanners to investigate performance trade-offs with alternate system 
parameters.

swath extended range undersea laser imaging systems, together with a brief description of 
future possibilities.
16.2  LLS SCANNING SYSTEM HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT
Although originally conceived in the early 1970s11 synchronous laser line scan system 
development began in the 1980s and early 1990s with a series of Navy R&D contracts. 
Scientists from private contracting firms in the San Diego area were involved in the early 
phases of development, including Spectrum Engineering Incorporated (SEI). In 1988, SEI 
began development of the dual pyramidal polygon system designed as an underwater 
imaging tool, which achieved significant advancements in operational range, field of view, 
and image quality over conventional imaging systems. During the early 1990s several 
proof of concept tests were conducted in the field. In tests off San Diego the towed system 
imaged a sunken WWII torpedo bomber in a “shoot-off” with another laser system known 
as Wide Area Imaging System (WAIS) as well as several other state-of-the-art intensified 
camera systems. Commercially oriented tests were also conducted in March 1993 at British 
Gas Subsea Engineering Centre in Blyth, England in static and towed performance tests 
in a large test tank in a comparison with SIT, ISIT, and other CCD cameras.12 The perfor­
mance of the LSS was clearly superior to the other state-of-the-art imaging systems in this 
application, and the system was further developed to address a commercial market using 
an embedded microprocessor control and automated control functions. The commercial 
system was delivered in October 1992 and was known as the SM 2000. The system was 
housed in a pressure vessel 80 in long, 11 in in diameter and required 5 kW of power. Over 
the years it has been used with some success for a variety of habitat survey operations10,13,14 
and has also been utilized by the Navy for object identification purposes.
Another laser imaging device emerged from Navy contracts into commercial availabil­
ity at this time. SPARTA, a high technology company with a laser systems laboratory in 
San Diego developed a range-gated laser imaging device.5,6 The system was tested by the 
Coastal Systems Station in a head-to-head comparison with the LLS system with disap­
pointing results, which may have limited its use by the Navy.3
In 2001, the Office of Naval Research sponsored an assessment of competing electro-
optic identification (EOID) sensors.15 In this assessment, a streak tube imaging lidar (STIL) 
and two LLS systems were mounted in a tow vehicle along with a suite of environmental 
sensors. As well as providing the opportunity to assess system performance in challeng­
ing environmental conditions, these exercises created a wealth of image data that was use­
ful for performance prediction model validation.
For almost two decades LLS has widely been regarded as the optimal method for acquir­
ing optical identification-quality imagery of the underwater environment. However, there 
was clearly a need to research performance improvements and to validate modeling and 
performance prediction software used by the Navy. In 2006 a dedicated underwater LLS 
test laboratory was built at Harbor Branch Oceanographic Institution (Fort Pierce, FL), now 
a campus of Florida Atlantic University. A more compact benchtop LLS system was devel­
oped in collaboration with Lincoln Laser (Phoenix, AZ), and the details of this system will 
also be covered in the sections that follow.

16.3  OPTICAL DESIGN PRINCIPALS FOR 
UNDERWATER LLS IMAGING SYSTEMS
16.3.1  Dual Pyramidal Line Scanner
The first design being considered is based on the original LLS, which, as described in 
Section 16.2, has been implemented in a cylindrical housing and used on various plat­
forms for a range of seabed imaging tasks. It consists of two pyramidal polygons driven 
by a single shaft motor, as shown in Figure 16.4.
The laser beam is reflected by each facet of the rotatable polygon toward the target 
region and a portion of the returning flux is reflected by a second larger rotatable polygon 
toward the detector, which usually consists of a collection lens, field-stop aperture and 
a photomultiplier tube (PMT). The two pyramidal mirror assemblies are synchronously 
coupled along a common axis about which they are each symmetrically aligned. The com­
mon axis is coincident with shafts coupling each assembly to a scan motor system that 
rotates both the assemblies. The pyramidal polygon mirrors have four plane mirror faces 
or facets which are triangular and which each extends to an apex. As the assembly rotates, 
the beam incident on a mirror face is reflected at a variable angle that generates a scanning 
line in space. Thus, for each revolution of the first assembly, four scan cycles are generated, 
each over a 90° maximum scan angle. The system typically uses the downward 70° of each 
scan line for imaging.
Reflections created in the target region by the scanning beam form the diffuse portion 
that is collected from scanning reflections across the rotating faces of the second larger 
FIGURE 16.4

pyramidal polygon mirror and condensing optics for input to the PMT. An aperture 
assembly resides at the focal point of the condenser lens to govern the angular extent of 
rays entering the PMT. The system of Figure 16.4 may include other common components 
such as cylindrical correction lenses in order to improve optical throughput.
A necessary characteristic to obtain high contrast images is minimal overlap of the illu­
mination light cone with the receiver IFOV prior to the target plane. Therefore, the receiver 
must maintain a restricted IFOV, and it is not uncommon to require something substan­
tially less than 5 mrad. In addition, the collection aperture must be large enough to collect 
sufficient number of photons to extend the range limit of the system. Since the number of 
photons collected is proportional to the square of the incident aperture diameter, a typical 
practical aperture may be on the order of 50-mm diameter or more. The mirrors required 
by the scanner must therefore be relatively large, and contribute to the overall size require­
ments of the deployed system.
One characteristic of this system is that the curvatures of the output scan field of the 
transmit polygon and the receive polygon scan field are in the opposite direction. This can 
require an undesirably large receiver IFOV in order to capture the reflected laser light as 
it scans across the receive polygon and is reflected back to the PMT. It can also lead to the 
collected irradiance spot walking over the focal plane of the collection lens and the sensi­
tive area of the PMT, thus requiring a complex aperture assembly and PMT with a large 
photocathode, respectively.
However, this design is well suited for packaging in cylindrically shaped hous­
ings, which are typically tolerant to high ambient pressure and characteristic for some 
towed bodies and AUVs. In operation, a scan line is developed cross track to the 
vehicle motion, with the second scan axis being provided by the forward platform 
motion.
Due to the two-dimensional image being formed through forward motion of the vehicle, 
the scan rate must be sufficient to scan a large angular field before the vehicle advances 
too far compared to the along-track resolution requirement ∆x. Vehicle maximum speeds, 
dx/dt are typically several meters per second, so that scan rates of hundreds of lines per 
second are required. An example calculation for a forward speed of 2 m/s and 1 cm reso­
lution yields:

These rates are easily achievable, and clearly, even higher resolution is possible

However, in practice higher sampling is used to allow for better resolution, and also to 
facilitate sample integration to improve SNR when necessary.
Typically, the postdetection optics is comprised of a telecentric collection system, where 
the angular acceptance angle is determined by the focal length of the system and a con­
trollable aperture of diameter d. Ideally, the scanner should allow the collection system to 
operate with a fixed aperture, implying that the angular deviation of the collected photon 
bundle be constant regardless of scan angle or distance to the object plane. For a fixed 
aperture D, the instantaneous angular aperture 𝛿 would be given according to:

However, due to the known scan deviations with this design, the collected irradiance max­
imum will move with both scan angle and target distance variations. This effect will be 
examined in Section. 16.4.
16.3.2  Single Hexagonal Polygon Line Scanner
The second design to be considered consists of a single hexagonal polygon, which uses 
two symmetrical steering mirrors to adjust for changes in target distance (shown in 
Figure 16.5). It was designed, fabricated, and tested collaboratively between Harbor Branch 
Oceanographic Institute at Florida Atlantic University (Fort Pierce, FL) and Lincoln Laser 
(Phoenix, AZ). The broad design requirement was the need for a wide-swath scanner that 
is compatible with a small active area detector through various target distances.
This scanner system uses a hexagonal shaped polygon and two symmetrical steering 
mirror assemblies (also shown in Figure 16.9) to synchronize the laser beam transmit path 
with the return path to the PMT through an entire line scan. When one facet is positioned 
to direct the laser beam along the transmit path, another facet is positioned to reflect radia­
tion along the detector signal path toward the telecentric collection optics and field-stop 
aperture which govern the receiver IFOV. The steering mirrors remain symmetrical about 

Synchronous Laser Line Scanners for Undersea Imaging Applications 
739
the center of the polygon axis, and only require adjustment to focus at a different target 
plane. The polygon assembly is coupled to a motor drive system for rotation at steady state 
speeds in the range of 1000 to 4000 rpm, although higher or lower rotational speeds may be 
selected based on required performance criteria, within the prevailing environmental and 
operational conditions. Rotation of the polygon transforms the transmitted beam from a 
static path into an outgoing scanning path. This rotation simultaneously transforms the 
static narrow IFOV receiver into a scanning narrow IFOV receiver, synchronized with the 
laser beam at the target plane through the entire line scan. Lines are scanned through a 
maximum of 120° from each polygon facet, limited by the length of the steering mirrors to 
utilize 70° around the nadir. This scan architecture was conceived to substantially reduce 
the scan deviations inherent in the previously developed systems, making it possible to 
use a simple aperture and small active area detector.
The outgoing steering optics comprises lower and upper steering mirrors, positioned 
orthogonally to reflect and thereby direct the scanning portion of the laser beam toward 
the target plane, as shown in Figure 16.9. The incoming steering optics comprises lower 
and upper steering mirrors, also positioned orthogonally to reflect and thereby direct the 
scanning portion of the return path from the same target region toward the polygon facet 
producing a reflection on a static path toward the PMT.
The prototype was tested with a wedged plane port interface into a test tank thereby 
limiting the total effective scan angle to be less than 70°. Imaging results using this scanner 
design are presented in Section 16.4.
16.3.3  Summary
Two alternate wide scan angle line scanner designs have been presented to illustrate 
different performance characteristics. Both systems have a collection area of approxi­
mately 20 cm2, corresponding to the area of one polygon facet, to collect enough light for 
FIGURE 16.5

image formation at extended ranges. The transmit and receive optical paths have been 
explained for each system up to the collection lens, and the theory by which each design 
has the potential to achieve synchronous scanning and reflected light collection over 
a wide total scan angle of up to 70° has been given. A key distinction between the two 
systems is that the hexagonal polygon system has the ability to adjust the focus distance 
at the incident aperture of the receiver path via steering mirrors, whereas the pyramidal 
polygon system uses a more sophisticated aperture assembly at the focal point of the 
collection optics.
The next section uses results from raytrace simulations of the two designs to examine the 
distribution of irradiance at the collection lens focal plane through a complete scan line. 
Furthermore the effect of variations in target distance is also simulated and the required

The primary optical requirement of both line scanner imagers for use in scattering-domi­
nant waters, is to provide a narrow IFOV which is spatially synchronous at the target plane 
with the laser beam illumination, over a wide scan angle of up to 70°. This section uses 
optical raytrace simulation results using Lambda Research TracePro® to examine the spa­
tial characteristics of the irradiance spot at the focal plane of the collection lens. Deviation 
of the collected irradiance spot due to changes in stand-off distance is also studied to 
examine the implications of the limited DOF of these designs to realistic environmental 
conditions. This information is critical to understanding the aperture design of the alter­
nate systems to meet the primary optical requirements. Two key attributes of both scan­
ning designs are analyzed:
	
1.	The position in the focal plane of received light as a function of the scan position
	
2.	The position in the focal plane of received light as a function of the stand-off dis­
tance between the imager and the target
Simulated irradiance profiles at the focal plane of the collection lens were produced for 
five optical scan angles (−35°, −20°, 0°, +20°, +35°) at three stand-off distances (5.2 m, 7.2 m, 
and 9.2 m).
16.4.1  Dual Pyramidal Polygon Line Scanner
A model for the dual pyramidal polygon line scanner was created which has a source–
receiver path separation of 40 cm to be consistent with the existing systems. To improve 
ray collection efficiency the target was modeled as the inside surface of a cylinder having 
a radius of curvature equivalent to the target distance (in this case 7.2 m) centered on the 
scan output. The collected ray bundles were aligned at the center of the focal plane disk 
for the 7.2-m stand-off distance case. For the simulated cases at 5.2 m and 9.2 m, the target 
curvature was changed accordingly.
The model is shown in Figure 16.6 for nadir (0°) case as well as +35°. It can be seen that 
an additional aperture was used prior to the collection lens as a stop for stray light for the 
purpose of this study. In the implemented system the angular aperture is limited by a 
field-stop aperture in the focal plane.

A summary of the raytrace results for the dual pyramidal polygon LLS is shown in 
Figure 16.7.
It can be seen from Figure 16.7 and the composite overlaid images of Figure 16.8 that the 
collected target irradiance walks across the face of the focal plane disk due to both the scan 
angle variations (cross-track walk-off of almost 2.5 mm for 5.2 m case, shown in the verti­
cal axes of the plots in Figures 16.7 and 16.8) and changes in target stand-off distance (more 
than 1.5-mm along-track walk-off between 5.2 m and 9.2 m cases, shown in the horizontal

needs to accommodate these deviations.
16.4.2  Single Hexagonal Polygon Line Scanner
A model for the single hexagonal polygon line scanner was created which has a source–
receiver separation of 25 cm to be consistent with the fabricated prototype. Again to 
improve ray collection efficiency the target was modeled as the inside surface of a cylinder 
having a radius of curvature equivalent to the target distance (in this case 7.2 m) centered 
at the polygon center of rotation. For the cases at 5.2 m and 9.2 m the target curvature was 
changed accordingly. The collected ray bundles were aligned at the center of the focal 
plane disk for the 7.2-m stand-off distance case, and for the results in Figures 16.10 and 
16.11, the steering mirror pair were aligned symmetrically at a focal distance of 7.2 m. The 
model is shown in Figure 16.9 for nadir case, as well as +35°. It can be seen that an addi­
tional aperture was used prior to the collection lens to limit the collection angle for the 
purpose of this study. In the implemented system this function is provided by the pinhole 
aperture residing at the focal plane.
A summary of the raytrace results for the single hexagonal polygon LLS is shown in 
Figure 16.10.
It can be seen from Figure 16.10 and the composite overlaid image of Figure 16.11 that 
the collected target irradiance walks minimally across the face of the focal plane disk due 
to scan angle variations (cross-axis walk-off of <0.5 mm, shown in the vertical axes of the 
plots in Figures 16.10 and 16.11) and the changes in target stand-off distance (along-track 
walk-off >1 mm between 5.2-m and 9.2-m cases, shown in the horizontal axes of the plots 
in Figures 16.10 and 11).
However, for the 5.2-m and 9.2-m target distance cases, the offset in the received irradi­
ance can be nulled by refocusing the steering mirror pair at the focal distance. Figure 16.12 
shows the effect of making steering mirror adjustments for the 5.2-m and 9.2-m cases; it is 
clear that the along-track walk-off has virtually been eliminated.
16.4.3  Discussion
Raytrace analysis of the two alternative line scanner designs highlights differences in 
aperture field-stop design to meet the optical performance requirements. More specifi­
cally, the results from the dual pyramidal polygon model indicate several second order 
requirements to achieve the desired level of performance. These include the need for a 
synchronous positioning of the aperture that defines the acceptance angle 𝛿.  This can be

seen in Figures 16.7 and 16.8, where the focused ray bundle can be seen to deviate as a 
function of scan angle. The implemented system mitigates the cross-track deviation by uti­
lizing a spinning aperture that is synchronized with the polygon scan motor to maintain 
a narrow cross-track IFOV through the entire scan line. To accommodate the along-track 
walk-off due to changes in stand-off distance, the implemented system also includes a

fixed aperture which can be set with knowledge of the desired upper imaging range and 
lower imaging range. A short distance behind this aperture assembly resides the photo­
detector, which is usually a PMT. The PMT needs to have a photosensitive region large 
enough to accommodate the two axes of walk-off in the collected irradiance profile, whilst 
being illuminated by an adequately large spot to avoid space-charge limitations. However, 
having a profile suited to a cylindrical housing, this class of LLS has major advantages in 
packaging for at-sea use. It has been used extensively for more than 2 decades and is the 
only known underwater synchronous scanning imager in operational use.
The results from the single hexagonal polygon model with adjustable steering mirrors 
have some advantages in reducing the complexity of aperture necessary to meet optical 
performance requirements. By means of both transmit and receive paths reflecting from 
a single polygon in alignment with the symmetrical steering mirrors, it provides parallel 
beam entry and exit axes at a selectable stand-off distance. This permits the use of a static 
pinhole aperture at the focal plane and allows for a smaller active area PMT placed behind 
the aperture. The purpose of the system was to experimentally investigate LLS performance 
trade-offs and to experimentally validate radiative transfer performance prediction models 
for the LLS class of underwater imager in highly controlled conditions at the Harbor Branch 
laser test facility. Ongoing use of this scanner involves bench testing future generation LLS 
system architectures that use pulsed and modulated-pulsed sources with gated PMTs. In 
general, high-speed PMTs needed for these studies have small photocathodes (<8 mm) so 
the receive path characteristics make the scanner suitable for such studies.
The next section summarizes some sets of test tank LLS imaging results performed with 
the single hexagonal polygon scanner to experimentally investigate performance trade-
offs in both the choice of system geometrical parameters, and the use of alternate illumina­
tion and detection schemes. A description of these experiments, including test hardware 
details and image quality analysis results are given in Dalgleish et al. (2009).2

16.5  TEST TANK EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS USING SINGLE 
HEXAGONAL POLYGON LINE SCANNER
Experiments were conducted using the benchtop hexagonal polygon line scanner in the 
Harbor Branch laser imaging test facility at realistic stand-off distances in a variety of turbid­
ity conditions ranging from very clear conditions to greater than seven attenuation lengths. 
Data were collected at 7-m stand-off distance (Z) for all imaging configurations presented 
here. The turbidity of the water in the tank was adjusted by adding a mixture of 50% labora­
tory grade magnesium hydroxide particles and 50% laboratory grade aluminum hydroxide 
particles. The resultant beam attenuation coefficient (c) and absorption coefficient (a) at 532 nm 
were measured with a Wetlabs ac-9 transmissometer. To allow for two-dimensional image 
formation, along-track motion between scanner and target was generated by mounting the 
target (1.2 m by 1.0 m dimensions) on a large rotating underwater drum (4 m circumference, 
2 m length). Image data was collected with the line scanner configured with a 532-nm diode 
pumped solid state CW laser (maximum power 3 W) and continuous gain PMT. Using an 
adjustable pinhole iris as the field-stop aperture, the receiver IFOV was adjusted for each tur­
bidity to vary both the common volume scattering volume and DOF. Image results from these 
tests, showing the effect of increased IFOV on image contrast are shown in Figure 16.13.
For the next sequence of images presented (shown in Figure 16.14), the line scanner was 
configured with a pulsed laser source and gated PMT. The laser source was a custom high 
repetition rate green (532 nm) pulsed laser was developed by Q-Peak (Bedford, MA). This 
solid state amplified master oscillator Q-switched YAG laser produced 7-ns FWHM green 
pulses at a fixed pulse repetition rate of 357 KHz. The average power entering the water 
was 1.3 W (4.6-µJ average pulse energy) with pulse-to-pulse energy instability of up to 
40%. The pulse-to-pulse timing jitter was typically 10–20 ns. A small portion of the out­
put was sampled by a reference detector and was used as a pulse monitor, both to trigger 
the receiver gate electronics and for normalization of pulse-to-pulse energy variations in 
acquired images. Correct alignment was verified, and the turbidity cycling and image 
acquisition sequence was repeated. System parameters (equal energy per pixel entering 
the water and far field beam divergence of 2 mrad for each laser) were adjusted to allow 
for a fair comparison with the CW LLS system images.
Despite obvious laser noise in the pulsed-gated LLS image set, the results in Figure 16.14 
demonstrate that a significant contrast improvement is possible with pulsed-gated LLS. 
This is due to the ability of the gated-PMT to temporally reject the first 40 ns of backscatter 
from the emitted pulses, which contains no target information. The imaging performance 
of the CW LLS was limited mainly by multiple backscatter and shot noise generated in 
the receiver, eventually reaching a complete contrast limit beyond six beam attenuation 
lengths. The pulsed-gated LLS did not become limited due to multiple backscatter, instead 
reaching a limit (believed to be primarily due to forward-scattered light overcoming the 
attenuated direct target signal) beyond seven beam attenuation lengths. This result dem­
onstrates the potential for a greater operational limit as compared to the existing CW LLS 
configurations. Furthermore, the pulsed-gated LLS does not require a significant source–
receiver separation to produce quality images, and hence allows for more compact, sim­
pler optical designs which have the potential to be more immune to changes in operating 
conditions, and hence more reliable than existing systems. Future advances in pulsed 
laser source technology should allow for these imagers to be suitably small for modern 
unmanned underwater platforms such as the man-portable AUVs.

16.6  CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE POSSIBILITIES
The line scanner designs discussed and analyzed in this chapter were both driven by the 
main optomechanical requirements for wide-swath extended range underwater viewing 
systems which are operable at variable stand-off distances. The ability to maintain syn­
chronous tracking between laser beam and detector IFOV at the target plane through the 
entire scan swath of 70° allows a significant reduction in the common scattering volume 
between laser and receiver, thus spatially rejecting both forward and back-scattered light. 
To increase collection of light from the target region, a large collector area is required; 
each described design typically uses a 20-cm2 collector area, defined by the area of a 
polygon facet.
The raytrace analysis of the two line scanner designs highlights differences in the 
required aperture field stop and consequently the minimum photosensitive region of

detector needed to meet the optical performance requirements. Perhaps the greatest differ­
ence between the two systems relates to dealing with variations in stand-off distance, and 
the implications at the focal plane where the field-stop aperture resides. The dual pyra­
midal polygon scanner, a mature system that has been operational for almost 2 decades, 
accommodates changes in stand-off distance at the focal plane via an adjustable field stop. 
Exhibiting significant along-track scan deviation, it consequently requires a large pho­
tosensitive region for detection. The hexagonal polygon scanner, a prototype system for 
benchtop experimentation of LLS alternatives, accommodates changes in stand-off dis­
tance via the use of symmetrical transmit and receive steering mirrors to direct the col­
lected irradiance with minimal deviation at the focal plane. This results in a system that is 
compatible with a simple pinhole field stop and small photosensitive region for detection. 
Results in Section 16.5 describe the use of this benchtop scanner to demonstrate the achiev­
able performance improvement of a pulsed-gated configuration of LLS over the existing 
CW LLS.

The design of the hexagonal polygon scanner was also motivated by the need to use a 
high bandwidth photodetector, which generally has small photosensitive regions. This 
is required for detection of pulsed or CW laser sources that use amplitude modulation, 
coupled with gating and coherent processing on the recovered waveforms. Such schemes, 
which are believed to offer measurable performance improvements over systems which 
use CW laser sources and possibly also over pulsed-gated LLS systems as described herein, 
have the additional potential for enhanced capabilities such as 3-D imaging and multiple-
platform imaging.
Future LLSs for undersea imaging applications need to be even more compact to be 
compatible with current and future classes of man-portable AUV. The use of pulsed or 
modulated-pulse laser sources together with gated receiver modules can allow for more 
compact configuration of the described systems. These future systems may also make use 
of alternate laser scanning technologies, such as the optical microelectromechanical sys­
tems (MEMS) class of devices, which in recent years have been emerging in more diverse 
applications. These systems may be configurable without the need for precise optical path 
synchronization, instead using more flexible digital control and synchronization tech­
niques and algorithms.
