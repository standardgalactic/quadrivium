Introducing Solar
Energy
Ninety-three million miles from
Earth, our sun is 333,000 times the
size of our planet. It has a diameter
of 865,000 miles, a surface
temperature of 5,600°C and a core
temperature of 15,000,000°C. It is a
huge mass of constant nuclear
activity.
Directly or indirectly, our sun
provides all the power we need to
exist and supports all life forms.
The sun drives our climate and our

weather. Without it, our world
would be a frozen wasteland of ice-
covered rock.
Solar electricity is a wonderful
concept. Taking power from the sun
and using it to power electrical
equipment is a terrific idea. There
are no ongoing electricity bills, no
reliance on a power socket: a free
and everlasting source of energy
that does not harm the planet!
Of course, the reality is a little
different from that. Yet generating
electricity from sunlight alone is a
powerful resource, with
applications and benefits throughout

the world.
But how does it work? For what is
it suitable? What are the
limitations? How much does it
cost? How do you install it? This
book answers all these questions
and shows you how to use the
power of the sun to generate
electricity yourself.
Along the way, I will also expose a
few myths about some of the wilder
claims made about solar energy and
I will show you where solar power
may only be part of the solution.
Although undoubtedly there are
some significant environmental

benefits of solar electricity, I will
also be talking about where its
environmental credentials have
been oversold.
I will keep the descriptions as
straightforward as possible. There
is some mathematics and science
involved. This is essential to allow
you to plan a solar electric
installation successfully. However,
none of it is complicated and there
are plenty of short-cuts to keep
things simple.
The book includes a number of
example projects to show how you
can use solar electricity. Some of

these are very straightforward, such
as providing electrical light for a
shed or garage, for example, or
fitting a solar panel to the roof of a
caravan or boat. Others are more
complicated, such as installing
photovoltaic solar panels to a
house.
I also show some rather more
unusual examples, such as the
possibilities for solar electric
motorbikes and cars. These are
examples of what can be achieved
using solar power alone, along with
a little ingenuity and determination.
I have used one main example

throughout the book: providing
solar-generated electricity for a
holiday home which does not have
access to an electricity supply from
the grid. I have created this example
to show the issues and pitfalls that
you may encounter along the way,
based on real life issues and
practical experience.
A website accompanies this book.
It has lots of useful information,
along with lists of suppliers and a
suite of online solar energy
calculators that will simplify the
cost analysis and design processes.

Who this book is aimed
at
If you simply want to gain an
understanding about how solar
electricity works then this handbook
will provide you with everything
you need to know.
If you are planning to install your
own stand-alone solar power
system, this handbook is a
comprehensive source of
information that will help you
understand solar and guide you in
the design and installation of your
own solar electric system.

Solar has a big application for
integrating into electrical products:
mobile phones, laptop computers,
portable radios. Even light electric
cars can use solar energy to provide
some or all of their power
requirements, depending on the
application. If you are a designer,
looking to see how you can
integrate solar into your product,
this book will give you a grounding
in the technology that you will need
to get you started.
If you are specifically looking to
install a grid-tie system, i.e. a solar
energy system that will feed

electricity back into your local
power grid, this book will provide
you with a good foundation and will
allow you to carry out the design of
your system. You will still need to
check the local planning laws and
any other local legislation
surrounding the installation of solar
energy systems, and you will have
to understand the building of
electrical systems. In some
countries, you specifically need to
be certified in order to carry out the
physical installation of a grid-tie
system.
If you are planning to install larger,
commercial–size systems, or if you

are hoping to install grid-tie solar
systems professionally, then this
book will serve as a good
introduction, but you will need to
grow your knowledge further. This
book gives you the foundations you
need in order to build this
knowledge, but there are special
skills required when designing and
implementing larger scale solar
systems that go far beyond what is
required for smaller systems and
are beyond the scope of this book.
If you are planning your own solar
installation, it will help if you have
some DIY skills. Whilst I include a

chapter that explains the basics of
electricity, a familiarity with wiring
is also of benefit for smaller
projects and you will require a
thorough understanding of electrical
systems if you are planning a larger
project such as powering a house
with solar.

The rapidly changing
world of solar energy
I wrote the first edition of this book
early in 2009. It is not a long time
ago. Yet this 2012 issue is the sixth
edition. In every edition, I have had
to rewrite significant sections of the
book and significantly update the
website in order to keep up with the
rapid pace of change.
The rapid improvement in the
technology and the freefall in costs
since early 2009 have transformed
the industry. Systems that were
completely unaffordable or
impractical just two or three years

ago are now cost-effective and
achievable.
Solar panels available today are
smaller, more robust and better
value for money than ever before.
For many more applications, solar
is now the most cost-effective way
to generate electricity.
Over the coming years, all the signs
are that the technology and the
industry will continue to evolve at a
similar pace. By 2015, solar will
be the cheapest form of electricity
generator, undercutting traditionally
low-cost electricity generators such
as coal-fired power stations. We

are likely to see solar energy
incorporated into more everyday
objects such as laptop computers,
mobile phones, backpacks and
clothing. Meanwhile, solar energy
is causing a revolution for large
areas of Asia and Africa, where
entire communities are now gaining
access to electricity for the first
time.
As an easy-to-use and low-carbon
energy generator, solar is without
equal. Its potential for changing the
way we think about energy in the
future is huge. For families and
businesses in rural African and
Asian villages, it is creating a

revolution.

Solar electricity and solar
heating
Solar electricity is produced from
sunlight shining on photovoltaic
solar panels. This is different to
solar hot water or solar heating
systems, where the power of the sun
is used to heat water or air.
Solar heating systems are beyond
the remit of this book. That said,
there is some useful information on
surveying and positioning your
solar panels later on that is relevant
to both solar photovoltaics and
solar heating systems.

If you are planning to use solar
power to generate heat, solar
heating systems are far more
efficient than solar electricity,
requiring far smaller panels to
generate the same amount of energy.
Solar electricity is often referred to
as photovoltaic solar, or PV solar.
This describes the way that
electricity is generated in a solar
panel.
For the purposes of this book,
whenever I refer to solar panels I
am talking about photovoltaic solar
panels for generating electricity,
and not solar heating systems.

The source of solar
power
Deep in the centre of the sun,
intense nuclear activity generates
huge amounts of radiation. In turn,
this radiation generates light energy
called photons. These photons have
no physical mass of their own, but
carry huge amounts of energy and
momentum.
Different photons carry different
wavelengths of light. Some photons
will carry non-visible light (infra-
red and ultra-violet), whilst others
will carry visible light (white
light).

Over time, these photons push out
from the centre of the sun. It can
take one million years for a photon
to push out to the surface from the
core. Once they reach the sun’s
surface, these photons rush through
space at a speed of 670 million
miles per hour. They reach earth in
around eight minutes.
On their journey from the sun to
earth, photons can collide with and
be deflected by other particles, and
are destroyed on contact with
anything that can absorb radiation,
generating heat. That is why you
feel warm on a sunny day: your

body is absorbing photons from the
sun.
Our atmosphere absorbs many of
these photons before they reach the
surface of the earth. That is one of
the two reasons that the sun feels so
much hotter in the middle of the
day. The sun is overhead and the
photons have to travel through a
thinner layer of atmosphere to reach
us, compared to the end of the day
when the sun is setting and the
photons have to travel through a
much thicker layer of atmosphere.
This is also one of the two reasons
why a sunny day in winter is so

much colder than a sunny day in
summer. In winter, when your
location on the earth is tilted away
from the sun, the photons have to
travel through a much thicker layer
of atmosphere to reach us.

(The other reason that the sun is
hotter during the middle of the day
than at the end is because the
intensity of photons is much higher

at midday. When the sun is low in
the sky, these photons are spread
over a greater distance simply by
the angle of your location on earth
relative to the sun.)

The principles of solar
electricity
A solar panel generates electricity
using the photovoltaic effect, a
phenomenon discovered in the early
19th century when scientists
observed that certain materials
produced an electric current when
exposed to light.
Two layers of a semi-conducting
material are combined to create this
effect. One layer has to have a
depleted number of electrons. When
exposed to sunlight, the layers of
material absorb the photons. This

excites the electrons, causing some
of them to ‘jump’ from one layer to
the other, generating an electrical
charge.
The semi-conducting material used
to build a solar cell is silicon, cut
into very thin wafers. Some of these
wafers are then ‘doped’ to
contaminate them, thereby creating
an electron imbalance in the wafers.
The wafers are then aligned
together to make a solar cell.
Conductive metal strips attached to
the cells take the electrical current.
When a photon hit the solar cell, it
can do one of three things: it can be

absorbed by the cell,  reflected off
the cell or pass straight through the
cell.
It is when a photon is absorbed by
the silicon that an electrical current
is generated. The more photons (i.e.
the greater intensity of light) that are
absorbed by the solar cell, the
greater the current generated.
Solar cells generate most of their
electricity from direct sunlight.
However, they also generate
electricity on cloudy days and some
systems can even generate very
small amounts of electricity on
bright moonlit nights.

Individual solar cells typically only
generate tiny amounts of electrical
energy. To make useful amounts of
electricity, these cells are
connected together to make a solar
module, otherwise known as a solar
panel or, to be more precise, a
photovoltaic module.

Understanding the
terminology
In this book, I use various terms
such as ‘solar electricity’, ‘solar
energy’ and ‘solar power’. Here is
what I mean when I am talking
about these terms:
Solar power is a general term for
generating power, whether heat or
electricity, from the power of the
sun.
Solar energy refers to the energy
generated from solar power,
whether electrical or as heat.
Solar electricity refers to

generating electrical power using
photovoltaic solar panels.
Solar heating refers to generating
hot water or warm air using solar
heating panels or ground-source
heat pumps.

Setting expectations for
solar electricity
Solar power is a useful way of
generating modest amounts of
electricity, so long as there is a
good amount of sunlight available
and your location is free from
obstacles such as trees and other
buildings that will shade the solar
panel from the sun.
Solar experts will tell you that solar
electricity is normally only
cost-effective where there is no
other source of electricity
available.

Whilst this is often the case, there
are plenty of exceptions to this rule.
Often solar electricity can be
extremely practical and can save
you money over the more traditional
alternatives. Some examples might
include:
·       Installing a light or a power
source somewhere where it is
tricky to get a standard
electricity supply, such as in
the garden, shed or remote
garage
·       Creating a reliable and
continuous power source
where the standard electricity

supply is unreliable because
of regular power cuts
·       Building a mobile power
source that you can take with
you, such as a power source
for use whilst camping,
working on outdoor DIY
projects or working on a
building site
·       Creating green energy for
your own use and selling
surplus energy production
back to the electricity
suppliers through a feed-in
tariff
The amount of energy you need to

generate has a direct bearing on the
size and cost of a solar electric
system. The more electricity you
need, the more difficult and more
expensive your system will
become.
If your requirements for solar
electricity are to run a few lights, to
run some relatively low-power
electrical equipment such as a
laptop computer, a small TV, a
compact fridge and a few other
small bits and pieces, then if you
have a suitable location you can
achieve what you want with solar.
On the other hand, if you want to

run high-power equipment such as
fan heaters, washing machines and
power tools, you are likely to find
that the costs will rapidly get out of
control.
As I mentioned earlier, solar
electricity is not well suited to
generating heat: heating rooms,
cooking and heating water all take
up significant amounts of energy.
Using electricity to generate this
heat is extremely inefficient. Instead
of using solar electricity to generate
heat, you should consider a solar
hot water heating system, and
heating and cooking with gas or
solid fuels.

It is possible to power the average
family home purely on solar
electricity without making any cuts
in your current electricity
consumption. However, it is not
cheap, and you will need a lot of
roof space to fit all the panels! It is
usually a good idea to carefully
evaluate your electricity usage and
make savings where you can before
you proceed.
Most households and businesses are
very inefficient with their electrical
usage. Spending some time first
identifying where electricity is
wasted and eliminating this waste is

an absolute necessity if you want to
implement solar electricity
cost-effectively.
This is especially true if you live in
cooler climates, such as Northern
Europe or Canada, where the
winter months produce much lower
levels of solar energy. In the United
Kingdom, for instance, the roof of
the average-sized home is not large
enough to hold all the solar panels
that would be required to provide
the electricity used by the average
household throughout the year. In
this instance, making energy savings
is essential.

For other applications, a solar
electric installation is much more
cost-effective. For instance, no
matter which country you live in,
providing electricity for a holiday
home is well within the capabilities
of a solar electric system, so long
as heating and cooking are catered
for using gas or solid fuels and the
site is in a sunny position with little
or no shade. In this scenario, a solar
electric system may be more
cost-effective than installing a
conventional electricity supply if
the house is off-grid and is not
close to a grid electricity
connection.

If your requirements are more
modest, such as providing light for
a lock-up garage, for example, there
are off-the-shelf packages to do this
for a very reasonable cost. Around
£70–£100 ($110–$160) will
provide you with a lighting system
for a shed or small garage, whilst
£200 ($300) will provide you with
a system big enough for lighting
large stables or a workshop.
This is far cheaper than installing a
conventional electricity supply into
a building, which can be expensive
even when a local supply is
available just outside the door.

Low-cost solar panels are also
ideal for charging up batteries in
caravans and recreational vehicles
or on boats, ensuring that the
batteries get a trickle charge
between trips and keeping the
batteries in tip-top condition whilst
the caravan or boat is not in use.

Why choose a solar
electric system?
There are a number of reasons to
consider installing a solar electric
system:
·       Where there is no other
source of electrical power
available, or where the cost
of installing conventional
electrical power is too high
·       Where other sources of
electrical power are not
reliable. For example, when
power cuts are an issue and a
solar system can act as a

cost-effective contingency
·       When a solar electric
system is the most convenient
and safest option. For
example, installing low
voltage solar lighting in a
garden or providing courtesy
lighting in a remote location
·       You can become entirely
self sufficient with your own
electrical power
·       Once installed, solar power
provides virtually free power
without damaging the
environment

Cost-justifying solar
Calculating the true cost of
installing a solar electric system
depends on various factors:
·       The power of the sun at
your location at different
times of the year
·       How much energy you need
to generate
·       How good your site is for
capturing sunlight
Compared to other power sources,
solar electric systems typically
have a comparatively high capital
cost, but a low ongoing maintenance

cost.
To create a comparison with
alternative power sources, you will
often need to calculate a payback of
costs over a period of a few years
in order to justify the initial cost of
a solar electric system.
On all but the simplest of
installations, you will need to carry
out a survey on your site and carry
out some of the design work before
you can ascertain the total cost of
installing a photovoltaic system. Do
not panic: this is not as frightening
as it sounds. It is not difficult and I
cover it in detail in later chapters.

We can then use this figure to put
together a cost-justification on your
project to compare with the
alternatives.

Solar power and wind
power
Wind turbines can be a good
alternative to solar power, but
probably achieve their best when
implemented together with a solar
system: a small wind turbine can
generate electricity in a breeze even
when the sun is not shining.
Small wind turbines do have some
disadvantages. Firstly, they are very
site-specific, requiring higher than
average wind speeds and minimal
turbulence. They must be higher
than surrounding buildings and
away from tall trees. If you live on

a windswept farm or close to the
coast, a wind turbine can work
well. If you live in a built-up area
or close to trees or main roads, you
will find a wind turbine unsuitable
for your needs.
Compared to the large wind
turbines used by the power
companies, small wind turbines are
not particularly efficient. If you are
planning to install a small wind
turbine in combination with a solar
electric system, a smaller wind
turbine that generates a few watts of
power at lower wind speeds is
usually better than a large wind

turbine that generates lots of power
at high wind speeds.

Fuel cells
Fuel cells can be a good way to
supplement solar energy, especially
for solar electric projects that
require additional power in the
winter months, when solar energy is
at a premium.
A fuel cell works like a generator.
It uses a fuel mixture such as
methanol, hydrogen or zinc to create
electricity.
Unlike a generator, a fuel cell
creates energy through chemical
reactions rather than through
burning fuel in a mechanical engine.
These chemical reactions are far

more carbon-efficient than a
generator.
Fuel cells are extremely quiet,
although rarely completely silent,
and produce water as their only
emission. This makes them suitable
for indoor use with little or no
ventilation.

Grid-tied solar electric
systems
Grid-tied solar electric systems
connect directly into the electricity
grid. When the sun is shining during
the day, excess electricity feeds into
the grid. During the evening and
night, when the solar panels are not
providing sufficient power,
electricity is taken from the grid as
required.
Grid-tied solar electric systems
effectively create a micro power
station. Electricity can be used by
other people as well as yourself. In
some countries, owners of grid-tied

solar electric systems receive
payment for each kilowatt of power
they sell to the electricity
providers.
Because a grid-tied solar electric
system becomes part of the utility
grid, the system will switch off in
the event of a power cut. It does this
to stop any current flowing back
into the grid, which could be fatal
for engineers repairing a fault.

Solar electricity and the
environment
Once installed, a solar electric
system is a low-carbon electricity
generator: the sunlight is free and
the system maintenance is extremely
low.
There is a carbon footprint
associated with the manufacture of
solar panels, and in the past this
footprint has been quite high,
mainly due to the relatively small
volumes of panels being
manufactured and the chemicals
required for the ‘doping’ of the
silicon in the panels.

Thanks to improved manufacturing
techniques and higher volumes, the
carbon footprint of solar panels is
now much lower. You can typically
offset the carbon footprint of
building the solar panels by the
energy generated within 2–5 years,
and some of the very latest
amorphous thin-film solar panels
can recoup their carbon footprint in
as little as six months.
Therefore, a solar electric system
that runs as a complete stand-alone
system can reduce your carbon
footprint, compared to taking the
same power from the grid.

Grid-tied solar systems are slightly
different in their environmental
benefit, and their environmental
payback varies quite dramatically
from region to region, depending on
a number of factors:
·       How grid electricity is
generated by the power
companies in your area (coal,
gas, nuclear, hydro, wind or
solar)
·       Whether or not your
electricity generation
coincides with the peak
electricity demand in your
area (such as air conditioning

usage in hot climates, or high
electrical usage by nearby
heavy industry)
It is therefore much more difficult to
put an accurate environmental
payback figure on grid-tied solar
systems.
It is undeniably true that some
people who have grid-tied solar
power actually make no difference
to the carbon footprint of their
home. In colder climates, the
majority of electricity consumption
is in the evenings and during the
winter. If you have grid-tie solar
but sell most of your energy to the

utility companies during the day in
the summer and then buy it back to
consume in the evenings and in the
winter, you are making little or no
difference to the overall carbon
footprint of your home. In effect,
you are selling your electricity
when there is a surplus and buying
it back when there is high demand
and all the power stations are
working at full load.
In warmer climates, solar energy
can make a difference. In a hot area,
peak energy consumption tends to
occur on sunny days as people try to
keep cool with air conditioning. In
this scenario, peak electricity

demand occurs at the same time as
peak energy production from a solar
array, and a grid-tie solar system
can be a perfect fit.
If you live in a colder climate, this
does not mean that there is no point
in installing a grid-tie solar system.
It does mean that you need to take a
good hard look at how and when
you consume electricity. Do not just
assume that because you can have
solar panels on the roof of your
house, you are automatically
helping the environment.
From an environmental perspective,
if you wish to get the very best out

of a grid-tie system, you should try
to achieve the following:
·       Use the power you generate
for yourself
·       Use solar energy for high
load applications such as
clothes washing
·       Reduce your own power
consumption from the grid
during times of peak demand
Environmental efficiency:
comparing supply and
demand
There is an online calculator that

will allow you to map your
electricity usage over a period of a
year and compare it with the amount
of sunlight available to your home.
Designed specifically for grid-tie
installations, this calculator allows
you to see how close a fit solar
energy is in terms of supply and
demand.
Whilst this online calculator is no
substitute for a detailed electrical
usage survey and research into the
exact source of the electricity
supplied to you at your location, it
will give you a good indication of
the likely environmental
performance of a solar energy

system.
To use this online calculator, you
will need to collate information
about your electricity usage for
each month of the year. You will
usually find this information on your
electricity bill or by contacting your
electricity provider. Then visit
www.SolarElectricityHandbook.com
follow the links to the Grid-Tie
Solar Calculator in the Online
Calculators section and fill in the
online questionnaire.

A Brief Introduction
to Electricity
Before we can start playing with
solar power, we need to talk about
electricity. To be more precise, we
need to talk about voltage, current,
resistance, power and energy.
Having these terms clear in your
head will help you to understand
your solar system. It will also give
you confidence that you are doing
the right thing when it comes to
designing and installing your
system.

Don’t panic
If you have not looked at electrics
since you were learning physics at
school, some of the principles of
electricity can be a bit daunting to
start with. Do not worry if you do
not fully grasp everything on your
first read through.
There are a few calculations that
I show on the next few pages, but I
am not expecting you to remember
them all! Whenever I use these
calculations later on in the book, I
show all my workings and, of
course, you can refer back to this
chapter as you gain more

knowledge on solar energy.
Furthermore, the website that
accompanies this book includes a
number of online tools that you can
use to work through most of the
calculations involved in designing a
solar electric system. You will not
be spending hours with a slide-rule
and reams of paper working all this
out by yourself.

A brief introduction to
electricity
When you think of electricity, what
do you think of? Do you think of a
battery that is storing electricity?
Do you think of giant overhead
pylons transporting electricity? Do
you think of power stations that are
generating electricity? Or do you
think of a device like a kettle or
television set or electric motor that
is consuming electricity?
The word electricity actually
covers a number of different
physical effects, all of which are
related but distinct from each other.

These effects are electric charge,
electric current, electric potential
and electromagnetism:
·       An electric charge is a
build-up of electrical energy.
It is measured in coulombs. In
nature, you can witness an
electric charge in static
electricity or in a lightning
strike. A battery stores an
electric charge
·       An electric current is the
flow of an electric charge,
such as the flow of electricity
through a cable. It is
measured in amps

·       An electric potential refers
to the potential difference in
electrical energy between
two points, such as between
the positive tip and the
negative tip of a battery. It is
measured in volts. The
greater the electric potential
(volts), the greater capacity
for work the electricity has
·       Electromagnetism is the
relationship between
electricity and magnetism,
which enables electrical
energy to be generated from
mechanical energy (such as in

a generator) and enables
mechanical energy to be
generated from electrical
energy (such as in an electric
motor)

How to measure
electricity
Voltage refers to the potential
difference between two points. A
good example of this is an AA
battery: the voltage is the difference
between the positive tip and the
negative end of the battery. Voltage
is measured in volts and has the
symbol ‘V’.
Current is the flow of electrons in a
circuit. Current is measured in
amps (A) and has the symbol ‘I’. If
you check a power supply, it will
typically show the current on the
supply itself.

Resistance is the opposition to an
electrical current in the material the
current is flowing through.
Resistance is measured in ohms and
has the symbol ‘R’.
Power measures the rate of energy
conversion. It is measured in watts
(W) and has the symbol ‘P’. You
will see watts advertised when
buying a kettle or vacuum cleaner:
the higher the wattage, the more
power the device consumes and the
faster (hopefully) it does its job.
Energy refers to the capacity for
work: power multiplied by time.
Energy has the symbol ‘E’. Energy

is usually measured in joules (a
joule equals one watt-second), but
electrical energy is usually shown
as watt-hours (Wh), or kilowatt-
hours (kWh), where 1 kWh = 1,000
Wh.

The relationship between
volts, amps, ohms, watts
and watt-hours
Volts
Current x Resistance = Volts
I x R = V
Voltage is equal to current
multiplied by resistance. This
calculation is known as Ohm’s
Law. As with power calculations,
you can express this calculation in
different ways. If you know volts
and current, you can calculate
resistance. If you know volts and

resistance, you can calculate
current:
Volts ÷ Resistance = Current
V ÷ R = I
Volts ÷ Current = Resistance
V ÷ I = R
Power
Volts x Current = Power
V x I = P
Power is measured in watts. It
equals volts times current. A 12-
volt circuit with a 4-amp current
equals 48 watts of power (12 x 4 =
48).

Based on this calculation, we can
also work out voltage if we know
power and current, and current if
we know voltage and power:
Power ÷ Current = Volts
P ÷ I = V
Example: A 48-watt motor with a
4-amp current is running at 12 volts.
48 watts ÷ 4 amps = 12 volts
Current = Power ÷ Volts
I = P ÷ V
Example: a 48-watt motor with a
12-volt supply requires a 4-amp
current.

48 watts ÷ 12 volts = 4 amps
Power (watts) is also equal to the
square of the current multiplied by
the resistance:
Current² x Resistance = Power
I² x R = P
Energy
Energy is a measurement of power
over a period of time. It shows how
much power is used, or generated,
by a device, typically over a period
of an hour. In electrical systems, it
is measured in watt-hours (Wh) and
kilowatt-hours (kWh).
A device that uses 50 watts of

power, has an energy demand of
50Wh per hour. A solar panel that
can generate 50 watts of power per
hour, has an energy creation
potential of 50Wh per hour.
However, because solar energy
generation is so variable, based on
temperature, weather conditions,
the time of day and so on, a new
figure is now often shown
specifically for solar systems: a
watt-peak (Wp) rating.
A watt-peak rating shows how
much power can be generated by a
solar panel at its peak rating. It has
been introduced to highlight the fact

that the amount of energy a solar
panel can generate is variable and
to remind consumers that a solar
panel rated at 50 watts is not going
to be producing 50 watt-hours of
energy every single hour of every
single day.

A word for non-
electricians
Realistically, if you are new to
electrical systems, you should not
be planning to install a big solar
energy system yourself. If you want
a low-voltage system to mount to
the roof of a boat, garden shed or
barn, or if you want to play with the
technology and have some fun, then
great: this book will tell you
everything you need to know.
However, if the limit of your
electrical knowledge is wiring a
plug or replacing a fuse, you should
not be thinking of physically wiring

and installing a solar energy system
yourself without learning more
about electrical systems and
electrical safety first.
Furthermore, if you are planning to
install a solar energy system to the
roof of a house, be aware that in
many parts of the world you need to
have electrical qualifications in
order to carry out even simple
household wiring.
That does not mean that you cannot
specify a solar energy system,
calculate the size you need and buy
the necessary hardware for a big
project. It does mean that you are

going to need to employ a specialist
to check your design and carry out
the installation.

In conclusion
·       Understanding the basic
rules of electricity makes it
much easier to put together a
solar electric system
·       As with many things in life,
a bit of theory makes a lot
more sense when you start
applying it in practice
·       If this is your first
introduction to electricity,
you may find it useful to run
through it a couple of times
·       You may also find it useful
to bookmark this section and

refer back to it as you read on
·       You will also find that,
once you have learned a bit
more about solar electric
systems, some of the terms
and calculations will start to
make a bit more sense.
·       If you are not an electrician,
be realistic in what you can
achieve. Electrics can be
dangerous and you do not
want to get it wrong. You can
do most of the design work
yourself, but you are going to
need to get a specialist in to
check your design and carry

out the installation.

The Four
Configurations for
Solar Power
There are four different
configurations you can choose from
when creating a solar electricity
installation. These are stand-alone
(sometimes referred to as off-grid),
grid-tie, grid-tie with power backup
(also known as grid interactive)
and grid fallback.
Here is a brief introduction to these
different configurations:

Stand-alone/off-grid
Worldwide, stand-alone solar
photovoltaic installations are the
most popular type of solar
installation there is. It is what solar
photovoltaics were originally
created for: to provide power at a
location where there is no other
source easily available.
Whether it is powering a shed light,
providing power for a pocket
calculator or powering a complete
off-grid home, stand-alone systems
fundamentally all work in the same
way: the solar panel generates
power, the energy is stored in a

battery and then used as required.
In general, stand-alone systems are
comparatively small systems,
typically with a peak power
generation of under one kilowatt.
Almost everyone can benefit from a
stand-alone solar system for
something, even if it is something as
mundane as providing an outside
light somewhere. Even if you are
planning on something much bigger
and grander, it is often a good idea
to start with a very small and
simple stand-alone system first.
Learn the basics and then progress
from there.

Examples of simple stand-
alone systems
The vending machine
ByBox is a manufacturer of
electronic lockers. These are
typically used for left luggage at
railway stations or at airports, or
situated at shopping malls or fuel
stations and used as part of a
delivery service for people to
collect internet deliveries, so they
do not need to wait at home.
One of the biggest issues with
electronic lockers has often been
finding suitable locations to place
them where a power source is

available. ByBox overcame this
issue by building an electronic
locker with a solar roof to provide
permanent power to the locker.
The solar roof provides power to a
set of batteries inside the locker.
When not in use, the locker itself is
in standby mode, thereby consuming
minimal power. When a customer
wishes to use the locker, they press
the START button and use the
locker as normal.
The benefit to ByBox has been
twofold: they can install a locker
bank in any location, without any
dependence on a power supply.

Secondly, the cost of the solar
panels and controllers is often less
than the cost of installing a separate
electricity supply, even if there is
one nearby.
Recreational vehicles
Holidaying with recreational
vehicles or caravans is on the
increase, and solar energy is
changing the way people are going
on holiday.
In the past, most RV owners elected
to stay on larger sites, which
provided access to electricity and
other facilities. As recreational
vehicles themselves become more

luxurious, however, people are now
choosing to travel to more remote
locations and live entirely ‘off-
grid’, using solar energy to provide
electricity wherever they happen to
be. Solar is being used to provide
all the comforts of home, whilst
offering holidaymakers the freedom
to stay wherever they want.

Grid-tie
Grid-tie is gaining popularity in
Europe and the United States. This
is due to the availability of grants to
reduce the installation costs and the
ability to earn money by selling
electricity back into the electricity
companies through a feed-in tariff.
Feed-in tariff schemes vary around
the world and are not available
everywhere. Where they exist, your
local electricity company buys
electricity from solar producers at
an agreed rate per kilowatt-hour. In
some countries, this price has been
set at an inflated rate by government

in order to encourage people to
install solar. In other countries and
regions, the price is agreed by the
electricity companies themselves.
In a grid-tie system, your home runs
on solar power during the day. Any
surplus energy that you produce is
then fed into the grid. In the
evenings and at night, when your
solar energy system is not
producing electricity, you then buy
your power from the electricity
companies in the usual way.
The benefit of grid-tie solar
installations is that they reduce your
reliance on the big electricity

companies and ensure that more of
your electricity is produced in an
environmentally efficient way.
One disadvantage of most grid-tie
systems is that if there is a power
cut, power from your solar array is
also cut.
Grid-tie can work especially well
in hot, sunny climates, where peak
demand for electricity from the grid
often coincides with the sun shining,
thanks to the high power demand of
air conditioning units. Grid-tie also
works well where the owners use
most of the power themselves.

An example of a grid-tie
system
Si Gelatos is a small Florida-based
ice-cream manufacturer. In 2007,
they installed solar panels on the
roof of their factory to provide
power and offset some of the energy
used in running their cold storage
facility.
“Running industrial freezers is
extremely expensive and consumes
a lot of power,” explains Dan
Foster of Si Gelatos. “Realistically,
we could not hope to generate all of
the power from solar, but we felt it
was important to reduce our overall

power demand and solar allowed
us to do that.”
Cold storage facilities consume
most of their power during the day
in the summer, when solar is
running at its peak. Since installing
solar power, Si Gelatos has seen its
overall energy consumption drop by
40% and now hardly takes any
power from the utilities during peak
operating times.
“Solar has done three things for our
business,” says Dan. “Firstly, it is a
very visible sign for our staff that
we are serious about the
environment. This in turn has made

our employees more aware that they
need to do their bit by making sure
lights and equipment are switched
off when they are not needed.
Secondly, it shows our customers
that we care for the environment,
which has definitely been good for
goodwill and sales. Thirdly, and
most importantly, we’re genuinely
making a real contribution to the
environment, by reducing our
electricity demand at the time of
day when everyone else’s demand
for electricity is high as well.”

Grid-tie with power
backup (grid interactive)
Grid-tie with power backup – also
known as a grid interactive system
– combines a grid-tie installation
with a bank of batteries.
As with grid-tie, the concept is that
you use power from your solar
array when the sun shines and sell
the surplus to the power companies.
Unlike a standard grid-tie system,
however, a battery bank provides
contingency for power cuts so that
you can continue to use power from
your system.

Typically, you would set up
‘protected circuits’ within your
building that will continue to
receive power during a power
outage. This ensures that essential
power remains available for
running lights, refrigeration and
heating controllers, for example,
whilst backup power is not wasted
on inessential items such as
televisions and radios.
If there is a potential for main
power to be lost for several days, it
is also possible to design a system
to incorporate other power
generators into a grid interactive

system, such as a generator. This
would allow a grid interactive
system to work as a highly efficient
uninterruptable power supply
(UPS) for extended periods of time.
The cost of a grid-tie system with
power backup is higher than a
standard grid-tie system, because of
the additional cost of batteries and
battery controllers. Typically,
having power backup will add
12–20% of additional costs over a
standard grid-tie system.
As with normal grid-tie systems, it
is possible to sell surplus power
back to the utility companies in

some countries, allowing you to
earn an income from your solar
energy system.
An example of a grid
interactive system
Grid interactive systems are gaining
popularity with rural farms in the
United Kingdom, where even short
power blackouts can cause
significant disruption.
Traditionally, farms have countered
this by using generators to provide
light and power. However, between
2009 and 2011, when the UK
Government were offering large

incentives for installing solar
power, many farmers fitted grid
interactive systems onto their
buildings, providing themselves
with an income by selling
electricity to the electricity utility
companies and giving themselves
backup power in case of a power
blackout.
The additional cost of installing a
grid interactive system over a
standard grid-tie system is more
than offset by the low running costs
and ease of use of the system.
Farmers do not need to buy and run
generators and the system is almost
entirely maintenance-free. This is a

big contrast with generator systems,
which need to be tested and run
regularly in order to ensure they are
working effectively.

Grid fallback
Grid fallback is a lesser-known
system that makes a lot of sense for
smaller household solar power
systems. For most household solar
installations where solar is being
installed for technical or
environmental reasons, grid
fallback is my preferred solution.
Operationally it is effective, it is
cost-effective and it is
environmentally extremely efficient.
With a grid fallback system, the
solar array generates power, which
in turn charges a battery bank.
Energy is taken from the battery and

run through an inverter to power
one or more circuits from the
distribution panel in the house.
When the batteries run flat, the
system automatically switches back
to the grid power supply. The solar
array then recharges the batteries
and the system switches back to
solar power.
With a grid fallback system, you do
not sell electricity back to the
electricity companies. All the
power that you generate, you use
yourself. This means that some of
the grants that are available for
solar installations in some countries

may not be available to you. It also
means that you cannot benefit from
selling your electricity back to the
electricity companies.
For this reason, grid fallback makes
more sense in countries where there
is no feed-in tariff available, such
as India, or in countries like
Australia that have financial
incentives available for both grid-
tied and off-grid systems.
Grid fallback systems provide most
of the benefits of a grid interactive
system, with the additional benefit
that you use your own power when
you need it, rather than when the sun

is shining. This reduces your
reliance on external electricity
supplies during peak load periods,
which ensures that your system has
an overall environmental benefit.
The other significant benefit of a
grid fallback system is cost: you
can genuinely build a useful grid
fallback system to power one or
more circuits within a house for a
very small investment and expand it
as budget allows. I have seen grid
fallback systems installed for under
£400 ($680), providing a useful
amount of power for a home. In
comparison, even a very modest
grid-tie system costs several

thousands of pounds.
There is a crossover point where a
grid-tie system works out more
cost-effective than a grid fallback
system. At present, that crossover
point is around the 1kWh mark: if
your system is capable of
generating more than 1kW of
electricity per hour, a grid-tie
system may be more cost-effective.
If your system generates less than
1kW of electricity per hour, a grid
fallback system is almost certainly
cheaper.
Unless you are looking to invest a
significant amount of money on a

larger grid-tie system in order to
produce more than 1 kW of power
per hour, or if you want to take
advantage of feed-in tariffs, a grid
fallback solution is certainly worth
investigating as an alternative.
An example of a grid fallback
system
Back in 2001, Colin Metcalfe
installed a solar panel onto the roof
of his garage, in order to charge an
old car battery, which in turn
powered a single light and a small
inverter. After a power cut that
winter, Colin decided to expand his
system in order to provide basic

power to his house.
“I wanted to ensure I always had
enough power in my home to power
lights and to ensure my heating
system would work,” explained
Colin. “I have gas heating, but the
controllers are all electric, which
means that if there is a power cut, I
have no heating at all. In addition, I
liked the idea of free electricity that
was generated in an
environmentally friendly way.”
Colin upgraded his system bit by
bit, as funds allowed. “An
electrician fitted a new distribution
panel (consumer unit) for my

essential circuits, and this was
connected up to the main panel via
an automatic transfer switch. Then I
added additional solar panels and
batteries over the years as I could
afford them.”
This automatic transfer switch
meant the essential circuits would
receive power from the solar array
or the batteries while power was
available, but switch back to utility
power when the batteries ran flat.
Originally, the system provided
around half the power he needed,
but as he has added to the system,
more and more of his power now
comes from his solar array. “Today

I have around 1.4kW of solar
panels on the roof of my garage,”
says Colin. “They look a bit odd as
no two panels are alike, as I have
bought them bit by bit as funds
allow, but they now provide all the
power I need around the year for all
my essential circuits.”
Grid failover
Alternatively, you can configure a
grid fallback system as a grid
failover system.
A grid failover system kicks in
when there is a power failure from
your main electricity supply. In

effect, it is an uninterruptable
power supply, generating its power
from solar energy.
The benefit of this configuration is
that if you have a power cut, you
have contingency power. The
disadvantage of this configuration is
that you are not using solar power
for your day-to-day use.
Although rare in Europe and
America, grid failover systems used
to be more common in countries
where power failures are
commonplace. In Africa and in
many parts of Asia, grid failover
systems reduce the reliance on

power generators for lighting and
basic electricity needs.
However, in most cases, customers
have found that a grid fallback or
grid interactive system is more
suitable for their needs. I am aware
of two grid failover systems that
have been installed in the past: both
of these have since been
reconfigured as grid fallback
systems.

How grid-tie systems
differ from stand-alone
Generally, stand-alone and smaller
grid fallback systems run at low
voltages, typically between 12 and
48 volts. This is because batteries
are low-voltage units and so
building a stand-alone system at a
low voltage is a simple, flexible
and safe approach.
Grid-tie systems tend to be larger
installations, often generating
several kilowatts of electricity each
hour. As the electricity is required
as a high-voltage supply, it is more
efficient to connect multiple solar

panels together to produce a high
voltage circuit, rather than use an
inverter to step up the voltage. This
high-voltage DC power is then
converted into an AC current by a
suitable grid-tie inverter.
Grid-tie systems either link multiple
solar panels together to produce a
solar array voltage of several
hundred volts before running to the
inverter, or have a small inverter
connected to each solar panel to
create a high-voltage AC supply
from each panel.
The benefit of this high voltage is
efficiency. There is less power loss

running high-voltage, low-current
electricity through cables from the
solar array.
For stand-alone battery-based
systems, low-voltage is the best
solution, as the battery banks tend to
work better as low-voltage energy
stores. For grid-tie systems where
the energy is not being stored in a
battery bank, the higher-voltage
systems are the best solution.
Neither approach is inherently
‘better’: it all depends on the type
of system you are designing.

In conclusion
·       Solar can be used in a
number of different ways and
for many different
applications
·       Stand-alone systems are the
simplest and easiest to
understand. They tend to be
comparatively small systems,
providing power where no
other power source is easily
available
·       With grid-tie, your solar
energy system generates
electricity that is then used

normally. Any excess
electricity production is
exported onto the grid
·       Grid-tie with power backup
(also known as grid
interactive) provides you
with the benefits of a grid-tie
system with the added benefit
that power remains available
even if electricity to your area
is cut off
·       Grid fallback systems have
more in common with stand-
alone systems than grid-tie
systems. In design they are
very similar to stand-alone

systems, with an inverter
running from a bank of
batteries and an automatic
transfer switch to switch
power between the solar
energy system and the grid
power supply
·       Grid failover systems are
comparatively rare now, but
provide uninterruptable
power supplies using solar as
the backup source
·       Grid-tie systems have a
different design to stand-
alone systems. They tend to
be high-voltage systems,

whereas stand-alone systems
run at much lower voltages

Components of a
Solar Electric System
Before I get into the detail about
planning and designing solar
electric systems, it is worth
describing all the different
components of a system and
explaining how they fit together.
Once you have read this chapter,
you will have a reasonable grasp of
how a solar energy system fits
together.
I deliberately do not go into much
detail at this stage: all I am doing is

providing an overview for now.
The detail can come later.

Solar panels
The heart of a solar electric system
is the solar panel itself. There are
various types of solar panel and I
will describe them all in detail later
on.
Solar panels or, more accurately,
photovoltaic solar panels, generate
electricity from the sun. The more
powerful the sun’s energy, the more
power you get, although solar
panels continue to generate small
amounts of electricity in the shade.
Most solar panels are made up of
individual solar cells, connected
together. A typical solar cell will

only produce around half a volt, so
by connecting them together in
series inside the panel, a more
useful voltage is achieved.
Most solar panels are rated as 12-
volt solar panels, although
higher-voltage panels are also
available. A 12-volt solar panel
produces around 14–18 volts when
put under load. This allows a single
solar panel to charge up a 12-volt
battery.
Incidentally, if you connect a
voltmeter up to a solar panel when
it is not under load, you may well
see voltage readings of up to 26

volts. This is normal in an ‘open
circuit’ on a solar panel. As soon as
you connect the solar panel into a
circuit, this voltage level will drop
to around 14–18 volts.
Solar panels can be linked together
to create a solar array. Connecting
multiple panels together allows you
to produce a higher current or to run
at a higher voltage:
·       Connecting the panels in
series allows a solar array to
run at a higher voltage.
Typically, 24 volts or 48
volts in a stand-alone system,
or up to several hundred volts

in a grid-tie system
·       Connecting the panels in
parallel allows a solar array
to produce more power while
maintaining the same voltage
as the individual panels
·       When you connect multiple
panels together, the power of
the overall system increases,
irrespective of whether they
are connected in series or in
parallel
In a solar array where the solar
panels are connected in series (as
shown in the following diagrams),
you add the voltages of each panel

together and add the wattage of
each panel together to calculate the
maximum amount of power and
voltage the solar array will
generate.
A solar array made
of four solar panels
connected in series.
If each individual
panel is rated as a

12-volt, 12-watt
panel, this solar
array would be rated
as a 48-volt, 48-watt
array with a 1 amp
current.
In a solar array where the panels
are connected in parallel (as shown
in the diagram below), you take the
average voltage of all the solar
panels and you add the wattage of
each panel to calculate the
maximum amount of power the
solar array will generate.

A solar array made
of four solar panels
connected in
parallel. With each
panel rated as a 12-
volt, 12-watt panel,
this solar array
would be rated as a
12-volt, 48-watt
array with a 4 amp

current.
I will go into more detail later
about choosing the correct voltage
for your system.

Batteries
Except in a grid-tie system, where
the solar array connects directly to
an inverter, solar panels rarely
power electrical equipment
directly. This is because the amount
of power the solar panel collects
varies depending on the strength of
sunlight. This makes the power
source too variable for most
electrical equipment to cope with.
In a grid-tie system, the inverter
handles this variability: if demand
outstrips supply, you will get power
from both the grid and your solar
system. For a stand-alone or a grid

fallback system, batteries store the
energy and provide a constant
power source for your electrical
equipment.
Typically, this energy is stored in
‘deep cycle’ lead acid batteries.
These look similar to car batteries
but have a different internal design.
This design allows them to be
heavily discharged and recharged
several hundred times over.
Most lead acid batteries are 6-volt
or 12-volt batteries and, like solar
panels, these can be connected
together to form a larger battery
bank. Like solar panels, multiple

batteries used in series increase the
capacity and the voltage of a battery
bank. Multiple batteries connected
in parallel increase the capacity
whilst keeping the voltage the same.

Controller
If you are using batteries, your solar
electric system is going to require a
controller in order to manage the
flow of electricity (the current) into
and out of the battery.
If your system overcharges the
batteries, this will damage and
eventually destroy them. Likewise,
if your system completely
discharges the batteries, this will
quite rapidly destroy them. A solar
controller prevents this from
happening.
There are a few instances where a
small solar electric system does not

require a controller. An example of
this is a small ‘battery top-up’ solar
panel that is used to keep a car
battery in peak condition when the
car is not being used. These solar
panels are too small to damage the
battery when the battery is fully
charged.
In the majority of instances,
however, a solar electric system
will require a controller in order to
manage the charge and discharge of
batteries and keep them in good
condition.

Inverter
The electricity generated by a solar
electric system is direct current
(DC). Electricity from the grid is
high-voltage alternating current
(AC).
If you are planning to run equipment
that runs from grid-voltage
electricity from your solar electric
system, you will need an inverter to
convert the current from DC to AC
and convert the voltage to the same
voltage as you get from the grid.
Traditionally, there is usually one
central inverter in a solar system,
either connecting directly to the

solar array in a grid-tie system, or
to the battery pack in an off-grid
system. A more recent invention has
been the micro inverter.
Micro-inverters are connected to
individual solar panels so that each
individual panel provides a
high-voltage alternating current.
Solar panels with micro-inverters
are typically only used with grid-tie
systems and are not suitable for
systems with battery backup. For
grid-tie systems, they do offer some
significant benefits over the more
traditional ‘big box’ inverter,
although the up-front cost is
currently higher.

Inverters are a big subject all on
their own. I will come back to
describe them in much more detail
later on in the book.

Electrical devices
The final element of your solar
electric system is the devices you
plan to power. Theoretically,
anything that you can power with
electricity can be powered by solar.
However, many electrical devices
are very power hungry, which
makes running them on solar energy
very expensive!
Of course, this may not be so much
of an issue if you are installing a
grid-tie system: if you have very
energy-intensive appliances that
you only use for short periods, the
impact to your system is low. In

comparison, running high-power
appliances on an off-grid system
means you have to have a more
powerful off-grid solar energy
system to cope with the peak
demand.
Low-voltage devices
Most off-grid solar systems run at
low voltages. Unless you are
planning a pure grid-tie installation,
you may wish to consider running at
least some of your devices directly
from your DC supply rather than
running everything through an
inverter. This has the benefit of
greater efficiency.

Thanks to the caravanning and
boating communities, lots of
equipment is available to run from a
12-volt or 24-volt supply: light
bulbs, refrigerators, ovens, kettles,
toasters, coffee machines,
hairdryers, vacuum cleaners,
televisions, radios, air conditioning
units, washing machines and laptop
computers are all available to run
on 12-volt or 24-volt power.
In addition, thanks to the recent
uptake in solar installations, some
specialist manufacturers are
building ultra low-energy
appliances, such as refrigerators,

freezers and washing machines,
specifically for people installing
solar and wind turbine systems.
You can also charge up most
portable items such as MP3 players
and mobile phones from a 12-volt
supply.
High-voltage devices
If running everything at low voltage
is not an option, or if you are using
a grid-tie system, you use an
inverter to run your electrical
devices.

Connecting everything
together
A stand-alone system
The simplified block diagram
above shows a simple stand-alone

solar electric system. Whilst the
detail will vary, this design forms
the basis of most stand-alone
systems and is typical of the
installations you will find in
caravans, boats and buildings that
do not have a conventional power
supply.
This design provides both
low-voltage DC power for running
smaller electrical devices and
appliances such as laptop
computers and lighting, plus a
higher-voltage AC supply for
running larger devices such as
larger televisions and kitchen
appliances.

In this diagram, the arrows show
the flow of current. The solar
panels provide the energy, which is
fed into the solar controller. The
solar controller charges the
batteries. The controller also
supplies power to the low-voltage
devices, using either the solar
panels or the batteries as the source
of this power.
The AC inverter takes its power
directly from the battery and
provides the high-voltage AC
power supply.
A grid-tie system using a

single central inverter
This simplified block diagram
shows a simple grid-tie system,
typical of the type installed in many
homes today. The solar panels are
connected to the grid-tie inverter,

which feeds the energy into the
main supply. Electricity can be used
by devices in the building or fed
back out onto the grid, depending on
demand.
The grid-tie inverter monitors the
power feed from the grid. If it
detects a power cut, it also cuts
power from the solar panels to
ensure that no energy is fed back out
onto the grid.
The grid-tie meter monitors how
much energy is taken from the grid
and how much is fed back into the
grid using the solar energy system.

A grid-tie system using
multiple micro-inverters
A grid-tie system using micro-
inverters is similar to the one
above, except that each solar panel
is connected to its own inverter,
and the inverters themselves are
daisy-chained together, converting
the low-voltage DC power from
each solar panel into a high-voltage
AC power supply.


In conclusion
·       There are various
components that make up a
solar electric system
·       Multiple solar panels can
be joined together to create a
more powerful solar array.
·       In a stand-alone system, the
electricity is stored in
batteries to provide an energy
store and provide a more
constant power source. A
controller manages the
batteries, ensuring the
batteries do not get

overcharged by the solar
array and are not
over-discharged by the
devices taking current from
them
·       An inverter takes the DC
current from the solar energy
system and converts it into a
high-voltage AC current that
is suitable for running
devices that require grid
power
·       Generally, it is more
efficient to use the electricity
as a DC supply than an AC
supply


The Design Process
No matter what your solar energy
system is for, there are seven steps
in the design of every successful
solar electric installation:
·       Scope the project
·       Calculate the amount of
energy you need
·       Calculate the amount of
solar energy available
·       Survey your site
·       Size up the solar electric
system

·       Select the right components
and work out full costs
·       Produce the detailed design
The design process can be made
more complicated, or simplified,
based on the size of the project. If
you are simply installing an off-the-
shelf shed light, for instance, you
can probably complete the whole
design in around twenty minutes. If,
on the other hand, you are looking
to install a solar electric system in a
business to provide emergency site
power in the case of a power cut,
your design work is likely to take
considerably more time.

Whether your solar electric system
is going to be large or small,
whether you are buying an
off-the-shelf solar lighting kit or
designing something from scratch, it
is worth following this basic design
process every time. This is true
even if you are installing an off-the-
shelf system. This ensures that you
will always get the best from your
system and will provide you with
the reassurance that your solar
energy system will achieve
everything you need it to do.

Short-cutting the design
work
Having said that doing the design
work is important, there are some
useful online tools to help make the
process as easy as possible.
Once you have scoped your project,
the Solar Electricity Handbook
website
(www.SolarElectricityHandbook.co
includes a number of online tools
and calculators that will help you
carry out much of the design work.
The solar irradiance tables and
solar angle calculators will allow

you to work out how much solar
energy is available at your location,
whilst the off-grid project analysis
and grid-tie project analysis
questionnaires will each generate
and e-mail to you a full report for
your proposed system, including
calculating the size of system you
require and providing a cost
estimate.
Of course, there is a limit to how
much a set of online solar tools can
help you in isolation, so you will
still need to carry out a site survey
and go through components
selection and detailed design
yourself, but these tools will allow

you to try several different
configurations and play out ‘what
if’ scenarios quickly and easily.
Incidentally, whilst some of these
tools ask you for an e-mail address
(in order to send you your report),
your e-mail address is not stored
anywhere on the system. Other than
the report that you request, you will
never receive unsolicited e-mails
because of entering your e-mail
address.

Solar energy and
emotions
Design can often seem to be a
purely analytical and rational
process. It should not be. All great
designs start with a dream.
For many people, choosing solar
energy is often an emotional
decision: they want a solar energy
system for reasons other than just
the purely practical. Some people
want solar energy because they
want to ‘do their bit’ for the
environment, others want the very
latest technology, or want to use
solar simply because it can be

done. Others want solar energy
because they see the opportunity to
earn money. I suspect that for most
homeowners, the reasons are a
combination of the above.
It is so important that the emotional
reasons for wanting something are
not ignored. We are not robots. Our
emotions should be celebrated, not
suppressed: the Wright brothers
built the first aircraft because they
wanted to reach the sky. NASA sent
a man to the moon because they
wanted to go further than anyone
had ever done before. Neither
undertaking could be argued as

purely rational; they were the
results of big dreams.
It is important to acknowledge that
there are often hidden reasons for
wanting solar energy. Sadly, these
reasons often do not make it down
onto a sheet of paper in a design
document or onto a computer
spreadsheet. Sometimes, the person
making the decision for buying
solar energy is secretly worried that
if they voice their dreams, they will
appear in some way irrational.
The reality is that it is often a good
thing if there is an emotional
element to wanting a solar energy

system. By documenting these
reasons, you will end up with a
better solution. For instance, if the
environmental benefits are top of
your agenda, you will use your
solar energy system in a different
way to somebody who is looking at
solar purely as a business
investment.
By acknowledging these reasons
and incorporating them into the
design of your system, you will end
up with a far better system. Not
only will you have a system that
works in a practical sense, it will
also achieve your dream.

In conclusion
·       No matter how big or small
your project, it is important to
design it properly
·       There are online tools
available to help you with the
calculations and to speed up
the work
·       Do not ignore the emotional
reasons for wanting a solar
energy system. You are a
human being: you are allowed
to dream

Scoping the Project
As with any project, before you
start, you need to know what you
want to achieve. In fact, it is one of
the most important parts of the
whole project. Get it wrong and you
will end up with a system that will
not do what you need it to.
It is usually best to keep your
scope simple to start with. You can
then flesh it out with more detail
later.
Here are some examples of a
suitable scope:

·       To power a light and a
burglar alarm in a shed on an
allotment
·       To provide power for
lighting, a kettle, a radio and
some handheld power tools in
a workshop that has no
conventional electrical
connection
·       To provide enough power
for lighting, refrigeration and
a TV in a holiday caravan
·       To provide lighting and
power to run four laptop
computers and the telephone

system in an office during a
power cut
·       To charge up an electric
bike between uses
·       To provide an off-grid
holiday home with its entire
electricity requirements
·       To reduce my carbon
footprint by producing
electricity for all my home
requirements
·       To run an electric car
entirely on solar energy
From your scope, you can start
fleshing this out to provide some

initial estimates on power
requirements.
As mentioned in the previous
chapter, I have created two online
Solar Project Analysis tools, one
for grid-tie systems and one for off-
grid systems. You can find both of
these tools on my website
www.SolarElectricityHandbook.com
You will still need to collect the
basic information to work with, but
all the hard work is done for you.
This tool will produce a complete
project scope, work out the likely
performance of your solar energy
system and provide some ballpark
cost estimates.

For the purpose of these next few
chapters, I am going to use the
example of providing a small off-
grid holiday home with its entire
electricity requirements.
This is a big project. In reality if
you have little or no experience of
solar electric systems or household
electrics you would be best starting
with something smaller. Going
completely off-grid is an ambitious
project, but for the purposes of
teaching solar electric system
design, it is a perfect example: it
requires a detailed design that
covers all of the aspects of

designing a solar energy system.

Designing grid-tie or grid
fallback systems
For our sample project, grid-tie is
not an option as we are using solar
power as an alternative to
connecting our site to the electricity
grid.
However, grid-tie is becoming a
popular option, especially in the
southern states of the United States
and in European countries like
Spain, Germany and the United
Kingdom where generous
government subsidies and feed-in
tariffs are available.

In terms of scoping the project, it
makes little difference whether you
are planning a grid-tie or grid
fallback system or not: the steps you
need to go through are the same.
The only exception, of course, is
that you do not need to take into
account battery efficiencies with
grid-tie.
The biggest difference with a grid-
tie or grid fallback system is that
you do not have to rely on your
solar system providing you with all
your electricity requirements: you
will not be plunged into darkness if
you use more electricity than you

generate.
This means that you can start with a
small grid-tie or grid fallback
system and expand it later on as
funds allow.
Despite that, it is still a good idea
to go through a power analysis as
part of the design. Even if you do
not intend to produce all the power
you need with solar, having a
power analysis will allow you to
benchmark your system and will
help you size your grid-tie system if
you aim to reduce your carbon
footprint by providing the
electricity companies with as much

power as you buy back.
Most grid-tie systems are sized to
provide more power than you need
during the summer and less than you
need during the winter. Over a
period of a year, the aim is to
generate as much power as you use,
although on a month-by-month basis
this may not always be the case.
Many solar companies claim that
this then provides you with a
‘carbon neutral’ system: you are
selling your excess power to the
electricity companies and then
buying the same amount of
electricity back when you need it.

If this is what you are planning to
do with your grid-tie system, your
scope is much simpler. You need to
get your electricity bills for the past
year and make a note of how much
electricity you have used over the
year. Then divide this figure by the
number of days in the year to work
out a daily energy usage and ensure
your system generates this as an
average over the period of a year.
Because you are not generating
enough electricity during the winter
months in a carbon neutral grid-tie
system, you need fewer solar panels
than you would need to create an

entirely stand-alone system.
Comparing supply with
demand
If you are designing a grid-tie
system, it can be interesting to
compare the supply of solar energy
with your electricity usage pattern.
By comparing supply with demand,
you can see how closely solar
energy production matches your
own usage and this, in turn, can be
used as an indicator to identify how
environmentally beneficial solar
energy is for you.
To do this, you will need to

ascertain your monthly electricity
usage for each month of the year.
Your electricity supplier may
already provide you with this
information on your electricity bill.
If not, you should be able to request
this from them.
Once you have this information,
visit
www.SolarElectricityHandbook.com
and fill in the Grid-Tie Solar
Project Analysis, including your
individual monthly consumption
figures. In the report that is e-
mailed to you, you will see a chart
that allows you to see how closely
your electricity usage maps onto

solar energy production.
This report will also provide you
with an approximate estimate for
the carbon footprint for each
kilowatt-hour of electricity you
produce from your solar array,
based on the production and
installation of your solar array and
the likely amount of energy that it
will generate during its lifetime.
Based on this, it is possible to see
whether installing solar energy is
likely to produce real-world
environmental savings.

Fleshing out the scope
Now we know the outline scope of
our project, we need to quantify
exactly what we need to achieve
and work out some estimates for
energy consumption.
Our holiday home is a small two-
bedroom cottage with a solid fuel
cooker and boiler. The cost of
connecting the cottage to the grid is
£4,500 (around $7,200) and I
suspect that solar electric power
could work out significantly
cheaper.
The cottage is mainly used in the
spring, summer and autumn, with

only a few weekend visits during
the winter.
Electricity is required for lighting
in each room, plus a courtesy light
in the porch, a fridge in the kitchen
and a small television in the sitting
room. There also needs to be
surplus electricity for charging up a
mobile phone or MP3 player and
for the occasional use of a laptop
computer.
Now we have decided what
devices we need to power, we need
to find out how much energy each
device needs, and estimate the daily
usage of each item.

In order to keep efficiency high and
costs low, we are going to work
with low-voltage electrics
wherever possible. The benefits of
using low-volt devices rather than
higher grid-voltage are twofold:
·       We are not losing efficiency
by converting low-volt DC
electrics to grid-voltage AC
electrics through an inverter.
·       Many electronic devices
that plug into a grid-voltage
socket require a transformer
to reduce the power back
down to a low DC current,
thereby creating a second

level of inefficiency
Many household devices, like
smaller televisions, music systems,
computer games consoles and
laptop computers, have external
transformers. It is possible to buy
transformers that run on 12-volt or
24-volt electrics rather than the AC
voltages we get from grid power,
and using these is the most efficient
way of providing low-voltage
power to these devices.
There can be disadvantages of
low-voltage configurations,
however, and they are not the right
approach for every project:

·       If running everything at
12–24 volts requires a
significant amount of
additional rewiring, the cost
of carrying out the rewiring
can be much higher than the
cost of an inverter and a
slightly larger solar array
·       If the cable running between
your batteries and your
devices is too long, you will
get greater power losses
through the cable at lower
voltages than you will at
higher voltages
If you already have wiring in place

to work at grid-level voltages, it is
often more appropriate to run a
system at grid voltage using an
inverter, rather than running the
whole system at low voltage. If you
have no wiring in place, running the
system at 12 or 24 volts is often
more suitable.

Producing a power
analysis
The next step is to investigate your
power requirements by carrying out
a power analysis, where you
measure your power consumption in
watt-hours.
You can find out the wattage of
household appliances in one of four
ways:
·       Check the rear of the
appliance, or on the power
supply
·       Check the product manual

·       Measure the watts using a
watt meter
·       Find a ballpark figure for
similar items
Often a power supply will show an
output current in amps rather than
the number of watts the device
consumes. If the power supply also
shows the output voltage, you can
work out the wattage by multiplying
the voltage by the current (amps):
Power (watts) = Volts x Current
(amps)
P = V x I
For example, if you have a mobile

phone charger that uses 1.2 amps at
5 volts, you can multiply 1.2 amps
by 5 volts to work out the number of
watts: in this example, it equals 6
watts of power. If I plugged this
charger in for one hour, I would use
6 watt-hours of energy.
A watt meter is a useful tool for
measuring the energy requirements
of any device that runs on
high-voltage AC power from the
grid. The watt meter plugs into the
wall socket and the appliance plugs
into the watt meter. An LCD display
on the watt meter then displays the
amount of power the device is
using. This is the most accurate way

of measuring your true power
consumption.
Finding a ballpark figure for similar
devices is the least accurate way of
finding out the power requirement
and should only be done as a last
resort. A list of power ratings for
some common household
appliances is included in Appendix
C.
Once you have a list of the power
requirements for each electrical
device, draw up a table listing each
device, whether the device uses
12-volt or grid voltage, and the
power requirement in watts.

Then put an estimate in hours for
how long you will use each device
each day and multiply the watts by
hours to create a total watt-hour
energy requirement for each item.
You should also factor in any
‘phantom loads’ on the system. A
phantom load is the name given to
devices that use power even when
they are switched off. Televisions
in standby mode are one such
example, but any device that has a
power supply built into the plug
also has a phantom load. These
items should be unplugged or
switched off at the switch when not

in use. However, you may wish to
factor in a small amount of power
for items in standby mode, to take
into account the times you forget to
switch something off.
If you have a gas-powered central
heating system, remember that most
central heating systems have an
electric pump and the central
heating controller will require
electricity as well. A typical central
heating pump uses around 60 watts
of power a day, whilst a central
heating controller can use between
2 and 24 watts a day.
Once complete, your power

analysis will look like this:

A word of warning
In the headlong enthusiasm for
implementing a solar electric
system, it is very easy to
underestimate the amount of
electricity you need at this stage.
To be sure that you do not leave
something out which you regret
later, I suggest you have a break at

this point. Then return and review
your power analysis.
It can help to show this list to
somebody else in order to get their
input as well. It is very easy to get
emotionally involved in your solar
project, and having a second pair of
eyes can make a world of
difference later on.

When you are ready to
proceed
We now know exactly how much
energy we need to store in order to
provide one day of power. For our
holiday home example, that equates
to 662 watt-hours per day.
There is one more thing to take into
account: the efficiency of the
overall system.
Batteries, inverters and resistance
in the circuits all reduce the
efficiency of our solar electric
system. We must consider these
inefficiencies and add them to our

power analysis.

Calculating inefficiencies
Batteries do not return 100% of the
energy used to charge them. The
Charge Cycle Efficiency of the
battery measures the percentage of
energy available from the battery
compared to the amount of energy
used to charge it.
Charge cycle efficiency is not a
fixed figure, as the efficiency can
vary depending on how quickly you
charge and discharge the battery.
However, most solar applications
do not overstress batteries and so
the standard charge cycle efficiency
figures are usually sufficient.

Approximate charge cycle
efficiency figures are normally
available from the battery
manufacturers. However, for
industrial quality ‘traction’
batteries, you can assume 95%
efficiency, whilst gel batteries and
leisure batteries are usually in the
region of 90%.
If you are using an inverter in your
system, you need to factor in the
inefficiencies of the inverter. Again,
the actual figures should be
available from the manufacturer but
typically, you will find that an
inverter is around 90% efficient.

Adding the inefficiencies to
our power analysis
In our holiday home example, there
is no inverter. If there were, we
would need to add 10% for inverter
inefficiencies for every
grid-powered device.
We are using batteries. We need to
add 5% to the total energy
requirement to take charge cycle
efficiency into account.
5% of 662 equals 33 watts. Add
this to our power analysis, and our
total watt-hour requirement
becomes 695 watt-hours per day.

When do you need to use
the solar system?
It is important to work out at what
times of year you will be using your
solar electric system most. For
instance, if you are planning to use
your system full time during the
depths of winter, your solar electric
system needs to be able to provide
all your electricity even during the
dull days of winter.
A holiday home is often in regular
use during the spring, summer and
autumn, but left empty for periods
of time during the winter.

This means that, during winter, we
do not need our solar electric
system to provide enough electricity
for full occupancy. We need enough
capacity in the batteries to provide
enough electricity for, say, the
occasional long weekend. The solar
array can then recharge the batteries
again, once the home is empty.
We might also decide that, if we
needed additional electricity in
winter, we could have a small
standby generator on hand to give
the batteries a boost charge.
For the purposes of our holiday
home, our system must provide

enough electricity for full
occupancy from March to October
and occasional weekend use from
November until February.

Keeping it simple
You have seen what needs to be
taken into account when creating a
power analysis and calculating the
inefficiencies. If you are planning to
use the online tools to help you,
now is the time to use them.
Visit
www.SolarElectricityHandbook.com
and follow the links to either the
Off-Grid or Grid-Tied Solar
Project Analysis tools, which can
be found in the Online Calculators
section. This will allow you to
enter your devices on the power
analysis, select the months you want

your system to work and select your
location from a worldwide list. The
system will automatically e-mail
you a detailed solar analysis report
with all the calculations worked out
for you.

Improving the scope
Based on the work done, it is time
to put more detail on our original
scope. Originally, our scope looked
like this:
Provide an off-
grid holiday
home with its
entire electricity
requirements.
Now the improved scope has
become:
Provide an off-
grid holiday
home with its

entire electricity
requirements,
providing power
for lighting,
refrigeration,
TV, laptop
computer and
various sundries,
which equals
695 watt-hours
of electricity
consumption per
day.
The system must
provide enough
power for
occupation from

March until
October, plus
occasional
weekend use
during the
winter.
There is now a focus for the
project. We know what we need to
achieve for a solar electric system
to work. Now we need to go to the
site and see if what we want to do
is achievable.

In conclusion
·       Getting the scope right is
important for the whole
project
·       Start by keeping it simple
and then flesh it out by
calculating the energy
requirements for all the
devices you need to power
·       If you are designing a grid-
tie system, you do not need to
go into so much detail: you
can get the usage information
from your electricity
company. It is probably

included on your electricity
bill
·       If you are designing a grid-
tie system, you can make a
reasonable estimate of its
environmental benefit by
comparing solar energy
supply with your demand on a
month-by-month basis
·       Do not forget to factor in
‘phantom loads’
·       Because solar electric
systems run at low voltages,
running your devices at low
voltage is more efficient than
inverting the voltage to grid

levels first
·       Thanks to the popularity of
caravans and boats, there is a
large selection of 12-volt
appliances available. If you
are planning a stand-alone or
grid fallback system, you may
wish to use these in your
solar electric system rather
than less efficient
grid-voltage appliances
·       Even if you are planning a
grid-tie system, it is still
useful to carry out a detailed
power analysis
·       Do not forget to factor in

inefficiencies for batteries
and inverters
·       Take into account the times
of year that you need to use
your solar electric system
·       Once you have completed
this stage, you will know
what the project needs to
achieve in order to be
successful

Calculating Solar
Energy
The next two chapters are just as
useful for people wishing to install
a solar hot water system as they are
for people wishing to install solar
electricity.
Whenever I refer to solar panel or
solar array (multiple solar electric
panels) in these two chapters, the
information is equally valid for
solar electricity and solar hot
water.

What is solar energy?
Solar energy is a combination of the
hours of sunlight you get at your site
and the strength of that sunlight.
This varies depending on the time
of year and where you live.
This combination of hours and
strength of sunlight is called solar
insolation or solar irradiance, and
the results can be expressed as
watts per square metre (W/m²) or,
more usefully, in kilowatt-hours per
square metre spread over the period
of a day (kWh/m²/day). One square
metre is equal to 9.9 square feet.

Why is this useful?
Photovoltaic solar panels quote the
expected number of watts of power
they can generate, based on a solar
irradiance of 1,000 watts per
square metre. This figure is often
shown as a watts-peak (Wp) figure
and shows how much power the
solar panel can produce in ideal
conditions. A solar irradiance of
1,000 watts per square metre is
what you could expect to receive at
solar noon in the middle of summer
at the equator. It is not an average
reading that you could expect to
achieve on a daily basis.

However, once you know the solar
irradiance for your area, quoted as
a daily average (i.e. the number of
kilowatt-hours per square metre per
day), you can multiply this figure by
the wattage of the solar panel to
give you an idea of the daily amount
of energy you can expect your solar
panels to provide.
Calculating solar irradiance
Solar irradiance varies significantly
from one place to another and
changes throughout the year. In
order to come up with some
reasonable estimates, you need
irradiance figures for each month of

the year for your specific location.
Thanks to NASA, calculating your
own solar irradiance is simple.
NASA’s network of weather
satellites has been monitoring the
solar irradiance across the surface
of the earth for many decades. Their
figures have taken into account the
upper atmospheric conditions,
average cloud cover and surface
temperature, and are based on
sample readings every three hours
for the past quarter of a decade.
They cover the entire globe.
For reference, I have compiled this
information for different regions

across the United States, Canada,
Australia, New Zealand, the United
Kingdom and Ireland in Appendix
B.
The website goes further. We have
incorporated solar irradiance charts
for every major town and city in
every country in the world: simply
select your location from a
pull-down list of countries and
cities and you can view the
irradiance figures for your exact
area.
Using the information in Appendix
B, here are the solar irradiance
figures for London in the United

Kingdom, shown on a month-by-
month basis. They show the average
daily irradiance, based on mounting
the solar array flat on the ground:
Jan
Feb
Mar
Apr
Ma
0.75
1.37
2.31
3.57
4.5
These figures show how many
hours of equivalent midday sun we
get over the period of an average
day of each month. In the chart
above, you can see that in
December we get the equivalent of
0.6 of an hour of midday sun (36
minutes), whilst in June we get the
equivalent of 4.86 hours of midday

sunlight (4 hours and 50 minutes).
Capturing more of the sun’s
energy
The tilt of a solar panel has an
impact on how much sunlight you
capture: mount the solar panel flat
against a wall or flat on the ground
and you will capture less sunlight
throughout the day than if you tilt the
solar panels to face the sun.
The figures above show the solar
irradiance in London, based on the
amount of sunlight shining on a
single square metre of the ground. If
you mount your solar panel at an

angle, tilted towards the sun, you
can capture more sunlight and
therefore generate more power.
This is especially true in the winter
months, when the sun is low in the
sky.
The reason for this is simple: when
the sun is high in the sky the
intensity of sunlight is high. When
the sun is low in the sky the sunlight
is spread over a greater surface
area:

This diagram shows
the different
intensity of light
depending on the
angle of sun in the
sky. When the sun is
directly overhead, a
1m-wide shaft of
sunlight will cover a

1m-wide area on the
ground. When the
sun is low in the sky
– in this example, I
am using an angle of
30° towards the sun
– a 1m-wide shaft of
sunlight will cover a
2m-wide area on the
ground. This means
the intensity of the
sunlight is half as
much when the sun is
at an angle of 30°
compared to the
intensity of the
sunlight when the

sun is directly
overhead.
The impact of tilting solar
panels on solar irradiance
If we tilt our solar panels towards
the sun, it means we can capture
more of the sun’s energy to convert
into electricity. Often the angle of
this tilt is determined for you by the
angle of an existing roof. However,
for every location there are optimal
angles at which to mount your solar
array, in order to capture as much
solar energy as possible.
Using London as an example again,

this chart shows the difference in
performance of solar panels, based
on the angle at which they are
mounted. The angles I have shown
are flat on the ground, upright
against a wall, and mounted at
different angles designed to get the
optimal amount of solar irradiance
at different times of the year (I
explain the relevance of these
specific angles in a moment):

Note: All angles are
given in degrees

from vertical and are
location specific.
Look at the difference in the
performance based on the tilt of the
solar panel. In particular, look at
the difference in performance in the
depths of winter and in the height of
summer.
It is easy to see that some angles
provide better performance in
winter; others provide better
performance in summer, whilst
others provide a good compromise
all-year-round solution.
Calculating the optimum tilt

for solar panels
Because of the 23½° tilt of the earth
relative to the sun, the optimum tilt
of your solar panels will vary
throughout the year, depending on
the season. In some installations, it
is feasible to adjust the tilt of the
solar panels each month, whilst in
others it is necessary to have the
array fixed in position.
To calculate the optimum tilt of
your solar panels, you can use the
following sum:
90° – your latitude = optimum
fixed year-round setting
This angle is the optimum tilt for

fixed solar panels for
all-year-round power generation.
This does not mean that you will
get the maximum power output
every single month: it means that
across the whole year, this tilt will
give you the best compromise,
generating electricity all the year
round.
Getting the best from solar
panels at different times of the
year
Depending on when you want to use
your solar energy, you may choose
to use a different tilt in order to
improve power output at a given

point in the year. Each month of the
year, the angle of the sun in the sky
changes by 7.8° – higher in the
summer and lower in the winter. By
adjusting the tilt of your solar panel
to track the sun, you can tweak the
performance of your system
according to your requirements.
You may want to do this for a
number of reasons:
·       For a stand alone, off-
grid system, you often
need to get as much power
generation during the
winter months as possible
to counter the reduction in

natural light
·       When installing a grid-
tie system in a cool
climate, where the focus is
on reducing your carbon
footprint, you can choose
to boost your electricity
production in winter, to
offset the amount of
electricity you need to buy
when demand is at its
highest
·       When installing a grid-
tie system where the focus
is on making the most
profit by selling your

power, you can choose to
tilt your solar panels at a
summer setting and thereby
produce the maximum
amount of energy possible
over the course of the year
You can see this monthly optimum
angle (rounded to the nearest whole
degree) on the bottom row of the
previous table.
Optimum winter settings
Here is an example of how you
could tweak your system.
Performance of a solar system is at
its worst during the winter months.
However, by tilting your panels to

capture as much of the sunlight as
possible during the winter, you can
significantly boost the amount of
power you generate at this time.
Based on the Northern Hemisphere,
an optimum winter tilt for solar
panels is the optimum angle for
November and January. For the
Southern Hemisphere, the optimum
winter tilt is May and July:
90° – your latitude – 15.6° =
optimum winter setting
As you can see from the previous
table, if you tilt your solar panels at
this angle, you will sacrifice some
of your power generation capability

during the summer months.
However, as you are generating so
much more power during the
summer than you are in the winter,
this may not be an issue.
More importantly, compared to
leaving the panels on a flat surface,
you are almost doubling the amount
of power you can generate during
the three bleakest months of the
year. This means you can reduce the
number of solar panels you need to
install.
Optimum summer settings
If you wish to get the best output of
your system overall, you will find

that you will get slightly more
energy, when measured over the
course of the whole year, by angling
your solar panels to an optimum
summer time tilt.
In warm climates, where maximum
energy consumption is during hot
weather, angling your panels to get
the maximum amount of sunlight
during the height of summer can be
the best solution, both financially
and environmentally.
For Northern Hemisphere countries,
the optimum summer time tilt is the
optimum angle for May and July.
For Southern Hemisphere countries,

the optimum summer time tilt is the
optimum angle for November and
January:
90° – your latitude + 15.6° =
optimum summer setting
Positioning your solar panels
Regardless of where you live, the
sun always rises from the east and
sets in the west. If you live in the
Northern Hemisphere, solar panels
will always work best if they are
south-facing. In the Southern
Hemisphere, solar panels work best
if they are north-facing.
However, it is not always possible

to position your solar panels so they
are facing exactly the right way. For
instance, if you want to install solar
panels on the roof of the house, and
the roof faces east/west, then it may
not be practical to install solar
panels in any other location.
Thanks to improved solar panel
design over the past decade, this is
not as big a problem as was once
the case. Whilst the figure varies
slightly in different parts of the
world, from one solar panel
manufacturer to another and during
the different seasons of the year, the
average efficiency drop of a solar
panel mounted away from due south

(due north in the Southern
Hemisphere) is around 1.1% for
every five degrees.
This means that if your panels face
due east or due west, you can
expect around 20% loss of
efficiency compared to facing your
panels in the optimum position.
You can even face your panels in
the completely opposite direction –
north in the Northern Hemisphere or
south in the Southern Hemisphere –
losing around 40% of the efficiency
of your solar array by doing so.


For the Northern
Hemisphere, this
chart shows the
approximate
efficiency loss by not
facing your panels
directly south. For
Southern
Hemisphere
countries, the chart
should be reversed.
Using solar irradiance to work
out how much energy a solar
panel will generate
Based on these figures, we can
calculate on a monthly basis how

much power a solar panel will give
us per day, by multiplying the
monthly solar irradiance figure by
the stated wattage of the panel:
Solar Irradiance x Panel Wattage =
Watt-hours per day
As we now know, the solar
irradiance figure depends on the
month and the angle for the solar
panel. Assuming we have a 20-watt
solar panel, mounted flat on the
ground, here are the calculations for
London in December and June:

Flat
December
June
0.60 x 20W =
12 Wh of energy
per day
4.86 x
20W = 97 Wh
of energy per
day
As you can see, there is a big
difference in the amount of energy
you can generate in the middle of
summer, compared to winter. In the

example above, over eight times the
amount of energy is generated in the
height of summer compared to the
depths of winter.
Here are the same calculations
again, but with the solar panels
angled at 38° for best
all-year-round performance. Note
the significant improvement in
winter performance and the slightly
reduced summer performance:

38° angle
December
June
1.05 x 20W =
21 Wh of energy
per day
4.20 x
20W = 84 Wh
of energy per
day
Using solar irradiance to give
you an approximate guide for
the required power capacity of
your solar array
In the same way that you can work
out how much energy a solar panel
will generate per day, you can use
solar irradiance to give you an

approximate guide for the required
capacity of solar array that you
need.
I say an approximate guide, because
the actual capacity will also need
to take into account:
·       The peculiarities of your
site
·       The location and angles of
your solar panels
·       Any obstacles blocking the
sunlight at different times of
year
I cover all this in the next chapter
when I look at the site survey.

Nevertheless, it can be useful to
carry out this calculation in order to
establish a ballpark cost for your
solar electric system. The
calculation is simple: take the
figure you calculated for your total
number of watt-hours per day and
divide it by the solar irradiance
figure for the worst month that you
require your system to work.
Using our holiday home as an
example, we can look at our watt-
hours per day figure of 695Wh/day
and then divide this number by the
worst month on our irradiance chart
(December). It is worth doing this
based on mounting the solar panel

at different angles, to see how the
performances compare:

This chart tells us that to provide
full power for our holiday home in
December, we require a solar array
with a generation capacity of
between 643 watts and 1159 watts,
depending on the tilt of the solar
panels.
But remember our scope. We only
want to use the home full time from
March to October. The solar
electric system only needs to
provide enough electricity for a
long weekend during the winter.

This means that, so long as our
batteries are big enough to provide
electrical power for a few days, it
does not matter if the solar power
in winter is not enough to provide
for constant use. As soon as we
close up the holiday home again, the
solar panels will recharge the
batteries.
Here are my calculations again, this
time using October as our worst
month:

This chart tells us that we require a
solar array with a generation
capacity of between 288 watts and
411 watts, depending on the tilt of
the solar panels. Compared to our

earlier calculations for generating
power throughout the year, it is
much lower. We have just saved
ourselves a significant amount of
money.
You can also see that during the
summer months, the solar electric
system will generate considerably
more electricity than we will need
to run our holiday home. That is
fine. Too much is better than not
enough and it allows for the
occasions when a light is left
switched on or a TV is left on
standby.

Solar panels and shade
The biggest negative impact on
solar energy production is shade.
Even if only a very small amount of
your solar array is in shade, the
impact on the performance of your
whole system can have a very big
effect.
Unlike solar thermal (hot water)
systems, the loss of power through
shading is much greater than the
amount of the panel that is in shade.
With solar thermal systems, if 5%
of the panel is in shade, you lose
around 5% of the power
production.

Depending on the exact
circumstances, even if only 5% of a
photovoltaic solar panel is in
shade, it is possible to lose
50–80% of power production from
your entire solar array.
For this reason, it is hugely
important that your solar energy
system remains out of shade
throughout the day. Sometimes this
is not possible, and this requires
some additional design work in
order to keep the effect of shade on
your system to a minimum.
I cover shade in much more detail
in Appendix A, including an

explanation of why shade has such a
big impact on energy production.
For now, it is just important to
know that shading can significantly
affect the amount of energy you can
get from your solar energy system.

Solar array power point
efficiencies
Now we know the theoretical size
of our solar panels. However, we
have not taken into account the
efficiencies of the panels
themselves or the efficiencies of the
controller or inverter that handles
them.
Solar panels are rated on their
‘peak power output’. Peak power
on a solar panel in bright sunlight is
normally generated at between 14
and 20 volts. This voltage can go up
and down quite significantly,
depending on the amount of sunlight

available.
This swing in voltage gets much
higher if you have multiple solar
panels connected together in series
– or if you are using a
higher-voltage solar panel. It is
common for a solar array with
fifteen or twenty panels connected
in series to have voltage swings of
several hundred volts when a cloud
obscures the sun for a few seconds!
Managing this voltage swing can be
done in one of two ways. The cheap
and simple method is to cut the
voltage down to a setting that the
solar panel can easily maintain. For

instance, a solar panel rated at 12
volts will usually maintain a
voltage level of at least 14 volts
during daylight hours. A charge
controller or inverter that cuts the
voltage down to this level will then
always be able to use this power.
The disadvantage of this approach
is that, as you cut the voltage, the
wattage drops with it, meaning you
can lose a significant amount of
energy.
In terms of the amount of energy you
can capture, as opposed to what the
solar array collects, this method can
reduce the efficiency of a solar
array by around 25%.

A better solution is to use
controllers and inverters that
incorporate Maximum Power Point
Tracking (MPPT). Maximum
power point tracking adjusts the
voltage from the solar array to
provide the correct voltage for the
batteries or for the inverter in order
to remove this inefficiency.
Maximum power point trackers are
typically 90–95% efficient. Over
the past three years, the price of
MPPT controllers and inverters has
dropped and the availability has
increased to the point where it is
almost always worth buying an

MPPT controller and inverter for
all but the very smallest and
simplest solar installations.
Incidentally, you only need an
MPPT inverter for grid-tie systems
where you are powering the
inverter directly from the solar
panels. You do not require an
MPPT inverter if you are planning
to run the inverter through a battery
bank.
To take into account power point
efficiencies, you need to divide
your calculation by 0.9 if you plan
to use a MPPT controller or
inverter, and by 0.75 if you plan to

use a non-MPPT controller or
inverter:

The effects of
temperature on solar
panels
Solar panels will generate less
power when exposed to high
temperatures compared to when
they are in a cooler climate. Solar
PV systems can often generate more
electricity on a day with a cool
wind and a hazy sun than when the
sun is blazing and the temperature is
high.
When solar panels are given a
wattage rating, they are tested at
25°C (77°F) against a 1,000 W/m²

light source. At a cooler
temperature, the solar panel will
generate more electricity, whilst at
a warmer temperature the same
solar panel will generate less.
As solar panels are exposed to the
sun, they heat up, mainly due to the
infrared radiation they are
absorbing. As solar panels are
dark, they can heat up quite
considerably. In a hot climate, a
solar panel can quite easily heat up
to 80–90°C (160–175°F).
Solar panel manufacturers provide
information to show the effects of
temperature on their panels. Called

a temperature coefficient of power
rating, it is shown as a percentage
of total power reduction per 1°C
increase in temperature.
Typically, this figure will be in the
region of 0.5%, which means that
for every 1°C increase in
temperature, you will lose 0.5%
efficiency from your solar array,
whilst for every 1°C decrease in
temperature you will improve the
efficiency of your solar array by
0.5%.
Assuming a temperature coefficient
of power rating of 0.5%, this is the
impact on performance for a 100W

solar panel at different
temperatures:

In northern Europe and Canada,
high temperature is not a significant
factor when designing a solar

system. However, in southern states
of America and in Africa, India,
Australia and the Middle East,
where temperatures are
significantly above 25°C (77°F) for
much of the year, the temperature of
the solar panels may be an
important factor when planning your
system.
If you are designing a system for
all-year-round use, then in all
fairness a slight dip in performance
at the height of summer is probably
not an issue for you. If that is the
case, you do not need to consider
temperature within the design of
your system and you can skip this

information.
If your ambient temperature is high
during the times of year you need to
get maximum performance from
your solar panels, then you will
need to account for temperature in
your design.
You can help reduce the
temperature of your solar panels by
ensuring a free flow of air both
above and below the panels. If you
are planning to mount your solar
panels on a roof, make sure there is
a gap of around 7–10cm (3–4")
below the panels, to allow a flow
of air around them. Alternatively,

you can consider mounting the
panels on a pole, which will also
aid cooling.
For a roof-top installation, if the
average air temperature at a
particular time of year is
25°C/77°F or above, multiply this
temperature in Celsius by 1.4 in
order to get a likely solar panel
temperature. For a pole-mounted
installation, multiply your air
temperature by 1.2 in order to
calculate the likely solar panel
temperature. Then increase your
wattage requirements by the
percentage loss shown in the
temperature coefficient of power

rating shown on your solar panels,
in order to work out the wattage you
need your solar panels to generate.
Temperature impact on solar
performance in Austin, Texas
during the summer months
By way of an example, here is a
table for Austin in Texas. This
shows average air temperatures for
each month of the year, the
estimated solar panel temperature
for the hottest months of the year
and the impact on the performance
on the solar array, assuming a
temperature coefficient of power
rating of 0.5%.

calculations in rows 3 and 5 of the

So, for July, the calculation for
roof-mounted solar was (41°C –
25°C) x (–0.5) = –8%
For around five months of the year,
the ambient temperature in Austin is
greater than 25°C/77°F. During
these months, the higher temperature
will mean lower power output from
a solar array. If you are designing a
system that must operate at
maximum efficiency during the
height of summer, you will need to
increase the size of your solar array
by the percentages shown, in order
to handle this performance
decrease.

You can find the average ambient
air temperature for your location by
visiting The Weather Channel
website at www.weather.com. This
excellent site provides average
monthly temperatures for towns and
cities across the world, shown in
your choice of Fahrenheit or
Celsius.
Our example holiday home project
is in the United Kingdom, where the
temperature is below 25°C for most
of the year. In addition, our solar
design will produce more power
than we need during the summer
months. As a result, we can ignore

temperature in our particular
project.

Working out an
approximate cost
It is worth stressing again that these
figures are only approximate at this
stage. We have not yet taken into
account the site itself and we are
assuming that shading will not be an
issue.
If you are planning to do the
physical installation yourself, a
solar electric system consisting of
solar array, controller and battery
costs around £4.00 ($6.20 US) per
watt, +/– 15%.
A grid-tie system is cheaper to

install than a stand-alone system, as
you do not need to budget for
batteries. You will, however, need
a qualified electrician to certify the
system before use. In most
countries, you will also need all the
components used in your solar
installation to be certified as
suitable for grid installation. If you
are planning grid-tie, budget around
£2.00–£3.00 ($3.10–$4.60 US) per
watt, +/– 15%.
For our holiday home installation,
we need 320 watts of solar
electricity if we tilt the solar panels
towards the sun, or 456 watts if we
mount the panels flat. Our rough

estimate suggests a total system cost
of around £1,280 ($1,970 US), +/–
15% for tilted panels, or £1,824
($2,800 US) +/– 15% for a flat
panel installation.
If you remember, the cost to connect
this holiday home to a conventional
electricity supply was £4,500
($7,200). Therefore, installing solar
energy is the cheaper option for
providing electricity for our home.
What if the figures do not add
up?
In some installations, you will get
to this stage and find out that a solar

electric system simply is
unaffordable. This is not
uncommon. I was asked to calculate
the viability for using 100% solar
energy at an industrial unit once,
and came up with a ballpark figure
of £33½m (around $54m)!
When this happens, you can do one
of two things: walk away, or go
back to your original scope and see
what can be changed.
The best thing to do is go back to
the original power analysis and see
what savings you can make. Look at
the efficiencies of the equipment
you are using and see if you can

make savings by using
lower-energy equipment or
changing the way equipment is
used.
If you are absolutely determined to
implement a solar electric system,
there is usually a way to do it.
However, you may need to be
ruthless as to what you have to
leave out.
In the example of the industrial unit,
the underlying requirement was to
provide emergency lighting and
power for a cluster of computer
servers if there was a power cut.
The cost for implementing this

system was around £32,500
($52,000): comparable in cost to
installing and maintaining on-site
emergency generators and UPS
equipment.

Working out dimensions
Now we know the capacity of the
solar panels, we can work out an
approximate size of our solar array.
This is extremely useful information
to know before we carry out our
site survey: the solar panels have to
go somewhere. We need to be able
to find enough suitable space for
them where they will receive
uninterrupted sunshine in a safe
location.
There are two main technologies of
solar panels on the market:
amorphous and crystalline solar
panels. I will explain the

characteristics and the advantages
and disadvantages of each, later on.
For the purposes of working out
how much space you’re going to
need to fit the solar panels, you
need to know that a 1m²
(approximately 9.9 square feet)
amorphous solar panel generates in
the region of 60 watts, whilst a 1m²
crystalline solar panel generates in
the region of 160 watts.
Therefore, for our holiday home,
we are looking for a location where
we can fit between 5 and 7.6m²
(49–75 square feet) of amorphous
solar panels or 2–3m² (20–29

square feet) of crystalline solar
panels.

In conclusion
·       By calculating the amount of
solar energy theoretically
available at our site, we can
calculate ballpark costs for
our solar electric system
·       There are various
inefficiencies that must be
considered when planning
your system. If you do not
take these into account, your
system may not generate
enough power
·       It is not unusual for these
ballpark costs to be far too

expensive on your first
attempt. The answer is to
look closely at your original
scope and see what can be cut
in order to produce a cost-
effective solution
·       As well as working out
ballpark costs, these
calculations also help us
work out the approximate
dimensions of the solar array.
This means we know how
much space we need to find
when we are carrying out a
site survey

Surveying Your Site
The site survey is one of the most
important aspects of designing a
successful solar system. It will
identify whether or not your site is
suitable for solar. If it is, the survey
identifies the ideal position to
install your system, ensuring that
you get the best value for money
and the best possible performance.

What we want to achieve
For a solar electric system to work
well, we need the site survey to
answer two questions:
·       Is there anywhere on the site
that is suitable for positioning
my solar array?
·       Do nearby obstacles such as
trees and buildings shade out
too much sunlight?
The first question might at first
sound daft but, depending on your
project, it can make the difference
between a solar energy system
being viable or not.

By answering the second question,
you can identify how much of the
available sunlight you will be able
to capture. It is vitally important
that you answer this question. The
number one reason for solar energy
failing to reach expectations is
obstacles blocking out sunlight,
which dramatically reduces the
efficiency of the system.
To answer this second question, we
need to be able to plot the position
of the sun through the sky at
different times of the year. During
the winter, the sun is much lower in
the sky than it is during the summer

months. It is important to ensure that
the solar array can receive direct
sunlight throughout the day during
the winter.
What you will need
You will need a compass, a
protractor, a spirit level and a tape
measure.
Inevitably a ladder is required if
you are planning to mount the solar
array on a roof. A camera can also
be extremely useful for
photographing the site. If you have
an iPhone or an Android cell phone,
you can also download some cheap
software that will help you identify

the path of the sun across the sky
and assist with obstacle analysis.
I also find it useful to get some
large cardboard boxes. Open them
out and cut them into the rough size
of your proposed solar array. This
can help you when finding a
location for your solar panels. It is
far easier to envisage what the
installation will look like and it can
help highlight any installation issues
that you might otherwise have
missed.
If you have never done a solar site
survey before, it does help if you
visit the site on a sunny day.

Once you have more experience
with doing solar site surveys, you
will find it does not actually make
much difference whether you do
your site survey on a sunny day or
an overcast day. As part of the site
survey, we manually plot the sun’s
position across the sky, so once you
have more experience, sunny
weather actually makes little
difference to the quality of the
survey.

First impressions
When you first arrive on the site,
the first thing to check is that the
layout of the site gives it access to
sunlight.
We will use a more scientific
approach for checking for shade
later, but a quick look first often
highlights problems without needing
to carry out a more in-depth survey.
If you are in the Northern
Hemisphere, look from east,
through south and to the west to
ensure there are no obvious
obstructions that can block the
sunshine, such as trees and other

buildings. If you are in the Southern
Hemisphere, you need to check
from east, through north to west for
obstructions. If you are standing on
the equator, the sun passes
overhead, so only obstructions in
the east and west are important.
Be very careful not to look directly
at the sun, even for a few moments,
whilst you are carrying out this
survey. Even in the middle of
winter, retina burn can cause
permanent damage to your eyesight.
Look around the site and identify all
the different options for positioning
the solar array. If you are

considering mounting your solar
array on a roof, remember that the
world looks a very different place
from a roof-top, and obstructions
that are a problem standing on the
ground look very different when
you are at roof height.
Drawing a rough sketch of the
site
It can be helpful to draw up a rough
sketch of the site. It does not have to
be accurate, but it can be a useful
tool to have, both during the site
survey and afterwards when you are
designing your system.

Include all properties and trees that
are close to your site and not just
those on your land. Include trees
that are too small to worry about
now, but may become a problem in
a few years’ time. Also make a note
of which way is north.

Positioning the solar
array
Your next task is to identify the best
location to position your solar
array. Whilst you may already have
a good idea where you want to
install your solar panels, it is
always a good idea to consider all
the different options available to
you.
As we discovered in the last
chapter, solar arrays perform at
their best when tilted towards the
sun.
If you are planning to install solar

energy for a building, then the roof
of the building can often be a
suitable place to install the solar
array. This is effective where the
roof is south-facing or where the
roof is flat and you can fit the
panels using angled mountings.
Other alternatives are to mount
solar panels on a wall. This can
work well with longer, slimmer
panels that can be mounted at an
angle without protruding too far out
from the wall itself. Alternatively,
solar panels can be ground-mounted
or mounted on a pole.
When considering a position for

your solar array, you need to
consider how easy it is going to be
to clean the solar panels. Solar
panels do not need to be spotless,
but dirt and grime will reduce the
efficiency of your solar system over
time, so while you are looking at
mounting solutions it is definitely
worth considering how you can
access your panels to give them a
quick wash every few months.
Roof-mounting
If you are planning to mount your
solar array on a roof, you need to
gain access to the roof to check its
suitability.

Use a compass to check the
direction of the roof. If it is not
directly facing south, you may need
to construct an angled support in
order to get the panels angled
correctly.
You will also need to find out the
pitch of the roof. Professionals use
a tool called a Roof Angle Finder
to calculate this. Roof angle finders
(also called Magnetic Polycast
Protractors) are low-cost tools
available from builders’ merchants.
You press the angle finder up
against the rafters underneath the
roof and the angle finder will show

the angle in degrees.
Alternatively, you can calculate the
angle using a protractor at the base
of a roof rafter underneath the roof
itself.
Solar panels in themselves are not
heavy: 15–20 kilograms (33–44
pounds) at most. Yet when multiple
panels are combined with a frame,
especially if that frame is angled,
the overall weight can become quite
significant.
Check the structure of the roof.
Ensure that it is strong enough to
take the solar array and to ascertain
what fixings you will need. It is

difficult to provide general advice
on roof structures and fixings. There
are so many different roof designs it
is not possible for me to provide
much useful information on this
subject. If you are not certain about
the suitability of your roof, ask a
builder or an architect to assess
your roof for you.
Roof-mounting kits are available
from solar panel suppliers.
Alternatively, you can make your
own.
If it does not compromise your
solar design, it can be quite useful
to mount your solar panels at the

lowest part of the roof. This can
make it considerably easier to keep
the panels clean: most window
cleaners will happily wash
easily-accessible solar panels if
they are situated at the bottom of the
roof, and telescopic window
cleaner kits are available to reach
solar panels at the lower end of a
roof structure.
Measure and record the overall
roof-space available for a solar
array. It is also a good idea to use
the cardboard cut-outs you made
earlier and place these on the roof
to give a ‘look and feel’ for the
installation and help you identify

any installation issues you may have
with positioning and mounting the
solar array.
Ground-mounting
If you want to mount your solar
array on the ground, you will need a
frame onto which you can mount
your solar panels. Most solar panel
suppliers can supply suitable
frames or you can fabricate your
own on site.
There are benefits for a ground-
mounted solar array: you can easily
keep the panels clean and you can
use a frame to change the angle of

the array at different times of year
to track the height of the sun in the
sky.
Take a note of ground conditions, as
you will need to build foundations
for your frame.
Incidentally, you can buy
ground-mounted solar frames that
can also move the panel to track the
sun across the sky during the day.
These Solar Trackers can increase
the amount of sunlight captured by
around 15–20% in winter and up to
55% in summer.
Unfortunately, at present,
commercial solar trackers are

expensive. Unless space is at an
absolute premium, you would be
better to spend your money on a
bigger solar array.
However, for a keen DIY engineer
who likes the idea of a challenge, a
solar tracker that moves the array to
face the sun as it moves across the
sky during the day could be a useful
and interesting project to do. There
are various sites on the internet,
such as instructables.com, where
keen hobbyists have built their own
solar trackers and provide
instructions on how to make them.
Pole-mounting

Another option for mounting a solar
panel is to affix one on a pole.
Because of the weight and size of
the solar panel, you will need an
extremely good foundation and a
heavyweight pole, in order to
withstand the wind.
You can mount up to 600-watt
arrays using single-pole mountings.
Larger arrays can be pole-mounted
using frames constructed using two
or four poles.
Most suppliers of solar panels and
associated equipment can provide
suitable poles.

Splitting the solar array into
several smaller arrays
It may be that when you get to the
site, you find that there is no one
space available that will allow you
to install all the solar panels you
need. If this is the case, it is
possible to split your single solar
array into several smaller arrays.
This means, for instance, that you
could have two sets of panels
mounted on different roof pitches,
or some mounted on a roof and
some from a pole.
If you do this, you are creating two
separate solar energy systems,

which you then have to link
together. For a grid-tie system, you
would require either a micro-
inverter system or an inverter that
can accept inputs from more than
one solar array. For a stand-alone
system, you would require a battery
controller for each separate solar
array.

Identifying the path of
the sun across the sky
Once you have identified a suitable
position for your solar array, it is
time to be a little more scientific in
ensuring there are no obstructions
that will block sunlight at different
times of the day, or at certain times
of the year.
The path of the sun across the sky
changes throughout the year. This is
why carrying out a site survey is so
important: you cannot just check to
see where the sun is shining today.
The height and position of the sun
constantly changes throughout the

year.
Each year, there are two days in the
year when the day is exactly twelve
hours long. These two days are 21st
March and 21st September, the
solar equinoxes. On these
equinoxes the sun rises due east of
the equator and sets due west of the
equator. At solar noon on the
equinox, exactly six hours after the
sun has risen, the angle of the sun is
90° minus the local latitude.
In the Northern Hemisphere (i.e.
north of the equator), the longest
day of the year is 21st June and the

shortest day of the year is 21st
December. These two days are the
summer and winter solstices
respectively.
On the summer solstice, the angle of
the sun is 23.5° higher than it is on
the equinox, whilst on the winter
solstice the angle is 23.5° lower
than on the equinox.
These two extremes are due to the
tilt of the earth, relative to its orbit
around the sun. In the Northern
Hemisphere, the summer solstice
occurs when the North Pole is tilted
towards the sun, and the winter
solstice occurs when the North Pole

is tilted away from the sun.

Figure 4: This chart
shows the different
paths of the sun from
sunrise to sunset at
different times of the
year from the
Northern
Hemisphere. The
intersection between
N, S, E and W is your
location.
We will take London in the United
Kingdom as an example. London’s
latitude is 51°. On the equinox, the
angle of the sun at noon will be 39°
(90° – 51°). On the summer

solstice, the angle will be 62.5°
(39° + 23.5°) and on the winter
solstice, it will be 15.5° (39° –
23.5°).

Shading
As mentioned in a previous chapter,
shading can have a very significant
impact on the performance of your
solar energy system. Even a tiny
amount of shading can have a huge
impact on the amount of energy that
your system is able to generate.
Therefore, it is important that your
solar array remains shade-free
whenever possible.
You can carry out this analysis in
various ways. You can use a
professional obstacle analysis tool,
you can download an obstacle
analysis tool onto your cell phone

or you can use paper and pencil to
come up with a rough plan.
Professional tools for obstacle
analysis
In the past, a product called a Solar
Pathfinder was one of the best
tools you could get. This was a
plastic unit with an angle chart
mounted on the top. A glass dome
was then placed on top of the chart.
You would mount the unit onto a
tripod at the desired location.
Obstacles were reflected in the
glass bubble and this would allow
you to manually plot the obstacles
on the chart and then manually work

out your shading issues.
The Solar Pathfinder is surprisingly
effective, as it can be easily moved
around in order to find the best
location for solar panels. Many
professional solar installers still
use a Solar Pathfinder for quick
checks, despite also using the more
expensive and advanced electronic
equipment to provide a more
detailed analysis.
Some solar suppliers can rent you a
Solar Pathfinder for a small daily
or weekly fee and can do the
manual calculations for you once
you have plotted the obstacles.

Today there are electronic systems
that use GPS, tilt switches and
accelerometers to do this work
electronically. They are expensive
to buy or rent on a daily basis. They
do provide extremely
comprehensive solar analysis,
however, and if you plan to take up
solar installations professionally,
they are a worthwhile investment.
The best known is the Asset from
Wiley Electronics and the SunEye
from Solmetric. My personal
preference is SunEye, as I find the
unit simpler, but both products do a
similar job.

Cell phone applications
Whilst they are very good, these
tools are overkill for smaller solar
installations and are often very
complicated to use. Thankfully,
modern smart phones provide the
processing power and functionality
to do a similar job. A few
companies have now developed
solar shade analysis software to run
on these mobile phones. These use
the phone’s built-in GPS, compass,
accelerometer and camera to record
a complete shade analysis in a
matter of a few moments.
If you have an iPhone, you can

download a product called
Solmetric IPV. Costing $29.99, this
application handles your obstacle
tracking, automatically providing
charts showing your shading
analysis throughout the year. The
detail of reporting is not as great as
some of the other electronic tools,
but more and more professionals
are now using this software. It
provides most of the functions that
you get with a more expensive
system, but in a package that is
easier to use and far cheaper to buy.
You can find out more about
Solmetric IPV from
www.solmetric.com and the

software can be downloaded from
the iTunes website.
Alternatively, there is an Android
phone download called Solar
Shading, produced by Comoving
Magnetics. Costing $15 on the
Android Market, this application
provides you with a complete
shading analysis throughout the
year, presenting the information in
easy-to-read charts.

Above: Examples of
on-screen reports
from Solmetric IPV
running on the

iPhone.

from Solar Shading,

phones.

Using paper and pencil
Finally, if you do not have access to
a professional tool or a suitable
mobile phone, you can use the old-
fashioned method of paper and
pencil. Go to the position where
you are planning to put your solar
array and find due south with a
compass. Looking from the same
height as your proposed location,
and working from east to west,
check there are no obstacles, such
as trees or buildings, that can shade
the sun at different times of the day
or when the sun is at its lowest
winter height.

To do this, you will need to find out
what position the sun rises and sets
at different times of the year.
Thankfully, this is easy to find out.
The solar angle calculator which
you can find at
www.SolarElectricityHandbook.com
includes this information, making it
easy to identify the path of the sun at
these different times of the year.
For a simple one-off site survey, the
easiest way to identify potential
obstructions is to use a protractor
and pencil. Tape the pencil to the
centre of the protractor where all
the lines meet, in such a way that

the other end of the pencil can be
moved across the protractor. You
can use this protractor to check the
field of view, using the pencil as an
‘aimer’ to show the angle of the sun
in the sky based on different times
of the year.
Be very careful not to look directly

at the sun, even for a few moments,
whilst you are carrying out this
survey. Even in the middle of
winter, retina burn can cause
permanent damage to your eyesight.
Your survey needs to ensure there
are no obstacles in the depths of
winter, when the sun is only a few
degrees up in the sky.
In the case of London, on the 21st
December the sun will be only
15½° high at midday (at due south)
and lower than that for the rest of
the day.
If there are obstacles that are
blocking visibility of the sun, find

another location. Alternatively, find
other ways around the obstacle,
such as mounting the solar array
higher up on a frame.
Of course, if you do not need your
solar system to produce much
power during the winter months this
may not be a problem for you.
However, make sure obstacles do
not shade your system for the times
of year when you need power.

Future proof your system
You do need to consider the future
when installing a solar electric
system. The system will have a
lifetime of at least 20 years, so as
far as possible you need to ensure
that the system will be effective for
that length of time.
When scanning the horizon, take
into account that trees and hedges
will grow during the lifetime of the
system. A small spruce in a nearby
garden could grow into a monster in
the space of a few years, and if that
is a risk, it is best to know about it
now, rather than have a nasty

surprise a few years down the line.
See if there is any planned building
work nearby that may overshadow
your site and try to assess the
likelihood of future building work
that could have an impact on
shading.
It is also worth finding out if fog or
heavy mist is a problem at certain
times of the year. The efficiency of
your solar array will be
compromised if the site has regular
problems with heavy mist.
What if there are shading
obstructions?

If there are obstructions that shade
your proposed location, and there
are no other locations that are
suitable for solar, you need to
ascertain at what point during the
day the obstructions occur.
Anything due south (or due north
in the Southern Hemisphere) is a
major problem, as this will be the
position of the sun when the
intensity of the sunlight is at its
highest. Core power generation
occurs between 9am and 3pm. If
you have shading either before 9am
or after 3pm, you will lose around
20% of your capability in the

summer, or 40% of your capability
if you have shading both before 9am
and after 3pm.
During the winter, the difference
is not so great. If you have shading
before 9am or after 3pm during the
winter, you will probably lose only
around 5–10% of your generating
capabilities during this time.
If you have shading during your
core power generation times, you
need to give serious thought as to
whether you should continue with a
solar implementation: the
performance of your solar system
will be severely compromised.

If you do have significant
shading issues and you want to find
out the exact impact of these
obstructions on your solar array,
you are going to need to use a
professional tool for obstacle
analysis. The electronic tools will
be able to quantify exactly what the
impact of the shade is on your
system at different times of the year.
If obstructions occur for part of the
day, such as during the morning or
during the afternoon, you can
consider increasing the number of
solar panels you purchase and
angling them away from the

obstruction in order to increase
their collection of sunlight during
the unobstructed parts of the day.
Alternatively, you may be better
off investigating other energy
options, such as wind power or fuel
cells, either instead of using solar
or in combination with a smaller
solar electric system.
Appendix A looks at the issue of
shading in a lot more detail and
explains how you can work around
obstruction issues. It is always best
to avoid shade as far as possible,
because workarounds can become
costly. However, if you cannot

eliminate shade altogether, it need
not write off solar as a solution that
can work for you.

Positioning batteries,
controllers and inverters
You need to identify a suitable
location for batteries. This could be
a room within a building, in a
garage or garden shed, or in a
weatherproof battery housing.
It is important to try to keep all the
hardware close together, in order to
keep the cable lengths as short as
possible. By ‘hardware’, I am
referring to the solar array itself,
batteries, controller and inverter.
For the batteries, inverter and
controller, you are looking for a

location that fits the following
criteria:
·       Water- and weather proof
·       Not affected by direct
sunlight
·       Insulated to protect against
extremes of temperature
·       Facilities to ventilate gases
from the batteries
·       Protected from sources of
ignition
·       Away from children, pets
and rodents
Lead acid batteries give off very

small quantities of hydrogen when
charging. Hydrogen is explosive.
You must ensure that, wherever
your batteries are stored, the area
receives adequate external
ventilation to ensure these gases
cannot build up.
Because of the extremely high
potential currents involved with
lead acid batteries, the batteries
must be in a secure area away from
children and pets.
For all of the above reasons,
batteries are often mounted on
heavy-duty racking, which is then
made secure using an open-mesh

cage. Alternatively, you can
purchase purpose-built battery
enclosures from solar or battery
suppliers.
Controllers and inverters need to be
mounted as close to the batteries as
possible. These are often
wall-mounted, but can also be
mounted to racking.
Large inverters can be extremely
heavy, so if you are planning to
wall-mount one, make sure that the
wall is load-bearing and able to
take the weight.

Cabling
While you are on site, consider
likely routes for cables, especially
the heavy-duty cables that link the
solar array, controller, batteries and
inverter together. Try to keep cable
lengths as short as possible, as
longer cables mean lower
efficiency. Measure the lengths of
these cables so that you can
ascertain the correct specification
for cables when you start planning
the installation.

Site survey for the
holiday home
Back to our holiday home example:
based on our previous calculations,
our holiday home needs a solar
array capable of generating 320
watt-hours of energy, if we angle
the array towards the sun. This
solar array will take up
approximately 2m² (18 sq. ft) of
surface area.
Our site survey for the holiday
home showed the main pitch of the
roof is facing east to west. This is
not ideal for a solar array. The
eastern side of the roof has a

chimney. There is shade from a tall
tree that obscures part of the west-
facing part of the roof. There is no
space on the gable end of the roof to
fit the required solar panels.


Map of the holiday
home, identifying
likely obstacles and
a suitable position
for the solar array
An old shed close to the house has a
south-facing roof, but only a 20°
pitch. A tree shades the shed for
most of the mornings for nine
months of the year. Furthermore, the
condition of the shed means that it
would need significant remedial
work should we decide to use it.
There is a farm to the east of the
house, with a large barn and a
number of trees bordering the

house, the tallest of which is
approximately 30 feet (10m) tall.
One of these trees provides shade
to the shed and part of the rear of
the house during the winter, and
may provide more shade during the
rest of the year if it continues to
grow.
The garden is south-facing and
receives sunlight throughout the
year.
We decide to install the solar array
in the rear garden, constructing a
suitable 1.2m (4 feet) tall garden
store with a south-facing pitched
roof of approximately 52°

(allowing us to tilt the solar array at
38° from vertical for best year-
round sunshine). Our solar house
will hold the batteries and
controller and will have adequate
ventilation to ensure that the small
amounts of hydrogen generated by
the batteries can escape. By
building our own structure, we can
install the solar array at the
optimum tilt to capture as much
sunlight as possible. This means our
solar array is compact and keeps
our costs to a minimum.
The solar house will be located
around 10m (33 feet) from the
house and shielded from the house

by a new shrubbery.
The cable lengths between the solar
array and the solar controller are
approximately 2m (6½ feet). The
cable length between the solar
controller and the batteries is less
than 1m (3 feet). The cable length
between the solar house and the
home is 12m (40 feet). There is a
further 10m (33 feet) of cabling
inside the house.
These longer cable lengths are not
ideal. Cable runs should be as short
as possible in order to reduce
power losses through the cable.
However, we cannot position the

solar array any nearer to the house.
We will have to address this
particular problem through our
design.

In conclusion
·       There is a lot to do on a site
survey. It is important. Spend
time; get it right.
·       Drawing a map and taking
photographs can help with the
site survey and are invaluable
for the next stage, when we
start designing our new
system.
·       Solar panels can be
roof-mounted, mounted with a
frame on the ground or on a
pole.
·       Once you have identified a

location for the panels, check
for obstructions that will
shade the panels throughout
the year.
·       These obstructions are most
likely to be an issue during
the winter months, when solar
energy is at a premium.
·       Identify a suitable space for
batteries, controller and
inverter.
·       Plan the cable runs and the
measure the length of the
required cables.
·       Cables should be as short as

possible, in order to reduce
the voltage losses through the
system. If long cable lengths
are necessitated by the
positioning of the solar array,
we may need to run our
system at a higher voltage to
compensate.

Understanding the
Components
Once you have completed your site
survey, you know all the facts: how
much power you need to generate,
the suitability of your site and
approximately how much it is going
to cost you.
Now you need to look at the
different technologies and products
that are available, to see what best
suits you and your application.
Your choice of components and the
design of your system will depend

on whether you are designing a
stand-alone system (which also
includes grid fallback and grid
failover systems), or a grid-tie
system that exports energy to the
grid.
Because there are differences in the
design of stand-alone and grid-tie
systems, I have split this section
into four chapters. This chapter
looks at components that are
common to both grid-tie systems
and stand-alone systems. The next
chapter looks specifically at what
you require for grid-tie systems.
The third chapter looks specifically
at stand-alone systems and systems

that incorporate their own battery
store, whilst the fourth chapter
looks at the component certification
and regulations that you need to take
into account when selecting solar
energy equipment.
How to use these chapters
These next three chapters will go
into much more detail about the
different options available to you.
There is a bewildering choice of
solar panels, batteries, controllers,
inverters and cables.
These chapters explain the
technology in a lot more detail, so

you can go and talk sensibly to
suppliers and understand what they
are saying.

Common components for
all systems
Core to all solar energy systems are
the solar panels themselves. Most
solar panels can be used for either
grid-tie or stand-alone use, and
although recently some
manufacturers have released
higher-voltage solar panels
designed specifically for grid-tie
applications, the criteria for
choosing one solar panel over
another remain the same.

Solar panels
There are three different
technologies used for producing
solar panels. Each has its own set
of benefits and disadvantages.
For the purpose of this handbook, I
am ignoring the expensive solar
cells used on satellites and in
research laboratories and focusing
on the photovoltaic panels that are
available commercially at
reasonable cost today.
Amorphous solar panels
The cheapest solar technology is
amorphous solar panels, also

known as thin-film solar panels.
These panels have had a bad
reputation in the past, with poor
product reliability and questionable
lifespan. This has often been down
to the chemistries used in older
designs of panel breaking down
under extremes of temperature over
a period of a few years, or the poor
quality of materials used in the
production of cheap panels.
Thankfully, this technology has
matured significantly over the past
five years and amorphous solar is
now regarded as being highly
reliable, with some significant

benefits over traditional solar
panels. Big name manufacturers
such as Mitsubishi, Sanyo and
Sharp now manufacture high-quality
amorphous solar panels, along with
some exceptionally good specialist
manufacturers such as Solar
Frontier and Uni-Solar. Some
manufacturers now even offer a ten-
or twenty-year warranty on their
amorphous panels.
On paper, amorphous solar panels
are the least-efficient panels
available, typically converting
around 6–8% of available sunlight
to electricity. This means that you
need twice as much space available

for installing amorphous solar
panels compared to crystalline
panels.
However, amorphous panels are
good at generating power even on
overcast and extremely dull days. In
general, they are also far better in
extreme temperature conditions,
with significantly less power loss at
higher temperatures than other solar
panel technologies.
Unlike other solar panel
technologies, amorphous solar
panels provide excellent
performance even when partially
shaded. Whilst a best-case scenario

is to eliminate shading whenever
and wherever possible, amorphous
panels continue to operate at a high
level of efficiency even if part of
the array is in shade.
Amorphous panels can also be
manufactured into a shape or
mounted on a curved surface. They
can be made to be hard-wearing
enough to be fitted onto surfaces
that can be walked on. A few solar
manufacturers have started
manufacturing amorphous solar roof
tiles (or shingles), so that new-
build houses can incorporate solar
into the structure of the roof.

This combination makes amorphous
panels suitable for integration into
consumer products such as mobile
phones and laptop computers, and
for mobile products such as the roof
of an RV or caravan, where the
manufacturer has no control over
where the products are placed or
how they are used.
Amorphous panels are the cheapest
panels to manufacture and a number
of manufacturers are now screen-
printing low-cost amorphous solar
films. Over the past three years,
amorphous solar panel costs have
dropped by around 30% each year.

They are expected to drop to around
half their current (2012) cost by
2015.
Because of their lower efficiency,
an amorphous solar panel has to be
much larger than the equivalent
polycrystalline solar panel. As a
result, amorphous solar panels can
only be used either where there is
no size restriction on the solar array
or where the overall power
requirement is very low.
In terms of environmental impact,
amorphous panels tend to have a
much lower carbon footprint at
point of production, compared to

other solar panels. A typical carbon
payback for an amorphous solar
panel would be in the region of
12–30 months.
Most amorphous solar panels have
comparatively low power outputs.
These panels can work well for
smaller installations of up to around
300-watt outputs, but not so well
for larger installations: larger
numbers of panels will be required
and the additional expense in
mounting and wiring these
additional panels starts to outweigh
their cost advantage.
Consequently, amorphous solar

panels are often more suited to
OEM applications, as an energy
source built into a manufactured
product, or for large-scale
commercial installations where the
panels are incorporated into the
structure of a roof-space on a new
build.
Some of the most exciting advances
in solar technologies over the past
three years have come from
amorphous technology. Products as
diverse as mobile phones, laptop
computers, clothing and roofing
materials have all had amorphous
solar panels built into them. An
exciting technology, amorphous

solar is going to get better and
better over the coming years.
Polycrystalline solar panels
Polycrystalline solar panels are
made from multiple solar cells,
each made from wafers of silicon
crystals. They are far more efficient
than amorphous solar panels in
direct sunlight, with efficiency
levels of 13–18%.
Consequently, polycrystalline solar
panels are often around one third of
the physical size of an equivalent
amorphous panel, which can make
them easier to fit in many

installations.
Polycrystalline solar panels
typically have a life expectancy of
about 25 years. This can often be
exceeded: commercial solar panels
only became available in the late
1970s and early 1980s and many of
these panels are still perfectly
functional and in use to this day.
The manufacturing process for
polycrystalline solar panels is
complicated. As a result,
polycrystalline solar panels are
expensive to purchase, often costing
20–30% more than amorphous solar
panels. The environmental impact

of production is also higher than
amorphous panels, with a typical
carbon payback of 3–5 years.
Prices for polycrystalline solar
panels are dropping, thanks to both
the increase in manufacturing
capacity over the past few years
and the increasing popularity for
larger screen televisions, which use
the same specification glass. For
the past five years, prices have
been dropping by around 25% per
year. They will undoubtedly
continue to reduce in price as the
cost of amorphous solar technology
continues to drop.

Monocrystalline solar panels
Monocrystalline solar panels are
made from multiple smaller solar
cells, each made from a single
wafer of silicon crystal. These are
the most efficient solar panels
available today, with efficiency
levels of 15–24%.
Monocrystalline solar panels have
the same characteristics as
polycrystalline solar panels.
Because of their efficiencies, they
are the smallest solar panels (per
watt) available.
Monocrystalline solar panels are
the most expensive solar panels to

manufacture and therefore to buy.
They typically cost 35–50% more
than the equivalent polycrystalline
solar panels.
Which solar panel technology
is best?
For most applications,
polycrystalline panels offer the best
solution, with reasonable value for
money and a compact size.
Amorphous panels can be a good
choice for smaller installations
where space is not an issue. They
are usually not practical for
generating more than a few hundred

watts of power because of their
overall size, unless you have an
extremely large area that you can
cover with solar panels.
What to look for when
choosing a solar panel
Not all solar panels are created
equal, and it is worth buying a
quality branded product over an
unbranded one. Cheaper, unbranded
solar panels may not live up to your
expectations, especially when
collecting energy on cloudy days.
If you are spending a lot of money
buying a solar energy system that

needs to last many years, it is
advisable to purchase from a known
brand such as Kyocera, Panasonic,
Clear Skies, Hyundai, Sanyo,
Mitsubishi, Solar Frontier or Sharp.
My personal recommendation is
Kyocera polycrystalline solar
panels, or Mitsubishi or Solar
Frontier amorphous panels. I have
found these to be particularly good.
Buying cheap solar panels
Not all solar energy systems have to
last ten or twenty years. If you are
looking for a small, cheap system to
provide power to an RV or
caravan, or your requirements are

modest, such as installing a light in
a shed, buying a cheap solar panel
may well be the right option for
you.
The quality of the cheaper solar
panels has improved significantly
over the past few years. Six or
seven years ago, buying a cheap,
unbranded Chinese-made product
was a recipe for disaster. Many of
the panels were poorly assembled,
allowing water to seep through the
frames and damaging the solar
cells. A lot of them used plate
glass, often a thin, low-grade glass
that becomes clouded over time and
is easily chipped or broken. The

cells used by these manufacturers
were often sub-standard reject cells
and often degraded very quickly.
Thankfully, most of these problems
are now resolved and if you buy a
cheap solar panel on eBay, you are
likely to have a good product that
will reliably generate power for
five to ten years, and in all
probability a lot longer. If you are
buying a solar panel from a
manufacturer you have never heard
of, here is a checklist of things to
look for:
Buy bigger than you think you’ll
need

If you are buying a very cheap solar
panel, you are likely to be saving as
much as 50% of the price when
compared to buying a branded
product. However, expect it to
degrade slightly more quickly than a
branded unit, and do not expect it to
be quite so efficient.
To counter this, buy a solar panel
with a higher watt rating (often
shown as a watt peak, or Wp,
rating) than you actually need, or
buy additional solar panels if you
are purchasing an entire array. Aim
for 15% more power than you
would otherwise have bought. You

will still save a lot of money, but
you will have an extra bit of
assurance that the system will be up
to the task.
Warranty
With cheap solar panels, you’re not
going to get a five-, ten- or
twenty-year warranty, but you
should still expect a one- or
two-year warranty with any solar
panel you buy. Check to see exactly
what the warranty offers.
You are looking for a warranty that
guarantees a minimum output under
controlled conditions. The standard
across the industry is to guarantee

80% of the quoted output under
controlled conditions.
If you have a warranty claim, also
check to see how you can claim on
that warranty. Shipping a broken
solar panel half way around the
world and paying for return
carriage is likely to cost as much as
buying a new solar panel.
Glass
If you are buying a solar panel that
is going to be fitted to a moving
vehicle, or if you are buying a
physically large solar panel, make
sure that the solar panel uses
tempered glass.

Tempered, or toughened, glass is
around eight times stronger than
plate glass. This makes it far more
robust. If your glass is chipped on
your solar panel, you will
immediately see a significant drop
in power output. If water gets into
the solar panel itself, it can create a
short circuit and becomes a fire
hazard. Water and electricity do not
mix.
It is worth noting that some
amorphous solar panels cannot use
tempered glass because of the way
the thin film is applied to the glass.
Some manufacturers reduce this

problem by using thicker plate
glass.
Second-hand solar PV panels
From time to time, second-hand
solar panels appear for sale. They
appear on eBay or are sold by solar
equipment suppliers or building
salvage yards.
So long as they come from a
reputable brand, second-hand solar
panels can be extremely good value
for money and even old panels that
are 25–30 years old may still give
many more years of useful service.
Although good quality solar panels
should provide at least 25 years

service, nobody knows how much
longer they will last. The early
commercially available solar
panels (which are now over 30
years old) are still working
extremely well, typically working
at around 80–90% of their original
capacity.
There are, however, a few points to
look out for if you are considering
buying second-hand solar PV
panels:
·       Never buy second-hand
solar PV panels unseen. Take
a multi-meter with you and
test them outside to make sure

you are getting a reasonable
voltage and wattage reading
·       Check the panels and reject
any with chipped or broken
glass. Also reject any panels
where the solar cells
themselves are peeling away
from the glass or have
condensation between the
glass and the solar cell
·       The efficiency of older
solar PV panels is
significantly lower than new
panels. 30 years ago, the most
efficient solar panels were
only around 5–6% efficient,

compared to 13–24%
efficiency levels today.
10–15 years ago, most solar
panels were around 10–12%
efficient
·       Consequently, a solar PV
panel from the early 1980s is
likely to be three times the
size and weight of an
equivalent modern crystalline
panel
·       These second-hand panels
will not have any of the safety
certification ratings that you
get with new solar panels.
This may cause issues with

building regulations or
building insurance, if you are
installing these onto a
building as part of a new
solar installation
Fresnel lenses and mirrors
A very brief word here about
Fresnel lenses and mirrors. The
Fresnel lens was invented for
lighthouses, as a way of projecting
a light over a long distance. It does
this by refracting the light to make it
a concentrated beam. Scientists
have been experimenting with
Fresnel lenses in conjunction with
solar panels for concentrating the

power of the sunlight and focusing
it on a solar panel.
In effect, by concentrating the
sunlight into a smaller area and
increasing the solar irradiance,
significantly more energy can be
captured by the solar panel, thereby
improving its efficiency quite
impressively.
However, there are problems with
this technology. Most specifically,
the heat build-up is quite
considerable and, in testing, many
solar panels have been destroyed
by the excessive heat generated by
the Fresnel lens. This is especially

true of Fresnel lenses built by
enthusiastic amateurs.
There are one or two companies
now promoting Fresnel solar
panels. These panels tend to be
quite large and bulky. Due to the
heat build-up, they also need to be
very carefully mounted, with
adequate ventilation around the
panel. There are also questions
about the long-term reliability of
Fresnel solar panels. My advice
would be to avoid these until other
people have tried them for a number
of years and found out how reliable
they really are.

As an alternative, mirrors or
polished metal can be a useful way
of reflecting additional sunlight
back onto solar panels and
therefore increasing the solar
irradiance. However, you must take
care to ensure that the reflected
light does not dazzle anyone. The
practicalities of mounting, safety
and ensuring that people are not
dazzled by the reflected sunlight
normally dissuade people from
using mirrors in this way.

Solar panel mountings
You can either fabricate your own
mounting for your solar panels, or
purchase a ready-made modular
system.
The design of the system must take
into account wind loading, so that it
is not damaged or destroyed in high
winds. If you are installing solar in
a hot climate, your mounting must
also ensure there is adequate
ventilation behind the panel to
avoid excessive heat build-up.
Your support structure needs to be
able to set the angle of the solar
array for optimal positioning

towards the sun.
If you have not installed solar
electric systems before, it is usually
a good idea to buy a modular
support structure from the same
supplier as your solar panels. Once
you have more experience, you can
then choose to fabricate your own,
if you prefer.
Solar trackers
For ground- or pole-mounted solar
arrays, you can buy solar trackers
that track the path of the sun across
the sky and move the solar panels
so they are facing the sun at all
times.

The benefits of solar trackers are
that they increase the amount of
sunlight the solar panels can
capture. They increase energy
capture by up to 55% during the
summer months and by around
15–20% during the winter months.
Unfortunately, the cost of these
solar trackers means that they are
rarely cost-effective. It is usually
far cheaper to buy a larger solar
array than it is to buy a solar
tracker. Only if space is at a
premium are solar trackers
currently viable.

Solar array cables
Solar array cables connect your
solar panels together and connect
your solar array to the solar
controller.
These cables are often referred to
as ‘array interconnects’. You can
purchase them already made up to
specified lengths or make them up
yourself. The cables are extremely
heavy duty and resistant to high
temperatures and ultra-violet light.
They also have a tough, extra-thick
insulation to make them less prone
to animal damage.
If you are planning to wire your

solar array in parallel rather than in
series, you need to ensure that your
solar array cables can cope with the
current that you are going to be
generating through your solar array.
If you are designing a parallel
design system, I explain how you
can calculate the size of cable
required in the chapter on stand-
alone system components.

Fuses and isolation
switches
The ability to isolate parts of the
system is important, especially
while installing the system and
carrying out maintenance. Even
comparatively low voltages can be
dangerous to work on.
Even small systems should
incorporate a fuse between the
batteries and the controller and/or
inverter. If something goes wrong
with the system, far better to blow a
cheap fuse than fry a battery or a
solar controller.

For all but the smallest systems, you
will also need to incorporate
isolation switches into your solar
design. This will allow a battery
bank to be disconnected for
maintenance purposes. For any
installation with more than one
solar panel, and for all grid-
connected systems, an isolation
switch to disconnect the solar array
should also be installed: I would
recommend installing an isolation
switch on the solar array for all
solar arrays capable of generating
over 100 watts of power.
If your solar panels are mounted

some way from your inverter or
controller, it can also be a good
idea to have an isolation switch
fitted next to the solar panels, as
well as one fitted next to the
inverter or controller. You can then
easily disconnect the solar panels
from the rest of the system for
maintenance or in case of an
emergency.
Ensure that the isolation switch you
choose is capable of handling
high-current DC circuits, with
contacts that will not arc. Suitable
isolation switches are available
from any solar supplier.

If you are planning a grid-connected
system, you will also need AC
isolation switches to allow you to
disconnect the inverter from the
grid supply. You will require an
isolation switch next to the inverter,
and a second one next to the
distribution panel.

Ground fault protection
Ground fault protection ensures that
if there is a short within the solar
array, the current flow is cut off
immediately. This averts the risk of
damage to either the controller or
the solar array, and significantly
reduces the risk of electrocution.
Ground fault protection works by
measuring the current entering and
exiting a circuit. If everything is
working correctly, the current in
should equal the current out.
However, if there is a ‘leak’ or a
partial short circuit, the system will
see a difference in current and

immediately shut down. A partial
short circuit could occur if a solar
panel was broken or if somebody
touched an exposed cable.
Most solar inverters and solar
controllers incorporate ground fault
protection, using a Residual
Current Device (RCD) built into
the unit (note: RCDs are known as
Ground Fault Interrupters – GFIs
– in the United States and Canada).
Many experts say that it is prudent
to install a separate ground fault
protector, even if the controller or
inverter has ground fault protection
built in. As the cost of an RCD or
GFI is low and the benefits they

provide are high, this is good
advice.
You will require separate ground
fault protection for your DC and AC
circuits:
·       For anything larger than
100-watt solar panel systems,
and for all systems mounted
to a building, you should
install ground fault protection
between your solar panels
and your controller or
inverter
·       If you are installing a DC
power supply into a building
for running appliances, you

must install ground fault
protection between your
controller and this power
supply
·       If you are using an inverter,
you should install ground
fault protection between your
inverter and any load
There are specific RCD units for
DC circuits and these are stocked
by solar panel suppliers.

Components for Grid-
Tie systems
Before discussing the components
required for a grid-tie system in
more detail, it is useful to look at
how a grid-tie system is configured.
There are three basic designs for
grid-tie solar energy systems:
·       High-voltage in-series
systems
·       Low-voltage systems
·       Micro-inverter systems

High voltage in-series
This is the most popular
configuration for a grid-tie system
today. Solar panels are connected
together in series, producing a
high-voltage DC power. This is
then fed into a central inverter to
convert the power into an AC
source, which in turn is connected
into the standard building electrical
system:
A simplified block

diagram showing the
basic layout of a
high voltage in-
series solar energy
system
This design is the most
cost-effective design for grid-tie
systems. It is relatively
straightforward to install, simple to
maintain, and components are
readily available. By running the
solar array at high voltage, it is also
very efficient, with minimal losses
through the array itself and allowing
the inverter to run at a very high
level of efficiency. This is why this
design is currently so popular

within the grid-tie solar industry.
This high-voltage DC power has the
benefit of great efficiency, but
comes with a number of very
significant safety risks. Voltages as
high as 600 volts in North America
and 1,000 volts in Europe are
common: voltages that can very
easily be fatal on contact.
These high voltages can also cause
significant problems if there is
damage to the wiring between solar
panels, either due to a mistake
during installation, through animal
damage, or simply through wear
over time. If a damaged cable

generates a high-voltage, direct
current electric arc whilst the
panels are in direct sunlight, the
immensely high temperatures can
easily melt metal and are a potential
fire hazard.
Connecting solar panels in series
also has a significant disadvantage:
when connected in series, the solar
array is only as strong as its
weakest link. If you have a damaged
solar panel, shade blocking light to
a few solar cells, or a damaged
cable, the output of the entire solar
array drops to the output of that
weakest link.

Low voltage systems
It is for these reasons that, in
previous editions of this book, I
have advocated lower-voltage solar
arrays for many grid-tie systems.
This was achieved by running
shorter series of solar panels and
having multiple strings running in
parallel. These are much safer than
the very high voltage systems
usually installed, lose little in
efficiency and are inherently more
tolerant of shade.

A simplified block
diagram showing the
basic layout of a
low-voltage solar
energy system where
multiple strings of
solar panels are
connected in parallel
This design tends to be more

expensive to install than an in-
series design. You will either need
to buy a grid-tie inverter that can
accept multiple strings of solar
panels, or buy a separate inverter
for each string.
I no longer advocate this approach,
because there is now another
alternative available that, in my
opinion, renders both high-voltage
in-series and low-voltage systems
redundant:
Micro-inverter systems
Micro-inverter systems have been
around for a few years now, but
until very recently had not gained

popularity, mainly due to their
higher cost.
However, with the huge growth in
the popularity of grid-tie systems
around the world, micro-inverter
systems have become far more
widespread as the benefits of this
technology have become more
apparent. Prices for micro-inverter
systems are dropping fast and are
now comparable to high-voltage in-
series systems.
In a micro-inverter system, each
solar panel has its own inverter,
converting its output to AC power.
In effect, each solar panel becomes

its own independent solar energy
system.
In the majority of micro-inverter
systems, the inverter itself is
mounted outside, bolted to the
frame that also holds the solar panel
in place. The individual solar
panels are connected to an AC
power cable that runs alongside the
solar array and then feeds directly
into the building’s electrical
system.

A simplified block
diagram showing the
basic layout of a
micro-inverter
system
There are some very significant
benefits of micro-inverter systems
over other forms of grid-tie
systems:

·       As each solar panel runs as
an independent unit, if one
panel is under-performing,
either because of damage or
simply because it is shaded, it
does not affect the output
from any of the other panels
·       Because there is no
high-voltage DC power
running from one panel to the
next, safety is less of an issue
·       Installation, fault-finding
and maintenance also become
significantly easier
·       It is easy to expand your

grid-tie system in the future,
as budget allows
·       More flexible solar panel
installation – you can have
solar panels mounted in
different locations and facing
in different directions
Whilst today, series-connected
solar systems with a central
inverter are still the standard model
for installing grid-tie systems, the
industry is moving towards micro-
inverter technology as a far better
model.

Now you have a clearer idea of
how a grid-tie system is put
together, it is time to look at the
components available in more
detail.

Grid-tie solar panels
In the past, when most solar energy
systems were stand-alone systems,
almost every solar panel you could
buy was rated for a 12-volt output.
Whilst this is still true for smaller
panels, there are now
higher-voltage configurations
available for larger solar panels.
As grid-tie systems have become
more popular, higher-voltage solar
panels have become available.
Many solar panels of 150Wp
capacity and over are rated for a
24-volt output and some
manufacturers are now building

solar panels with rated outputs of
between 48 volts and 120 volts.
These higher voltages are well
suited to grid-tie installations. By
running your solar array at a higher
voltage, you can keep the current
flow low, which improves the
efficiency of the overall system.
Using high-voltage solar panels
also gives you the option to connect
multiple solar panels in parallel
rather than in series, whilst
retaining the benefit of the
high-voltage current.
The 24-volt and 48-volt solar
panels can work with many micro-

inverter systems, too. Theoretically,
this would allow a micro-inverter
system to run more efficiently,
although in practice the differences
seem to be marginal.

Grid-tie inverters
Grid-tie inverters convert the DC
power from your solar energy
system into AC power, and convert
the voltage to the same as the grid.
This allows you to connect your
system into the grid, enabling you to
become a mini power station and
supply your electricity to the
electricity companies.
You cannot use an ordinary inverter
for grid-tie applications. There are
a number of reasons for this:
·       Grid-tie inverters have to
work in conjunction with the
grid, in order to be able to

export electricity to it. The
AC pure sine waveform
generated by the inverter has
to be perfectly coordinated
with the waveform from the
grid
·       There is an additional safety
feature with grid-tie inverters
to cut off power from the
solar array if the grid shuts
down
·       Grid-tie inverters are
connected directly to the
solar panels. In an in-series
system, this means the input
voltage from the panels can

fluctuate wildly, often
jumping or dropping by
several hundred volts in an
instant. Non grid-tie inverters
cannot cope with such
massive voltage jumps
·       In many countries, grid-tie
inverters have to be certified
for use with the grid
There are a number of things to
consider when purchasing a grid-tie
inverter:
·       Input voltage
·       Power rating
·       Power tracking

·       How many strings the
inverter can support
·       Diagnostics and reporting
information
·       Inbuilt safety systems
·       Installation options and
operating environment
·       Certification and local
regulations
Input voltage
Your choice of inverter will have a
large voltage range in order to cope
with the huge fluctuation of voltage
that a solar array can provide. From

this voltage range, you will be able
to identify how many solar panels
the inverter can cope with, when
connected in series.
You need to remember that the rated
voltage of a solar panel is not the
maximum voltage that the solar
panel can generate. The voltage
from a single 12-volt solar panel
can fluctuate anywhere from 12
volts on a very dull day, up to
around 20 volts in intense overhead
sunlight. If you have a 48-volt solar
panel, or four 12-volt solar panels
connected together in series, the
voltage swing can be between 48
volts and 88 volts.

In addition to this, a solar panel can
produce significantly higher
voltages in an open circuit – i.e.
when the solar array is generating
power but the power is not being
used. Depending on your solar
panel, it is possible for a single 12-
volt solar panel to generate 26 volts
in an open circuit.
As you can see from the table
below, the higher the nominal
voltage from your solar array, the
greater the voltage fluctuation can
be:

Note: the maximum open-circuit

voltage allowable in the United
States for grid-tied systems is 600
volts, whilst in Europe it is
advisable that your system does not
exceed 1,000 volts. You must
ensure that your system never
exceeds this.
As you can see from this table, if a
heavy cloud blocks the sun on an
otherwise clear day, you can see a
voltage drop of several hundred
volts in an instant. When the cloud
passes over, the voltage shoots
back up again.
It is important to ensure that the
solar panel will work with the peak

voltage of your solar array and not
just the nominal voltage of your
array. If you exceed the peak
voltage of your inverter, the
inverter will shut down to avoid
damage. In extreme cases, you
could damage or destroy your
inverter by exceeding the input
voltage rating.
In addition to the standard input
voltage range, your inverter will
also show a maximum voltage
rating. This maximum voltage rating
relates to the maximum open circuit
voltage of your solar array. You
must ensure that the open circuit
voltage of your array does not

exceed the maximum voltage of
your inverter.
Power rating
There are two power ratings on a
grid-tie inverter:
·       Input power rating – the
minimum and maximum
amount of power the inverter
can accept from the solar
array
·       Output power rating – the
maximum amount of power
and current the inverter can
generate as an AC output
Input power rating

The input power rating shows the
minimum and maximum wattage
range the inverter can work with. In
the main, the wider the range, the
more efficient your inverter is.
The specification on an inverter
will typically show three figures for
input power rating:
·       A nominal power rating,
shown in watts
·       A minimum and maximum
power range
·       A start-up power rating
The nominal power rating shows
the maximum amount of power that

the inverter can convert into an AC
output. If you exceed this figure on
your solar array, the additional
power will be lost and converted
into heat. Exceed this figure for
long and your inverter may shut
down to avoid overheating.
The minimum power rating shows
the minimum amount of power that
your solar array must generate in
order for the inverter to start
producing power. The maximum
power rating shows the maximum
amount of power that can be fed
into the inverter before you risk
damaging your inverter.

The start-up power rating is the
minimum amount of power the solar
inverter requires to power itself. If
the solar array produces less than
this amount of power, the inverter
will switch off.
Because of the wide variation in the
power a solar panel can produce, it
is good practice to buy a bigger
grid-tie inverter than you actually
need. Remember that whilst a solar
panel has a watt-peak (Wp) rating,
in ideal conditions the panel itself
may slightly exceed this rating in a
real world environment.
Output power rating

The output power rating is the
maximum continuous AC power that
the inverter can generate. The
output power information will show
voltage, nominal output power in
watts, the maximum output current
in amps and the alternating current
frequency.
For North America, the grid voltage
is nominally set at 110 volts, with a
frequency of 60 Hz. For the
majority of the rest of the world, the
grid voltage is nominally set at 230
volts, with a frequency of 50 Hz. In
both cases, it is normal to get some
variation in voltage and frequency.

The output power rating will also
show the maximum efficiency rating
of the inverter, given as a
percentage. This rating is usually in
the region of 90–94% with modern
grid-tie inverters. If you are
shopping on a budget, you must
check this rating: some very cheap
grid-tie inverters may be
significantly less efficient.
Power tracking
As discussed on previously, the
efficiency of the solar array
depends on how efficiently the
fluctuating voltage is handled by
your inverter.

If you are purchasing a grid-tie
inverter, you should invest in one
that incorporates maximum power
point tracking (MPPT). Maximum
power point tracking can provide
an additional 15–20% of energy
when compared to a non-MPPT
inverter.
Today, MPPT is the norm, but there
are a few older designs of inverter
still on the market, often sold at
bargain prices online. No matter
how cheap these inverters are, the
performance loss rarely makes them
a worthwhile investment.
Multiple strings

A ‘string’ of solar panels is simply
an array of solar panels connected
in series. Some inverters allow you
to connect more than one string of
solar panels. These two strings then
work as separate arrays, but feed
the power through the same
inverter.
With multiple
strings, you can mix
and match solar

panels and locate
them in physically
separate areas if you
so wish. The two
strings run
completely
independently of
each other
With a multiple string system, your
two solar arrays work
independently from each other. This
means that you can have two
different sizes of array with
different solar panels, or have the
two arrays mounted at different
orientations. If one array is partially
shaded, the performance does not

affect the second array.
This is different to connecting
multiple strings together to create a
serial/parallel hybrid. If you have
multiple strings connected together,
the two strings are still linked. You
need to have identical setups on
both strings and the panels need to
be facing the same way. Failure to
do this will result in lower solar
performance.

Here we have two
strings of solar
panels, connected
together in parallel
to feed a single
string inverter. The
two strings have to
match each other. If
one string is
compromised, for
instance due to
shading, the second
string is also
affected. (Note: you
would not normally
wire a grid-tie solar
array in this way.

Instead, you would
connect everything
in series on a single
string.)
Multiple strings are of benefit in the
following situations:
·       Where you wish to fit two
different sizes of solar panel
·       Fitting solar panels facing at
different orientations, such as
on a roof that has two
different pitches
·       Resolving shading issues.
Solar panels that are in shade
at certain times of the day can

be put onto a separate string
so as not to affect the output
of the rest of the system
Whilst an inverter that can handle
multiple strings does have its
benefits, there is usually an
additional cost for multi-string
inverters. If you are considering a
multi-string inverter, you are
probably better off choosing a
micro-inverter system where every
solar panel has its own inverter.
Diagnostics and reporting
information
Almost all inverters provide a level

of diagnostics and reporting
information, either using a small
display built into the inverter itself,
a series of LEDs on the front panel
of the inverter, a separate
monitoring unit that plugs into the
inverter, or by allowing you to
connect a PC to the inverter.
Some inverters even have a built-in
internet connection, allowing them
to connect to a wireless network.
This means your system can
provide you with updates via e-
mail, via a built-in website, or even
send updates to your mobile phone.
In some cases, these systems can be
remotely monitored by the solar

inverter supplier, who can then
notify you if there are any potential
issues with your system.
If you have a micro-inverter system
with multiple inverters, the
diagnostics and reporting system is
usually a separate box, which is
either connected to the AC power at
the point where the solar array
connects to your distribution panel,
or it communicates wirelessly with
the micro-inverters. This ensures
that you have one central
information point for your inverters.
As a bare minimum, you want an
inverter that can tell you if your

system is working and provide you
with an indication of what may be
the problem if a fault is detected.
The diagnostics should be able to
give you enough information to
enable to you identify a fault with
your system, such as:
·       Insufficient or excess power
from the solar array
·       Grid connection issues
·       Grid voltage or frequency
issues
·       Overheating
Most solar inverters will provide
you with much more information,

allowing you to see the voltage and
current from your solar array and
the amount of AC power being
generated at that moment. They will
also be able to show the amount of
energy generated by the system,
both for that day and since the
system was installed.
Built-in safety
Most inverters incorporate safety
shutdown systems as part of the
inverter itself. It is common for
inverters to have ground fault
protection built in. As mentioned in
the previous chapter, even if your
inverter does provide this, it is still

good practice to install additional
ground fault protection when you
design your system. This is
incorporated into your system using
a Residual Current Device (RCD).
RCDs are known as Ground Fault
Interrupters (GFIs) in the United
States and Canada.
A grid-tie inverter will also
monitor the power from the grid and
shut down if it detects a power cut
(sometimes referred to as ‘Island
Protection’).
This power shutdown ensures that
your solar energy system does not
continue to feed power into the grid

if there is a power cut. This is a
necessary safety requirement: if
workers are attempting to repair a
power outage, they risk
electrocution if power is being fed
into the grid from your solar array
while they are working.
Inverters should also shut down or
derate if the internal temperature
gets too high, in order to avoid
permanent damage.
Installation options and
operating environment
Inverters tend to be heavy units.
They need to be mounted securely

on a wall or bolted to the floor.
They can generate a significant
amount of heat, especially when
running close to their rated output,
and require good airflow around the
units to keep them cool.
You can purchase inverters for
either indoor or outdoor
installation. If you are looking at
installing an inverter outdoors,
check that the inverter is sealed
against dust and water ingress,
rated to at least IP64.
Overheating inverters is the number
one reason for grid-tie systems
failing. As an inverter gets hotter, it

provides less power, and if the
temperature continues to rise, it
will eventually shut down to avoid
permanent damage. When choosing
an inverter, check its operating
temperatures and consider how you
can ensure your system remains
within these limits.
Inverters should always be installed
in a well-ventilated area, away
from the ceiling and with a
clearance around each side, the top
and the bottom. They cannot be
installed in a sealed cupboard.
Some inverters have the option of
an external heat sink or
temperature-controlled cooling fans

to help keep the inverter cool.
Most inverters do make a small
amount of noise. This is typically a
continuous low-level hum. It is
usually only noticeable if the
surrounding area is quiet. However,
for this reason, inverters are not
usually installed inside the living
space in a home or in an office
environment. Instead, consider
installing your inverter in a garage
or on an outside wall of your
building.
Occasionally, the sound made by
the inverter has been known to
resonate with the wall, amplifying

the sound and making it quite
unpleasant to live with. This can
occur even if the inverter is
mounted to an outside wall. This is
a very rare occurrence, but is most
likely to occur if you are planning
to mount your inverter onto a wall
made of solid concrete. The
solution is to dampen the mounting
between the inverter and the wall or
floor that the inverter is mounted
on. There is a very effective
product called Green Glue,
produced by the Green Glue
Company
(www.GreenGlueCompany.com)
that is applied between the wall and

the inverter. When it is compressed
by remounting the inverter, the glue
spreads out to form a sound
isolation barrier that is particularly
effective at blocking out
low-resonance vibrations.
Buying from eBay
Some companies and individuals
have been selling non-approved
grid-tie inverters online, most
commonly on eBay. These are often
sold at a bargain price, bundled
with a cheap solar panel and often
advertised as a ‘micro grid-tie
system’.
The sellers claim that these systems

are designed for amateur
installation. The inverter plugs into
the household electricity supply
through a normal domestic power
socket, and the systems look
exceptionally easy to install and
use. The sellers often claim that you
can use these systems to sell power
back to the utility companies and
that they can be used to run the
meter backwards.
These systems are highly dangerous
and must be avoided. For a start,
the equipment has inevitably not
been certified for grid-tie use in any
country. More importantly, the use

of these systems is illegal in the
United States, Canada, Australia
and most of the European
Community, because of the way the
inverters connect to the household
electricity supply, using a domestic
power plug in reverse.
This means that the household plug
has grid-level AC power running
through it. This is extremely high
risk and directly contravenes basic
electrical safety legislation. In the
UK, for instance, this is directly in
contravention with BS7671:2008
(amd 1, 2011) 551.7.2 (ii). The
catastrophic and potentially fatal
results should somebody unplug the

cable and accidentally touch the
unshielded plug do not bear thinking
about.
Never design any electrical system
that risks grid-level AC power
running through exposed
connectors. The lives of the people
around you are worth far more than
saving a few pounds.

Components for
Stand-Alone Systems
If you are designing a stand-alone
system, there is a lot more design
work and planning involved than
there is for a similarly-sized grid-
tie system. It is more critical to
make sure your stand-alone system
works: while a grid-tie system will
not let you down if you do not
generate enough energy, a stand-
alone system will.
As well as considering and
planning all the physical side of

fitting the solar panels, routing the
cabling and handling the safety
aspects, you will also need to
consider the voltage that your
system will run at and design a
battery system to store your energy.

Calculate your optimum
voltage
Solar panels and batteries are
normally both 12 volts, so logically
you would think that it would make
the most sense to run your system at
12 volts.
For small systems, you would be
right. However, there are some
limitations of 12-volt systems.
Therefore, we now need to identify
the optimum voltage for your
system.
If you are still not comfortable with
volts, watts, currents and

resistance, now would be a good
time to re-read Chapter 2: A Brief
Introduction to Electricity.
Voltages and currents
Current is calculated as watts
divided by volts. When you run at
low voltages, your current is much
higher than when you run at higher
voltages.
Take a normal household low-
energy light bulb as an example. A
12W light bulb running from
grid-level voltages is consuming 12
watts of power per hour. The
current required to power this light
bulb at 230 volts is 0.05 amps

(12W ÷ 230V = 0.05 amps) and at
110 volts is 0.1 amps (12W ÷ 110v
= 0.1 amps).
If you run the same wattage light
bulb from a 12-volt battery, you are
still only consuming 12 watts of
power per hour, but this time the
current you require is 1 amp (12W
÷ 12V = 1 amp).
If you run the same wattage light
bulb from a 24-volt battery, you
halve the amps. You now only
require ½ amp (12W ÷ 24V = ½
amp).
“So what?” I hear you say. “Who
cares? At the end of the day, we’re

using the same amount of energy,
whatever the voltage.”
The issue is resistance. Resistance
is the opposition to an electrical
current in the material the current is
running through. Think of it as
friction on the movement of
electrons through a wire. If
resistance is too high, the result is
power loss. By increasing your
voltage, you can reduce your
current and thereby reduce
resistance.
You can counter the resistance by
using thicker cabling, but you soon
get to the point where the size of the

cabling becomes impractical. At
this point, it is time to change to a
higher voltage.
What voltages can I run at?
For either a stand-alone or a grid
fallback system, the most common
voltages to run a solar electric
system at are 12 volts, 24 volts or
48 volts.
As a rule, the most efficient way to
run an electrical circuit is to keep
your voltage high and your current
low. That is why the grid runs at
such high voltages: it is the only
way to keep losses to a minimum
over long distances.

However, you also need to factor
cost into the equation: 12-volt and
24-volt systems are far cheaper to
implement than higher voltage
systems, as the components are
more readily available, and at a
lower cost. 12-volt and 24-volt
devices and appliances are also
easily available, whereas 48-volt
devices and appliances are rarer.
It is unusual to go beyond 48 volts
for stand-alone systems. Whilst you
can go higher, inverters and
controllers that work at other
voltages tend to be extremely
expensive and only suitable for

specialist applications.
For a grid-tie system, you do have
the option to run your solar array at
a much higher voltage, by
connecting lots of solar panels
together in series. Grid-tie inverters
are available that work anywhere
from 12 volts up to 1,000 volts. In
grid-tie systems, the voltage you run
at depends on the number of solar
panels you use.
How to work out what voltage
you should be running at
Your choice of voltage is
determined by the amount of current

(amps) that you are generating with
your solar array or by the amount of
current (amps) that you are using in
your load at any one time.
To cope with bigger currents, you
need bigger cabling and a more
powerful solar controller. You will
also have greater resistance in
longer runs of cabling, reducing the
efficiency of your system, which in
turn means you need to generate
more power.
In our system, we are proposing a
12m (40 feet) long cable run from
the solar array to the house, plus
cabling within the house.

Higher currents can also reduce the
lifespan of your batteries. This
should be a consideration where the
current drain or charge from a
battery is likely to exceed 1/10th of
its amp-hour rating.
We will look at battery sizing later
on, as current draw is a factor in
choosing the right size of battery. It
may be that you need to look at
more than one voltage option at this
stage, such as 12-volt and 24-volt,
and decide which one is right for
you later on. Finally, if you are
planning to use an inverter to
convert your battery voltage to a

grid-level AC voltage, 12-volt
inverters tend to have a lower
power rating than 24-volt or 48-
volt inverters. This can limit what
you can achieve purely with 12
volts.
To solve these problems, you can
increase the voltage of your system:
double the voltage and you halve
your current.
There are no hard and fast rules on
what voltage to work on for what
current, but typically, if the
thickness of cable required to carry
your current is over 6mm (and
we’ll calculate that in a minute), it

is time to consider increasing the
voltage.

How to calculate your
current
As explained in Chapter 2, it is
very straightforward to work out
your current. Current (amps) equals
power (watts) divided by volts:
Power ÷ Volts = Current
P ÷ V = I
Go back to your power analysis and
add up the amount of power (watts)
your system will consume if you
switch on every electrical item at
the same time. In the case of our
holiday home, if I had everything
switched on at the same time, I

would be consuming 169 watts of
electricity.
Using the holiday home as an
example, let us calculate the current
based on both 12 volts and 24 volts,
to give us a good idea of what the
different currents look like.
Using the above formula, 169 watts
divided by 12 volts equals 14.08
amps. 169 watts divided by 24
volts equals 7.04 amps.
Likewise, we need to look at the
solar array and work out how many
amps the array is providing to the
system. We need a 320-watt solar
array. 320 watts divided by 12

volts equals 26.67 amps. 320 watts
divided by 24 volts equals 13.33
amps.

Calculating cable
thicknesses
I will go into more detail on cabling
later, but for now, we need to
ascertain the thickness of cable we
will need for our system.
For our holiday home, we need a
12m (40 feet) cable to run from the
solar controller to the house itself.
Inside the house, there will be
different circuits for lighting and
appliances, but the longest cable
run inside the house is a further 10m
(33 feet).
That means the longest cable run is

22m (72½ feet) long. You can work
out the required cable size using the
following calculation:
(L x I x 0.04) ÷ (V ÷ 20) = CT
L               Cable
length in metres
(one metre is 3.3
feet)
I               Current
in amps
V              System
voltage (e.g. 12V
or 24V)
CT             
Cross-sectional

area of the cable
in mm²
So calculating the cable thickness
for a 12-volt system:
(22m x 14.08A x 0.04) ÷ (12V ÷
20) = 20.65mm²
Here is the same calculation for a
24-volt system:
(22m x 7.04A x 0.04) ÷ (24V ÷ 20)
= 5.15mm²
And just for sake of completeness,
here is the same calculation for a
48-volt system:
(22m x 3.52A x 0.04) ÷ (48V ÷ 20)
= 1.63mm²

Converting wire sizes:
To convert cross-sectional area to
American Wire Gauge or to work
out the cable diameter in inches or
millimetres, use the following

From these figures you can see the
answer straightaway. Our cable
lengths are so great that we cannot
practically run our system at 12
volts. The nearest match for
20.65mm² cables is 21.14mm². This
is AWG 4 cable, with a cable
diameter of 5.19mm. Cable this size
is thick, heavy, inflexible, hard to
source and very expensive.
This means we would need to lay
extremely thick AWG 4 cables from

the solar array and around our
house to overcome the resistance.
This would be expensive, inflexible
and difficult to install.
Realistically, due to cable sizing,
we are going to need to use either
24 volts or 48 volts for our solar
electric system.

Mixing and matching
solar panels
When specifying your solar array,
you should keep to one type of
panel rather than mixing and
matching them. If you want a
100-watt array, for example, you
could create this with one 100-watt
solar panel, two 50-watt solar
panels or five 20-watt solar panels.
If you do wish to use different solar
panels in your array, you can do so
by running two sets of panels in
parallel with each other and either
connecting them into a controller
that can handle more than one feed,

or by using more than one
controller. This can be a useful way
of creating the right wattage system,
rather than spending more money
buying bigger solar panels that
generate more power than you
actually need.
The result is slightly more
complicated wiring, but it is often a
more cost-effective solution to do
this than to buy a larger capacity
solar array than you actually need.
The two diagrams below show
different ways of connecting two
solar panels of different sizes to the
same system. Both these systems

are running at 12 volts, using two
different sized panels to create a
140 watt system
This first system uses

a single controller.
The controller has
two separate input
feeds. The two solar
panels work
independently of
each other and the
controller handles
the mismatch in
power output

This second system
uses two controllers.
The second
controller is used to

provide additional
power to the
batteries for the
smaller solar panel.
These solutions are effective if you
are planning to start small and add
to your solar energy system when
needs and budget allows. It means
that you can collect an assortment of
solar panels over time and put them
to good use within your one solar
energy system.
If you end up with two different
makes of solar panels with identical
ratings, put them on their own
separate circuits. Solar panels from

different manufacturers are not all
identical in their operating voltages
or performances, so putting two
different makes and models of solar
panel on the same circuit is likely to
compromise the performance of
both panels, even if the
specification of the two panels is
similar.
If you buy multiple controllers for
your solar energy system, to handle
different makes, models and sizes
of solar panel, you only need one
main controller to handle the power
output from the batteries. Your
other controllers can be much
cheaper and simpler pieces of

equipment as they are only handling
the power feed into the batteries. If
you wish, you can even use a
simple solar regulator that simply
cuts off charging when the batteries
are full, although these are usually
not as efficient as a proper solar
inverter.
Not all solar panels are 12-volt
panels. Many solar panels are now
designed predominantly for grid-tie
installation only and are available
in many different voltage
configurations. Solar panels with
voltage ratings of up to 120 volts
are on the market, although the most

common are 12-volt, 24-volt and
48-volt.
12-volt panels remain the most
commonly available panels and are
the most popular for stand-alone
applications. If your stand-alone
solar electric system runs at a
voltage other than 12 volts, you can
either install multiple solar panels
in order to boost the system voltage,
or choose higher-voltage solar
panels. For example, if you wanted
a 200-watt 24-volt solar array, you
could achieve this in various ways,
including:
·       Using two 12-volt, 100-watt

solar panels, connected in
series
·       Using one 24-volt, 200-watt
solar panel
When choosing a solar array, you
need to consider:
·       The physical size: will it fit
into the space available?
·       The support structure:
ready-made supports may
only fit certain combinations
of panels
·       How much cabling you will
need to assemble the array

·       The system voltage: if you
are not running at 12 volts,
you will need multiple solar
panels in order to build the
system to the correct voltage
as well as wattage

Batteries
There are a number of different
options when it comes to batteries,
and a number of specialist battery
suppliers who can advise you on
the best options for your solar
installation.
Lead acid batteries usually come as
either 6-volt or 12-volt batteries,
although other voltages are also
available. Batteries can be
connected together in series to
increase the voltage, or in parallel
to keep the same voltage but
increase the capacity.
The capacity of a battery is

measured in amp-hours. The amp-
hour rating shows how many hours
the battery will take a specific
drain: for instance, a 100-amp-hour
battery has a theoretical capacity to
power a 1-amp device for 100
hours, or a 100-amp device for 1
hour.
I say theoretical, because the
reality is that lead acid batteries
provide more energy when
discharged slowly: a 100-amp-hour
battery will often provide 20–25%
less power if discharged over a
five-hour period, compared to
discharge over a twenty-hour
period.

Secondly, a lead acid battery must
not be run completely flat. A
minimum of 20% state of charge
(SOC) should be maintained in a
lead acid battery at all times to
ensure the battery is not damaged.
For best overall battery life, you
should design your system so that
the battery charge rarely goes
below 50%.
Types of batteries
There are three types of lead acid
battery:
·       ‘Wet’ batteries require
checking and topping up with

distilled water, but perform
better and have a longer
lifespan than other batteries
·       AGM batteries require no
maintenance but have a
shorter overall life
·       Gel batteries are also
maintenance-free, do not emit
hydrogen during charging and
provide a reasonable overall
life. They can be placed on
their side or used on the move
In the past, most installers have
recommended industrial quality
‘wet’ batteries for all solar
installations. These provide the best

long-term performance and the
lowest cost. Often called traction
batteries (as they are heavy-duty
batteries used in electric vehicles),
they can often have a lifespan of
8–10 years for a solar installation.
A lower cost option to the
industrial-quality traction battery is
the leisure battery, as used in
caravans and boats. These are
typically either wet batteries or
AGM batteries. Their lifespan is
considerably shorter than traction
batteries, often requiring
replacement after 3–4 years and
significantly less in intensive
applications.

The third option is the gel battery.
These have the benefit of being
entirely maintenance-free. They are
also completely sealed and do not
emit hydrogen gas. In the past, gel
batteries have not been particularly
reliable in solar installations,
tending to require replacement after
1–2 years. However, more recently,
smaller gel batteries have seen
significant improvements in
lifespan and they now are
comparable to AGM batteries. The
price has also dropped
significantly.
Gel batteries are not suitable for

big solar applications with a power
drain of more than around 400 watt-
hours, but they can provide an
excellent, zero-maintenance
alternative to wet batteries for
smaller applications.
If your solar project requires
batteries of 50 amp-hour capacity
or less, gel batteries are a very
good alternative to traction
batteries.
Not all battery makes are the same.
From my experience, the very best
battery manufacturers for solar
energy installations are Crown and
Trojan, both of whom have

excellent batteries specifically
designed for solar installations. If
only the very best will do and you
are prepared to pay the premium,
the Optima ‘yellow top’ batteries
provide the benefits of AGM
batteries in a smaller, lighter
battery with some of the best
overall performance figures of any
battery available today.
Battery configurations
You can use one or more batteries
for power storage. Like solar
panels, you can wire your batteries
in parallel in order to increase their
capacity or in series in order to

increase their voltage.
Unlike solar panels, which you can
mix and match to create your array,
you need to use the same
specification and size of batteries to
make up your battery bank. Mixing
battery capacities and types will
mean that some batteries will never
get fully charged and some batteries
will get discharged more than they
should be. As a result, mixing
battery capacities and types can
significantly shorten the lifespan of
the entire battery bank.
Battery lifespan
Batteries do not last forever, and at

some stage in the life of your solar
electric system, you will need to
replace them. Obviously, we want
to have a battery system that will
last as long as possible and so we
need to find out about the lifespan
of the batteries we use.
There are two ways of measuring
the lifespan of a battery, both of
which tell you something different
about the battery.
·       Cycle Life is expressed as a
number of cycles to a
particular depth of discharge
·       Life in Float Service shows
how many years the battery

will last if it is stored,
charged up regularly, but
never used
Cycle life
Every time you discharge and
recharge a battery, you cycle that
battery. After a number of cycles,
the chemistry in the battery will
start to break down and eventually
the battery will need replacing.
The cycle life will show how many
cycles the batteries will last before
they need to be replaced. The life is
shown to a ‘depth of discharge’
(DOD), and the manufacturers will
normally provide a graph or a table

showing cycle life verses the depth
of discharge.
Typical figures that you will see for
cycle life may look like this:
              CYCLE
LIFE
              20%
DOD              1600
cycles
              40%
DOD              1200
cycles
              50%
DOD              1000
cycles

              80%
DOD              350
cycles
As you can see, the battery will last
much longer if you keep your depth
of discharge low.
For this reason, it can often be
better to specify a larger battery, or
bank of batteries, rather than a
smaller set of batteries. Most
experts recommend that you install
enough batteries to ensure that your
system does not usually discharge
your batteries beyond 50% of their
capacity.
The second benefit of a larger bank

of batteries is that this gives you
more flexibility with your power
usage. If you need to use more
electricity for a few days than you
originally planned for, you know
you can do this without running out
of energy.
Holdover
When considering batteries, you
need to consider how long you want
your system to work while the solar
array is not providing any charge at
all. This time span is called
holdover.
Unless you live inside the Arctic or
Antarctic Circles (both of which

provide excellent solar energy
during their respective summers,
incidentally), there is no such thing
as a day without sun. Even in the
depths of winter, you will receive
some charge from your solar array.
You may find there are times when
the solar array does not provide all
the energy you require. It is
therefore important to consider how
many days holdover you want the
batteries to be able to provide
power for, should the solar array
not be generating all the energy you
need.
For most applications, a figure of

between three days and five days is
usually sufficient.
In our holiday home, we are
deliberately not providing enough
solar energy for the system to run
24/7 during the winter months.
During the winter, we want the
batteries to provide enough power
to last a long weekend. The
batteries will then be recharged
when the holiday home is no longer
occupied and the solar panel can
gradually recharge the system.
For this purpose, I have erred on
the side of caution and suggested a
five-day holdover period for our

system.
Calculating how long a set of
batteries will last
Calculating how long a set of
batteries will last for your
application is not a precise science.
It is impossible to predict the
number of discharges, as this will
depend on the conditions the
batteries are kept in and how you
use the system over a period of
years.
Nevertheless, you can come up with
a reasonably good prediction for
how long the batteries should last.

This calculation will allow you to
identify the type and size of
batteries you should be using.
First, write down your daily energy
requirements. In the case of our
holiday home, we are looking at a
daily energy requirement of 695
watt-hours.
Then, consider the holdover. In this
case, we want to provide five days
of power. If we multiply 695 watt-
hours a day by 5 days, we get a
storage requirement of 3,475 watt-
hours of energy.
Batteries are rated in amp-hours
rather than watt-hours. To convert

watt-hours to amp-hours, we divide
the watt-hour figure by the battery
voltage.
If we are planning to run our system
at 12 volts, we divide 3,475 by 12
to give us 290 amp-hours at 12
volts. If we are planning to run our
system at 24 volts by wiring two
batteries in series, we divide 3,475
by 24 to give us 145 amp-hours at
24 volts.
We do not want to completely
discharge our batteries, as this will
damage them. So we need to look at
our cycle life to see how many
cycles we want. We then use this to

work out the capacity of the
batteries we need.
On a daily basis during the spring,
summer and autumn, we are
expecting the solar array to
recharge the batteries fully every
single day: it is unlikely that the
batteries will be discharged by
more than 10–20%.
However, during the winter months,
we could have a situation where the
batteries get run down over a
period of several days before the
solar panels get a chance to top the
batteries back up again.
So for four months of the year, we

need to take the worst-case
scenario where the batteries may
get discharged down to 80% depth
of discharge over a five day period
and then recharged by the solar
array.
The batteries will allow us to do
this 350 times before they come to
the end of their useful life.
350 cycles multiplied by 5 days =
1,750 days = 58 months
As this scenario will only happen
during the four months from
November to February, these
batteries will last us for around
14½ years before reaching the end

of their cycle life.
In reality, the Life in Float Service
figure (i.e. the maximum shelf-life)
for batteries is likely to be around
ten years, which means that, for this
application, they will fail before
they reach their cycle life.
Based on our energy requirements
of 145 amp-hours at 24 volts, and a
maximum discharge of 80%, we can
calculate that we need a battery
capacity of 145 ÷ 0.8 = 181.25
amp-hours at 24 volts.
Second-hand batteries
There is a good supply of

second-hand batteries available.
These are often available as ex-
UPS batteries (UPS =
Uninterruptable Power Supplies) or
ex-electric vehicle batteries.
Whilst these will not have the
lifespan of new batteries, they can
be extremely cheap to buy, often
selling at their scrap value. If you
are working to a tight budget and
your power demands are not great,
this is a very good way to save
money.
Do not ‘mix and match’ different
makes and models of batteries. Use
the same make and model of battery

throughout your battery bank. I
would also advise against using a
mixture of new and used batteries.
This is a false economy as the life
of your new batteries may be
compromised by the older ones.
If you are considering second-hand
batteries, try and find out how many
cycles they have had and how
deeply they have been discharged.
Many UPS batteries have hardly
been cycled and have rarely been
discharged during their lives.
If buying ex-electric vehicle
batteries, remember these have had
a very hard life with heavy loads.

However, ex-electric vehicle
batteries can continue to provide
good service for lower- demand
applications: if your total load is
less than 1kW, these batteries can
provide good service.
If possible, try and test second-hand
batteries before you buy them.
Ensure they are fully charged up,
and then use a battery load tester on
them to see how they perform.
If your second-hand batteries have
not been deep cycled many times,
the chances are they will not have a
very long charge life when you first
get them. To ‘wake them up’,

connect a solar controller or an
inverter to them and put a
low-power device onto the battery
to drain it to around 20% state of
charge. Then charge the battery up
again using a trickle charge and
repeat.
After three deep cycles, you will
have recovered much of the
capacity of your second-hand
batteries.
If using second-hand batteries,
expect them to provide half of their
advertised capacity. So if they are
advertised as 100-amp-hour
batteries, assume they will only

give you 50 amp-hours of use. In the
case of ex-electric vehicle
batteries, assume only one-third
capacity.
The chances are, they will give you
much more than this, but better to be
happy with the performance of your
second-hand batteries than to be
disappointed because they are not
as good as new ones.
Building your battery bank
Because we are running our system
at 24 volts, we will need two
12-volt batteries connected in
series to create our battery bank.

We therefore need two 12-volt
batteries of 181.25 amp-hours each
in order to create the desired
battery bank.
It is unlikely that you are going to
find a battery of exactly 181.25
amp-hours, so we need to find a
battery that is at least 181.25 amp-
hours in size.
When looking for batteries, you
need to consider the weight of the
batteries. A single 12-volt battery
of that size will weigh in the region
of 50kg (over 110 pounds)!
Safely moving a battery of that size
is not easy. You do not want to

injure yourself in the process. A
better solution would be to buy
multiple smaller batteries and
connect them together to provide the
required capacity.
Because batteries contain acid, they
should be installed in a battery tray,
so that any acid leaks may be
contained. In Australia and Canada,
regulations state that batteries must
be enclosed in a ventilated,
lockable and vermin-proof
enclosure.
As it is not possible to buy 181.25
amp-hour batteries, I have decided
to use four 100-amp-hour 12-volt

batteries, giving me a battery bank
with a total capacity of 200
amp-hours at 24 volts.
12-volt, 100-amp-hour batteries are
still not lightweight. They can
easily weigh 30kg (66 pounds)
each, so do not be afraid to use
more, lighter-weight batteries, if
you are at all concerned.
To build this battery bank, you can
use four 100-amp-hour, 12-volt
batteries, with two sets of batteries
connected in series, and then
connect both series in parallel, as
shown below:

Four 100-amp-hour
12V batteries. I have
paired up the
batteries to make
two sets of 100-amp-
hour 24V batteries,
and then connected

each pair in parallel
to provide a
200-amp-hour
capacity at 24 volts.
If I were putting together a 12-volt
battery system instead of a 24-volt
battery system, I could wire
together multiple 12-volt batteries
in parallel in order to provide the
higher capacity without increasing
the voltage:

Four 100-amp-hour
12V batteries
connected in parallel
to provide a
400-amp-hour 12V
battery bank.
Battery safety
When choosing batteries, you need
to consider the safety aspects of

batteries. With the exception of gel
batteries, all lead acid batteries
produce hydrogen, which needs to
be ventilated. Batteries can also be
very heavy and care is needed when
lifting or moving them. Finally, due
to the highly acidic nature of
batteries, protective clothing should
be worn whenever batteries are
being worked on, and a chemical
clean-up kit should be kept nearby.
I will go into more detail about
handling batteries during the
chapter on installation.

Solar controller
The solar controller looks after the
batteries and stops them either
being overcharged by the solar
array or over-discharged by the
devices running off the batteries.
Many solar controllers also include
an LCD status screen so you can
check the current battery charge and
see how much power the solar
array is generating.
Your choice of solar controller will
depend on four things:
·       System voltage
·       The current of the solar

array (measured in amps)
·       The maximum current of the
load (measured in amps)
·       The level of detail you
require from the status
display
Some solar experts will sometimes
add a fifth item to that list: battery
type. To be fair, this was a problem
with some older solar controllers,
which only worked with specific
battery types. Modern solar
controllers work with all types of
lead acid battery without a
problem, although you may need to
tell your solar controller what type

of batteries you are using when you
are setting up the system.
All but the very cheapest solar
controllers provide basic
information on an LCD screen that
allows you to see how much power
you have generated compared to
how much energy you are using, and
can also show the current charge
stored in the battery. Some solar
controllers include more detailed
information that allows you to
check on a daily basis how your
power generation and usage
compares.
Balancing the batteries

Another important function of a
solar controller is to manage the
charge in each battery and to ensure
each battery is properly charged up.
As batteries get older, the charge of
each battery will start to vary. This
means that some batteries will
charge and discharge at different
rates to others. If left over time, the
overall life of the batteries will
deteriorate.
Intelligent solar controllers can
manage these variations by
balancing, or equalizing, the
batteries they are charging. On most
controllers, you need to manually

activate a balance as part of a
routine inspection.
Allow for expansion
When looking at solar controllers, it
is worth buying one with a higher
current rating than you actually
need.
This allows you extra flexibility to
add additional loads or additional
panels to your solar array in the
future without having the additional
expense of replacing your solar
controller.
Maximum power point
tracking

More expensive solar controllers
incorporate a technology called
maximum power point tracking
(MPPT). An MPPT controller
adjusts the voltage being received
from the solar array to provide the
optimum voltage for charging the
batteries without significant loss of
watts from the voltage conversion.
If you have an MPPT controller,
you can capture around 20% more
of the power generated by the solar
array compared to a more basic
controller.
If you have less than 120W of solar
panels, it can work out cheaper to

buy extra solar panels rather than
spend the extra money on an MPPT
controller. However, prices
continue to fall and, if you have the
choice, a controller with maximum
power point tracking is a
worthwhile investment.
Ground fault protection
Many solar controllers include
ground fault protection. In the case
of a short from the solar array, a
Residual Current Device (RCD)
will cut off the current flow
between the solar array and the
controller, thereby averting the risk
of damage to either the controller or

the solar array.
In the United States and Canada,
RCDs are also known as Ground
Fault Interrupters (GFIs).
For anything larger than 100-watt
solar panel systems, and for all
systems mounted to a building, you
need to incorporate a separate
RCD/GFI into your system if you do
not have ground fault protection
built into your controller.
Backup power
Some controllers have one extra
useful feature: the facility to start up
an emergency generator if the

batteries run too low and the solar
array is not providing enough
power to cope with the load.
This can be a useful facility for
sites where the system must not fail
at any time, or for coping with
unexpected additional loads.
Whilst this may not seem so
environmentally friendly, many
generators are now available that
run on bio-diesel or bio-ethanol.
Alternatively, you can use an
environmentally friendly fuel cell
system instead of a generator. These
tend to run on bio-methanol or zinc
and only emit water and oxygen.

Using multiple controllers
Sometimes it is desirable to have
multiple controllers on your solar
energy system. For instance, you
may want to install solar panels in
different locations or facing in
different directions, or you may
have mismatched solar panels that
you want to use. If you need to have
multiple controllers, only one needs
to have the expensive features such
as battery balancing. The other
controllers can be much simpler
regulators that simply provide an
additional charge to the batteries
and switch off when the batteries
are fully charged.


Inverters
We are not using an inverter with
our holiday home, but many solar
applications do require an inverter
to switch up the voltage to grid-
level AC current.
An inverter for stand-alone
systems is a different piece of
equipment to a grid-tie solar
inverter. With a grid-tie inverter,
your power is feeding into the grid
and has to work in conjunction with
the grid. The inverter connects
directly to your solar panels and
switches off when the solar panels
no longer produce enough energy.

With a stand-alone system, your
power is entirely separate from the
grid. The inverter connects to your
battery bank and switches off when
the battery bank is running low on
charge.
There are three things to
consider when purchasing an
inverter:
·       Battery bank voltage
·       Power rating
·       Waveform
Battery bank voltage
Different inverters require a

different input voltage. Smaller
inverters, providing up to 3kW of
power, are available for 12-volt
systems. Larger inverters tend to
require higher voltages.
Power rating
The power rating is the maximum
continuous power that the inverter
can supply to all the loads on the
system. You can calculate this by
adding up the wattages of all the
devices that are switched on at any
one time. It is worth adding a
margin for error to this figure.
Inverters will not run beyond their
maximum continuous power rating

for very long.
Most inverters have a peak power
rating as well as a continuous
power rating. This peak power
rating allows for additional loads
for very short periods of time,
which is useful for some electrical
equipment that uses an additional
burst of power when first switched
on (refrigeration equipment, for
example).
As a general rule of thumb, go for a
bigger power rating than you
actually need. Inverters can get very
hot when they get close to their
maximum load for long periods of

time. Many professionals
recommend that you buy an inverter
that has a continuous power rating
that is at least one third higher than
you plan to use.
Waveform
Waveform relates to the quality of
the alternating current (AC) signal
that an inverter provides.
Lower-cost inverters often provide
a modified sine wave signal
(sometimes advertised as a
quasi-sine wave). More expensive
inverters provide a pure sine wave
signal.

Modified sine wave inverters tend
to be considerably cheaper and also
tend to have a higher peak power
rating.
However, some equipment may not
operate correctly with a modified
sine wave inverter. Some power
supplies, such as those used for
laptop computers and portable
televisions, may not work at all,
while some music systems emit a
buzz when run from a modified sine
wave inverter.
These faults are eliminated with a
pure sine wave inverter, which
produces AC electricity with an

identical waveform to the standard
domestic electricity supply
provided by the grid.
Installation options and
operating environment
Small inverters with a continuous
power rating of less than 3kW are
lightweight units and are often
simply placed on a shelf or a desk.
Medium-sized inverters tend to be
heavy units that need to be mounted
securely on a wall. Larger
inverters, rated at 10kW or above,
may need to be bolted to a floor.
All inverters generate a significant

amount of heat, especially when
running close to their rated output,
and require good airflow around the
unit.
Most off-grid inverters are
designed to be installed inside.
Outdoor inverters are available, but
they are expensive and may be
difficult to source. If you are
looking at installing an inverter
outdoors, check that the inverter is
sealed against dust and water
ingress, rated to at least IP64.
Overheating inverters is the number
one reason for any solar system
failing. As an inverter gets hotter,

they provide less power, and if the
temperature continues to rise they
will eventually shut down to avoid
permanent damage. When choosing
an inverter, check its operating
temperatures and consider how you
can ensure your system remains
within these limits.
Inverters should always be installed
in a well-ventilated area, away
from the ceiling and with a
clearance around each side, the top
and the bottom. They cannot be
installed in a sealed cupboard.
Some inverters have the option of
an external heat sink, or
temperature-controlled cooling fans

to help keep the inverter cool.
If your inverter is producing more
than around 500 watts of power, it
is likely to make a very small
amount of noise. This is typically a
continuous low-level hum. This is
usually only noticeable if the
surrounding area is quiet. However,
for this reason, inverters are not
usually installed inside the living
space in a home or in an office
environment. Instead, consider
installing your inverter in a garage,
or on an outside wall of your
building.
Occasionally, with larger inverters,

the sound made by the inverter has
been known to resonate with the
wall, amplifying the sound and
making it quite unpleasant to live
with, even if the inverter is mounted
to an outside wall or the wall of a
garage. This is a very rare
occurrence, but is most likely to
occur if you are planning to mount
your inverter onto a wall made out
of solid concrete. The solution is to
dampen the mounting between the
inverter and the wall or floor that
the inverter is mounted onto. There
is a very effective product called
Green Glue, produced by the Green
Glue Company

(www.GreenGlueCompany.com)
that is applied between the wall and
the inverter. When it is compressed
by remounting the inverter, the glue
spreads out to form a sound
isolation barrier that is particularly
effective at blocking out
low-resonance vibrations.
Ground fault protection
Most inverters now include ground
fault protection. All inverters must
always be grounded. If your chosen
grid-tie inverter does not
incorporate ground fault protection,
you need to incorporate this into
your system using a Residual

Current Device (RCD). RCDs are
known as Ground Fault
Interrupters (GFIs) in the United
States and Canada.

Cables
It is easy to overlook them, but
cables have a vital part to play in
ensuring a successful solar electric
system.
There are three different sets of
cables that you need to consider:
·       Solar array cables
·       Battery cables
·       Appliance cabling
Solar array cabling has already
been discussed. For stand-alone
systems, the battery and appliance
cabling also needs to be correctly

specified.
For all cabling, make sure that you
always use cable that can cope with
the maximum amount of current
(amps) that you are planning to
work with.
Take into account that you may wish
to expand your system at some point
in the future, and use a higher
ampere cable than you actually need
in order to make future expansion as
simple as possible.
Battery cables
Battery cables are used to connect
batteries to the solar controller and

to the inverter. They are also used
to connect multiple batteries
together.
Battery interconnect cable is
available ready-made up from
battery suppliers, or you can make
them up yourself. You should
always ensure that you use the
correct battery connectors to
connect a cable to a battery.
Appliance cabling
If you are using an inverter to run
your appliances at grid-level
voltage, you can use standard
domestic wiring, wired in the same
way as you would wire them for

connection to domestic AC power.
If you are running cabling for
12-volt or 24-volt operation, you
can wire your devices up using the
same wiring structure as you would
use for grid-level voltage, although
you may need to use larger cables
throughout to cope with the higher
current.
In a house, you would typically
have a number of circuits for
different electrical equipment: one
for downstairs lighting, one for
upstairs lighting and one or two for
appliances, depending on how many
you have. This has the benefit of

keeping each individual cable run
as short as possible, as well as
reducing the amount of current that
each circuit needs to handle.
As we have already learnt,
low-voltage systems lose a
significant amount of power through
cabling. The reason for this is that
the current (amps) is much higher
and the power lost through the cable
is proportional to the square of the
current. You therefore need to keep
your cable runs as short as
possible, especially the cable runs
with the highest current throughput.
I have already mentioned how you

can calculate suitable cable
thicknesses for your solar array
earlier in this chapter. You use the
same calculation for calculating
cable thicknesses for appliance
cabling.

Plugs and sockets
For 12-volt or 24-volt circuits with
a current of less than 30 amps, you
can use the same standard switches
and light sockets as you do for
normal domestic power.
However, you must not use the
standard domestic plugs and
sockets for attaching low-voltage
devices to your low-voltage circuit.
If you do, you run the risk that your
low-voltage devices could
accidentally be plugged into a
high-voltage circuit, which could
have disastrous consequences.
Instead, you have the choice of

using non-standard plugs and
sockets or of using the same 12-volt
plugs and sockets as used in
caravans and boats.
These low-voltage sockets do not
need to have a separate earth
(ground) wire, as the negative cable
should always be earthed
(grounded) on a DC circuit system.

Appliances
So far, I have talked a lot about
12-volt appliances, but you can buy
most low-voltage appliances for
either 12-volt or 24-volt and a lot
of them are switchable between 12
and 24 volts.
Compared to appliances that run
from grid-level voltages, you often
pay more for low-voltage
appliances. This is not always the
case, however, and with careful
shopping around, items like
televisions, DVD players, radios
and laptop computers need not cost
any more to buy than standard

versions.
Lighting
12-volt and 24-volt lighting is often
chosen for off-grid solar electric
systems, due to the lower power
consumption of the lower-voltage
lighting. You can buy low-voltage,
energy-saving bulbs and strip lights,
both of which provide the same
quality of light as conventional
lighting. Filament light bulbs are
also available in low-voltage
forms, and although these are not
very energy-efficient, they do
provide an excellent quality of
light.

You can buy a lot of 12-volt
lighting from ordinary hardware
stores. Many kitchen and bathroom
lights work at low voltage and will
work just as well from a 12-volt
battery supply as they will from the
12-volt AC transformers typically
used with this lighting. Diachronic
flood lamps, halogen spot lamps,
strip lamps and LED lights often run
at 12 volts, giving you an excellent
choice. Buying these from a
hardware store rather than from a
specialist solar supplier can also
save a considerable amount of
money.

Refrigeration
A good selection of refrigerators
and freezers are available that will
run from 12-volt and 24-volt power
supplies. Some refrigerators will
run on both low-voltage DC and
grid-level AC voltage, and some
can run from a bottled gas supply as
well.
Unlike most other devices that you
will use, refrigerators need to run
all the time. This means that,
although the power consumption
can be quite low, the overall energy
consumption is comparatively high.
There are three types of

low-voltage refrigerator available:
·       Absorption fridges are
commonly found in caravans
and can often use 12-volt,
grid-level voltage and bottled
gas to power the fridge.
These are very efficient when
powered by gas, but
efficiency when powered on
lower voltages varies
considerably for different
models
·       Peltier effect coolers are
not really fridges in their own
right; they are portable
coolers, of the type often sold

in car accessory shops and
powered by the 12-volt in-car
accessory socket. Whilst
these are cheap, most of them
are not very efficient. Avoid
using these for solar
applications
·       Compressor fridges use the
same technology as
refrigerators in the home.
They are the most efficient for
low-voltage operation. They
are more expensive than other
types but their efficiency is
significantly better: many
models now consume less

than 5 watts of electricity per
hour
You can choose to use a standard
domestic fridge for your solar
electric system, running at grid-
level voltages. However, they are
typically not as efficient as a good
12-volt/24-volt compressor fridge.
Domestic fridges also tend to have
a very high starting current, which
can cause problems with inverters.
A number of manufacturers now
produce refrigerators that are
specifically designed to work with
solar power. Companies such as
Waeco, Sundanzer and Shoreline

produce a range of refrigerators and
freezers suitable for home, medical
and business use.
If you wish to use a standard
domestic fridge, speak to the
supplier of your inverter to make
sure the inverter is suitable. Many
refrigerators have a very high start-
up current and you may need to buy
a larger inverter that can handle this
sudden demand.
Microwave ovens
Standard domestic microwave
ovens consume a lot more power
than their rated power: their rated
power is output power, not input.

You will find the input power on
the power label on the back of the
unit, or you will be able to measure
it using a watt meter.
Typically, the input power for a
microwave oven is 50% higher than
its rated power.
Low-voltage microwave ovens are
available, often sold for use in
caravans and recreational vehicles
(RVs). They tend to be slightly
smaller than normal domestic
microwaves and have a lower
power rating, so cooking times will
increase, but they are much more
energy-efficient.

Televisions, DVDs, computer
games consoles and music
Flat screen LCD televisions and
DVD players designed for 12-volt
or 24-volt operation are available
from boating, camping and leisure
shops. These tend to be quite
expensive, often costing as much as
50% more than equivalent domestic
televisions and DVD players.
However, many domestic LCD
televisions (with screens up to 24-
inch) and DVD players often have
external power supplies and many
of them are rated for a 12-volt
input. Some investigations at your

local electrical store will allow
you to identify suitable models.
If you want to use one of these, it is
worth buying a 12-volt power
regulator to connect between the
television and your battery. Battery
voltages can vary between 11.6
volts and 13.6 volts, which is fine
for most equipment designed for
12-volt electrics, but could damage
more sensitive equipment. Power
regulators fix the voltage at exactly
12 volts, ensuring that this
equipment cannot be damaged by
small fluctuations in voltage.
Many power regulators will also

allow you to run 12-volt devices
from a 24-volt circuit, and are much
more efficient than more traditional
transformers.
Power regulators also allow you to
switch from one voltage to other
low voltages, if required. For
example, the Sony PlayStation 3
games console uses 8.5 volts, and
with a suitable power regulator you
can power one very effectively
from 12-volt batteries.
Power regulators can step up
voltages as well as step down. A
suitable power regulator can switch
the voltage from a solar battery

bank to an output voltage of
between 1½ volts and 40 volts,
depending on the specification of
the regulator.
This means that many normal
household items with external
power supplies, such as smaller
televisions, laptop computers, DVD
players, music systems and
computer games, to name but a few,
can be connected directly to your
solar power system.
Music systems
Like televisions and DVD players,
many music systems have an
external power supply, and a power

regulator can be used in place of the
external power supply to power a
music system.
Alternatively, you can build your
own built-in music system using in-
car components. This can be very
effective, both in terms of sound
quality and price, with the added
benefit that you can hide the
speakers in the ceiling.
Using a music system with an
inverter which has a modified sine
wave can be problematic. Music
systems designed to run at grid-
level voltages expect to work on a
pure sine wave system and may

buzz or hum if used with a modified
sine wave inverter.
Dishwashers, washing
machines and tumble dryers
Dishwashers, washing machines
and tumble dryers tend to be very
power hungry.
There are small washing machines,
twin tubs and cool-air dryers
available that run on low voltage,
but these are really only suitable for
small amounts of washing. They
may be fine in a holiday home or in
a small house for one person, but
are not suitable for the weekly

washing for a family of four.
If you need to run a washing
machine from a solar electric
system, you are going to need an
inverter to run it. The amount of
energy that washing machines
consume really does vary from one
model to the next. An
energy-efficient model may only use
1,100 watts, whereas an older
model may use almost three times
this amount.
The same is true for dishwashers.
Energy-efficient models may only
use 500 watts, whereas older
models may use nearer 2,500 watts.

If you need to run a dishwasher, you
will need to use an inverter.
Tumble dryers are hugely energy
inefficient and should be avoided if
at all possible. Most of them use
between 2,000 and 3,000 watts of
electricity and run for at least one
hour per drying cycle.
There are various alternatives to
tumble dryers. These range from the
traditional clothes line or clothes
airer to the more high-tech low-
energy convection heating dryers
that can dry your clothes in around
half an hour with minimal amounts
of power.

If you really must have a tumble
dryer, you may wish to consider a
bottled gas powered tumble dryer.
These are more energy-efficient
than electric tumble dryers and will
not put such a strain on your solar
electric system.
Air conditioning systems
Over the past couple of years, a
number of manufacturers have been
launching solar powered air
conditioning and air cooling
systems.
Air conditioning has traditionally
been very power hungry. For this
reason, solar powered air

conditioning has been unaffordable,
as a large solar array has been
required simply to run the
compressors.
In response, manufacturers have
developed more efficient air
conditioning systems, designed to
run from a DC power source.
Companies such as Austin Solar,
Solar AC, Securus, Sunsource,
Sedna Aire, Hitachi and LG have
all announced air conditioning units
designed to work with solar energy.
Other manufacturers have
developed evaporative air coolers
that use a fraction of the power of

an air conditioning unit. Whilst
these air coolers do not provide the
‘instant chill’ factor of a full air
conditioning system, by running
constantly when the sun is shining,
they can provide a very comfortable
living and working environment at a
fraction of the cost of full air
conditioning.

Reputable brand names
Most solar manufacturers are not
household names, and as such it is
difficult for someone outside the
industry to know which brands have
the best reputation.
Of course, this is a subjective list
and simply because a manufacturer
does not appear on this list, it does
not mean the brand or the product is
not good.

Shopping list for the
holiday home
Because our solar electric system is
being installed in the garden, 10
metres (33 feet) away from the
house, we have worked out that we
need to run our system at 24 volts
rather than 12 volts, due to the high
levels of losses in the system.
I have already calculated that I need
320 watts of power from my solar
array at 24 volts. To achieve this, I
will need to connect 12-volt solar
panels in series to make a 24-volt
system.

There are various different options
available to make a 320-watt, 24-
volt solar array. After checking
with a number of suppliers, I have
come up with the following options:
·       Buy two 160-watt panels
for a total of 320 watts of
power – total cost £499
($768 US)
·       Buy four 80-watt panels for
a total of 320 watts of power
– total cost £434 ($668 US)
·       Buy eight 40-watt panels for
a total of 320 watts of power
– total cost £640 ($985 US)

·       Buy six 60-watt panels for a
total of 360 watts of power) –
total cost £580 ($893 US)
It is really worth shopping around
and finding the best price. Prices
can vary dramatically from one
supplier to another and I have seen
many cases where one supplier is
selling a solar panel for over twice
the price it is available from
elsewhere.
Depending on what configuration I
buy (and where I buy it), solar
panel prices for the different
combinations vary between £434
($668 US) and £640 ($985).

Based on price and convenience, I
have decided to go for the cheapest
option and buy four Clear Skies 80-
watt polycrystalline solar panels.
Because I am running at 24 volts
and at a relatively low current, I
have a good choice of solar
controllers without spending a
fortune. I decided to buy a Steca
MPPT controller, which
incorporates a built-in LCD display
so I can see how much charge my
batteries have at any one time. The
cost of this controller is £225
($350).

This drawing shows
how I intend to wire
up my solar array. I
will pair two sets of
panels together in
series to bring the
voltage up from 12
volts per panel to 24
volts per pair. I then
connect the pairs

together in parallel
to maintain the 24
volts but to increase
the power of the
system to a total of
320 watts
I calculated that I needed 181Ah of
24-volt battery storage. I have
decided to go for four Trojan 12V,
105Ah batteries, which I will
connect together in pairs to provide
me 210 Ah of power at 24 volts.
The cost of these batteries is £560
($860).

This drawing shows
how I intend to wire
up my batteries. I
will pair two sets of
batteries together in
series to bring the
voltage up to 24
volts per pair. I then
connect the pairs
together in parallel
to maintain the 24

volts but to increase
my storage capacity
to 210 amp-hours at
24 volts
My Steca controller incorporates
Ground Fault Protection, but I have
decided to install a separate RCD
(GFI) unit as well. It is a ‘belt and
braces’ approach, but RCDs are
extremely cheap and I feel it is
worth the extra money. I still need a
way of isolating the solar array
manually. I choose to install three
DC isolation switches: one between
my controller and the solar array,
one between my solar controller
and my batteries and one between

my controller and my distribution
box. This allows me to isolate each
part of my system separately, for
maintenance or in case of an
emergency.
For lighting, I have decided on
24-volt energy saving compact
fluorescent light bulbs for inside
use and a 24-volt halogen bulkhead
light for an outdoor light. The
energy saving compact fluorescent
light bulbs look identical to grid-
powered energy saving light bulbs
and provide the same level of
lighting as their grid-powered
equivalents. Bulbs cost around

£8/$13 each and I can use the same
light switches and fittings as I
would for lights powered by the
grid.
I have decided to use a Shoreline
RR14 battery-powered fridge,
which can run on either 12-volt or
24-volt power supplies. This has a
claimed average power
consumption of 6 watts per hour
and costs £380 ($610).
For television, I have chosen a
Meos 19-inch flat screen TV with
built-in DVD player. The Meos TV
can run on 12-volt or 24-volt power
and has an average power

consumption of 45 watts. This is
slightly higher than I was originally
planning for (I was planning to buy
a model with a 40 watt power
consumption), but not by enough to
be of any great concern.
At this stage, I now know the main
components I am going to be using
for my holiday home. I have not
gone into all the details, such as
cables and configuration. We need
to complete that as we plan the
detailed design for our solar energy
system.

In conclusion
·       When choosing solar
panels, buy from a reputable
manufacturer. The
performance of the
high-quality panels,
especially in overcast
conditions, is often better than
the cheaper panels, and the
improved build quality
should ensure a longer life
·       Lead acid batteries come in
various types and sizes. You
can calculate the optimum
size of battery based on cycle
life when operating on your

system
·       The voltage you run your
system at will depend on the
size of current you want to
run through it. High-current
systems are less efficient than
low-current systems, and
low- current inverters and
controllers are inevitably
cheaper
·       Allow for future expansion
in your system by buying a
bigger controller and inverter
than you currently need,
unless you are absolutely
certain your requirements are

not going to change in the
future
·       Many appliances and
devices are available in
low-voltage versions as well
as grid-level voltage
versions. Generally, the
low-voltage versions tend to
be more efficient
·       When wiring in 12-volt or
24-volt sockets, do not use
standard domestic power
sockets. If you do, you are
running the risk of
low-voltage devices being
plugged into grid-level

voltage sockets, which could
have disastrous consequences

Planning, regulations
and approvals
Depending on where you live
around the world, there are
different planning requirements,
regulations and approvals needed
for installing a solar energy system.
Some countries have little or no
regulation in place; other countries
have extremely tight regulations. In
some countries, the regulations
change from one region to another.
Consequently, it is impossible to
provide every bit of relevant

information here. Instead, we
provide much of this information on
www.SolarElectricityHandbook.com
You will also be able to find
information from your local
planning authority and electricity
providers.
Wherever you live around the
world, there is a simple mantra for
dealing with authority when it
comes to building and electrical
regulations and approvals: if in
doubt, ask. Ignorance is never an
excuse.
In the case of a solar installation,
the people you need to speak to are

your local planning office, your
buildings insurance provider and, if
you are building a grid-tie system,
your local electricity company. Not
only will they be able to help
ensure you do not fall foul of any
regulation; you will often find they
are a helpful and useful source of
information in their own right.

National and
international standards
for solar components
In the United States, Canada,
Australia and across Europe, solar
panels and inverters must comply
with specific standards in order to
be used in a grid-tie system. The
units are tested to ensure that they
conform to these standards before
they are allowed on sale.
Across Europe, solar panels have
to be certified to IEC safety
standard IEC 61730 and
performance standards IEC 61215

or IEC 61646. Solar grid-tie
inverters have to conform to IEC
62109. Some European countries
have additional certification. In
Germany, grid-tie inverters must
have a VDE126 certification, whilst
in the United Kingdom, grid tie
inverters that produce fewer than 16
amps of peak power (3.6kW) must
have G83/1 certification, and larger
inverters require the much more
complicated G59/1 certification.
Also in the United Kingdom, solar
panels and inverters have to be
certified by the Micro generation
Certificate Scheme (MCS) in order
to be eligible for feed-in tariffs and

other financial incentives.
In the United States, solar panels,
solar cables and inverters have to
have UL certification. Solar panels
must conform to the UL 1703
standard. Grid-tie inverters must
conform to UL 1741 and solar
cabling must conform to UL 4703 or
UL 854 (USE-2). If you are using
batteries in your design, the
batteries must conform to either UL
1989, UL 2054, UL-SU 2580 or
UL-SU 1973.
In Canada, solar panels must
conform to safety standard
ULC/ORD-C1703-1 and design

standards CAN/CSA C61215-08 or
CAN/CSA C61646-2, whilst grid-
tie inverters must conform to CSA
C22.2 No. 107.1. Batteries must
conform to CAN/CSA F382-M89
(R2004).
In Australia, solar panels must
conform to AS/NZS5033, whilst
grid-tie inverters must conform to
AS4777. If you are planning a
stand-alone system in a building,
your system must also conform to
AS4509. If you are planning a
mobile system, for instance in a
caravan or recreational vehicle,
your system must conform to
AS3001.

It is worth noting that, in all of these
regions, no differentiation is made
between grid-tie solar and stand-
alone systems for component
selection. If you are building a solar
energy system that is to be fitted to
a building, your system must use
certified components in order to
comply with building and electrical
safety regulations in these regions.
If you use non-approved equipment
in a grid-tie system in these
countries, you will not be allowed
to connect your system to the grid.
You are also likely to be in
contravention of building

regulations and may invalidate your
buildings insurance.

Installation regulations
In many countries, including the
United States, Canada, Australia,
New Zealand and throughout most
of the European Union, you cannot
work on building electrics unless
you are a qualified electrician.
Some countries allow you to work
on electrics, but your work has to
be checked and certified by a
qualified electrician before
commissioning.
In the main, low-voltage DC
circuits are excluded from this
legislation, but it is worth ensuring
that this is the case in your region.

In many countries, there are
additional qualifications for
electricians that allow them to
install and certify solar energy
systems. In most countries, it is not
yet a legal requirement to have
additional training in order to
install photovoltaic systems.
However, if you wish to get access
to government subsidies, feed-in
tariffs or renewable energy
certificates, you will almost
certainly need to have your system
installed, or at least checked, tested
and certified, by qualified solar
installation specialists. This is
certainly the case in the United

Kingdom and Australia. In the
United States, subsidies vary from
state to state, and often from county
to county.

Getting your electricity
supplier involved
If you are planning a grid-tie
system, it is worth getting your
electricity supplier involved in your
project earlier rather than later.
Sometimes they have their own
requirements or lists of approved
equipment. They often have
specialists you can speak to, who
can give you extra advice and
support.
In most parts of the world, your
electricity company will usually
need to be involved while your
system is being installed, replacing

your current electricity meter with a
specific import/export meter and
carrying out the final inspection
before approving your system.
Some electricity companies will
only accept feed-in connections
from professional solar PV
installers. Almost all electricity
providers insist that the installation
is inspected and signed off, either
by a certified solar installer or by
one of their own inspectors, before
they will accept your connection
onto the grid.

Solar grants and selling
your power
Around the world, governments are
encouraging the take-up of solar
energy. Financial assistance comes
through various different schemes,
and researching what is available
can be confusing and
time-consuming.
The different types of schemes that
are offered in different places are
described in more detail below.
The specific schemes for grants and
the amount of money you can
receive for installing solar power
and selling your electricity vary

from country to country, and often
from county to county. Many
countries are currently reviewing
their schemes, which means that
information that is current one
month will be out of date the next.
The Solar Electricity Handbook
website has information on specific
financial incentive schemes for
various countries, as this can be
kept more up-to-date than the book.
General information about
grants, tax credits and feed-in
tariffs
Whilst some schemes are flexible

over who is allowed to install your
solar energy system, most schemes
work in conjunction with a
governing body that insists that your
system is installed by one of their
members.
In some cases, individuals have
been able to get their system signed
off by a solar energy company in
order to claim the financial
incentives. However, this is often at
the discretion of the solar installers,
and many will refuse outright.
In general, financial incentives are
being offered through four different
mechanisms:

·       Feed-in tariffs
·       Tax credits
·       Renewable Energy
Certificates (RECs)
·       Remote installation
allowances
Feed-in tariffs
If you have a grid-tie solar energy
system, you can often sell your
power back to the electricity
companies. This is done through a
feed-in tariff, where the electricity
providers agree to buy your surplus
power at an agreed rate.

In some countries, feed-in tariffs
are set by the electricity companies
and can vary throughout the day,
depending on supply and demand.
In other countries, feed-in tariffs are
fixed by the government, often at a
premium rate in order to
compensate solar owners for the
up-front cost of installing their
systems.
In many cases, the government
guarantees the value of feed-in
tariffs for a minimum number of
years, thereby guaranteeing that
owners make a return on their
investments. A common theme with

governments is to set a very high
value for feed-in tariffs initially and
then to reduce the feed-in tariff
values for new customers
significantly after two years. This
has happened in Spain, Portugal,
Germany, Hong Kong and now the
United Kingdom. The message is
this: if you are offered guaranteed
long-term feed-in tariffs at a very
good and guaranteed rate of return,
take up the offer: the scheme is
unlikely to remain available for
more than two years.
Tax credits
A second option for compensating

solar energy owners is a tax credit
scheme where all or part of the
installation cost of a solar energy
system may be offset against tax. In
some countries, these schemes are
only available to businesses; in
others they are available to
individuals as well.
With a tax credit, you pay for the
installation up front, but then
receive part or all of the money
back through tax credits over one,
two or three years.
The United States of America are
currently offering tax credits for
people installing solar energy

systems through the Federal Tax
Credits for Consumer Energy
Efficiency scheme. There are
additional tax credits available in
some states and counties.
Renewable Energy Certificates
(RECs)
Renewable Energy Certificates are
tradable certificates that prove that
a certain amount of energy was
generated from renewable sources.
These certificates can be bought
and sold on the open market.
Whoever owns the certificate can
claim to have bought electricity
from a renewable resource.

There are two markets for buying
renewable energy certificates:
·       The voluntary sector –
where individuals and
companies elect to buy green
electricity and pay a premium
to do so
·       The electricity providers
themselves, who are
mandated by governments to
provide a certain percentage
of their electricity from green
sources
In some countries, individuals and
small businesses who install solar
energy systems are eligible to

receive renewable energy
certificates for the energy they
produce. In many cases, renewable
energy certificates are available for
both grid-tie and stand-alone
systems.
In some countries, governments
have encouraged the take-up of
small-scale solar by providing a
multiplier for small solar
generators. Under these schemes,
solar energy owners can receive
two, three or even five times the
number of renewable energy
certificates for the energy they
produce, ensuring that owners can
earn money from their small-scale

solar energy systems.
Renewable energy certificates are
also known as Green Tags in the
United States and Tradable
Renewable Certificates (TRCs) in
South Africa and New Zealand.
Remote installation allowances
Remote installation allowances are
offered in a few countries. They
tend to be available for individuals
and businesses with premises in
remote areas, where the cost of
connecting these buildings to the
grid is very high.
By their very nature, these systems

are stand-alone, off-grid
applications. A good example of the
sort of scheme on offer is the
Australian model that provides
credits for people installing solar
where the cost of connecting their
premises to the grid is greater than
AUS $30,000, or the distance
between the premises and the grid
is greater than 1 km.
How much money is available, and
how it is paid, varies from one
scheme to another. In Australia, the
remote installation allowance is
offered by multiplying the number
of renewable energy certificates
that owners can receive for their

system.

In conclusion
·       There are different rules
and regulations for installing
solar power depending on
where you live
·       You have to comply with
the building regulations and
electrical regulations that are
in force in your region
·       You will be able to find
help by talking to your local
planning office and your
electricity provider. You will
also need to talk to your
building insurance company

·       There are many national and
international standards for
solar energy systems,
covering both the actual
physical hardware and how it
is installed
·       In many places around the
world there are financial
incentives available for solar
energy providers. These
schemes vary, but tend to fall
into four camps: feed-in
tariffs, tax credits, renewable
energy certificates and remote
installation allowances

Detailed Design
By now, you know what
components you are going to use for
your solar project. The next step is
to work on your detailed design:
effectively, a picture of what you
want to build. Even for simple
projects, it makes sense to draw up
a diagram before installation.
The benefits of drawing a wiring
diagram are numerous:
·       It ensures that nothing has
been overlooked
·       It will assist in the cable

sizing process
·       It helps ensure nothing gets
forgotten in the installation
(especially where there is a
group of people working
together on site)
·       It provides useful
documentation for
maintaining the system in the
future
The wiring diagram will be
different for each installation and
will vary depending on what
components are used. Read the
product documentation for each
component for information on how

it must be wired.
If you have not yet chosen your
exact components at this stage,
draw a general diagram but make
sure that you flesh this out into a
detailed document before the
installation goes ahead.

A sample wiring
diagram for a simple
stand-alone lighting
system
When drawing up your wiring
diagrams, you will need to
remember the following:

Safety is designed in
It is easy to forget that solar energy
can be dangerous. We are working
with electricity and whilst any
individual component may only be
low-voltage, some of the currents
involved can be quite significant.
Furthermore, connecting multiple
solar panels or batteries together in
series can very quickly create a
high voltage. It is therefore
important that safety be taken into
account during the detailed design
phase of the project, as well as
during installation.
When designing the system, ask

yourself this question:
“What’s the worst that can
happen?”
Solar energy systems are relatively
straightforward and the design of
all the components you will use
will keep risks to an absolute
minimum. Nevertheless, there are
potential risks. If you are aware of
these risks, you can take steps to
eradicate them in your design.
What is the worst that can
happen with a solar
installation?
With solar energy, we will be

working in a few risk areas: DC
electrics from the solar array, high
currents from batteries, AC
electrics if you are using an
inverter, and high temperatures
from the solar panels themselves.
Each of these risk areas can pose
problems, both in isolation and
when combined. It is worth
considering these risks to ensure
that you can design out as many of
them as possible.
Grounding your electrics
Except for a very small system,
such as rigging up a light in a shed,
a solar energy system should

always be earthed (grounded). This
means running a wire from a
negative terminal to an earthing rod
(known as a grounding rod in
North America) that is rammed into
the ground.
An earthing rod (grounding rod) is a
1m (3 foot) long metal pole,
typically made of copper. They are
available from all electrical
wholesalers and builders’
merchants.
Connections to a ground prevent
build-up of static electricity and can
help prevent contact with high
voltages if the circuit gets damaged.

If you are connecting a solar array
to a home, you should always
include a ground connection from
the solar array itself. Whilst it is
optional in other cases, it is always
a good idea to include a ground
from a solar array, where the array
is capable of generating more than
200 watts. You must also earth the
battery bank, as they are capable of
delivering very high currents.
If you are using both AC electrics
and DC electrics in your system,
you must always have a separate
ground for each system.
Grounding a system where you

cannot connect to the ground
There may be instances where you
are building a system where no
connection to the ground is
possible. For instance, a portable
solar charging unit that can be
carried anywhere, or a solar
powered boat.
Typically, these designs are very
small, using only DC electrics and
running only a few amps of current.
If your solar array is less than 100
watts, your system runs at 12 volts
and you are drawing less than 10
amps of current, you are unlikely to
need a common earth for all your

components.
For larger systems, a ground plane
is often used. A ground plane is a
high-capacity cable connected to
the negative pole on the battery, to
which every other component
requiring a ground is also
connected. A thick, heavy-duty
battery interconnection cable is
often used as a ground plane cable,
with thinner wires connecting to
this ground plane cable from every
other component requiring an earth.
As an alternative to a high-capacity
cable, depending on what you are
installing your solar system on, you

can use a metal frame as the
common ground for your system. In
standard car electrics, for example,
the ground plane is the car body
itself.
DC Electrics
Direct current electricity typically
runs at relatively low voltages: we
are all familiar with AA batteries
and low-voltage transformers used
for charging up devices such as
mobile phones. We know that if we
touch the positive and negative
nodes on an AA battery we are not
going to electrocute ourselves.
However, direct current electricity

can be extremely dangerous, even at
comparatively low voltages.
Around the world, a small number
of people are killed every year by
licking 9-volt batteries, because of
the electric jolt they receive. Scale
that up to an industrial grade heavy-
duty 12-volt traction battery,
capable of delivering over 1,000
amps of current, or a solar array
capable of producing hundreds of
volts on an open circuit, and it is
easy to see that there is a real risk
involved with DC electrics.
If you are electrocuted with AC
power, the alternating current

means that whilst the shock can be
fatal, the most likely outcome is that
you will be thrown back and let go.
If you are electrocuted with DC
power, there is a constant charge
running through you. This means
you cannot let go. If you are
electrocuted with very high current
DC, the injury is more likely to be
fatal than a similar shock with AC
power.
Because of the low current from a
single solar panel, you are unlikely
to notice any jolt if you short-circuit
the panel and your fingers get in the
way. However, wire up multiple
solar panels together and it is a

different story. Four solar panels
connected in series produce a
nominal 48 volts. The peak voltage
is nearer 80–100 volts. At this
level, a shock could prove fatal for
a young child or an elderly person.
The current thinking with grid-tie
solar systems is to connect many
solar panels together in series,
creating a very high-voltage DC
circuit. Whilst there are some
(small) efficiency benefits of
running the system at very high
voltage, there are risks as well,
both during the installation and the
ongoing maintenance of the system.

There are issues with the 12-volt
batteries too. Industrial grade,
heavy-duty batteries can easily
deliver a charge of 1,000 amps for
a short period. Short out a battery
with a spanner and it will be red
hot in just a few seconds. In fact,
the current delivery is so great it is
possible to weld metal using a
single 12-volt battery.
The big risk with DC electrics is
electrocuting yourself (or somebody
else) or causing a short circuit,
which in turn could cause a fire.
Solar panels generate electricity all
the time, often including a small

current at night, and cannot simply
be switched off. Therefore, there
need to be manual DC circuit
breakers (also called isolation
switches) to isolate the solar panels
from the rest of the circuit, plus a
good ground and a ground fault
protection system to automatically
switch off the system should a short
circuit occur.
If your system is running at a high
voltage, you may want to consider
multiple DC circuit breakers/
isolation switches between
individual solar panels. This means
that, as well as shutting off the
overall circuit, you can reduce the

voltage of the solar array down to
that of a single panel or a small
group of panels. This can be of
benefit when maintaining the solar
array, or in the case of an
emergency.
A short circuit in a solar array can
happen for many reasons.
Sometimes it is because of a
mistake during installation, but it
can also occur as a result of general
wear and tear (especially with
installations where the tilt of the
solar panels is adjusted regularly)
or as a result of animal damage
such as bird mess corroding cables

or junction boxes, or a fox chewing
through a cable.
Short circuits can also occur where
you are using unsuitable cabling.
Solar interconnection cabling is
resistant to UV rays and high
temperatures, and the shielding is
usually reinforced to reduce the risk
of animal damage. Always use
solar interconnection cabling for
wiring your array and for the
cabling between the array and your
solar controller or inverter.
When a short circuit does occur,
there is often not a complete loss of
power. Instead, power generation

drops as resistance builds up. There
is a build-up of heat at the point of
failure. If you have a ground fault
protection system such as an RCD
or GFI in place, the system should
switch itself off automatically at
this point, before any further
damage is caused.
If you do not have a ground fault
protection system in place, the heat
build-up can become quite intense,
in some cases as high as several
hundred degrees. There have been
documented instances where this
heat build-up has started a fire.
If a fire does break out, you need to

be able to isolate the system as
quickly as possible. Because a
solar array cannot be switched off
(it always generates power
whenever there is light) there have
been cases where the fire brigade
have not been able to put out a fire
generated by a fault in a solar array
because there has been no way of
switching it off. Isolating the solar
array quickly, using a DC circuit
breaker, resolves this problem.
However, remember that, even if
you isolate the solar array, you are
still generating power within the
solar array. If you have many solar
panels, the voltage and the current

can still be quite considerable. The
ability to shut down the array by
fitting DC circuit breakers within
the array can significantly reduce
this power, rendering the system far
safer if there is an emergency.
AC electrics
AC electrical safety is the same as
household electrical safety. It is
high-voltage and in many countries
you are not allowed to work with it
unless you are suitably qualified.
You will need to install two AC
isolation switches: one switch
between the inverter and the

distribution panel to isolate the
solar system completely, and one
switch between your grid-feed and
your distribution panel to isolate
your system from the grid if you are
running a grid-tie system.
If you are planning a grid-tie
installation, you will need to speak
with your electricity supplier, as
there will often be additional
requirements that you will need to
incorporate. Your inverter will
need to be a specific grid-tie system
that switches off in the case of a
grid power cut. This ensures that
power is not fed back into the grid
from your solar system in the case

of a power failure, which could
otherwise prove fatal for an
engineer working on restoring
power.
High temperatures
We have already touched on the
risk of high temperatures with a
solar array. Solar panels are black
and face the sun: they can therefore
get very hot on a warm day. It may
not be hot enough to fry an egg, but
in many climates it can certainly be
hot enough to burn skin.
So make sure your solar array is
installed in a place where it cannot

be touched by curious children. If
the solar panels are close to the
ground, make sure there is some
protection to keep people away
from it.
The high temperatures become more
of a problem if there is a fault
within the solar array or with the
wires running between solar panels.
If a cable or a solar panel becomes
damaged, there can be significant
heat build-up. As already
mentioned, this heat build-up can
lead to a fire.
A residual current device (RCD),
otherwise known as a ground fault

interrupter (GFI) should avert this
problem, allowing you to
investigate the issue before
significant damage occurs.
However, manual DC circuit
breakers should also be installed in
order to override the system in case
of an emergency.
Think safety
That is the end of the safety lecture
for now. I will touch on safety again
when we come to installation, but
for now, please remember that
safety does not happen by accident.
Consider the safety aspects when
you are designing your system and

you will end up with a safe system.
The additional cost of a few AC
and DC circuit breakers, an earthing
rod/ grounding rod, an RCD/ GFI
and getting the right cables is not
going to break the bank. It is money
well worth spending.

Solar array design
All solar panels in an array must
face in the same direction. This
ensures that each cell receives the
same amount of light, which is
important for optimum power
production.
Sometimes, you may want to install
solar panels in different locations,
such as on two different pitches of
roof. In this instance, you need to
keep the two banks of solar panels
separate, running them as two
separate arrays, either by feeding
them into an inverter or controller
that can handle more than one solar

input, or by feeding them into two
separate inverters or controllers.
If you wish to mix and match
different sizes of solar panel, you
will also need to set these up in
separate arrays and wire these
separately, either using an inverter
or controller that can handle more
than one solar input, or using two
separate inverters or controllers.
If you are designing a grid-tie
system, where you are considering
different sizes or orientations of
solar panels, you should seriously
consider a micro-inverter system
where each solar panel has its own

inverter.
Solar array design – stand-
alone systems
If you have more than one solar
panel and you are running your
solar electric system at 12 volts,
then you will need to wire your
panels together in parallel in order
to increase your capacity without
increasing the overall voltage.
If you are running your solar
electric system at higher voltages,
you either need to buy
higher-voltage solar panels, or you
will need more than one solar

panel, wired in series to increase
the voltage of the solar panels to the
voltage of your overall system:
·       For a 24-volt system, you
have the choice of using 24-
volt solar panels, or two 12-
volt solar panels connected in
series
·       For a 48-volt system, you
can use one 48-volt solar
panel, two 24-volt solar
panels connected in series, or
four 12-volt solar panels
connected in series
Once you have reached the voltage
that you want, you can then run the

panels both in series and in
parallel, connecting strings of
panels together in series to reach
your desired voltage, and then
connecting multiple strings together
in parallel to increase your
capacity:

A sample diagram of
a 24-volt array
where two sets of
two 12-volt solar
panels are connected
in series in order to
create a 24-volt
array and the two
arrays are then
connected in parallel
to create a more
powerful 24-volt
array.
Solar array design – grid-tie
systems with micro-inverters
If you are designing a grid-tie

system and using micro-inverters,
your design is extremely simple.
Each solar panel becomes a self-
sufficient solar energy system, each
feeding power into its own micro-
inverter. The micro-inverters
convert the energy to AC and feed it
into the main AC circuit.
Solar array design – grid-tie
systems with a single inverter

If you are designing a grid-tie
system with a single inverter, you
will typically be connecting all
your solar panels in series and then
feeding this high-voltage DC power
into an inverter.
A simplified block
diagram of a typical
grid-tie system using
a single inverter.
The residual current
device (RCD)

provides ground
fault protection. In
the United States, an
RCD is known as a
ground fault
interrupter (GFI)
Because of the very high DC
voltages involved, additional
safeguards are necessary. The solar
array must always be grounded,
there must be a DC circuit breaker
(also known as an isolation switch)
installed between the solar array
and the inverter and there must be a
DC residual current device/ ground
fault interrupter installed to shut
down the solar array in the case of

a short circuit.
In the diagram below, there are
sixteen solar panels connected in
series. Assuming each solar panel
produces a 12-volt output, this
system will run at a nominal 192
volts, with a peak power in the
region of 320 volts and an open
circuit voltage of 416 volts.
Because of the very high voltages, I
have decided to install additional
DC circuit breakers in the middle of
the solar array in order to reduce
the voltage within the array if I
switch them off. This makes the
system safer during maintenance

and can reduce the risk of fire or
electrocution in case of an
emergency.
The diagram shows two AC
isolation switches: one switch
between the inverter and the
distribution panel to isolate the
solar system completely from your
house and one switch to isolate
your building from the grid.


Above: A sample
block diagram for a
grid-tie system
In the United States, you are not
allowed to have a grid-tie solar
energy system where any part of
that system has the potential to run
at over 600 volts. This means that
the open voltage of your solar array
must be less than 600 volts. In
general, this means that you will not
want to connect more than twenty
12-volt solar panels or ten 24-volt
solar panels in series, in order to
ensure that you stay well below this
level.

In Europe, it is advisable that your
open circuit voltage remains under
1,000 volts. In general, this means
that you will not want to connect
more than thirty 12-volt solar
panels, or fifteen 24-volt solar
panels in series.
If you are running close to this limit,
there are three options, which I
have listed in order of preference:
·       Install a micro-inverter
system
·       Install a multi-string system,
either using an inverter that
handles more than one solar
feed, or by using two separate

inverters
·       Wire your solar panels in a
parallel/series hybrid

Batteries
Batteries are wired in a similar
way to your solar array. You can
wire up multiple 12-volt batteries
in parallel to build a 12-volt system
with higher energy capacity, or you
can wire multiple batteries in series
to build a higher-voltage system.
When wiring batteries together in
parallel, it is important to wire
them up so that you take the positive
connection off the first battery in the
bank and the negative connection
off the last battery in the bank.
This ensures equal energy drain and
charging across the entire battery

bank. If you use the same battery in
the bank for negative and positive
connections to the controller and
inverter, you drain this first battery
faster than the rest of the batteries in
the bank. The first battery also gets
the biggest recharge from the solar
array.
This shortens the life of the battery
and means all the batteries in the
bank end up out of balance. Other
batteries in the bank never get fully
charged by the solar array, as the
first battery will report being fully
charged first and the controller will
then switch the power off rather
than continuing to charge the rest of

the batteries in the bank. The result
is that the batteries end up with a
shorter lifespan.


How to wire
batteries in parallel:
the diagram on the
left, where power
feed for both positive
and negative is taken
off the first battery
in the bank, shows
how not to do it – it
will lead to poor
battery performance
and premature
battery failure. The
diagram on the right,
where the positive
feed is taken off the
first battery in the

bank and the
negative feed is
taken off the last
battery in the bank,
is correct and will
lead to a more
balanced system with
a significantly
longer life.
Controller
A controller will have connections
to the solar array, to the battery
bank and to DC loads. Although
controllers tend not to have the
same heat problems as inverters,
they can get warm in use. Make sure

they are installed in an area with
good ventilation around them and in
a location where they can be easily
checked.
Inverter
Where an inverter is used in a
stand-alone or grid fallback system,
it is connected directly to the
battery bank and not through the
controller.
Make sure that you design your
system so that the inverter is in a
well-ventilated area. Take into
account the weight of the inverter
and ensure that it is installed in a
location where it can easily be

checked.
Devices
Devices are connected to the
inverter if they require grid-level
voltage, or to the controller if they
are low-voltage DC devices. They
are never connected directly to the
solar array or the batteries.

Specifics for a grid
fallback system
Because a grid fallback system
does not connect your solar energy
system to the grid, you are less
restricted as to the components you
can use.
You must still adhere to basic
wiring legislation for your country.
In some countries (such as the
United Kingdom, for instance) this
can mean having the final
connection into your building
electricity supply installed by a
fully qualified electrician, but this
is significantly cheaper than having

a grid-tie system installed and
inspected.
The design for a grid fallback
system is very similar to a stand-
alone solar system, i.e. solar
panels, solar controller and
batteries. The only difference is
what happens after the batteries.
The advantage of a grid fallback
system is that it can work in three
ways: it can provide power for an
entire building, it can provide
power for specific circuits within a
building or it can provide power
for a single circuit within a
building.

More information and a sample
circuit diagram for grid fallback
configurations are included in
Appendix E.

Circuit protection
Circuit protection is required in any
system to ensure the system shuts
down safely in the event of a short
circuit. It is as valid on low-voltage
systems as it is on high-voltage
systems.
A low-voltage system can cause
major problems simply because of
the huge current that a 12-volt
battery can generate: in excess of
1,000 amps in a short burst can
easily cause a severe shock and
even death or serious injury in some
cases.
In the case of a short circuit, your

wiring will get extremely hot and
start melting within seconds unless
suitable protection has been fitted.
This can cause fire or burns, and
necessary protection should be
fitted to ensure that no damage to
the system occurs as a result of an
accidental short circuit.
Earthing (grounding)
In all systems, the negative terminal
on the battery should be adequately
earthed (referred to as grounded in
North America). If there is no
suitable earth available, a
grounding rod or ground plane
should be installed.

DC circuit protection
For very small systems generating
less than 100 watts of power, the
fuse built into the controller will
normally be sufficient for basic
circuit protection. In a larger
system, where feed for some DC
devices does not go through a
controller, a fuse should be
incorporated on the battery positive
terminal.
Where you fit a fuse to the battery,
you must ensure that all current
from the battery has to pass through
that terminal.
In DC systems with multiple

circuits, it is advisable to fit fuses
to each of these circuits. If you are
using 12 volts or 24 volts, you can
use the same fuses and circuit
breakers as you would for normal
domestic power circuits. For
higher-voltage DC systems, you
must use specialist DC fuses.
When connecting devices to your
DC circuits, you do not need to
include a separate earth (ground)
for each device, as the negative is
already earthed at the batteries.
Fit an isolation switch (DC
disconnect switch) between your
solar array and your inverter or

controller. Fit a second isolation
switch between your batteries and
your controller and inverter.
Unless your controller or inverter
already incorporates one, you
should fit a DC residual current
device/ ground fault interrupter
between your solar array and your
controller or inverter.
AC circuit protection
AC circuits should be fed through a
distribution panel (otherwise
known as a consumer unit). This
distribution panel should be earthed
(grounded) and should incorporate
an earth leakage trip with a residual

current device (RCD), otherwise
known as a ground fault interrupter.
As you will have earthed your
DC components, you must use a
separate earth (ground) for AC
circuits.
You must also install an AC
disconnect switch (isolation
switch) between your inverter and
your distribution panel. In the case
of a grid-tie system, this is normally
a legal requirement, but it is good
practice anyway.
The wiring in the building should
follow normal wiring practices.
You should use a qualified

electrician for installing and signing
off all grid-level voltage work.

Cable sizing and
selection
Once you have your wiring
diagram, it is worth making notes
on cable lengths for each part of the
diagram, and making notes on what
cables you will use for each part of
the installation.
Sizing your cables
This section is repeated from the
previous chapter. I make no
apologies for this, as cable sizing is
one of the biggest mistakes that
people make when installing a solar
electric system.

Low-voltage systems lose a
significant amount of power through
cabling. This is because currents
(amps) are higher to make up for the
lack of voltage. Ohms law tells us
that the power lost through the cable
is proportional to the square of the
current: the higher the current, the
greater the resistance. To overcome
this resistance, we must use thicker
cables.
Wherever you are using
low-voltage cabling (from the solar
array to the controller, and to all
low-voltage DC equipment) you
need to ensure you are using the
correct size of cable: if the cable

size is too small, you will get a
significant voltage drop that can
cause your system to fail.
You can work out the required
cable size using the following
calculation:
(Length x I x 0.04) ÷ (V ÷ 20) =
Cable Thickness
Length :                           
Cable length in metres (1m
= 3.3 feet)
I :                           
              Current in amps
V :                            
              System voltage

(e.g. 12 volts or 24 volts)
Cable Thickness:             
Cross-sectional area of the
cable in mm²
The cable thickness you are using
should be at least the same size as
the result of this calculation. Never
use smaller cable, as you will see a
greater voltage drop with a smaller
cable, which could cause some of
your devices not to work properly.
Protecting cable runs
When planning cable layouts, you
need to ensure they are protected
from unwanted attention from

animals and children and from
possible vandalism.
Rats and foxes chewing through
cable insulation can be a big
problem in some installations. This
can be resolved by using rodent
protected cabling. Using conduit is
often a good idea as well,
especially if you can use steel
conduit or thin-wall electrical
metallic tubing (EMT) to protect
cables.
Designing your system to keep
your cables runs as short as
possible

If you have multiple devices
running in different physical areas,
you can have multiple cable runs
running in parallel in order to keep
the cable runs as short as possible,
rather than extending the length of
one cable to run across multiple
areas.
By doing this, you achieve two
things: you are reducing the overall
length of each cable and you are
splitting the load between more than
one circuit. The benefit of doing
this is that you can reduce the
thickness of each cable required,
which can make installation easier.

If you are doing this in a house, you
can use a distribution panel
(otherwise known as a consumer
unit) for creating each circuit.
In the holiday home, for instance, it
would make sense to run the
upstairs lighting on a different
circuit to the downstairs lighting.
Likewise, it would make sense to
run separate circuits for powering
appliances upstairs and downstairs.
In the case of the holiday home, by
increasing the number of circuits it
becomes possible to use standard
2.5mm domestic ‘twin and earth’
cable for wiring the house, rather

than more specialist cables. Not
only does this simplify the
installation, it keeps costs down.
Selecting solar cable
A common fault with
poorly-designed or poorly-installed
solar energy systems is under-
performance where there is no clear
source for the problem. In
particular, this tends to occur
around two to three years after the
system was first installed.
The source of the problem is often
either bird droppings or UV damage
on cables leading from the solar
panels to the inverters. This is

usually caused by not using solar
interconnection cables, which have
a much tougher insulation that is UV
protected, designed to withstand
high temperatures and can withstand
acidic bird droppings.
It is vital that you use specific solar
interconnection cable to connect
your solar panels together and for
linking your solar panels to your
inverter or controller. If you are not
sure, look for cable that conforms to
the UL 4703 or UL 854 (USE-2)
specification for PV cabling. This
is available from all solar
equipment suppliers.

Controller cable
When calculating the thickness of
cable to go between the controller
and the battery, you need to take the
current flow into the battery from
the solar array as well as the flow
out of it (peak flow into the battery
is normally much higher than flow
out).
Battery interconnection cables
You can buy battery interconnection
cables with the correct battery
terminal connectors from your
battery supplier. Because the flow
of current between batteries can be
very significant indeed, I tend to use

the thickest interconnection cables I
can buy for connection between
batteries.

Some sample wiring
diagrams
As ever, a picture can be worth a
thousand words, so here are some
basic designs and diagrams to help
give you a clearer understanding of
how you connect a solar electric
system together.

Above: A simple
solar installation: a
light with light
switch, a small radio
and a simple
intruder alarm –

perfect for a garden
shed or a small lock-
up garage. Because
it is a small system,
you may choose not
to fit an isolation
switch. Because the
system is very small,
I have decided only
to fit a fuse between
the controller and
the battery

This is an interesting
project – a solar
powered river boat.
Electric boats are
gaining in
popularity, thanks to
their virtually silent
running and lack of
vibration. The only

downside is
recharging the
batteries. Here,
solar panels are
used to recharge the
batteries, charging
them up during the
week to provide all
the power required
for a weekend
messing about on the
river. The total cost
of this complete
system was less than
the cost of a
traditional outboard
engine and fuel tank

of a 12-volt solar

system running an
AC inverter to
provide a normal
building electricity
supply in an off-grid
installation. Below:

The holiday home wiring
diagram


The next step
Once you have your wiring
diagram, it is time to start adding
cables, battery terminal clamps,
fuses, isolation switches, earthing
rods (referred to as grounding rods
in North America) and, in this case,
a distribution panel (otherwise
known as a consumer unit) to your
shopping list. It can help to add
more detail to your wiring diagram
as well, noting the locations of
appliances and sockets, and the
lengths of cables at each point.

Solar frame mounting
There are off-the-shelf solar array
frames available, and your solar
panel supplier will be able to
advise you on your best solution.
Sometimes, however, these are not
suitable for your project. In this
case, you will either have to
fabricate something yourself (angle
iron is a useful material for this
job) or get a bespoke mounting
made specifically for you.
Solar panels in themselves are not
heavy, but you do need to take into
account the effect of wind loadings
on your mounting structure. If the

wind can blow underneath the solar
array it will generate a ‘lift’,
attempting to pull the array up off
the framework. However, a gap
beneath the solar array is useful to
ensure the array itself does not get
too hot. This is especially important
in warm climates, where the
efficiency of the solar panels
themselves drops as they get hotter.
Making sure the mounting is strong
enough is especially important as
the solar array itself is normally
mounted at an optimal angle to
capture the noonday sun. This often
means that, even if you are
installing your solar array onto an

existing roof, you may want to
install the solar panels at a slightly
different angle to the roof itself in
order to get the best performance
out of your system.
It is therefore imperative that your
solar array mounting frame is strong
enough to survive 20 years plus in a
harsh environment and can be
securely mounted.
If you are mounting your solar array
on a roof, you must be certain that
your roof is strong enough to take
this. If you are not certain about
this, ask a builder, structural
surveyor or architect to assess your

roof.
If you are planning to mount your
solar array on a pole or on a
ground-mounted frame, you will
need to make plans for some good
strong foundations. Hammering
some tent pegs into the ground to
hold a ground-mounted frame will
not last five minutes in a strong
wind, and a pole will quickly blow
down if you only use a bucket of
cement to hold it in place.
You should build a good foundation
consisting of a strong concrete base
on a compacted hardcore sub-base
to hold a ground-mounted frame,

and the frame itself should be
anchored using suitable ground
anchors, bolted using 25cm–30cm
(10"–12") bolts.
For a pole, follow the advice given
by the manufacturers. Typically,
they need to be set in a concrete
foundation that is at least 3 feet
(1m) deep, and quite often
significantly more.
To mount your solar panels onto
your frame, make sure you use high-
tensile bolts and self-locking nuts to
prevent loosening due to wind
vibration.
If your solar array is going to be

easily accessible, you may wish to
consider an adjustable solar
mounting system so you can adjust
the angle of tilt throughout the year.
You can then increase the tilt during
the winter in order to capture more
winter sun, and decrease the tilt
during the spring and summer in
order to improve performance
during those seasons.
For the holiday home project, the
solar array is to be fitted to a
specially constructed garden store
with an angled roof. The benefit of
this approach is that we can build
the store at the optimum position to
capture the sun. We can also install

the batteries and solar controller
very close to the solar array. In
other words, we are creating an ‘all
in one’ power station.
There are a number of regional shed
and garden building manufacturers
who will build a garden store like
this to your specification. A good
quality store, so long as it is treated
every 2–3 years, will easily last
25–30 years.
If you go this route, make sure your
chosen manufacturer knows what
you are planning to use it for. You
need to specify the following
things:

·       The angle of the roof has to
be accurate in order to have
the solar panels in their
optimum position
·       The roof itself has to be
reinforced to be able to take
the additional weight of the
solar array
·       The floor of the garden
store (where the batteries are
stored) must be made of
wood. Batteries do not work
well on a concrete base in
winter
·       There must be ventilation

built into the store in order to
allow the hydrogen gas
generated by the batteries to
disperse safely through the
top of the roof
·       The door to the garden store
itself should be large enough
for you to easily install, check
and maintain the batteries
·       You should consider
insulating the floor, walls and
ceiling in the garden store,
either using polystyrene
(Styrofoam) sheets or loft
insulation. This will help
keep the batteries from getting

too cold in winter or too hot
in summer
A garden store will still require a
solid concrete foundation.
Consideration of rainwater runoff is
also important, to ensure the garden
store does not end up standing in a
pool of water.

Positioning batteries
You will have already identified a
suitable location for your batteries.
As discussed on the chapter on site
surveys, your location needs to fit
the following criteria:
·       Water- and weather-proof
·       Not affected by direct
sunlight
·       Insulated to protect against
extremes of temperature
·       Facilities to ventilate gases
·       Protected from sources of
ignition

·       Away from children and
pets
Lead acid batteries give off very
small quantities of explosive
hydrogen gas when charging. You
must ensure that, wherever your
batteries are stored, the area
receives adequate external
ventilation so that these gases
cannot build up.
Because of the extremely high
potential currents involved with
lead acid batteries, the batteries
must be in a secure area away from
children and pets.
Do not install batteries directly onto

a concrete floor. In extremely cold
weather, concrete can cause an
additional temperature drop inside
the batteries that will adversely
affect performance.
You need to ensure that your
batteries are accessible for regular
checks and maintenance. Many
deep-cycle batteries require
watering several times each year
and connections must be checked
regularly to ensure they have not
corroded.
For all of the above reasons,
batteries are often mounted on
heavy-duty racking, which is then

made secure using an open-mesh
cage.
If you are installing your batteries
in an area that can get very cold or
very hot, you should also insulate
your batteries. Extreme
temperatures adversely affect the
performance of batteries, so if your
batteries are likely to be in an area
where the temperature drops below
8°C (46°F) or rise above 40°C
(104°F), you should consider
providing insulation. If the
temperature is likely to drop below
freezing, you must provide it.
You can use polystyrene

(Styrofoam) sheets underneath and
around the sides of the batteries to
keep them insulated. Alternatively,
foil-backed bubble-wrap insulation
(available from any DIY store in
the insulation section) is even
easier to use and has the benefit that
it does not disintegrate if you ever
get battery acid splashed on it.
Never insulate the top of the
batteries, as this will stop them
from venting properly and may
cause shorts in the batteries if the
insulating material you use is
conductive.

Planning the installation
By now, you should have a
complete shopping list for all the
components you need. You should
know where everything is to be
positioned and what you need to in
order to proceed.
Before placing any equipment
orders, go back to your site and
check everything one last time.
Make sure that where you planned
to site your array, controller,
batteries and so on is still suitable
and that you have not overlooked
anything.
Once you are entirely satisfied that

everything is right, place your
orders for your equipment.
Bear in mind that some specialist
equipment is often only built to
order and may not be available
straight away. If you require
bespoke items such as solar
mounting frames, or, as in the case
of the holiday home, a complete
garden store made up for mounting
the solar panels and holding the
batteries and controller, take into
account that this could take a few
weeks to be built for you.

In conclusion
·       The detailed design ensures
you have not overlooked any
area of the design
·       Consider the safety aspects
of your system in your design.
At each stage, ask yourself
“What is the worst that can
happen?” and then design
around the problems
·       The wiring diagram helps
you envisage how the
installation will work
·       You need to keep cable runs
as short as practically

possible. You can do this by
running several cables in
parallel, either directly from
the controller, through a
junction box or through a
distribution panel
·       Splitting the cables into
parallel circuits also means
you reduce the current load
on each circuit, thereby
reducing resistance and
improving the efficiency of
your system
·       If you are using an inverter
to run at grid-level voltages,
a qualified electrician is

required to handle the
electrical installation.
However, your wiring
diagram will help your
electrician to envisage how
your solar electric system
should work
·       You need to design your
battery storage area to ensure
your batteries can perform to
the best of their ability

Installation
Congratulations on getting this far.
If you are doing this for real, you
will now have a garage or garden
shed full of solar panels, batteries,
cables, controllers, isolation
switches, RCDs and whatnots. The
planning stage is over and the fun is
about to begin.
Before you get your screwdriver
and drill out, there are just a few
housekeeping items to get out of the
way first…

Have you read the
instructions?
No, of course you haven’t. Who
reads instructions anyway? Well,
on this occasion, it is worth reading
through the instructions that come
with your new toys so that you
know what you are playing with.
Pay particular attention to the solar
controller and the inverter: there
are many settings on most
controllers and you need to make
sure you get them right.

Safety
There are a few safety notices we
ought to go through. Some of these
may not be relevant to you, but read
them all first, just to make sure.
Remember, you are working with
electricity, dangerous chemicals
and heavy but fragile objects. It is
better to be safe than sorry.
Your First Aid kit
You will need a good First Aid kit
on hand, including some items that
you will not normally have in a
regular First Aid kit. Most
specifically, you will need an eye-

wash and a wash kit or gel that can
be applied to skin in case of contact
with battery acid.
Chemical clean-up kit
You will be working with lead acid
batteries that contain chemicals that
are hazardous to health. You will
require the following:
·       A chemical clean-up kit
suitable for cleaning up
battery acids in the case of a
spill
·       A supply of strong
polythene bags
·       A good supply of rags/

disposable wipes to mop up
any battery spillages
Chemical clean-up kits and
chemical First Aid kits are
available from most battery
wholesalers and industrial tool
suppliers. They only cost a few
pounds. You probably will not need
them but, if nothing else, they buy
you peace of mind.
Considering the general public
If you are working in an area where
the general public has access, you
should use barriers or fencing, and
signage to cordon off the area.
Clear diversion signage should

explain an alternative route.
In this scenario, I would
recommend employing a
professional team of builders to
carry out the installation work on
your behalf. They will already
understand the implications of
working in a public area and the
relevant Health and Safety
regulations.
Even if you do not have to consider
the general public, you should still
consider the people around you.
Children love to get involved with
these sorts of projects and there
really can be some safety issues

involved. Keep children out of the
way, and let anyone in the vicinity
know that you are working with
high voltages and to keep away.
Working at height
You are very likely to be working
at height and quite possibly
crawling around on slanted
rooftops.
Make sure you are using suitable
climbing equipment (ladders,
crawler boards, safety harnesses,
scaffolding). You can hire anything
that you do not have at reasonable
prices.

If you have any concerns about
working at heights, or if you are
working beyond your area of
competence at any time, remember
there is no shame in hiring a
professional. A professional
builder can fit a solar array to a
roof in 2–3 hours. This is typically
less than half the time it takes an
amateur DIY enthusiast.
Handling
Batteries, large inverters and solar
arrays can be heavy. Solar panels
themselves may not be heavy in
their own right, but when several of
them are mounted on a frame and

then lifted they are heavy, bulky and
fragile.
Moving and installing much of this
equipment is a two-person job as a
minimum. More people can be
useful when lifting a solar array
into position.
Working with batteries
Lead acid batteries are extremely
heavy, in some cases weighing as
much as an adult. Use proper lifting
gear to move them, and look after
your back.
Heavier batteries quite often have
hoops in the top case. To lift a

battery, I tend to use a piece of rope
threaded through these hoops to
create a carrying handle. This
means I can carry a battery close to
the ground and reduce the need to
bend over to lift it.
Lead acid batteries contain acid.
Unless they are gel batteries, the
acid is in liquid form. It is
extremely corrosive and extremely
dangerous to health. Splashes of
liquid from the batteries can cause
severe chemical burns and must be
dealt with immediately.
When working with lead acid
batteries, stay safe:

·       ALWAYS wear protective
clothing, including overalls,
eye protection (either
protective glasses or a full-
face shield) and protective
gloves. I would also advise
you to wear steel toe-capped
shoes
·       Keep batteries upright at all
times
·       Do not drop a battery. If you
do, the likelihood is that the
battery has been damaged. In
the worst-case scenario, the
casing could be cracked or
broken

·       If you drop a battery, place
it immediately in a spill tray
(a heavy-duty deep
greenhouse watering tray can
be used if necessary) and
check for damage and leaks
·       If you have a damaged
battery, both the battery and
the spill tray must be
double-bagged in sealed
polythene bags and marked as
hazardous waste
·       If you have a spillage from
a battery, mop up the spillage
immediately using rags or
disposable wipes. Place

these rags in a polythene bag,
seal it and mark it as
hazardous waste
·       If any spillage from a
battery comes into contact
with clothing, remove
clothing immediately and
dispose of it in polythene
bags
·       If any spillage from a
battery comes into contact
with the eyes, wash
repeatedly with eye-wash and
seek urgent medical help
·       If any spillage from a
battery comes into contact

with the skin, wash off
immediately with water,
apply an anti-acid wash,
cream or gel to stop burning
and then seek urgent medical
help
·       If you end up with battery
acid in your mouth, wash your
mouth out with milk. DO
NOT swallow the milk. Spit
it out. Then seek urgent
medical help
·       Do not smoke near
batteries, and ensure that the
area where you are storing
the batteries is ventilated

·       Prevent arcing or short
circuits on battery terminals.
Batteries can provide a huge
current very quickly. Should
you short-circuit a battery
with a spanner, the spanner is
likely to be red hot within a
few seconds and could easily
lead to fire or explosion.
Remove any rings, bracelets
or watches you may be
wearing and keep tools a safe
distance away from batteries
Gloves
You need two different sets of
gloves for installing your solar

array: a set of chemical gloves for
moving batteries and a set of
electrical protection gloves for
wiring up your solar system.
When choosing suitable
chemical gloves for working with
batteries, consider the following:
·       The gloves need to be quite
strong, as lifting and moving
batteries is hard on gloves
·       A good grip is important
·       Buy a glove with a medium
or long cuff length, in order to
protect both the hands and
forearms

·       The gloves should be made
of a suitable material to
protect against battery acid
The Health and Safety Executive
website suggest that 0.4mm-thick
neoprene gloves will give suitable
protection through a full shift. If you
do splash your gloves while
working with batteries, make sure
you wash them or replace them
immediately, in order to avoid
transferring acid to other parts of
your body.
Electrically-insulated protection
gloves give protection when
working with high voltages. These

are vitally important when working
with high-voltage solar arrays and
are recommended for all
installations.
Electrically-insulated gloves come
with different ratings to provide
protection at different voltages:
·       Class 00 gloves provide
protection for up to 500 volts
·       Class 0 gloves provide
protection for up to 1,000
volts
·       Class 1 gloves provide
protection for up to 7,500
volts

·       Class 2 gloves provide
protection for up to 17,000
volts
·       Class 3 gloves provide
protection for up to 26,500
volts
For most solar installations, Class
00 or Class 0 gloves are the most
appropriate. Remember that the
open circuit voltage of a solar array
can be more than double the
nominal voltage of the solar array:
twenty solar panels connected in
series may only have a nominal
voltage of 240 volts, but the open
circuit voltage could be over 500

volts.
Like chemical gloves, choose
gloves with a medium or long cuff
length to protect both your hands
and forearms.
If your electrically-insulated gloves
are splashed with battery acid,
remove and replace the gloves
immediately.
All electrically-insulated gloves
should be visually inspected and
checked for tears and holes before
use. Class 1–3 gloves require full
electrical testing every six months.
Electrical safety

I make no apologies for repeating
my mantra about electrical safety.
Electrical safety is extremely
important when installing a solar
electric system.
Solar panels generate electricity
whenever they are exposed to
sunlight. The voltage of a solar
panel on an ‘open’ circuit is
significantly higher than the system
voltage. A 12-volt solar panel can
generate a 22–26 volt current when
not connected.
Connect several solar panels in
series and the voltage can get to
dangerous levels very quickly: a

24-volt solar array can generate
45–55 volts, which can provide a
nasty shock in the wrong
circumstances, whilst a 48-volt
solar array can easily generate
voltages of 90–110 volts when not
connected. These voltages can be
lethal to anyone with a heart
condition, or to children, the elderly
or pets.
Solar systems produce DC voltage.
Unlike AC voltage, if you are
electrocuted from a direct current,
you will not be able to let go.
Batteries can produce currents
measuring thousands of amps. A

short circuit will generate huge
amounts of heat very quickly and
could result in fire or explosion.
Remove any rings, bracelets or
watches you may be wearing and
keep tools away from batteries.
The output from an inverter is AC
grid-level voltage and can be lethal.
Treat it with the same respect as
you would any other grid-level
electricity supply.
In many countries, it is law that if
you are connecting an inverter into
a household electrical system, you
must use a qualified electrician to
certify your installation.

Assembling your toolkit
As well as your trusty set of DIY
tools, you will need an electrical
multi-meter or volt meter in order
to test your installation at different
stages. You should use
electrically-insulated screwdrivers
whilst wiring up the solar array,
and a test light circuit tester can be
useful.
There are a few sundries that you
ought to have as well:
·       Cable ties are very useful
for holding cables in place.
They can keep cable runs tidy
and are often good for

temporary as well as
permanent use
·       A water- and dirt-repellent
glass polish or wax, for
cleaning solar panels
·       Petroleum jelly is used on
electrical connections on
solar panels and batteries in
order to seal them from
moisture and to ensure a good
connection

Preparing your site
As mentioned in the previous
chapter, you may need to consider
foundations for ground- or
pole-mounting a solar array, or
strengthening an existing roof
structure if you are installing your
solar array on a roof.
If you are installing your batteries
in an area where there is no suitable
earth (ground), you should install an
earthing rod (grounding rod) as
close to the batteries as is practical.

Testing your solar panels
Now the fun begins. Start by
unpacking your solar PV panels and
carry out a visual inspection to
make sure they are not damaged in
any way.
Chipped or cracked glass can
significantly reduce the
performance of the solar panels, so
they should be replaced if there is
any visible damage to the panel.
Damage to the frame is not such a
problem, so long as the damage
will not allow water ingress to the
panel and does not stop the solar
panel from being securely mounted

in position.
Next, check the voltage on the panel
using your multi-meter, set to an
appropriate DC voltage range.
Solar PV panels generate a much
higher voltage on an ‘open’ circuit
(i.e. when the panel is not
connected to anything) than they do
when connected to a ‘closed’
circuit. So do not be surprised if
your multi-meter records an open
voltage of 20–26 volts for a single
panel.

Installing the solar array
Cleaning the panels
It is a good idea to clean the glass
on the front of the panels first, using
a water- and dirt-repellent glass
polish or wax. These glass polishes
ensure that rain and dirt do not stick
to the glass, thereby reducing the
performance of your solar array.
They are available from any DIY
store and many supermarkets and
car accessories stores.
Assembly and connections
Some roof-mounted solar mounting
kits are designed to be fitted to your

roof before fitting the solar panels.
Others are designed to have the
solar panels mounted to the fixing
kits before being mounted to the
roof.
With a pole-mounted system, you
typically erect your pole first and
then fit the solar panels once the
pole is in position.
A ground-based mounting system is
the easiest to install, as there is no
heavy lifting.
Typically, you mount and wire the
solar panels at the same time. If you
are stepping up the voltage of your
system by wiring the panels in

series, wire up the required number
of panels in series first (i.e. sets of
two panels for 24 volts, sets of four
for 48 volts).
Once you have wired up a set of
panels in series, test them using
your multi-meter, set to a voltage
setting to check that you have the
expected voltage (20 volts plus for
a 12-volt system, 40 volts plus for a
24-volt system and 80 volts plus for
a 48-volt system).
Take care when taking these
measurements, as 40 volts and
above can give a nasty shock in the
wrong circumstances.

Once you have wired each series
correctly, make up the parallel
connections and then test the entire
array using your multi-meter, set to
the appropriate voltage setting.
If you have panels of different
capacities, treat the different sets of
panels as separate arrays. Do not
wire panels of different capacities
together, either in series or parallel.
Instead, connect the arrays together
at the controller.
Once you have completed testing,
make the array safe so that no one
can get an electric shock by
accident from the system. To do

this, connect the positive and
negative cables from the solar array
together to short-circuit the array.
This will not damage the array and
could prevent a nasty shock.
Roof-mounting a solar array
If you are roof-mounting a solar
array, you will normally have to fit
a rail or mounting to the roof before
attaching the solar array.
Once this is in place, it is time to fit
the array itself. Make sure you have
enough people on hand to be able to
lift the array onto the roof without
twisting or bending it. Personally, I
would always leave this job to

professional builders, but the best
way seems to be to have two
ladders and two people lifting the
array up between them, one on each
ladder, or using scaffolding.
Final wiring
Once your solar array is in position,
route the cable down to where the
solar controller is to be installed.
For safety purposes, ensure that the
cables to the solar array remain
shorted whilst you do this.
If you are installing a DC isolation
switch and a residual current
device (known as a ground fault
interrupter in North America),

install them between the solar array
and the controller.
Once you have the cables in
position, un-short the positive and
negative cables and check with a
meter to ensure you have the
expected voltage readings. Then
short the cables again until you are
ready to install the solar controller.

Installing the batteries
Pre-installation
Before installing the batteries, you
may need to give them a refresher
charge before using them for the
first time.
You can do this in one of two ways.
You can use a battery charger to
charge up the batteries, or you can
install the system and then leave the
solar panels to fully charge up the
batteries for a day or so before
commissioning the rest of the
system.
Put a sticker on each battery with an

installation date. This will be useful
in years to come for maintenance
and troubleshooting.
Positioning the batteries
The batteries need to be positioned
so they are upright, cannot fall over
and are away from members of the
public, children and any sources of
ignition.
For insulation and heating purposes,
batteries should not be stood
directly on a concrete floor: during
the winter months, a slab of
concrete can get extremely cold and
its cooling effects can have
detrimental effects on batteries. I

prefer to mount batteries on a
wooden floor or shelf.
Ventilation
If there is little or no ventilation in
the area where the batteries are
situated, this must be implemented
before the batteries are sited.
As batteries vent hydrogen, which
is lighter than air, the gas will rise
up. The ventilation should be
designed so that the hydrogen is
vented out of the battery area as it
rises.
Access
It is important that the battery area

is easily accessible, not just for
installing the batteries
(remembering that the batteries
themselves are heavy), but also for
routinely checking the batteries.
Insulation
As mentioned earlier, if you are
installing your batteries in an area
that can get very cold or very hot,
you should insulate your batteries.
Polystyrene (Styrofoam) sheets or
foil-backed bubble-wrap can be
used underneath and around the
sides of the batteries to keep them
insulated. DO NOT INSULATE
THE TOP OF THE BATTERIES as

this will stop them from venting
properly and may cause shorts in
the batteries if the insulating
material you use is conductive.
Connections
Once the batteries are in place,
wire up the interconnection leads
between the batteries to form a
complete battery bank.
Always use the correct terminals
for the batteries you are using and
make sure the cables provide a
good connection. You should use
battery interconnection cables
professionally manufactured for the

batteries you are using.
Use petroleum jelly around the
mountings to seal it from moisture
and ensure a good connection.
Next, add an earth (ground) to the
negative terminal. If there is no
earth already available, install an
earthing rod (grounding rod) as
close as possible to the batteries.
Now check the outputs at either end
of the batteries using a multi-meter
to ensure you are getting the correct
voltage. A fully-charged battery
should be showing a charge of
around 13–14 volts per battery.

Installing the control
equipment
The next step is to install the solar
controller and the power inverter if
you are using one.
Mount these close to the batteries.
Ideally they should be mounted
within a metre (3 feet), in order to
keep cable runs as short as
possible.
Most solar controllers include a
small LCD display and a number of
buttons to configure the controller.
Make sure the solar controller is
easily accessible and that you can

read the display.
Some solar controllers that work at
multiple voltages have a switch to
set the voltage you are working at.
Others are auto-sensing. Either
way, check your documentation to
make sure you install the solar
controller in accordance with the
manufacturer’s instructions. If you
have to set the voltage manually,
make sure you do this now, rather
than when you have wired up your
system.
Inverters can get very hot in use and
adequate ventilation should be
provided. They are normally

mounted vertically on a wall, in
order to provide natural ventilation.
The installation guide that comes
with your particular make of
inverter will tell you what is
required.
Some inverters require an earth
(ground) in addition to the earth on
the negative terminal on the battery.
If this is the case, connect a 2.5mm²
green-yellow earth cable from the
inverter to your earth rod (ground
rod).
If you are installing a DC isolation
switch between the solar panels and
your control equipment, connect that

up first and make sure it is switched
off.
Once you have mounted the
controller and inverter, connect the
negative cables to the battery,
taking care that you are connecting
the cables to the correct polarity.
Then un-short the positive and
negative cables from the solar array
and connect the negative cable from
the solar array to the solar
controller, again taking care to
ensure the cable is connected to the
correct polarity.
Now double-check the wiring.
Make sure you have connected the

cables to the right places.
Double-check that you have
connected your negative cable from
your solar array to the negative
solar input connection on your solar
controller. Then double-check that
you have connected your negative
cable from your battery to the
negative battery input on your solar
controller and your inverter. Only
then should you start wiring up your
positive connections.
Start with the battery connection. If
you are planning to install a fuse
and DC isolation switch into this
cable, make sure that your fuse and
switch work for both the solar

controller and the inverter (if you
are using one). Connect the inverter
and the solar controller ends first
and double-check that you have got
your wiring correct, both visually
and by checking voltages with a
volt meter, before you connect up
the battery bank.
Finally, connect up the positive
connection from your solar array to
the solar controller. At this point,
your solar controller should power
up and you should start reading
charging information from the
screen.
Congratulations. You have a

working solar power station!

Installing a grid-tie
system
Before starting to install your
grid-tie system, you must have
already made arrangements with
your electricity provider for them to
set you up as a renewable energy
generator.
Regulations and agreements vary
from region to region and from
electricity provider to electricity
provider, but at the very least they
will need to install an export meter
to your building in order to
accurately meter how much energy
you are providing. They will also

ask for an inspection certificate
from a qualified electrician, to
confirm that the work has been done
to an acceptable standard.
Physically, installing a grid-tie
system is very similar to installing
any other solar energy system,
except, of course, you do not have
any batteries to work with.
However, you do have to be careful
while wiring up the high-voltage
solar array. When the solar array is
being connected up you can have a
voltage build-up of several hundred
volts, which can quite easily prove
fatal. If building a high-voltage

array, cover the solar panels while
you are working on them and wear
electrically-insulated gloves at all
times.

Commissioning the
system
Once you have stopped dancing
around the garden in excitement, it
is time to test what you have done
so far and configure your solar
controller.
Programming your solar
controller
The type of solar controller you
have will determine exactly what
you need to configure. It may be that
you do not need to configure
anything at all, but either way you
should check the documentation that

came with the solar controller to
see what you need to do.
Typically, you will need to tell your
solar controller what type of
batteries you are using. You may
also need to tell your solar
controller the maximum and
minimum voltage levels to show
when the batteries are fully charged
or fully discharged. You should
have this information from your
battery supplier, or you can
normally download full battery
specification sheets from the
internet.
Testing your system

You can test your solar controller
by checking the positive and
negative terminals on the output
connectors on the controller using
your multi-meter. Switch the multi-
meter to DC voltage and ensure you
are getting the correct voltage out of
the solar controller.
If you have an inverter, plug a
simple device such as a table lamp
into the AC socket and check that it
works.
If your inverter does not work,
switch it off and check your
connections to the battery. If they
are all in order, check again with a

different device.

Charging up your
batteries
If you have not carried out a
refresher charge on your batteries
before installing them, switch off
your inverter and leave your system
for at least 24 hours in order to give
the batteries a good charge.

Connecting your devices
Once you have your solar power
station up and running and your
batteries are fully charged, it is time
to connect your devices.
If you are wiring a house using
low-voltage equipment, it is worth
following the same guidelines as
you would for installing
grid-voltage circuits.
For low-voltage applications, you
do not need to have your
installation tested by a qualified
electrician, but many people choose
to do so in order to make sure there
are no mishaps.

The biggest difference between AC
wiring and DC wiring is that you do
not need to have a separate earth
(ground) with DC electrics, as the
negative connection is earthed both
at the battery and, if you are using
one, at the distribution panel.
If you are using 12-volt or 24-volt
low-voltage circuits, you can use
the same distribution panels,
switches and light fittings as you
would in a grid-powered home. As
already suggested, do not use the
same power sockets for
low-voltage appliances as you use
for grid-powered appliances. If you

do, you run the risk that low-voltage
appliances could be plugged
directly into a high-voltage socket,
with disastrous consequences.

In conclusion
·       Once you have done all
your preparation, the
installation should be
straightforward
·       Heed the safety warnings
and make sure you are
prepared with the correct
safety clothing and access to
chemical clean-up and
suitable First Aid in case of
acid spills
·       Solar arrays are both fragile
and expensive. Look after
them

·       The most likely thing that
can go wrong is wiring up
something wrongly.
Double-check each
connection
·       Check each stage by
measuring the voltage with a
multi-meter to make sure you
are getting the voltage you
expect. If you are not, inspect
the wiring and check each
connection in turn

Troubleshooting
Once your solar electric system is
in place, it should give you many
years of untroubled service. If it
does not, you will need to
troubleshoot the system to find out
what is going wrong and why.

Keep safe
All the safety warnings that go with
installation also relate to
troubleshooting. Remember that
solar arrays will generate
electricity almost all the time
(except in complete darkness), and
batteries do not have an ‘off’
switch.

Common faults
Unless you keep an eye on your
solar energy system, problems can
often go undetected for months.
Only if you have a stand-alone
system and the power switches off
will you find out that you have a
problem.
The faults are typically to be found
in one of the following areas:
·       Excessive power usage –
i.e. you are using more power
than you anticipated
·       Insufficient power
generation – i.e. you are not

generating as much power as
you expected
·       Damaged wiring/ poor
connections
·       Weak batteries
·       Obstructions (shading)
·       Faulty earth (ground)
·       Inverter faults
Obstructions are a big subject by
themselves, and I cover this in much
more detail in Appendix A. Other
faults are covered below.

Excessive power usage
This is the most common reason for
solar electric systems failing: the
original investigations
underestimated the amount of power
that was required.
Almost all solar controllers
provide basic information on an
LCD screen that allows you to see
how much power you have
generated compared to how much
energy you are using, and shows the
amount of charge currently stored in
the battery bank. Some solar
controllers include more detailed
information that allows you to

check on a daily basis how your
power generation and power usage
compares.
Using this information, you can
check your power drain to see if it
is higher than you originally
expected.
If you have an inverter in your
system, you will also need to
measure this information from your
inverter. Some inverters have an
LCD display and can provide this
information, but if your system does
not provide this, you can use a plug-
in watt meter to measure your
power consumption over a period

of time.
If your solar controller or your
inverter does not provide this
information, you can buy a multi-
meter with data logging
capabilities. These will allow you
to measure the current drain from
the solar controller and/or your
inverter over a period of time (you
would typically want to measure
this over a period of a day).
Attach the multi-meter across the
leads from your batteries to your
solar controller and inverter. Log
the information for at least 24
hours. This will allow you identify

how much power is actually being
used.
Some data logging multi-meters
will plot a chart showing current
drain at different times of the day,
which can also help you identify
when the drain is highest.
Solutions
If you have identified that you are
using more power than you were
originally anticipating, you have
three choices:
·       Reduce your power load
·       Increase the size of your
solar array

·       Add another power source
(such as a fuel cell, wind
turbine or generator) to top up
your solar electric system
when necessary

Insufficient power
generation
If you have done your homework
correctly, you should not have a
problem with insufficient power
generation when the system is
relatively new.
However, over a period of a few
years, the solar panels and batteries
will degrade in their performance
(batteries more so than the solar
panels), whilst new obstructions
that cut out sunlight may now be
causing problems.
You may also be suffering with

excessive dirt on the solar panels
themselves, which can significantly
reduce the amount of energy the
solar array can generate. Pigeons
and cats are the worst culprits for
this!
Your site may have a new
obstruction that is blocking sunlight
at a certain time of day: a tree that
has grown substantially since you
carried out the original site survey,
for instance.
Alternatively, you may have made a
mistake with the original site survey
and not identified an obstruction.
Unfortunately, this is the most

common mistake made by
inexperienced solar installers. It is
also the most expensive problem to
fix. This is why carrying out the site
survey is so important.
To identify if your system is not
generating as much power as
originally expected, check the input
readings on your solar controller to
see how much power has been
generated by your solar panels on a
daily basis. If your solar controller
cannot provide this information, use
a multi-meter with data logger to
record the amount of energy
captured by the solar panels over a
three-to-five day period.

Solutions
If you have identified that you are
not generating as much power as
you should be, start by checking
your solar array. Check for damage
on the solar array and then give the
array a good wash with warm,
soapy water and polish using a
water- and dirt-repellent glass
polish or wax.
Check all the wiring. Make sure that
there is no unexplained high
resistance in any of the solar panels
or on any run of wiring. It could be
a faulty connection or a damaged

cable that is causing the problems.
Carry out another site survey and
ensure there are no obstructions
between the solar array and the sun.
Double-check that the array itself is
in the right position to capture the
sun at solar noon. Finally, check
that the array is at the optimum
angle to collect sunlight.
If you are experiencing these
problems only at a certain time of
the year, it is worth adjusting the
angle of the solar panel to provide
the maximum potential power
generation during this time, even if
this means compromising power

output at other times of year.
Check the voltage at the solar array
using a multi-meter. Then check
again at the solar controller. If there
is a significant voltage drop
between the two, the resistance in
your cable is too high and you are
losing significant efficiency as a
result. This could be due to an
inadequate cable installed in the
first place, or damage in the cable.
If possible, reduce the length of the
cable and test again. Alternatively,
replace the cable with a larger and
better quality cable.
If none of that works, you have

three choices:
·       Reduce your power load
·       Increase the size of your
solar array
·       Add another power source
(such as a fuel cell, wind
turbine or generator) to top up
your solar electric system
when necessary

Damaged wiring/ poor
connections
If you have damaged wiring or a
poor connection, this can have some
very strange effects on your system.
If you have odd symptoms that do
not seem to add up to anything in
particular, then wiring problems or
poor connections are your most
likely culprit.
Examples of some of the symptoms
of a loose connection or damaged
wiring are:
·       A sudden drop in solar
energy in very warm or very

cold weather. This is often
due to a loose connection or
damaged wiring in the solar
array or between the solar
array and the solar controller
·       Sudden or intermittent loss
of power when you are
running high loads. This
suggests a loose connection
between batteries, or between
the batteries and solar
controller or inverter
·       Sudden or intermittent loss
of power on particularly
warm days after the solar
array has been in the sun for a

period of time. This suggests
a loose connection
somewhere in the array, a
damaged panel or high
resistance in a cable
·       Significantly lower levels
of power generation from the
solar array suggest a loose
wire connection or a short
circuit between solar panels
within the array             
·       A significant voltage drop
on the cable between the
solar array and the solar
controller suggests either an
inadequate cable or damage

to the cable itself
·       Likewise, a significant
voltage drop on the cable
between the solar controller
and your low-voltage devices
suggests an inadequate cable
or damage to the cable itself
·       If you find a cable that is
very warm to the touch, it
suggests the internal
resistance in that cable is
high. The cable should be
replaced immediately
Unfortunately, diagnosing exactly
where the fault is can be
time-consuming. You will require a

multi-meter, a test light and plenty
of time.
Your first task is to identify which
part of the system is failing. A solar
controller that can tell you inputs
and outputs is useful here. The
information from this will tell you
whether your solar array is
underperforming or the devices are
just not getting the power they need.
Once you know which part of the
system to concentrate on, measure
the resistance of each cable using
the ohm setting on your multi-meter.
If the internal resistance is higher
than you would expect, replace it. If

any cable is excessively hot,
replace it. The problem could be
caused either by having an
inadequate cable in the first place
(i.e. too small) or by internal
damage to the cable.
Next, check all the connections in
the part of the system you are
looking at. Make sure the quality of
the connections is good. Make sure
that all cables are terminated with
proper terminators or soldered.
Make sure there is no water ingress.

Weak battery
The symptoms of a weak battery are
that either the system does not give
you as much power as you need, or
you get intermittent power failures
when you switch on a device.
In extreme cases, a faulty battery
can actually reverse its polarity and
pull down the efficiency of the
entire bank.
Weak battery problems first show
themselves in cold weather and
when the batteries are discharged to
below 50–60% capacity. In warm
weather, or when the batteries are
charged up, weak batteries can

quite often continue to give good
service for many months or years.
If your solar controller shows that
you are getting enough power in
from your solar array to cope with
your loads, then your most likely
suspect is a weak battery within
your battery bank, or a bad
connection between two batteries.
Start with the cheap and easy stuff.
Clean all your battery terminals,
check your battery interconnection
cables, make sure the cable
terminators are fitting tightly on the
batteries and coat each terminal
with a layer of petroleum jelly in

order to ensure good connectivity
and protection from water ingress.
Then check the water levels in your
batteries (if they are ‘wet’
batteries). Top up as necessary.
Check to make sure that each
battery in your battery bank is
showing a similar voltage. If there
is a disparity of more than 0.7 volts,
it suggests that you may need to
balance your batteries.
If, however, you are seeing a
disparity on one battery of 2 volts
or over, it is likely that you have a
failed cell within that battery. You
will probably find that this battery

is also abnormally hot. Replace that
battery immediately.
If your solar controller has the
facility to balance batteries, then
use this. If not, top up the charge on
the weaker batteries, using an
appropriate battery charger, until
all batteries are reading a similar
voltage.
If you are still experiencing
problems after carrying out these
tests, you will need to run a load
test on all your batteries in turn. To
do this, make sure all your batteries
are fully charged up, disconnect the
batteries from each other and use a

battery load tester (you can hire
these cheaply from tool hire
companies). This load tester will
identify any weak batteries within
your bank.
Changing batteries
If all your batteries are several
years old and you believe they are
getting to the end of their useful
lives, it is probably worth replacing
the whole battery bank in one go.
Badly worn batteries and new
batteries do not necessarily mix
well, because of the voltage
difference. If you mix new and
used, you can easily end up with a

bank where some of the batteries
never fully charge up.
If you have a bank of part-worn
batteries and one battery has failed
prematurely, it may be worth
finding a second-hand battery of the
same make and model as yours.
Many battery suppliers can supply
you with second-hand batteries: not
only are they much cheaper than
new, but because the second-hand
battery will also be worn, it will
have similar charging and
discharging characteristics to your
existing bank, which can help it bed
down into your system.

If you cannot find a part-worn
battery, you can use a new one, but
make sure you use the same make
and model as the other batteries in
your bank. Never mix and match
different models of batteries, as
they all have slightly different
characteristics.
If you add a new battery to a part-
worn bank, you may find the life of
the new battery is less than you
would expect if you replaced all
them. Over a few months of use, the
performance of the new battery is
likely to degrade to similar levels
to the other batteries in the bank.

Before changing your battery, make
sure that all of your batteries (both
new and old) are fully charged.
Put a label on the new battery,
noting the date it was changed. This
will come in useful in future years
when testing and replacing
batteries.
Once you have replaced your
battery, take your old one to your
local scrap merchants. Lead acid
batteries have a good scrap value
and they can be 100% recycled to
make new batteries.

Inverter issues
The symptoms of inverter issues
can include:
·       Buzzing or humming sounds
from some electronic
equipment when powered
from the inverter
·       Failure of some equipment
to run from the inverter
·       Regular tripping of circuits
·       Sudden loss of power
If you are experiencing buzzing or
humming sounds from electronic
equipment when powered from the

inverter, or if some equipment is
not running at all, it suggests that the
inverter is not producing a pure AC
sine wave. If you have a grid-tie
system, the AC pure sine waveform
generated by the inverter may not be
perfectly coordinated with the
waveform from the grid. This
would suggest poor quality power
from the grid, a grounding issue or a
faulty inverter.
If you have a stand-alone system
and have purchased a modified sine
wave inverter (or quasi-sine wave),
it may be that you cannot resolve
these issues without replacing the
inverter. Some electronic

equipment, such as laptop
computers and portable televisions,
may not work at all using a
modified sine wave inverter, whilst
other equipment will emit a buzz
when run from these inverters.
If you have sudden and unexplained
tripping of circuits when running
from an inverter, or experience
sudden loss of power, there are a
number of things to check:
·       Does the tripping occur
when a heavy-load appliance
such as a fridge switches
itself on or off?
·       Does the tripping occur

when the inverter cuts in at
the start of the day or when it
cuts out at the end of the day?
·       Does the tripping occur
more often on very warm
days or after heavy rain?
Unfortunately, circuit tripping and
sudden power loss often only
occurs when a combination of
events occur, which can make
diagnosis time-consuming and
difficult to get right.
The most common reasons for
circuit tripping or sudden power
loss are temperature-related issues.
Inverters can generate a huge

amount of heat. The hotter they get,
the less power they produce. If the
inverter is running too hot, a sudden
peak demand can be enough to shut
the inverter down momentarily. If
the inverter runs too hot for too
long, it will shut down for a longer
period of time in order to cool.
If this is the case, you are going to
have to provide your inverter with
more ventilation. If you cannot keep
it cool, it may also mean that you
require a more powerful inverter in
order to cope with the load.
If the issue occurs during sudden
rain or on very hot days, you may

also have a grounding problem.
Check the inverter with a PAT
tester to ensure that you are not
getting a ground leakage from the
inverter itself. If you are, check all
the connections from the DC input
of your inverter.

Maintaining Your
System
There is very little maintenance to
be carried out on a solar electric
system. There are some basic
checks that should be carried out on
a regular basis. Typically these
should take no more than a few
minutes to carry out.
As required
·       Clean the solar array. This
actually takes very little
effort: unless you live in a

very dry and dusty part of the
world, the rain will usually
do a very good job of
washing your solar panels
clean on a regular basis
·       Telescopic window cleaner
kits are available to clean
solar arrays mounted on
lower sections of a roof. If
you can easily access the
panels, a dirt- and
rain-repellent glass polish
can help keep your solar
array cleaner for longer
·       If you have a thick layer of
snow on your solar array,

brush it off! A thick blanket of
snow very quickly stops your
solar array from producing
any energy at all
Every month
·       If your solar controller or
inverter includes a display
that shows power input and
power output, check the
performance of your solar
array. Check that it is in line
with your expectations for the
time of year. It is worth
keeping a log of the
performance so you can
compare it from one year to

the next
·       If there is an unexplained
drop in performance, clean
the solar array, visually check
the condition of the cables
and balance the batteries. If
the performance does not
improve, follow the
troubleshooting guide for
further assistance
Every three months
·       Check the ventilation in the
battery box
·       Check the battery area is
still weatherproof and there

are no leaks from the
batteries
·       Clean dirt and dust off the
top of batteries
·       Visually check all the
battery connectors. Make sure
they are tightly-fitting. Clean
and protect them with
petroleum jelly where
required
·       Check the electrolyte level
in batteries and top up with
distilled water where
required
Every six months

·       If you have a multi-battery
system and your solar
controller has the facilities to
do so, balance the battery
bank
·       Once the batteries are
balanced, use a volt meter or
multi-meter to check the
voltage on each individual
battery. Ensure the voltages
are within 0.7 volts of each
other
·       If one or more battery has a
big difference in voltage,
follow the instructions on
weak batteries in the

troubleshooting section of this
book
Every year
·       If you have a battery bank
with more than two batteries,
swap the order of the
batteries in your bank. Place
the batteries that were in the
middle of your bank at either
end and the batteries that
were at either end of your
bank in the middle. Then
balance them
·       This will ensure that all the
batteries get even wear

throughout their lifetime and
thereby increase the overall
lifespan of the batteries
At the start of each winter
·       Check the insulation around
the batteries
·       Check that the area around
the batteries is free of
rodents. Mice and rats like to
keep warm, and insulation
around batteries is a tempting
target. If they have found your
batteries, they are likely to
gnaw the cabling as well
·       Clean the solar array to

ensure you get the best
possible performance at the
worst time of the year

A Final Word
Solar electric power is an excellent
and practical resource. It can be
harnessed relatively easily and
effectively.
It is not without its drawbacks and
it is not suitable for every
application. To get the best out of a
solar electric system, it is important
to do your planning first and to be
meticulous with detail. Only then
will you have a system that will
perform properly.
From an enthusiast’s perspective,

designing and building a solar
electric system from scratch is
interesting, educational and fun. If
you are tempted to have a go, start
with something small like a shed
light, and feel free to experiment
with different ideas.
If you are a professional architect
or builder, you should now have a
clear idea of how solar energy can
be used in your projects: its
benefits and its drawbacks.
It is quite amazing, the first time you
connect a solar panel up to an
electrical item such as a light bulb
and watch it power up straight

away. Even though you know it is
going to work, there is something
almost magical about watching a
system that generates electricity
seemingly from thin air!
Teaching children about solar
electricity is also fun. There are
small solar powered kits suitable
for children. These can be
assembled by little fingers and they
teach the fundamentals of electricity
and solar power in a fun and
interesting way.
If this book has inspired you to
install a solar electric system
yourself, then it has served its

purpose. I wish you the very best
for your project.
All the best

Appendix A –
Crystalline Solar
Panels and Shading
As mentioned a few times in this
book, shading is a big issue with
crystalline photovoltaic panels. A
small amount of shading has a big
impact on the amount of electrical
power generated by your solar
system.
Unlike solar thermal (hot water)
systems, the loss of power through
shading is much greater than the
amount of the panel that is in shade.

With solar thermal systems, if only
5% of the panel is in shade, you
lose less than 5% of the power
production. With amorphous
(thin-film) PV panels, you would
usually lose 15–20% of the power
production in a similar scenario.
With crystalline solar panels, the
difference is significantly more and
in some instances can bring power
generation down to zero, even if the
amount of the panel in shade is
small.
The reason for this is in the
construction of the solar panel
itself. A crystalline solar panel is

made up of a number of individual
solar cells. Typically, each of these
cells generates ½ volt of potential
energy. These cells are connected
together in series to increase the
voltage to a more useful level
inside the solar panel. Each
individual solar panel has one or
more strings of solar cells.
Because these strings of cells are
connected in series, a solar panel is
only as good as its weakest cell. If
one cell produces a weak output, all
the other cells within the string are
compromised as well. This means
that if you have a ‘soft shade’ such
as a distant tree branch, creating a

soft dappled shade across just one
or two cells on a solar panel, the
effect can be to reduce the output of
the whole string to a similar level
to a dull, overcast day.
Worse happens when you have a
more direct shadow, creating a
bigger contrast between light and
shade. When even one cell is in
complete shade and the remainder
are in bright sunlight, the shaded
cell short-circuits as the flow of
electrons within the cell goes into
reverse.
However, because the cell is
connected in series with the other

cells in the panel, current is forced
through the reversed cell. In this
scenario, the reversed cell absorbs
the power produced by the other
cells in the panel, generating heat
and creating a hotspot within the
solar panel.
The amount of power that is
absorbed by a single reversed cell
is disproportionate to the amount of
power a single cell can generate. A
single cell may only produce ½ volt
of potential energy, but can absorb
6–8 volts when it has gone into
reversal.
If unchecked, a solar cell left in this

state can easily be destroyed. The
hot spot generated by the blocked
cell can very quickly reach
dangerous temperature levels too,
and amateur home-built solar
panels have been known to burst
into flames precisely for this
reason.
Thankfully, solar panel
manufacturers have a solution to
this problem in order to avoid the
panel itself becoming damaged. All
professionally manufactured
crystalline solar panels have in-
built protection to route power
around a string of cells where one
or more of the cells are in reversal.

If your solar panel has only a single
string of solar cells within it, this
effectively means the entire solar
panel is bypassed and produces no
power at all. If your solar panel has
two strings of solar cells, it means
the power output of the panel is
halved.
Because a solar array is typically
put together by installing multiple
solar panels in series, the effects of
shading on just part of one panel
impacts the performance of the
entire solar array.

Types of obstruction
Shade can be broken down into two
categories: soft shade and hard
shade.
A soft shade is a distant obstruction
where the shadow is dispersed or
diffused, which significantly
reduces the amount of light reaching
the solar cells. A shadow from a
tree would be classed as a soft
shade.
Hard shade is an obstruction that
blocks out light from reaching the
solar cell completely. Bird
droppings, fallen leaves or a tree
branch sitting on top of the glass

would be classed as a hard shade.
Where cells are soft shaded, you
will see a significant drop off in
energy production. Effectively, the
production of the entire array will
drop down to a similar level to a
dull day.
Where cells are hard shaded, the
production of the entire array will
drop down to the same level as the
affected cells: if the cells are
covered completely, you may see a
complete power shutdown
(depending on how shade-tolerant
your solar panels are). If the cells
are only partially covered, you will

see a significant drop in energy
production.

Designing shade-tolerant
solar systems
If you cannot avoid shade in your
solar energy system, the solution is
to design a shade-tolerant system.
In other words, you have to design
your system in such a way that the
effect of shade on any one part of
your system has as small an effect
on the overall array as possible.
Designing shade-tolerant solar
arrays is a complex subject and a
specialist area even amongst solar
design experts. There are entire
books written on this subject alone.
Consequently, it is not possible to

cover the whole subject here.
However, it is possible to design a
basic solar energy system with a
reasonable level of shade tolerance
without a huge amount of specialist
knowledge.
If you need to design a system that
will continue to perform well in
partially shaded conditions, there
are options available to you:
Track the shade
First, you should never design a
system that will have to cope with
hard shading. Solar panels should
be mounted so that they are not
covered in leaves and so they can

be inspected and cleaned of any
hard obstructions if necessary. If
there is a permanent obstruction that
will be creating a hard shade, you
should not be installing solar panels
in that particular location.
If you have a soft shade, for how
much of the day does this shade
your panels? Remember, even a soft
shade over a small area can have a
big impact. Typical core power
generation times for solar energy
during the summer are three hours
either side of solar noon (i.e.
between 9am and 3pm, if your time
zone equates to solar time). If you

have shading either before this
period or after it, you will lose
around 20% of your capability in
the summer, or 40% of your
capability if you have shading in
both the early morning and late
afternoon.
During the winter, the difference
is not so great. Because the sun is
lower in the sky and the intensity of
the sunlight is significantly lower,
almost all of your power is
generated during the core power
generation times. If you have
shading before 9am or after 3pm
during the winter, you will
probably be losing only around

5–10% of your generating
capabilities.
However, if you are suffering
from shade within the core power
generation times, you are going to
severely compromise the
performance of your system. The
exact impact on the performance of
your system will vary according to
your location, the severity of
shading and the type of solar panels
you are using, but in general terms,
this is how much of your solar
energy production you can expect to
lose from one hour of shading
during core power generation

This table shows the

performance loss
from your system if it
is shaded for one
hour during core
production times

As you see, you can lose a
significant amount of energy
production due to shading during
the middle of the day. This is why
shading during the middle of the day
is the number one reason for solar
arrays failing to live up to
expectations.
However, because you can now
quantify the impact of the shading, it
is possible to do something to
counter the effects.
Increasing the number of solar
panels
The first option is the most obvious:

if you have the space, you can
increase the number of solar panels
you install in order to counter the
periods of shade.
This is not always possible, either
because of space or cost
restrictions. Also, it is not always
the most efficient way of getting
around the problem.
Panel orientation
If shade affects you at a particular
time of the day, consider angling
your solar panels away from the
obstruction. This will increase their
effectiveness during the
unobstructed parts of the day and

reduce or remove the impact of the
obstruction in the first place. The
reduction in power generation from
angling the panels away from due
south is often less than the impact
on shading if you can eliminate the
shade problem altogether.
Choice of solar panel
Another option is to choose
amorphous (thin-film) solar panels.
Amorphous solar panels do not
suffer from cell reversal in the same
way that crystalline solar panels do,
and consequently provide far better
shade tolerance.
Because of their lower efficiency

levels, you will need to take into
account that you will require around
twice as much physical space to
install amorphous solar panels. If
space is not an issue, using
amorphous solar panels is likely to
be the simplest and most cost-
effective solution for stand-alone
solar installations.
Sharp, Mitsubishi, Uni-Solar, Solar
Frontier and Sanyo now
manufacture high-quality amorphous
solar panels that offer excellent
performance and reliability.
Use micro-inverters

If you are building a grid-tie
system, possibly the best solution is
to use micro-inverters, where each
panel has its own power inverter
and is a full solar energy system in
its own right.
With a micro-inverter system, each
solar panel runs entirely
independently of every other solar
panel. If shade affects one panel,
none of the other panels is affected
in any way.
Using micro-inverters also means
that you can have solar panels
facing in different directions from
each other. For instance, if you are

installing solar panels on a roof and
your roof has multiple pitches and
angles, you can choose to install
your solar array on more than one
part of the roof using a micro-
inverter system.
This approach gives you greater
flexibility as to where you mount
solar panels: it may even be
possible to avoid your shading
issues altogether.
Design a parallel solar array
By connecting solar panels in
parallel rather than in series, you
can reduce the overall effect of
shading on just one or two parts of

the array. In a parallel system, when
one solar panel is in shade, the
power outputs of other panels in the
array are not affected.
If you are designing a grid-tie solar
energy system and want a
high-voltage system, it is possible
to achieve this with a parallel array
by using high-voltage grid-tie
specific solar panels. A number of
manufacturers now offer these
panels, often producing over 100
volts from a single panel. Other
panels are available that provide
either 24-volt or 48-volt output, and
these can be suitable for larger

stand-alone solar energy systems
that require more than 12 volts.
Design a multi-string solar
array
Instead of designing your system to
have just one set of solar panels
connected in series, you can design
your system to have multiple series
of solar panels. Controllers and
inverters are available that allow
you to have multiple strings of solar
panels, or you can have a controller
or inverter for each individual
string.
In effect, this means you end up

with two smaller solar power
systems, rather than one. This may
mean you can face your two
different sets of solar arrays at
different angles, giving you the
opportunity to mount them in
entirely different locations if you so
wish.
In this scenario, you can design
your system so that partial shading
will only affect one of your strings
rather than your entire array. As
with micro-inverters, such an
approach may even allow you to
avoid the shading issue altogether.

Other options
There are other options, but the
designs can become extremely
complicated and are really in the
domain of highly specialist solar
designers. If you are designing a
shade-tolerant solar energy system
and the above options will not work
for you, it is time to call in a solar
shading specialist.
Unless you have significant shading
issues, you can usually design
around the problems using one of
the options I have suggested here,
or by using a combination of
options to come up with a workable

solution. Over the past few years, I
have designed a number of
shade-tolerant systems, including
systems that are designed to work in
an entirely shaded environment all
year round. With careful planning, it
is often possible to overcome the
issues.

If all else fails...
Sometimes it is not possible to
design around shading problems. In
this scenario, it requires a rethink of
what you can achieve using solar.
This is an issue that I have with my
own home. My house is on the edge
of ancient woodland. For most of
the year, my home is almost entirely
shaded by the tall trees that
surround it. Even in the height of
summer, the sun does not reach my
garden until mid-afternoon.
This shading means I could never
run my own home completely from
solar power. However, I have

designed a smaller solar energy
system that provides me with
enough energy to run my lighting
and provide backup power in case
of a power cut.
I have achieved this by installing
amorphous solar panels onto the
back of my home, facing south-west
to catch the afternoon and evening
sun. Despite receiving very little
sunlight, this system provides
enough electricity to provide me
with my lighting and backup power
requirements throughout the year,
even in the depths of winter.

In conclusion
·       Shade is a big problem for
solar energy – especially if
using crystalline solar panels
·       Even a very small amount of
shade can have a big impact
on your system
·       Amorphous solar panels
also suffer in shade, but not to
the same extent as crystalline
panels
·       If you have shade during
core power generating
periods of the day – typically
the three hours either side of

solar noon – you will lose a
very significant amount of
your potential power
generation
·       There are things you can do
to reduce the impact of
shading, either through your
choice of materials or your
system design
·       In some cases where you
have very significant shading
issues, you may need to
reconsider what you can
realistically achieve with
solar

Appendix B – Solar
Insolation
Solar insolation shows the daily
amount of energy from the sun you
can expect per square metre at your
location, averaged out over the
period of a month. The figures are
presented as an average irradiance,
measured in kilowatt-hours per
square metre spread over the period
of a day (kWh/m²/day).
Averages have been collated over a
22-year period between 1983 and
2005, based on a three-hour sample

rate.
The book only shows solar
insolation figures for the United
States, Canada, Australia, New
Zealand, UK and Ireland. Whilst I
have tried to show this information
as clearly as possible, the
information is in tabular form which
does not display well on some
smaller eBook readers. More
detailed information can be
accessed at
www.SolarElectricityHandbook.com
with figures for every major town
and city in every country in the
world, thereby allowing you to
access information that is specific

to your area.

Understanding this
information
The amount of energy you capture
from the sun differs, depending on
the tilt of the solar panels. If you
mount your solar panels
horizontally or vertically, you will
capture less energy than if you face
them due south (due north in the
Southern Hemisphere) and tilt them
towards the sun.
The tables on the following pages
show the irradiance figures based
on mounting your solar panels at the
following angles:

·       Flat (horizontal)
·       Upright
·       Tilted towards the equator
for best year-round
performance
·       Tilted for best performance
during the winter months
·       Tilted for best performance
during the summer months
·       Tilted with the angle
adjusted each month
throughout the year
Where the figures show the panels
tilted at a fixed angle, I show this

angle in the left hand column as the
angle adjustment from an upright
(vertical) position. On the bottom
row, where the optimum tilt
changes each month, I show this
angle underneath each month’s
irradiance figures. Please note: all
angles are in degrees from
vertical.
For a more detailed explanation of
these figures, refer to the chapter on
Calculating Solar Energy.

Appendix C – Typical
Power Requirements
When creating your power analysis,
you need to establish the power
requirements for your system. The
best way is to measure the actual
power consumption using a watt
meter.
Finding a ballpark figure for similar
devices is the least accurate way of
finding out your true power
requirements. However, for an
initial project analysis it can be a
useful way of getting some

information quickly:

Appendix D – Living
Off-Grid
Living off-grid is an aspiration for
many people. You may want to
‘grow your own’ electricity and not
be reliant on electricity companies.
You may live in the middle of
nowhere and be unable to get an
outside electricity supply. Whatever
your motive, there are many
attractions for using solar power to
create complete self-sufficiency.
Do not confuse living off-grid with
a grid-tie installation and achieving

a balance where energy exported to
the grid minus energy imported
from the grid equals a zero overall
import of electricity. A genuinely
off-grid system means you use the
electricity you generate every time
you switch on a light bulb or turn on
the TV. If you do not have enough
electricity, nothing happens.
Before you start, be under no
illusions. This is going to be an
expensive project and for most
people it will involve making some
significant compromises on power
usage in order to make living off-
grid a reality.

In this book, I have been using the
example of a holiday home. The
difference between a holiday home
and a main home is significant: if
you are planning to live off-grid all
the time, you may not be so willing
to give up some of the creature
comforts that this entails.
Compromises that you may be
prepared to accept for a few days
or weeks may not be so desirable
for a home you are living in for
fifty-two weeks a year.
Remember that a solar electric
system is a long-term investment,
but will require long-term

compromises as well. You will not
have limitless electricity available
when you have a solar electric
system, and this can mean limiting
your choices later on. If you have
children at home, consider their
needs as well: they will increase as
they become teenagers and they may
not be so happy about making the
same compromises that you are.
You need to be able to provide
enough power to live through the
winter as well as the summer. You
will probably use more electricity
during the winter than the summer:
more lighting and more time spent
inside the house mean higher power

requirements.
Most off-grid installations involve
a variety of power sources: a solar
electric system, a wind turbine and
possibly a hydro-generation system
if you have a fast-flowing stream
with a steep enough drop. Of these
technologies, only hydro on a
suitable stream has the ability to
generate electricity 24 hours a day,
seven days a week.
In addition to using solar, wind and
hydro for electrical generation, a
solar water system will help heat
up water and a ground source heat
pump may be used to help heat the

home.
When installing these systems in a
home, it is important to have a
failover system in place. A failover
is simply a power backup so that if
the power generation is insufficient
to cope with your needs, a backup
system cuts in.
Diesel generators are often used for
this purpose. Some of the more
expensive solar controllers have the
facility to work with a diesel
generator, automatically starting up
the generator in order to charge up
your batteries if the battery bank
runs too low on power. Advanced

solar controllers with this facility
can link this in with a timer to make
sure the generator does not start
running at night when the noise may
be inappropriate.

A solar electric system in
conjunction with grid
electricity
Traditionally, it has rarely made
economic sense to install a solar
electric system for this purpose.
This has changed over the past three
years, with the availability of
financial assistance in many parts of
the world.
If you are considering installing
a system purely on environmental
grounds, make sure that what you
are installing actually does make a
difference to the environment. If you

are planning to sell back electricity
to the utility grids during the day,
then unless peak demand for
electricity in your area coincides
with the times your solar system is
generating electricity, you are
actually unlikely to be making any
real difference whatsoever.
A solar energy system in the
southern states of America can
make a difference to the
environment, as peak demand for
electricity tends to be when the sun
is shining and everyone is running
air conditioning units. A grid-tie
solar energy system in the United
Kingdom is unlikely to make a real

difference to the environment unless
you are using the electricity
yourself or you live in an industrial
area where there is high demand for
electricity during the day.
If you are in the United Kingdom
or Canada and are installing a solar
energy system for the primary
motive of reducing your carbon
impact, a grid fallback system is the
most environmentally friendly
solution. In this scenario, you do not
export energy back to the grid, but
store it and use it yourself. When
the batteries have run down, your
power supply switches back to the

grid. There is more information on
grid fallback in Appendix E.
There may be other factors that
make solar energy useful. For
example, ensuring an electrical
supply in an area with frequent
power cuts, using the solar system
in conjunction with an electric car,
or for environmental reasons where
the environmental benefits of the
system have been properly
assessed.
One of the benefits of building a
system to work in conjunction with
a conventional power supply is that
you can take it step by step,

implementing a smaller system and
growing it as and when finances
allow.
As outlined in Chapter Three, there
are three ways to build a solar
electric system in conjunction with
the grid: a grid-tie system, a grid
interactive system and grid
fallback.
You can choose to link your solar
array into the grid as a grid-tied
system if you wish, so that you
supply electricity to the grid when
your solar array is generating the
majority of its electricity and you
use the grid as your battery. It is

worth noting that if there is a power
cut in your area, your solar electric
system will be switched off as a
safety precaution, which means you
will not be able to use the power
from your solar electric system to
run your home, should there be a
power cut.
Alternatively, you can design a
stand-alone solar electric system to
run some of your circuits in your
house, either at grid-level AC
voltage or on a DC low-voltage
system. Lighting is a popular circuit
to choose, as it is a relatively low
demand circuit to start with.

As a third alternative, you can wire
your solar electric system to run
some or all of the circuits in your
house, but use an AC relay to
switch between your solar electric
system when power is available,
and electricity from the grid when
your battery levels drop too low. In
other words, you are using the grid
as a power backup, should your
solar electric system not provide
enough power. This setup is known
as a grid fallback system. A
diagram showing this configuration
is shown in the next Appendix
under the section on grid fallback.

Appendix E – Other
Solar Projects
Grid fallback system/
grid failover system
Grid fallback and grid failover are
both often overlooked as a
configuration for solar power. Both
these systems provide AC power to
a building alongside the normal
electricity supply and provide the
benefit of continued power
availability in the case of a power
cut.

For smaller systems, a solar
electric emergency power system
can be cost-competitive with
installing an emergency power
generator and uninterruptable
power supplies. A solar electric
emergency power system also has
the benefit of providing power all
of the time, thereby reducing
ongoing electricity bills as well as
providing power backup.
The difference between a grid
fallback system and a grid failover
system is in the configuration of the
system. A grid fallback system
provides solar power for as much

of the time as possible, only
switching back to the grid when the
batteries are flat. A grid failover
system cuts in when there is a
power cut.
Most backup power systems
provide limited power to help tide
premises over a short-term power
cut of 24 hours or less. Typically, a
backup power system would
provide lighting, enough electricity
to run a heating system and enough
electricity for a few essential
devices.
As with all other solar projects, you
must start with a project scope. An

example scope for a backup power
project in a small business could be
to provide electricity for lighting
and for four PCs and to run the gas
central heating for a maximum of
one day in the event of a power
failure.
If your premises have a number of
appliances that have a high-energy
use, such as open fridges and
freezer units, for example, it is
probably not cost-effective to use
solar power for a backup power
source.
Installing any backup power system
will require a certain amount of

rewiring. Typically, you will install
a secondary distribution panel (also
known as a consumer unit)
containing the essential circuits, and
connect this after your main
distribution panel. You then install
an AC relay or a transfer switch
between your main distribution
panel and the secondary distribution
panel, allowing you to switch
between your main power source
and your backup source:

In this above diagram, a second
consumer box has been wired into
the electrical system, with power
feeds from both the main consumer
box and an inverter connected to a
solar system.

Switching between the two power
feeds is an automatic transfer box.
If you are configuring this system to
be a grid fallback system, this
transfer box is configured to take
power from the solar system when
it is available, but then switches
back to grid-sourced electricity if
the batteries on the solar system
have run down.
This provides a backup for critical
power when the normal electricity
supply is not available, but also
uses the power from the solar
system to run your devices when
this is available.

If you are configuring this system to
be a grid failover system, the
transfer box is configured to take
power from the normal electricity
supply when it is available, but then
switches to power from the solar
system if it is not.
One issue with this system is that
when the transfer box switches
between one power source and the
other, there may be a very short loss
of power of around 1/20 of a
second. This will cause lights to
flicker momentarily, and in some
cases may reset electronic
equipment such as computers, TVs

and DVD players.
Many modern transfer boxes
transfer power so quickly that this
is not a problem. However, if you
do experience this problem it can
be resolved by installing a small
uninterruptable power supply
(UPS) on any equipment affected in
this way.
You can buy fully built-up
automatic transfer boxes, or you can
build your own relatively easily
and cheaply using a high-voltage
AC Double-Pole/ Double-Throw
(DPDT) Power Relay, wired so
that when the inverter is providing

power, the relay takes power from
the solar system, and when the
inverter switches off, the relay
switches the power supply back to
the normal electricity supply.

Portable solar power unit
A popular and simple project, a
briefcase-sized portable power unit
allows you to take electricity with
you wherever you go. They are
popular with people who go
camping, or with repair people who
need to take small power tools to
locations where they cannot always
get access to electrical power.
In essence, a portable power unit
comprises four components: a small
solar panel, a solar controller, a
sealed lead acid gel battery and an
inverter, all built into a briefcase.
Many people who build them add

extra bits as well. A couple of light
bulbs are a popular addition, as is a
cigarette lighter adapter to run
12-volt car accessories.
For safety purposes, it is important
to use a sealed lead acid gel battery
for this application, so that you can
place the unit on its side, if
necessary, without it leaking.
For occasional use, a portable solar
power unit can be a good
alternative to a petrol generator:
they are silent in operation and
extremely easy to use. Their
disadvantage is that, once the
battery is flat, you cannot use it until

it is fully charged up again and on
solar power alone this can take
several days.
For this reason, solar powered
generators often include an external
charger so they can be charged up
quickly when necessary.

Solar boat
Boating on inland waterways has
been undergoing a revival in recent
years, especially with small craft
powered with outboard motors.
Electric outboard motors are also
becoming extremely popular: they
are lighter, more compact, easier to
use and cheaper to buy than the
equivalent petrol outboard motor.
Best of all, their silent running and
lack of vibration make them ideally
suited to exploring inland
waterways without disturbing the
wildlife.
For a small open boat, a 100-watt

electric motor will power the boat
effectively. Depending on what they
are made from, small, lightweight
boats can be exceptionally light – a
5m (15 foot) boat may weigh as
little as 20kg (44 pounds), whilst a
simple ‘cabin cruiser’ constructed
from alloy may weigh as little as
80kg (175 pounds). Consequently,
they do not require a lot of power to
provide ample performance.
An 80 amp-hour leisure battery will
provide around eight hours of
constant motor use before running
flat. This is more than enough for
most leisure activity. Because most
boats are typically only used at

weekends during the summer, a
solar panel can be a good
alternative to lugging around a
heavy battery (the battery can quite
easily weigh more than the rest of
the boat!).
Provided the boat is moored in an
area where it will capture direct
sunlight, a 50–60 watt panel is
normally sufficient to charge up the
batteries over a period of a week,
without any external power source.

Solar shed light
There are several off-the-shelf
packages available for installing
solar shed lights and these often
offer excellent value for money
when bought as a kit rather than
buying the individual components
separately.
However, the manufacturers of
these kits tend to state the best
possible performance of their
systems based on optimum
conditions. Consequently, many
people are disappointed when the
‘four hours daily usage’ turns out to
be closer to twenty minutes in the

middle of winter.
Of course, if you have done a
proper site survey and design, you
will have identified this problem
before you bought the system. If you
need longer usage, you can then buy
a second solar panel when you buy
the kit in order to provide enough
solar energy.

Solar electric bikes
Electric bikes and motorbikes are
gaining in popularity and are an
excellent way of getting around on
shorter journeys.
Electric bikes with pedals and a top
power-assisted speed of 15mph are
road-legal across Europe,
Australia, Canada and the United
States. You can ride an electric
bike from the age of fourteen.
Legally, they are regarded as
normal bicycles and do not require
tax or insurance. They typically
have 200-watt or 250-watt motors
(up to 750-watt motors are legal in

North America). Most electric
bikes have removable battery packs
so they can be charged up off the
bike and usually have a total
capacity of 330–400 watt-hours and
a range of 12–24 miles (20–40km).
Thanks to their relatively small
battery packs, a number of owners
have built a solar array that fits onto
a garage or shed roof to charge up
their bike batteries. This is
especially useful when you have
two battery packs. One can be left
on charge while the second is in use
on the bike.
A number of people have also fitted

solar panels onto electric trikes in
order to power the trike while it is
on the move. Depending on the size
of trike and the space available, it
is usually possible to fit up to
around 100 watts of solar panels to
a trike, whilst some of the load-
carrying trikes and rickshaws have
enough space for around 200 watts
of solar panels. Such a system
would provide enough power to
drive 15–20 miles during the
winter, and potentially an almost
unlimited range during the summer,
making them a very practical and
environmentally friendly form of
personal transport.

Whilst the solar-only range may not
seem that great, there are many
drivers who live in a sunny climate
and only use their cars for short
journeys a few times each week.
For these people, it could mean that
almost all their driving could be
powered from the sun.
Even in colder climates such as the
United Kingdom and Northern
Canada, solar power has its uses in
extending the range of these cars: by
trickle-charging the batteries during
the daytime, the batteries maintain
their optimum temperature, thereby
ensuring a good range even in cold

conditions.
Meanwhile, a number of electric
car owners have already made their
cars solar powered by charging up
their cars from a larger home-based
solar array, providing truly green
motoring for much greater
distances. Several electric car
clubs have built very small and
lightweight solar powered electric
cars and tricycles and at least one
electric car owners’ club is
planning to provide a solar roof to
fit to existing electric cars in the
coming year.

Appendix F –
Building Your Own
Solar Panels (and
Why You Shouldn’t)
A number of people have asked me
about building their own solar
panels from individual solar cells
and asked for my opinion on a
number of websites that make
claims that you can build enough
solar panels to power your home
for around $200 (£120).
I have a huge amount of respect for

people with the aptitude and the
ability to build their own
equipment. These people often
derive a great deal of personal
satisfaction from being able to say,
“I built that myself.” Largely, these
people are to be encouraged. If you
want to build your own solar
panels, however, I would advise
caution.
There have been many claims made
from certain websites that say it is
possible to build your own solar
panels and run your entire house on
solar for an outlay of $200 or less,
selling excess power back to the
utility grid and even generating an

income from solar.
Most of the claims made by these
websites are either false or
misleading. When you subscribe to
these services, you typically
receive the following:
·       Instructions on how to build
a solar panel that are virtually
identical to instructions that
are available free from sites
like instructables.com
·       Information on tax credits
and rebates for installing
solar PV in the United States.
(However, these credits and
rebates are not applicable for

home-built equipment. The
websites omit to tell you
that.)
·       A list of companies and
eBay sellers who will sell
you individual solar cells
Many of the websites claim, or at
least imply, that you can run your
home on a solar panel built for
around $200. In reality, this amount
will buy you enough solar cells to
build a solar panel producing
60–120 watts, which is certainly
not enough to allow you to run your
home on solar power.
Leaving aside the obvious point that

you can buy a cheap, but
professionally built 60–100 watt
solar panel with five-year warranty
and anticipated 25-year lifespan for
around $200 (£120) if you shop
around, there are various reasons
why it is not a good idea to build
your own solar panels using this
information:
·       A solar panel is a precision
piece of equipment, designed
to survive outside for
decades of inclement weather
and huge temperature
variation including intense
heat

·       Professionally manufactured
solar panels use specifically
designed components. They
are built in a clean room
environment to very high
standards. For example, the
glass is a special tempered
product designed to withstand
huge temperatures and ensure
maximum light penetration
with zero refraction
·       The solar cells you can buy
from sellers on eBay are
factory seconds, rejected by
the factory. Many of them are
blemished or chipped and

damaged. They are extremely
fragile, almost as thin as
paper, brittle like glass and
very easy to break
·       Unless you are an expert at
soldering techniques, you are
likely to create a cold solder
joint between one or more
solar cells. Cold solder joints
inside a solar panel are likely
to create a high temperature
arc, which can start a fire
·       There are several
documented cases where
home-made solar panels have
caught fire and caused

damage to people’s homes.
These fires are typically
caused by poor quality
soldering or the use of wrong
materials
·       Many of the websites
promoting home-made solar
panels claim that you can
power your house with them.
In the United States,
connecting home-made panels
to your household electrics
would be in violation of the
National Electric Code and
you would therefore not be
allowed a permit to install

them
·       Many of these websites
imply that you can also sell
your power back to the utility
companies. It is actually
illegal to install non-
approved power generation
equipment to the utility grid in
many countries, including
both the United States and the
United Kingdom
·       The tax credits and rebates
that are available for
installing solar PV on your
home are not available for
home-built solar panels

Many people who make their own
solar panels have found that they
fail after a few months due to
moisture penetration, or fail after
only a few days or weeks due to
high temperature arcing and panel
failure.
Most instructions recommend
building a frame out of wood and
covering it with Plexiglas or
acrylic. This is extremely bad
advice:
·       Never build a solar panel
frame and backing out of
wood. This is dangerous
because of the intense heat

build-up in a solar panel. On
a hot and sunny day, the
surface temperature of the
panel can exceed 90°C
(175°F). If there is any
additional heat build-up
within the panel due to short
circuits or poor quality
soldering, these spot
temperatures could be as high
as 800°C (1,472°F). At these
sorts of temperatures, you can
easily start a fire
·       Do not use Plexiglas or
acrylic to cover your home-
made solar panel. Tiny

imperfections in the material
can lead to light refractions
and intense heat build-up on
elements within the panel.
Plexiglas and acrylic can also
distort under high
temperatures, increasing these
light refractions over time.
The effect can be like a
magnifying glass,
concentrating the intensity of
the sunlight onto a small spot
on the solar cell, which could
result in fire
If you wish to build a small solar
panel for fun, as a way of learning
more about the technology, then you

can get instructions on how to do
this free of charge from many
websites such as
instructables.com. Build a small
one as a fun project if you so wish.
You will learn a lot about the
technology by doing so. However:
·       Treat your project as a
learning exercise, not as a
serious attempt to generate
electricity
·       Never build a solar panel
with a wood frame
·       Treat your home-made solar
panel as a fire hazard

·       Do not mount your
completed home-made solar
panel as a permanent fixture
·       Only use your home-made
solar panel under
supervision, checking
regularly for heat build-up on
the solar panel or frame.
Remember that the front of the
solar panel may get extremely
hot, especially on hot, sunny
days. Do not touch the solar
panel with your fingers
·       Visually check your
home-made solar panel every
time you plug it in to ensure

there is no moisture
penetration. If you spot
moisture penetration, stop
using the solar panel
immediately
·       Use the cheapest solar
charge controller you can find
for your project. The
warranty will be invalidated
on the controller by using a
home-made panel, but at least
if you damage a cheap
controller you haven’t
damaged an expensive one
·       Never charge batteries
using your home-made solar

panel without using a solar
charge controller
·       Never run an inverter
directly from your
home-made solar panel
