About the Authors
Bridget McCrea is a former real estate agent who, for the last 12
years, has run her own Florida-based freelance writing company,
Expert Writing Services, Inc. She specializes in business topics and,
because of her background, spends a good deal of her time writing
about real estate–related topics for magazines such as REALTOR
Magazine, Florida Realtor, The Residential Specialist, and Log 
Home Living.
Bridget has also penned a few books along the way, including The
Real Estate Agent’s Field Guide, The Home Buyer’s Question and
Answer Book, The Real Estate Agent’s Business Planner, and the
RE/MAX Guide to Buying a Home.
She’s shared her home-buying expertise on various radio programs
and Web sites, and is herself a homeowner who, until recently, also
owned a rental home out of state. 
Hunkered down in her Florida home office for most of the day and
night, Bridget does break away from her desk now and then to work
out at the gym and run 5K road races on a regular basis. She’s now
thinking seriously about training her 12-year-old daughter, Catie, to
take over her business so she can put down the pen, turn off the
computer, buy a vacation home on Maui, and get a life outside of
work. So far, Catie has been somewhat noncommittal about giving
up soccer and homework to be a CEO.
Stephen Spignesi is a full-time writer and editor and the author of
40 nonfiction books and one acclaimed debut novel, Dialogues
(Bantam). His books include The New York Times bestseller, J.F.K. Jr.,
five books about Stephen King, three books about the Beatles, and
several books about world and American history, pop culture, the
paranormal, true crime, TV, movies, cooking, natural disasters, Italian
historical figures, cats, and contemporary fiction. Stephen’s most
recent book is George Washington’s Leadership Lessons (published
by Wiley), written with James Rees, the executive director of George
Washington’s Mount Vernon. Stephen lives in New Haven, Connecti-
cut, with his wife, Pam, and their beloved and brilliant cat, Carter.

Introduction
A
re you interested in finding your own getaway somewhere other than in
your hometown? Or perhaps you want to purchase a second home as an
investment, rent it on a year-round or short-term basis to others for profit, and
then sell it? Or maybe you want to buy a second home, hang onto the property
for a few years, rent it for profit, and then sell your primary home and move
into the second home during retirement? Or do you want to brag about owning
two homes or having a home on the shore where you spend your summers?
If you fit into any of these categories — or a combination of them — then Second
Homes For Dummies is for you. Long term, real estate has always been a great
investment. A second home can serve not only as a delightful vacation spot for
you and yours, but can also make you some money. Best of both worlds, right?
With this book in your hands, you’ll be well prepared to handle the entire
second-home buying process, from concept to completion. No matter how
you want to use your second home — as a vacation spot, as an investment
(rental property), or as a future retirement home — or where you want your
second home to be located, I talk about some of the challenges and problems
you may encounter. Danger signs are identifiable, though, and I help you keep
a wary eye.
About This Book
With the ranks of second-home owners growing in leaps and bounds (check
out Chapter 1 for specific statistics), there’s no time like the present to jump
into the second-home game. On the other hand, buying a second home —
and paying for it — can be tricky and fraught with challenges that tend to
rear their heads at the worst possible times.
Although I can’t predict every single challenge or obstacle that will crop up
in your own second-home buying adventure, I can cover the bases and the
basics by helping you prepare for what may very well be the second biggest
financial transaction — after your primary home purchase, of course — of
your lifetime.
Second Homes For Dummies serves as an adjunct to your own knowledge —
that potpourri of information you’ve accumulated over the years about
homes and real estate and plumbing and taxes and . . . well, you get the point.
I present all this info in a logical and modular format so you can find just
what you need on the subjects that interest you.

This book also can bolster the info you receive from any professionals and
advisors you choose to work with. Real estate agents, attorneys, property
managers, and even friends and family (especially those who already own
second homes) can really be gold mines of info for you and can serve as a
strong support team during this process.
Conventions Used in This Book
I use the following conventions in this book to help you navigate your way:
 I italicize all new words and terms that are defined.
 I boldface all text to indicate the action part of numbered lists and for
keywords in bulleted lists.
 I use monofont for all Web addresses and e-mail addresses.
Also, I alternate references between male and female when discussing the dif-
ferent professionals in this book because your property inspector, real estate
agent, or whomever may be a woman or man.
What Not to Read
Of course I want you to read everything that I’ve written in this book.
However, I also realistically know that you’re a busy person and only want to
read just what you need to know to help you buy a second home. So feel free
to skip the sidebars. These shaded boxes appear here and there. These side-
bars often contain related but nonessential info, often about my personal
experiences with real estate and second homes. Although this info is interest-
ing, it’s not essential for you to read to find and buy a second home.
Foolish Assumptions
In writing this book, I make a few assumptions about you, my dear reader,
to whittle down the info and make it as useful as possible. I can assure
you that you’ve picked up the right home-buying guide for your adventure.
The assumptions I make include
2
Second Homes For Dummies 

 You already own a primary home.
 You’re seriously considering purchasing a second home, and you want
just the need-to-know info before you proceed.
 You’ve already been through at least one home purchase transaction
involving a mortgage, and you’ve survived a closing.
 You’re looking for a getaway that’s at least a few hours away (driving time)
from your primary residence.
 You want to use your second home solely for your own personal use, or
use it yourself in between renting it out for short-term stints to others
(for profit).
 You want to buy a second home as an investment property. For now, you
plan on renting it long term, but eventually you plan on making it your
primary residence.
 You’ll likely retire to your second home someday.
 You’re a take-control type of person, and you’ll refer to this book again
and again as you figure out whether you want to buy a second home,
where you want to buy, and how you want to use the property.
How This Book Is Organized
Like every For Dummies book, Second Homes For Dummies has chapters with
self-contained info, so you can read the chapters that interest you the most.
I organize this book into five parts. Here’s what you find in each:
Part I: Seeing a Second Home 
in Your Future
In this first part, I cover the high-level info that can help you determine if
second-home ownership is right for you. I discuss the basics of buying a
second home, and who’s out there in the marketplace doing it right along
with you — and possibly competing with you for the choice properties.
This part also answers the all-important “can I afford it?” question for you
and walks you through the myriad options available to you as a second-home
buyer.
3
Introduction

Part II: Searching for Your New 
Home and Sealing the Deal
This part gets into the basics of finding the perfect home, whether you’re
doing it on your own or with the help of a real estate agent. I discuss everyone’s
role in the game, including real estate agents, loan officers, title companies,
accountants, and so on, and advise you on how you can fit these pros into
your own game plan. And because financing tends to be the most challenging
aspect of the purchase process, you also find in this section a slew of infor-
mation on that topic.
If you’re considering purchasing a second home overseas, this part has an
entire chapter that deals with the many issues you may face and what you
can do to make the process less stressful.
Part III: Making Your Second 
Home a Smart Investment
Whether you’re looking to rent out your home or just keep it for yourself,
you’ll want to do whatever you can to ensure that it remains a sound, grow-
ing investment. What you don’t want to happen is to fall into the trap of
neglecting your property and, thus, reducing its value, as well as your equity
in the place. I show you how to increase your home’s value in this section,
how to rent your home, how to make smart renovations, and how to handle
the maintenance and upkeep on your new home.
Part IV: Home, Sweet Home: Retiring 
to Your Second Home
This part helps you make the transition from landlord or vacationer to 
full-time resident of your second home. Here you can discover how to tell
when the time is right to make the move, what steps need to be taken
to ensure a smooth transition, and how to fix up the home to make it 
suitable for year-round living. You also can read about retirement and
estate planning.

Second Homes For Dummies 

Part V: The Part of Tens
Every For Dummies book has this fun part with short chapters full of interest-
ing tidbits. This part contains important information presented in a compact
list format that you can read quickly. This part boils down some of the most
important aspects of second-home buying, including ten great locations, ten
ways to make your home first-rate, and ten rules to lay down when friends
and family use your home.
Icons Used in This Book
You can find helpful hints sprinkled throughout every chapter of this book. I
identify them with icons, odd-looking symbols that appear occasionally in the
margin next to the text that can help you easily identify this useful informa-
tion. Second Homes For Dummies includes the following icons:
These are ideas and, sometimes, tricks of the trade that can save you time,
energy, and headaches during the second-home buying process. Who needs
added frustration in their lives, right? These tips alleviate some of the pressure.
These are pitfalls that you can avoid during just about every aspect of the
process. This information can help you not make the mistakes many who
came before you have already made.
This icon points out info that’s worth remembering.
This icon points you to anecdotal information from real folks who own their
own second homes and who have been through illustrative experiences that
can be useful for buyers like you.
Where to Go from Here
In a perfect world where no one had jobs, children to care for, obligations to
handle, and (of course) TV shows to watch, you would read this book in its
entirety from cover to cover.

Introduction

Because I’m as busy and distracted as you are, I know that’s probably not
going to happen. The great thing about this and every other For Dummies
book, however, is that you can pick it up and flip through it for the informa-
tion that you need right now, and then go back to the other sections later
as issues crop up, or as you need more background on certain areas of the
process. If you’re not entirely sure what topics you want to read, flip through
the Table of Contents or the Index. Locate the topics that interest you, and
then peruse those chapters or sections that apply to your present situation.
Customized for use by busy home buyers, this book serves as your trustwor-
thy guide as you make your way through your second-home buying venture.
After you read this book, I hope you’re able to purchase a second home in
the perfect location and make many memorable memories there with your
friends and loved ones.

Part I
Seeing a Second
Home in Your
Future

In this part . . .
H
ave you often dreamed of owning a second home in
an ideal location where you and your family can
escape for family vacations and where you hope to retire
someday? Maybe you and your significant other have
started thinking about how you can afford a second home?
Be honest, now. It has crossed your mind, right? And I
don’t blame you one whit. It’s a lovely dream — and one
you can make a reality, too.
If you see a new second home in your future, you’ve come
to the right place. In this part, I discuss the basics of
second-home ownership, cover the various home types
you can choose from, and help you figure out whether you
can afford a second home — and give you some alterna-
tives if you can’t. The final chapter in this part discusses
location (location, location), and what to look for when
you’re shopping for a great place for your second home.

W
elcome to the world of second-home ownership! If you’re considering
buying a second home, you’ve come to the right place. Here, you can
discover how wonderful it is to have a second home to run away to, how grat-
ifying it is to rent your place for extra income (if you choose to do so), and
how comforting it is to know that you’ll retire there at some point in your life
if you so choose.
A large number of people — many of whom have been disenchanted with low
stock market gains over the past few years — have turned to investing in
second homes. This strategy is twofold: Grab a nice slice of paradise while
also putting money in a place where, thanks to the wonders of housing appre-
ciation, it will (ideally) grow steadily over time.
Owning a second home can be a fun adventure, but it isn’t free of some ups
and downs. This chapter gives you an overview of what you can expect when
you buy and own a second home. I explain why people buy second homes
and discuss the second-home market. I also show you the good, the bad, and
the ugly of owning a second home (and, yes, there’s always a little of each),
and I help you avoid making mistakes when searching for the perfect second
home. Finally, I help you get into the “real estate investor” mind-set, and I
explain the roles that you the home buyer, your trusted real estate agent,
and those unknown home sellers play in the process.

Identifying Why People 
Buy a Second Home
People purchase second homes for various reasons, and you’re likely to
relate to at least one of them. Perhaps you want to be able to get away at the
drop of a hat and know that you have somewhere to go that isn’t a hotel
room, a rented condominium, or your in-laws’ sleeper sofa.
Second homes are commonly located in vacation-oriented areas and can be a
great escape for you, as well as for your friends and family who are invited to
make use of the place and its facilities and amenities (if, of course, things like
a pool and tennis courts came along with the purchase). Or perhaps you
simply want a fairly safe investment and plan to rent the property to make
some extra bucks.
This section gives you a brief rundown of some of the main reasons why
people buy second homes. Keep in mind that this section is simply a quick
glance. Check out Chapter 3 for more discussion on the pros and cons of
buying and owning a second home.
A vacation getaway
Who loves taking a vacation? Raise your hand. Of course, you have your hand
up, right? Vacations allow you to take time off from work to escape the daily
grind and relax and unwind. You can decompress from the stress of work,
spend time with your family, and enjoy your surroundings.
Many people buy second homes so they have a reason to take a few days off
to get away and visit it! If you can make the time, a vacation spot is ready and
waiting for you. Especially for hardworking people who tend to burn the
candle at both ends (doesn’t that sound like you?), a second home is a great
place for some downtime. Think about it: If you know that you have an empty,
available beach home a mere five hours away, won’t you be more apt to go
there, visit, and just relax? I know I would!
A place for family and friends to visit
Whether you bring friends and family along on vacation, or let them use your
digs on their own, friends and relatives will love the fact that you have a pad
for them to use away from home — and that you’re such a generous sort that
you don’t mind them enjoying it.
10
Part I: Seeing a Second Home in Your Future 

Many people enjoy using their second homes as a gathering spot for friends
and family. No matter if you’re at the second home with your kith and kin
socializing for a getaway weekend or holiday, or some of your extended
family is using your home for their own little getaway, a second home is a
great way to bring your loved ones together. This book offers plenty of tips
and advice on how to deal with these types of guests. For example, should
you charge them rent (check out Chapter 11)? And how do you ask them to
follow the house rules (check out Chapter 20)?
An investment (in the form of rent money)
Some people purchase second homes for investment purposes. Rather than
spend their vacations there, they rent the property with the intention of
making some money. In doing so, they begin to build equity in yet another
home, thus forming the foundation for a retirement nest egg that at some
point can be sold to a third party or willed to an heir.
By renting your place for more than 14 days per year, you not only can collect
rent checks, but you can also gain tax advantages that owners who opt not to
rent simply don’t have. (Refer to Chapter 14 for the specific IRS rules and reg-
ulations for renting your second home.)
11
Chapter 1: The Lowdown on Buying and Owning a Second Home
Just the stats, please: Why people 
buy second homes
According to the National Association of
Realtors (NAR), sales of second homes, in the
form of vacation homes and investment homes,
set records in 2005. In fact, the combined total of
second-home sales accounted for 4 out of 10
residential transactions.
The NAR reports that 27.7 percent of all homes
purchased in 2005 were for investment, and
another 12.2 percent were purchased for use as
vacation homes. Altogether, 3.34 million second
homes were sold in 2005, up 16.0 percent over
2004 — more than 9,000 second homes were
bought and sold every day of the year!
The NAR determined the reasons vacation-
home buyers wanted a second home:
 41 percent purchased their dwellings to use
for vacations.
 31 percent purchased a place to use as a
family retreat.
 28 percent bought to diversify their invest-
ment portfolio.
For investment-home buyers:
 55 percent said rental income was the pri-
mary factor for buying.
 35 percent wanted to diversify their 
investments.

Part III of this book covers everything you need to know about renting your
home, including finding renters, hiring a property manager, remodeling
your home, maintaining your home, and paying the appropriate taxes on a
rental property.
A space to peacefully retire to
Knowing that you actually own a delightful place on a gorgeous beach in
Maui, and that it’s just sitting there waiting for you to come and live there
full time, may be reason enough for you to purchase a second home. In fact,
many people buy second homes with retirement in mind.
Whether you plan to retire in 5 years or 25 years, you can purchase a second
home and use it as an incentive to work hard and look forward to the golden
years when you can relax. If you do purchase a second home for retirement,
it doesn’t have to sit empty until you’re ready to move in permanently. You
can use it as a vacation destination for yourself or friends, or you can rent it.
Even if you have to rent it seasonally or full time in the interim, the home is still
there (and still appreciating in value) while you put in those additional years
of work and plan for the day when you can retire and enjoy it fully — and full
time. (Refer to Part IV for more in-depth info about retiring to your home.)
Understanding the Second-Home Market
Remember when having more than one house was a really big deal? Yes,
there was a time when owning a second home was considered a luxury only
afforded by the affluent, with everyone else content to stay in hotels or
rented spaces while on vacation.
The perception of second-home owners being King Midas has changed dra-
matically over the last few years. Low mortgage interest rates and an often
uncertain and fluctuating stock market have pushed more people to consider
real estate as an investment, rather than a necessity, or even a luxury. But do
you wonder if you fit in the second-home market? If you want to see how you
compare with these second-home buyers, this section can help you under-
stand the second-home market a bit better.
12
Part I: Seeing a Second Home in Your Future 

Who is the second-home buyer?
The second-home buyer can be the person who is looking for a monthly escape
of her own in a neighboring town or hundreds of miles away. The second-
home buyer can be the shrewd investor who wants to add a few rental 
properties to his retirement portfolio. The second-home buyer can be the
wealthy family that has always wanted to own their own chalet on the coun-
tryside in France. Knowing who’s buying second homes is useful in that
you can easily tell if you fit into one of these categories, and this knowledge
(combined with other considerations, such as what type of homes they’re
buying and what amenities and features they’re looking for; check out
Chapter 3) can help you decide if a second home is right for you.
13
Chapter 1: The Lowdown on Buying and Owning a Second Home
An agent picks his clients’ brains
One Chicago real estate agent I know does a
good 5 to 10 percent of his annual business with
second-home buyers eager to purchase prop-
erty in the city’s downtown Streeterville neigh-
borhood. That’s where theaters, opera houses,
restaurants, and Navy Pier are flanked by one-
and two-bedroom condos priced in the $200,000
to $300,000 range.
Before the agent takes them out to look at prop-
erties, though, he first probes into the buyers’
wants and needs by asking questions like:
 What will you use the property for?
 What amenities or features are you look-
ing for?
 How long do you plan to own this property?
 Would you be willing to upgrade it to maxi-
mize its value?
 Would you rather spend more money on a
finished condo unit, or would you prefer
buying something that you can work on?
Why all the questions?
According to the agent, buying a second, in-
town home in Chicago is about convenience as
much as it is about property appreciation. His
second-home customers include folks ranging
from investors looking for a city getaway, to par-
ents who are purchasing homes for their col-
lege-age children attending school in the area.
Most of his clients come to him through word-
of-mouth referrals from bankers and lawyers, as
well as through his firm’s excellent relocation
department. (For more on working with a real
estate agent, flip to Chapter 6.)
And most of my friend’s clients are also thinking
about exit strategies before they even sign on
the dotted line. According to the agent, he often
finds himself answering one simple question
time after time: “If I needed to sell right away,
how quickly could I do so?”

In 2005, the profile for a typical second-home buyer who uses the home for
vacations was as follows:
 He was 52 years old.
 She had an annual income of $82,800.
 He purchased a property that was a median of 197 miles from his pri-
mary residence. Also, 47 percent of these homes were less than 100
miles away, and 43 percent were 500 miles or more.
In 2005, the profile of the typical second-home buyer who uses the home as
an investment was as follows:
 She was 49 years old.
 He had an income of $81,400.
 She bought a home that was relatively close by — a median of 15 miles
from her primary residence.
More than three-fourths of people who bought second homes for vacations
have no interest in renting their property, and 21 percent said it would
become a primary residence on retirement, compared with only 2 percent of
people who purchased a second home as an investment. Furthermore, 14
percent of investment buyers and 6 percent of vacation-home buyers pur-
chased a property that their son or daughter could occupy while in school.
Where do you fit in? People of all ages and walks of life purchase second homes.
If you’re paying your bills and enjoying life, and can afford the out-of-pocket
expenses — down payment, closing costs, and other outlays associated with
buying a home — the odds are you can purchase and use a second home —
as a vacation home, a full-time rental, a future retirement home, or a place
where you and your family can spend every weekend if you want to.
14
Part I: Seeing a Second Home in Your Future 
Location is everything
The National Association of Realtors asked
second-home buyers which characteristics they
sought out and valued most about their property.
Here’s what they said about location. (Check out
Chapter 4 for more on why location is important
when buying a second home.)
 40 percent said close to an ocean, river,
or lake
 34 percent said close to family members
 27 percent said close to preferred 
recreational activities
 27 percent said close to their primary 
residence
 26 percent said close to mountains
 24 percent said close to a preferred vaca-
tion area
 17 percent said close to a job or school

And you don’t have to spend millions of dollars to get into your second home
of choice. Many of today’s buyers are spending reasonable amounts of money
to buy second homes. The median price of a vacation home in 2005 was
$204,100, up 7.4 percent from $190,000 in 2004. The typical investment prop-
erty cost $183,500 in 2005, up 24.0 percent from $148,000 in 2004.
Where are people buying second homes?
Knowing where the second home hot spots are can help you pinpoint the
best place for yours, particularly if you don’t already have a specific city,
state, or county in mind. By keeping an eye on where others are flocking to,
you can get a great sense of where the best values, amenities, and attractions
are without having to get on an airplane and see for yourself.
People are purchasing second homes in various regions of the United States.
According to the National Association of Realtors (NAR), in 2005, here’s how
the second-home-sales buying pattern shakes out (in order of popularity):
 The Midwest: 33 percent
 The South: 30 percent
 The West: 20 percent
 The Northeast: 17 percent
When you’re ready to pick the place where you want to purchase your
second home, Chapters 4 and 18 have some useful advice you can apply to
your search. Some people are also buying homes abroad. Check out Chapter
9 for more about buying a second home overseas.
Getting in on the Second-Home Boom:
Are You Ready?
Turning your dream of owning two homes into a reality requires careful con-
sideration, despite the allure of low mortgage interest rates and that extra
cash lying around waiting to be invested.
As you decide whether a second home is right for you, take a few moments
and consider the following pointers and reminders:
 Thoroughly review your ability to pay for a second home. Asking your-
self if you can afford a second home is particularly important if you’re
already carrying a mortgage on your first home and you don’t plan to
generate rental income from your second home. Check out Chapter 2 for
more info about whether you can afford a second home.
15
Chapter 1: The Lowdown on Buying and Owning a Second Home

 While figuring out your financials, keep in mind the investment poten-
tial of the new home. If your second home is in a coastal area where
property appreciation is consistent and high (say, in the 15 to 25 percent
range annually or every couple of years), for example, the financial
returns may be significant. Also your home’s rental potential can increase
its value. If you so desire, rent can start pouring in during those months
when you’re not using the place. (See Chapter 11 to read more about
renting a second home.)
 Understand the main financial differences of buying a second home
compared to your first home. Most second-home loans require down
payments of 15 to 20 percent, and some mortgage companies require
higher down payments on second homes, compared to first homes. I’ve
heard of lenders demanding up to 50 percent of the total sales price.
How much you’ll be asked to come up with depends in large part on
your credit rating. (Check out Chapter 8 for more info on financing differ-
ences and credit scores.)
 Know that after the sale closes, you need to be able to afford the
monthly mortgage payment, utilities, and any additional upkeep or
related fees. Remember, owning and maintaining a property isn’t cheap.
You must maintain the property. (Check out Chapter 13 for more on the
upkeep of a second home.)
 Factor in tax obligations. Have a financial advisor or accountant clearly
explain the tax considerations you’ll incur well ahead of your closing
day. If you decide to rent the unit when you’re not using it, you need to
know how all that additional taxable income will affect your financial
picture. (See Chapter 14 for more info on sending Uncle Sam his due.)
 Look for a home and area that boasts the kinds of amenities that will
make you and yours happy and comfortable. Are there certain activi-
ties that you can’t live without, even when you’re on vacation? (Did I just
hear someone shriek the word “golf”?) The key is to make sure you know
which amenities you want before you buy, and only look for those homes
that have the features or that provide easy access to them. For example,
you may desire a house with a pool and basement game room, and your
spouse may want nearby shopping malls.
 Think about your social and family lifestyle. If having friends and
family — a built-in community — close by is important, consider areas
that you have frequented over the years.
 Choose a climate that matches your needs. My favorite season is
summer. My friend Steve’s is, too. If you’re planning on using your
second home year-round, be sure that the location experiences the
weather you enjoy throughout the year. (See Chapter 4.)

Part I: Seeing a Second Home in Your Future 

 Figure out the ideal travel distance, by car or plane, to your second
home. How often do you plan on visiting your second home? If, for
example, you detest flying, choose somewhere within a few hours’ drive.
If, on the other hand, driving is your nemesis, then go for something
very close to home or far enough away to justify the cost of a plane trip.
(Check out Chapter 4.)
 Think about your second home’s long-term use. Will you be renting it?
Then make it easy on yourself and pick a place that’s popular for vaca-
tioners and renters. Will you retire to the home? Then make sure the
home and its surroundings feature all the amenities and extras that you
need to be comfortable and content.
Finding and Purchasing a Second Home:
On Your Own or with an Agent
Do you want to buy a second home for your family to use on vacations? Are
you considering expanding your investment portfolio with a second home?
No matter the reason, if you want to purchase a second home, you first have
to know where to find one. Where do you start? You have two choices when it
comes to buying a second home:
 Shop around on your own, decide on a home, and handle the details
of the purchase by yourself. Handling the deal on your own may not
be easy, but if you’ve been through real estate transactions before, and
if you know what to expect, then you know it’s doable. The upside is
that you’re in control. The downside is that it’s a huge amount of work.
See Chapter 5 for details on how to go about buying a second home on
your own.
 Use a real estate agent to help you buy your second home. Because
agents typically collect commissions from the seller side of the transac-
tion, you have nothing to lose when you hire an agent to help you pur-
chase your home. The pluses include having a pro and all the knowledge
and resources she brings to the table. The negatives include not having
total control and having to depend on the agent to find what you’re look-
ing for. See Chapter 6 for the nitty-gritty on how to select and work with
an agent.

Chapter 1: The Lowdown on Buying and Owning a Second Home

What Kind of Second Home to Avoid
If you’re seriously considering buying a second home, you can’t just buy the
first home you see. Make sure you’re not buying a property that you’ll later
ask yourself why the heck you bought it. If you’re working with a real estate
agent, rely on her expertise to help you find the home that’s right for you. If
you’re not using a real estate agent, make sure you know what you’re buying.
(For example, an inspector can help you if you notice a structural problem
with a home; see Chapter 7 for more info.)
The following list points out a few types of houses you may want to stay
away from:
 A home that doesn’t meet your specific needs, or that of your family.
 A house that’s located in an area of the country that you don’t particu-
larly care for (or even loathe with the heat of a thousand suns).
 A dwelling located in an area where the amenities you really want are
few and far between.
 A home that’s obviously overpriced (comparatively speaking) in a
declining market. (This is a sure sign that you could lose money on
your investment.)
 A house that you want to buy right now because you really like the way it
looks. Doing so is called buying on emotion, and no second-home owner
should get sucked into this situation. You’ll live to regret it. I’ve seen it
happen.
 An abode that needs entirely too much work to get into shape for com-
fortable living. This type of home is considered a fixer-upper.
 A home that’s not located in an area where others want to visit. This is
especially important if you plan on renting it on a seasonal or annual
basis.
 A house that’s too far away for you to get to on a regular basis, say, once
a month, or once every other month — unless, of course, you’re buying
overseas and are aware of the fact that it will be far away regardless of
where you buy.
This list is a good starting point. Feel free to add to it, based on your own cir-
cumstances. By selecting a home that meets your needs, as well as one that’s
a good investment, you’ll be much happier with your choice.

Are You Saying I’m a Real Estate Investor
with Only Two Houses? Yes!
Real estate is a game of sorts and, as a primary homeowner, you’re already
playing it. And, like every game, real estate buying and selling has rules, 
winners, losers, and a multitude of ways to play. When you become a second-
home buyer, you officially move into the “investor” category of game player.
Why? Because you now have a bit more skin in the game. Plus, you’ve shown
that you have a true interest in putting your money into real estate — even if
it’s just for the sake of having a fun vacation every month, which is fine.
This section gives you a quick overview of each person’s role in the real
estate game, and how you can put their expertise and experience to work in
making your real estate transaction successful and smooth, as well as how to
score the best deal possible. Keep in mind that these concepts are discussed
at length elsewhere in the book, too. Check out Chapter 6 for more on who
does what, and to whom, and for whom!
The seller’s game
The seller probably has the easiest job: Get the highest possible price for her
home in the shortest amount of time. Period.
To make this happen,
 She sets an asking price that’s higher than what she thinks she’ll get.
Very few prices these days are really and truly firm.
 She negotiates hard on all points. You can expect one of three things to
happen if you insist on knocking off a significant amount from her price
because of a faulty dishwasher or a carpet you feel needs to be replaced.
• She’ll give you an outright, “No, thanks.”
• She’ll be willing to discuss a compromise.
• She won’t even dignify your offer with a response.
 She refuses to settle until she knows she’s getting a good deal for her
home. Sellers rarely agree to a sale if they feel they’re not getting what
they deserve.
19
Chapter 1: The Lowdown on Buying and Owning a Second Home

Of course, the motivated seller, a subspecies of the seller, is slightly different.
How? She’s much more flexible on all aspects of the sale, and for one good
reason: She’s eager to sell. For whatever reason, she can’t allow the house to
sit on the market for weeks or even months. This type of situation can be a
real opportunity for the serious buyer.
But if a seller is not in a hurry, and she knows what the house is worth and
has decided that that’s the amount she wants, no matter what, then it’ll take
the First Cavalry to move her. (For more insights into negotiating with a
seller, see Chapter 5.)
The buyer’s game
The buyer — and for purposes of this book (except for Chapter 16, where
you’re the seller), that’s you — is out to pay the lowest possible price for
the home that meets his needs in as many ways as possible. He’s looking for
location (location, location), size, amenities, and, of course, price.
For you to score your ideal second home, consider working with an agent to
negotiate pricing and terms on the home of your choice. Or you may choose
to handle the hands-on dickering yourself. Check out Chapter 5, if that’s the
case. Like the seller, you won’t settle until you feel like you’re getting exactly
what you want and for the price you want to pay.
There are also motivated buyers. These buyers need to purchase something
and, thus, sometimes agree to a higher price than they’re happy with in order
to get the house they want, with what they want in it, in a location they’re
excited about. There may be lots of reasons for the urgency, but it boils down
to an opportunity for the seller who holds the house the buyer is interested in.
The agent’s game
The real estate agent’s place is somewhere in between the buyer and the
seller. His job is to shepherd the sale to the closing table . . . no matter what it
takes to do so, all within the ethical guidelines, of course. (Real estate agents
are obliged to follow their national real estate organization’s Code of Ethics.)
Agents typically represent either the buyer or the seller and always work
closely with the co-broker representing the other side of the deal. If there’s
no co-broker, then your agent deals directly with the seller. Everyone’s goal?
To come to terms on the second-home sale.
20
Part I: Seeing a Second Home in Your Future 

Because the agent works on commission, and also because he doesn’t get
paid until the deal closes, it’s in his best interest to see that the deal reaches
the closing table and that all parties are satisfied and cooperating by doing
their part in creating a happy experience for all. (Chapter 6 has all the details
of the agent’s role and how you can work with him.)
If you’re not using an agent, the process is still very much the same: Negotiate
the price and conditions, sign the contract, get the necessary inspections
and appraisals done, get the financing in order, and get the transaction to the
closing table.
After You Purchase: Putting 
Together a Support Team
Second-home ownership is on the rise, so how hard can it be? You put your
money down and voilà, it’s your home, right? Depending on how you plan to
use the home, you move some stuff in and plan for your next vacation, or you
find some renters. Well, it’s not quite as simple as that.
Buying and owning a second home adds a level of complexity to all aspects of
your life, especially when your second home is several hundred miles away
from your primary residence. If something happens, you can’t exactly drop
everything and stop by to check on the place. This section explains how you
can deal with crises when they pop up.
If you don’t have a support team, you’ll be largely left to your own devices
when any type of emergency or issue comes up. If you live 20 minutes down
the interstate, then you can probably handle it on your own. But if your home
is more than an hour or so away, then follow the advice in Chapter 13 and
form a solid support team for yourself and your home.
For the day-to-day responsibilities
By forming strong, friendly bonds with property managers, real estate agents,
and your neighbors, as well as with any friends or family who live close to
your second home, you’ll have a much easier time managing your abode from
afar with all the day-to-day issues and responsibilities. Without this network,
you’re on your own.
21
Chapter 1: The Lowdown on Buying and Owning a Second Home

Your support team can help maintain the home and handle any issues, regard-
less of how far you are from your second home. Your team’s responsibilities
may include cutting the grass, trimming the hedges, cleaning the gutters, and
handling any other regular maintenance and upkeep.
If you’re planning on renting your place, you can hire someone to help you
with all the paperwork and upkeep. For example, a property manager can
handle the marketing of the property to potential renters, keep an eye on the
place when you’re not in town, and hire subcontractors to handle odd jobs
like plumbing problems and routine care like lawn maintenance. (Check out
Chapters 11 and 13 for more on working with a property manager.)
Dealing with the late-night 
emergency call
Phones don’t generally ring in the middle of the night for no good reason.
When you live eight hours away from your second home and you get a call
in the dead of night from someone living in or near your home, you can bet
dollars to doughnuts something serious has taken place. This is when your
support team can swing into action (it can also come to your rescue for emer-
gencies during daylight hours, too).

Part I: Seeing a Second Home in Your Future 
Laying down the ground rules for people 
who use your home
If after you purchase your second home you
decide to let friends and family use it, you want
to ensure that you protect your investment.
A friend of mine owns a few vacation homes,
none of which are rented out but all of which
are used on a regular basis by his friends and
family members. Like many of the owners I have
rented from, he leaves a sheet of rules, instruc-
tions, and info on the refrigerator in the home.
This list cuts down on the number of frantic calls
he receives (telling him, for example, that the
televisions won’t turn on) and the amount of
cleanup that he has to do after they depart.
The following set of House Rules — shame-
lessly pulled off my friend’s second home’s
refrigerator and reprinted almost verbatim —
paints a clear picture as to how guests should
be instructed to treat a home like it’s their own.
(This list was developed after several infrac-
tions took place, and it’s mostly directed at the
owner’s children and friends.) You’ll want to do
the same thing at your second home. Feel free
to photocopy the rules or draft similar rules for
your own guests.

Feel free to use the telephone for local and near-zone calls or to call me if you have

Feel free to watch TV and note that we have all the movie channels. Enjoy those 
channels if you wish, but don’t order Pay-Per-View movies because they are billed

I have wireless broadband available if you care to access the Internet wirelessly on 
your own notebook computer (not sure you have the hardware to do it, but it’s available 
if you do). The wireless signal is very strong throughout the entire condo.
Don’t open the garage door. It’s locked, and I prefer to keep it locked.
If you find any mail in the mailbox, please leave it on the counter when you leave.
Upon leaving, check that all windows are properly closed and that all doors are closed 
and locked. Also, please remove any perishable food stored in the refrigerator.
Take any trash out.
In case you get locked out, don’t panic. The next door neighbor has a spare key to our

Leave me a note on the dining room table and tell me which beds were used. I will 
change the sheets at a later date. But, please do make the beds so that the rooms 
look neat and orderly upon my arrival.
Regarding towels, you have two choices: bring your own or use mine. If you use mine, that 
is okay, but drape the wet ones over the sliding tub enclosure and pile up the used dry 
ones on the counter by the sink, so I will know which ones are dirty. Same holds true for 
the three kitchen towels. There are more clean towels in the bedroom dressers, and 
more kitchen towels in one of the drawers to the right of the kitchen sink. There are 
more sheets in the bedside tables.

House Rules
Note: This stuff is listed in no particular order of importance. I hope you enjoy your stay at 
my vacation home. In return for my generosity, I expect visitors to treat my home like they 
treat their own (better, if they’re homes aren’t clean and neat), report any damage or 
problems as soon as possible, and leave the place as clean (preferably CLEANER) as it was 
when they arrived.

You may receive a late-night call for any number of reasons:
 Maintenance issues: A pipe broke, or the air conditioning won’t kick on.
 Security concerns: The alarm company received a break-in signal.
 Personal injuries on your property: Some guy fell on your lawn and
broke his arm.
 Weather-related disasters: A tree crashed through your roof, or your
basement has 3 feet of water in it.
 Unforeseen calamities: A car jumped your lawn and is now in your
living room.
 Major property damage: A fire seriously damaged your garage.
Having someone you can trust living near your second home is especially
important if your primary home is a great distance away. A good way to deal
with these issues is to think about them in advance and determine what
steps you’ll take when an emergency happens. If you plan to rely on a neigh-
bor, friend, or relative to help you handle crises, give them a heads-up that if
you get a late-night call, you may be waking them up, too. Chapter 13 can
help you figure out whom to call and how to handle emergencies.
Retiring to (And Protecting) 
Your Second Home
When the time comes to retire to your second home, you want to take a few
steps to shore it up and make sure that it’s ready for full-time living. (Check
out Chapter 16 for more advice and info on moving into your second home.)
Here are some things that you can do:
 Have a security system installed and turned on to protect yourself and
your belongings.
 Inspect all windows and door locks to make sure they’re operable and
can be properly secured.
 Check outdoor facilities (such as screen doors) for their ability to close
and lock properly.
 Get adequate insurance coverage for the home (if you don’t have it
already) and its contents (particularly if you’re going to fill up the home
with all of your earthly belongings).
By protecting your home, you can feel more secure. Enjoy retirement and
your home. You deserved it.

Figuring Out Whether You Can
Afford a Second Home
In This Chapter
 Assessing your financial situation
 Deciding whether a second home is in your budget
 Staying within your limits
 Figuring the expenses
 Paying for your second home
O
ne of the first things you should do when considering a major purchase,
whether it’s a second home, third boat, or fourth car, is to make sure
that you can afford it. When you’re thinking about buying another home, you
don’t want to end up having two pieces of property draining your checkbook
to an alarming level every month. In order to prevent you from biting off
more than you can chew, this chapter helps you assess your financial situa-
tion, get a breakdown of the basic expenses associated with second-home
ownership, and figure out how to pay for a second house and its upkeep.
Evaluating Your Financial Situation: Can
You Afford a Second House Now?
Owning a second home gives you great bragging rights and probably some
comfort when you think about your future. Because many people consider
property ownership an important part of the American dream, owning two
homes can translate into financial security: It’s the type of investment that
rarely loses its value. Plus, knowing where you’ll be spending your retirement
years provides reassurance about that phase of your life. But a second home
isn’t worth the commitment if you can’t afford the upfront cost, monthly pay-
ments, and maintenance and upkeep involved in owning one.

Before you make the huge decision to buy a second home, this section helps
you look at your finances to determine whether you have enough money for
such a large investment.
Looking at your assets and liabilities
Before you take on the responsibility of a second home, you need to thor-
oughly and honestly evaluate your financial situation. An easy way to do this
evaluation is to list your assets (how much money you have on hand) and
then your liabilities (how much money you owe in the form of mortgages,
personal loans, credit card balances, and so forth).
Your list of assets may include
 Liquid cash: Money you have ready access to in your savings, checking,
or money market accounts.
 Value of your investments: How much money you have invested in
401(k)s, retirement funds, mutual funds, and other accounts, whether 
or not such funds are liquid.
 Equity in your primary home: Equity is the value of your primary home
minus the total amount that you currently owe on your mortgage.
 Personal property: Valuable collections, such as stamps, art, guns, 
collectibles, jewelry, vehicles, and so on, are assets.
Your list of liabilities may include
 Mortgage balance (including home equity amounts) for your 
current home
 Balances on car loans and student loans
 Revolving credit card balances
 Personal loan balances (including unwritten loans you’re paying off 
to friends or family)
Evaluating your net worth
After you know your assets and liabilities, you can figure out your net worth,
which is the value of all assets, including cash, less your total liabilities.
Knowing your net worth is important for second-home buyers because 
you can see exactly what you have to work with for a down payment. This
amount can also be a source for closing costs and, perhaps, a new monthly
mortgage payment (which will eventually be mitigated if you rent the place).
26
Part I: Seeing a Second Home in Your Future 

To figure out your net worth, subtract your liabilities from your assets. Here’s
an illustration:
Assets ($214,000) – Liabilities ($26,000) = Net worth ($188,000)
When looking at your net worth (what you’re worth on paper) and your
monthly income and outgo (what comes in and goes out every month), you
need to ask yourself two important questions:
 How much of your net worth are you able (and willing) to spend on a
down payment for a second home? This money will come from your
savings, investments, a home equity loan, or a combination of these.
 How much are you able (and willing) to spend each month on paying
for your second home? To answer this question, figure out your current
monthly expenses: expenses that absolutely must be paid without fail.
Then determine what’s left over to pay for a second mortgage (see the
next section). Of course, if you plan to rent your second home, you’ll
have a source of income to help pay the mortgage. (Check out Chapter
11 for more info on garnering rental income from your second home.)
When figuring your monthly income and outgo, make sure you factor in any
additional income, such as alimony, child support, or other regular sources
of funding you receive, as well as extra expenses, like alimony or child sup-
port. This cold appraisal of everything you bring in and spend allows you to
determine the total amount of monthly income that is available to invest in a
second home.
Figuring your monthly surplus
After you know what your current monthly income and expenses are, plug
the numbers into Figure 2-1 to calculate your monthly surplus (the money you
have left at the end of the month after you pay your expenses) available to
pay for a second home.
The basic rule: The costs for your primary home should be a third of your
gross income. So for example, if you earn $7,000 a month in gross income, your
housing costs are $2,000 (including mortgage, taxes, and homeowners’ insur-
ance) and your monthly living expenses are $3,000, then you have $2,000 left 
in monthly surplus for a second home. You have to decide whether $2,000 per
month is enough to comfortably afford a second home. It very well may be,
depending on what your secondary mortgage will be. For example, if you buy 
a $200,000 property, put down $50,000, and get a fixed 30-year mortgage at 5.9
percent, your monthly payment without taxes will be $889.70. That would leave
you with about $1,100 for property taxes and other expenses. Is that enough?
You need to make that decision based on your own circumstances. If it’s not,
you may need to buy something cheaper, find a way to put down a larger
deposit, or hold off on buying a second home right now.
27
Chapter 2: Figuring Out Whether You Can Afford a Second Home

Mortgage bankers use gross income to determine worth and borrowing
power. But in real life, calculating net income (what’s left of your paycheck
after taxes and benefit deductions) less outgo provides a clearer picture of
your monthly financial situation.
Be honest with yourself about every penny that goes out, lest you wind up 
in the red after purchasing your new second home. Sometimes unexpected
situations affect your financial picture. If a loved one is ill, for example, and
you’re helping to pay for medical care, you’ll want to factor that expense in
as a liability. If your daughter just went off to college and is burning through
$800 a month in spending money, be sure to take that into account.
This bottom-line number can tell you where you stand financially and provide
you with a glimpse of reality regarding your second-home purchase. Can you
do it? Should you do it? Knowing how much more you will spend each month
can help you answer those questions.
Knowing and staying within your limits
If you had a dollar for every time someone warned you not to overextend
yourself financially, you’d probably be able to pay cash for a second (and
third, and maybe fourth) home right now. (And after you read this section,
I’m going to owe you a dollar, too.) I can’t stress enough how important it is
for you to realize that second-home ownership is a major undertaking.
If you don’t understand your financial limitations before you move ahead
with choosing and financing a second home, you risk losing at least your
second home to foreclosure, and possibly your first house, too. Foreclosure is
when the lender sells the home to cover the debt that you owe. And yes, it’s
as horrible an experience as it sounds. And adding insult to injury, not only
do you lose the second home, but you also lose everything you put down on
the place when you bought it. So think carefully before making the plunge.
Enter your gross monthly income (how much you earn before taxes and other 
expenses are withheld).
Enter your total monthly housing costs, such as mortgage payments, private 
mortgage insurance, taxes, and homeowners’ insurance paid on your primary 
home. 
Subtract line 2 from line 1.
Enter your other monthly expenses, such as credit card debt, student loans, car 
loans, medical bills, and so forth.
Subtract line 4 from line 3.
This amount is your total monthly surplus available.

Use the following fun short quiz to help you get a handle on your financial
limits. Answer yes or no. Be brutally honest.
1. Do I save money on a monthly basis? _________
2. Do I live paycheck to paycheck? _________
3. Am I in the red at the end of the month on a fairly regular 
basis? _________
(If you said “Yes” to questions 2 and 3, you may want to reconsider 
an outright purchase of a second home.)
4. Can I afford the mortgage payment, insurance, property taxes, and
upkeep on another home at this time? _________
5. If I answered “No” to question 4, is there an active rental market in
my second-home location of choice right now? _________
(If so, then rent coming in on my second home every month may cover
some or all the expenses associated with second-home ownership.)
6. Considering my own financial situation and the current real 
estate market conditions, is real estate a good investment right 
now? _________
(For example, if it’s a hot seller’s market — a market where housing
inventory is low, appreciation is high, negotiating room is limited, and
housing prices are through the roof — but your job situation is iffy, you
may want to think twice about buying a second home right now.)
7. Do options like timesharing or leasing sound more feasible to me right
now? _________
(These options are viable for individuals who want a vacation home, but
who don’t want to take on the expense of owning one outright. Check out
Chapter 3 for how you can take advantage of a timeshare and the “Trying
leasing before buying” section later in this chapter for more info.)
Only you and any cosigners will be responsible for the payments on your
second home, so be honest with yourself when figuring out whether you can
afford a second home. You may be counting on the rent of the home to cover
its monthly nut (the total monthly expenses to keep and maintain the house),
but tenants move out, and sometimes rentals stay vacant for a while. So
always be sure you’ll be able to pay for the home, even when it’s empty.
(Unless, of course, you’re a gambler at heart and are willing to let the chips
fall where they may! Not a recommended strategy, by the way!)
If, after reading this section and completing the quiz, you’re now confident
that second-home ownership is right for you and your long-term financial pic-
ture, then good for you. If, however, after these exercises you’re still having
doubts about your ability to afford a second home, retrace your steps, look
again at the numbers, and weigh the pros and cons one more time before
making a final decision.
29
Chapter 2: Figuring Out Whether You Can Afford a Second Home

Considering timing
Location means a lot in real estate, but timing is also very important. Life
events — both expected and unexpected — can play a significant role in 
your ability to buy a second home.
That’s not to say that everything needs to be perfect for it to be the right
time to invest in real estate. It doesn’t. But you should carefully consider job
security, life events, and health issues before you jump into the second-home
market feet first. You improve your chances of second-home success if you
work through the timing issues now, in advance of signing on the dotted line.
For instance, if you’re in the middle of a two-year divorce battle, now is prob-
ably not the best time to buy that $500,000 condo in Myrtle Beach, South
Carolina. Think carefully before you plunk down a $10,000 deposit on that
bungalow on the French Riviera (no matter how badly you may need a vaca-
tion there right now!).
Trying leasing before buying
What if your financial analysis didn’t make you smile and you still want a
second home? Just because your numbers aren’t perfect doesn’t mean you
still can’t have your own little slice of heaven nestled on a shoreline or situ-
ated a mile away from the Las Vegas Strip. If you enjoy visiting the same area
on a regular basis, you may want to consider leasing first before buying.
You can rent a place from owners who, if asked nicely (and monetarily com-
pensated, of course), will often hold certain weeks each year for their best
customers. This arrangement can work well for you if you’re not quite ready
to buy a second home but want to know how it feels to vacation at the same
place every year.
If you lease a home in a popular vacation area, you can also use your time to
get to know other owners and suss out how they like their properties, whether
maintenance and upkeep are affordable (you’ll find that many will be almost
too eager to tell you what you’d like to know, especially when it comes to what
they’re not happy about), plus their take on the experience of owning a second
home. Use this time to your advantage, and factor all this knowledge into your
final second-home buying decision, whether that happens now or in the future.
You can also check out “for lease/rent by owner” Web sites, such as www.
vrbo.com and www.vacationrentals.com, where you can view properties
and rates without any sales pressure.

Figuring Out How Much (Second) 
House You Can Afford
Assuming you already own your primary residence, you know what it took to
get you there: You know what it’s like to apply and be approved for a mortgage
and to pay the closing costs on your purchase. You also know what it takes to
pay that mortgage every month, while also covering the taxes, homeowners’
insurance, home repairs, and routine maintenance.
However, owning a second home does have its differences. This section gives
you a more detailed look at the financial commitments of second-home own-
ership, which can help you decide whether your budget allows for the added
expenses.
Keep that calculator handy: Adding it up
Even though the real estate transaction process is, of course, similar for pri-
mary and second homes, buying a second home can be more challenging
when it’s time to get a mortgage. Just remember: Buying a second home is 
a numbers game. As with most real estate purchases, you want to look at 
not only how much money you have to spend on the property, but also how
much money you can make on the investment from appreciation and rental
income (if you choose to rent the property).

Using some nifty online mortgage calculators
Second-home buyers can use all sorts of free,
online calculators to determine everything from
basic monthly mortgage payments and tax
advantages of second-home ownership to loan
amortization schedules. Check these out for
starters:
 The 
Mortgage 
Calculator,
www.
smartmoney.com/home: Smart Money’s
mortgage calculator figures the monthly pay-
ment, calculates the effects of prepaying the
mortgage, and analyzes the composition of
future monthly payments.
 GMAC Mortgage Calculators,
www.
gmacmortgage.com/Purchase/
Buy_a_Vacation_or_Investment_
Home/What_You_Should_Know/
benefits.html: GMAC’s site offers
biweekly and monthly payment, mortgage
loan, ARM versus fixed rate, and annual
percentage rate (APR) calculators.
 Mortgage-Calc, www.mortgage-calc.
com: This site boasts a variety of mortgage
calculators that help buyers compare dif-
ferent loan offerings, determine whether it’s
better to rent or buy, and figure out how
much they can borrow.

When buying a second home, you’ll likely pay higher interest rates and down
payments than you did for your first home because lenders know that during
tough financial times a borrower is more likely to pay for his primary home
and leave the second-home mortgage to languish.
To calculate how much home you can afford, use the same reasoning that
you used when you purchased your primary residence. A simple online
search for a “mortgage calculator” can provide you with many tools.
To the do-it-yourselfers: There is no simple, by-hand formula for calculating a
monthly mortgage payment. (That’s why God made banks and computers.)
However, there is a “down-and-dirty” trick you can use to at least give you a
sense of what kind of monthly payment you’re looking at:
1 Simply divide the loan amount by the term of the loan in months.
For example, a $180,000 loan divided by 360 (the number of months in a
30-year mortgage) comes out to $500 a month.
2. Multiply that amount by 1.5 (for a 3 percent interest rate) to 3 or more
(for a 10 percent rate and up).
Doing so can give you a fairly good estimate as to what you’ll pay just on
the loan, without escrow.
And this trick works: At a 3 percent rate, multiplying that $500 by 1.5
gives you $750. And what do the amortization calculators come up with?
$758.89. And with the 10 percent rate? Multiplying $500 by 3 gives you
$1,500. The amortization calculators come up with $1,579.63.
The mathematically astute readers can easily work this formula to come up
with a rough estimate for all the rates in between 3 and 10 percent. For the
math-challenged, I suggest you pick up the phone or go online to use a mort-
gage calculator.
After you have your final monthly payment calculated, you need to add on 
a few more costs: insurance and tax payments, as well as any recurring
monthly fees associated with the home, which normally include maintenance
and the amount you expect to pay a property manager to maintain and rent
out the home while you’re not using it (if you opt for this route). Of course,
you need to also be prepared for unexpected repair bills. Whether you’re
renting out the house or not, a kaput water heater needs to be replaced now.
If, for whatever reason, the numbers don’t work for you, the next step is to
revise your target home’s sales price down. If, for example, that $750,000
single-family home in the golf course community is obviously out of reach,
then you set your sights on the $500,000 condo in the same ’hood.
32
Part I: Seeing a Second Home in Your Future 

Considering the expenses
Before you make the final decision to jump into the second-home market-
place, you need to have a complete grasp of the various costs associated
with owning a second home. These expenses go beyond your monthly mort-
gage payment, and keeping current with them is every bit as important as
meeting that monthly commitment.
Homeowners’ association fees
The Community Association Institute (CAI) has estimated that about 1 in 6
Americans lives in a community managed by a homeowners’ association. If
you’ve never owned a home that was part of a development or a complex,
you may be surprised at the additional monthly expenses that come with
owning a condo or home that’s managed by an association. Depending on
where you buy, you may have to pay monthly, quarterly, or biannual associa-
tion fees that cover such expenses as general neighborhood upkeep, lawn
maintenance, snow removal, water and sewer expenses, electricity (for park-
ing lot lights, tennis court lights, and so on), and cable.
Be sure to ask about the types of fees you’ll be expected to pay in your com-
munity and factor these costs into the budget for your second home. Condos
have particularly high fees that usually cover several expenses that you’d
otherwise have to pay on your own (such as water and sewer or exterior
maintenance). Single-family homes and townhouses command lower fees,
with much of the maintenance responsibility falling on the owner’s shoulders.
Maintenance: Inside and out
No matter where your second home is located, you’ll have to maintain the
property inside and outside. Your grass will certainly grow, filth will find 
your windows, and loose trash may occasionally blow into your front yard.
Maintaining your second home is an ongoing task, and you need to factor all
these types of maintenance issues into your budget.
For example, owning a house by the shore may be hip, but the reality is that
maintaining such a dwelling can be tough on your checkbook. All it takes is
one active hurricane season with its delightful driving rain and 75 miles per
hour winds to take a toll on what was once a beautiful little home by the sea.
The interiors of homes in close proximity to saltwater also need TLC. Even 
if your home isn’t located near the shore, it still has regular maintenance
requirements. Lawns, yards, and swimming pools all need regular upkeep and
repair, with breakdowns often occurring at the most inopportune times.
33
Chapter 2: Figuring Out Whether You Can Afford a Second Home

Keep these realities in mind as you preview properties, and don’t be afraid to
ask the current owners about their maintenance routines. (They probably
won’t tell you about the negatives, but asking doesn’t hurt.) Be sure to set
aside funds every year for maintenance and repairs. You can do some of the
maintenance and minor repairs yourself (for example, mowing the yard), and
some things won’t be necessary at all depending on where you buy (you
don’t need to shovel snow in Miami, right?). And even if you buy a condo in
Vegas where you have condo fees to pay, you’ll still deal with regular, perma-
nent maintenance expenses one way or another.
Damages and repair costs
You keep your primary home looking good and running like a well-oiled
machine, right? You need to take care of your second home with the same
diligence and attention to detail. It needs to be kept in tiptop shape, free of
damage, and in the best condition possible. This ensures that your invest-
ment is protected, and it also assures that your home is aesthetically pleas-
ing to neighbors, guests, and renters. Always be prepared for those bills for
necessary repairs that rear their heads unexpectedly.
Many homeowners’ associations have a year’s income in the bank as a
reserve for . . . well, for whatever must be paid on behalf of the complex. As
an individual homeowner, you likewise should have an emergency fund to
pay for repair or replacement of appliances and heating and cooling systems.
The fund should be equal to the cost of the worst possible immediate prob-
lem you may face. For example, what if your stove, washer, or refrigerator
dies? What would it cost to replace them immediately? Estimating high is a
smart move. What if your furnace, central air conditioning unit, or water
heater self-destructs? You need to know what it’s going to cost to get these
necessities repaired, so have a fund to tap as needed.
To be sure that you’re not caught unprepared, you may want to keep $500 to
$3,000 in reserve for unexpected expenses. Of course, you can always put
these expenses on a credit card, but if at all possible, you don’t want to add
to your credit card debt by paying for necessary repairs.
You can delegate just about all the maintenance duties on your second home
to a property manager, but you’re going to pay for her time, in addition to the
actual costs of the services. Is your time worth more than the costs of these
services? You need to decide that and act accordingly. (Check out Chapter 13
for more on hiring a property manager and the related fees.)
Homeowners’ insurance
Homeowners’ insurance comes in many different forms, depending on where
you live and the type of home you buy. Furthermore, as the owner of a second
home, you’ll probably have to shell out more than you’re used to paying for
your primary home. More things can go wrong when the owner isn’t present,
and insurers factor this reality into their rates for second homes.
34
Part I: Seeing a Second Home in Your Future 

Location also plays a key role in insurance rates. For example, you can expect
to spend more money on homeowners’ insurance in higher-risk states, such
as Florida, where hurricanes have created a rough market for current insur-
ers. Along with the additional cost, you can expect to spend extra time find-
ing insurance for homes in high-risk areas.
If you’re buying a condo, your condo association fees will cover your home-
owners’ insurance, which includes liability and hazard coverage. But you
must also take out your own contents insurance to cover your possessions
and furniture. For more info on homeowners’ insurance, check out Chapter 8.
For now, just be aware of the need for and cost of this coverage and be sure
to factor it into your buying decision.
Taxes of all kinds
Benjamin Franklin said the only things guaranteed in life are death and taxes,
and the latter certainly holds true for owners of second homes. Taxes come
in many forms. (Chapter 14 discusses in detail how second-home ownership
can affect your tax situation.)
 Property taxes: You may not be living in the home full time, and you
may not have kids attending the local school district, but you still have
to help fill the municipality’s coffers for the coming year, every year.
Property taxes are based on a fixed proportion of the value of the prop-
erty being taxed. The property owner pays these taxes; she is liable
regardless of whether the home is used and whether it generates
income. The good news is that these property taxes are almost always
deductible on your federal income taxes.
 Income taxes: If you rent out your second home, remember that rental
income is taxable income.
Renting out your second home can impact your right to deduct property
taxes on your tax return. Talk to your accountant.
 Automobile registration taxes: If you decide to register a vehicle at your
second home’s address, you should first determine what the vehicle
taxes will be and compare that figure with what you’re paying now. You
may be better off keeping your cars registered at your primary address.
Also, check your state statutes: Some states require a certain period 
of residency for automobile registration (and resulting taxation).
Registering a car in a second home’s state to save on taxes when you
spend 50 weeks a year at your primary home may not be legal.
35
Chapter 2: Figuring Out Whether You Can Afford a Second Home

Traveling to and fro your new home
A final expense to consider when purchasing a second home is the trans-
portation expense that you’ll incur getting there on a regular basis. With fuel
costs fluctuating wildly, think about the gas your vehicle requires to make the
trek. Sure, gas may be (relatively) cheap one day, but one global crisis can
send prices skyrocketing, and you can’t avoid this expense.
You may face other travel expenses if your second home is far from your first
home. If it’s more than a day’s drive, you need to factor lodging, meal costs,
and the myriad expenses that always crop up when traveling. Are you flying
to your second home? Consider the airline ticket, any parking fees, and
ground transportation costs to get to and from the property.
How Are You Going to Pay for It?
You can pay for your second home in a variety of ways, although most
second-home buyers stick with one of three strategies:
 They take out a mortgage for the second home.
 They pay with cash.
 They rent the home and use the rental money to pay a mortgage.
If your primary home is already paid off, then the challenge of juggling two
mortgages isn’t on your radar screen. Thoroughly review your finances,
though, to be sure you’re ready for a new mortgage, property taxes, home-
owners’ insurance, and repair/maintenance costs.
This section covers the pros and cons of paying cash for your second home,
addresses the realities of having two mortgages at once, and suggests that
renting the property can offset some of the associated expenses.
Twice isn’t always nice: Two 
mortgage payments
If you get stressed every month when you receive that three- or four-figure
mortgage statement in the mail, and your other house-related bills (for prop-
erty taxes, homeowners’ insurance, and so on) add to your mental strain,
then you may want to think twice about taking out an additional mortgage.
36
Part I: Seeing a Second Home in Your Future 

Two mortgage payments can stretch a budget thin pretty quickly, so enter
into a second-home mortgage with a full knowledge of your monthly budget
and available financial resources.
The good news is that more and more people are buying second homes these
days, and mortgage lenders are responding by offering a wide range of prod-
ucts and services to meet those needs. Still, you should expect to search a
little longer for your second-home mortgage to find a good deal.
Don’t leap at the first loan that comes your way. Take your time and find the
right lender for your situation. A little extra legwork can save you money.
Laying down cold, hard cash
Another option you have when buying a second home is to lay down your
hard-earned cash. Where can you come up with such a large sum of dinero?
The following are your main options along with the concerns you must think
about if you choose that option:
 You can cash in your 401(k) or other retirement plan. But before you
do, check out the rules associated with cashing in early. Most plans
charge a 10 percent penalty.
 You can borrow from friends and family. These folks can be great
sources of funds if they’re financially well situated and inclined to help.
In exchange, maybe you can offer them annual use of your new pad.
However, borrowing from a close relative or pal can create problems
that you can avoid by relying on a third party that you’re not so close to.
 You can drain your savings and investment accounts. Approach this
option cautiously. Consider using only a portion of your savings and
investment accounts for the new home, and saving the rest.
 You can win the lottery or strike it big in Vegas. Sorry, but I don’t have
a strategy for this option, but hey, if you strike it big, you may be able to
buy a second, third, and even fourth home. (Can you dream Bora Bora
or someplace exotic and serene?)
Paying your mortgage with rental income
If you don’t have a lump sum of cash to purchase your second home and you
don’t have surplus income each month to pay the home’s mortgage, you may
decide to rent out your second home and use the rent payment to pay your
37
Chapter 2: Figuring Out Whether You Can Afford a Second Home

second-home mortgage. With careful planning, your second home can be a
lucrative investment that not only appreciates in value over time, but also
creates a revenue stream as soon as you begin renting it out. (Chapter 11 
discusses in more depth what you need to know if you decide to rent out
your second home.)
If, for example, you have a $2,000 a month mortgage on a property in Denver,
Colorado, you may well be able to charge $2,000 a month in rent (depending
on the time of year and what the market will bear), which will completely
cover the monthly mortgage payment. Understand, however, that insurance
and taxes will also come due, and that repairs and maintenance may also 
be in order. Of course, if the area market rental prices are higher, the rental
income may be able to cover these expenses. (Which, truth be told, is a very
nice set of circumstances!)
Although a long-term rental offers you a sense of security that someone is
living in and taking care of your second home (and the lease guarantees
income for a specific amount of time), short-term rentals in vacation spots
can be particularly lucrative. The downside is that these units fetch the best
rates (and are in most demand) mostly during certain seasons, and their 
pricing depends on their location and size. A two-bedroom, two-bath condo
in Honolulu, Hawaii, for example, rents for $2,500 a week during the high
season, while a three-bedroom, two-bath townhouse in Clearwater, Florida,
rents for that much per month during the area’s high season.
With proper planning, smart research, and a keen awareness of what appeal
your second home has for renters, donning a landlord’s hat can help ease the
financial burden of paying for your second home.

Second-Home Options
In This Chapter
 Choosing among second-home options
 Building versus buying already built
 Buying land to build on
 Considering options if you don’t want to buy
F
or a second-home buyer, the world is a cornucopia of home choices. You
can choose from scores of different home styles, from detached single-
family homes and townhouses, to condominiums and mobile homes. You can
buy undeveloped land on which to build a new home, and if none of those
options suit you, you can consider alternative ownership options.
This chapter covers the many different varieties of second homes and the
pluses and minuses of each. With everything from basic structural elements
to lifestyle preferences playing important roles in your ultimate selection,
this chapter is where you can really nail down exactly what you are — and
aren’t — looking for in a second home.
Narrowing Your Options: 
What Do You Want?
Buying a second home can be a lot like buying a new car: Either you look
around the lot and take what’s available, or you dig a little deeper and ferret
out a style, color, and model that you really want. You go through the same
process when you’re looking for a second home. If you’re not too picky, you
may be happy in a home that’s already available. Sometimes getting what 
you want means you may have to wait several months for the home of your
dreams to be built. Other times, you may have to be patient until a home with
the right features in the right area hits the market. But whether you decide to

select from what’s available or wait, the point is the same: To get what you
want, you need to know what you want.
To help you clearly spell out exactly what you’re looking for in a second
home, complete the following worksheet. Then use your criteria to review the
various options available in your market and find the perfect second home. If
you need more info about any of the different types of second homes, see the
corresponding section in this chapter. Feel free to write in this book or make
a copy of this questionnaire. Answer the questions and use your answers as a
checklist or give the worksheet to your real estate agent for use during your
home search.

Single-Family Homes: The 
Most Popular Option
Most people, whether buying a primary or secondary residence, buy a single-
family home. Detached from any other residential structures, single-family
homes are usually landscaped with grass, trees, and flowers, and often
include a garage and an attic. In many states, they may also have basements.
In this section, I go over your basic options when purchasing single-family
homes for use as vacation pads.
You as the one-and-only, original owner
As I write this, there’s no time like the present to purchase a new second
home. The real estate boom of the early 2000s resulted in an overabundance
of new homes — particularly in areas where home values appreciate quickly,
such as vacation spots. The good news for you is that builders have a surplus
of new homes — many of which are competing with existing properties —
that they need to unload. And because the market is more stable than it was
a few years ago, you now have more choices and negotiating room when it
comes to buying a new home.
If you buy a newly constructed home, you’ll pay more for your second 
home than if you were to buy an existing home because of rising construction
costs and the expensive modern elements that new homes often feature.
Nonetheless, if gorgeous granite countertops, energy-efficient stainless steel
appliances with all the bells and whistles, and stunning floors made of Italian
tile are on your must-have list, then a new home may be your best fit and
right choice.
42
Part I: Seeing a Second Home in Your Future 

Remember that even though new homes usually include many exciting fea-
tures and modern conveniences, they’re not perfect. Chapter 7 discusses the
inspection process and what to look for, and look out for, when purchasing a
new home.
The age factor: Modern, older, or historic
When buying a second home, do you need to consider when it was built 
and how old it is? It really depends. The age of a second home matters less
than the owner’s personal preferences and ability to maintain the structure.
Comfort is king, and even if a home has every convenience and feature 
imaginable, it won’t matter one whit if you don’t look forward to going there
and don’t love being there. For example, to some individuals, a 150-year-old,
historic home in downtown Philadelphia is the perfect getaway. For others, a
2-year-old, single-family abode with modern appliances and delightful ameni-
ties in West Palm Beach, Florida, is old enough for their liking.
An older home may ooze charm and warmth, and perhaps even nostalgia for
bygone days if you buy something in the 100-year-old category (either you
love or hate those separate bathroom sink faucets, right?), but the house
may require too much upkeep for the out-of-state owner who uses it twice a
year. Be sure to consider the maintenance factor before you fall in love with
that quaint seaside abode that constantly gets buffeted by ocean spray, or
the 19th-century Victorian that needs a new roof and exterior painting, and
maybe a furnace one of these days. (Check out Chapter 13 for more on main-
tenance and upkeep issues.)
Don’t dismiss older homes that need work if you’re handy enough to do the
repairs and improvements and you have the required time to do them. Being
able to handle tasks like plumbing and carpentry jobs on your own opens the
field of second homes. If you have a toolbox that could be on display at your
favorite home improvement store, then by all means have at it!
Sizing up your square-feet needs
A 1,200-square-foot single-family home may be plenty of room to live in for
some people, but that “smallish” home can get pretty crowded pretty quickly
for others. Before you buy, think about the typical number of people who will
use the home at one time, and consider their personal space needs. Here are
some scenarios to think about concerning size:
 If you, your spouse, and two children are, for the most part, comfortable
and happy in a 1,500-square-foot primary home, then a smaller vacation
place will probably suffice.
43
Chapter 3: Considering Your Second-Home Options

 If your family loves its sprawling 6,000-square-foot, multifloor home in
the country, then a beach house with plenty of room (2,500 square feet
or more) would be a good choice.
 If your family often brings extended family and friends on vacation, then
size matters — a lot. For the sake of everyone’s nerves and the desire to
avoid family feuds, opt for a larger home where everyone can be com-
fortable and not squished together like sardines.
Depending on your square footage needs, you want to make sure everyone
who visits and uses your second home is comfortable and relaxed. Keep the
two following points in mind when thinking about square footage:
 Consider issues like kitchen and family room space when checking
out homes. Guests tend to congregate in these areas the most while 
on vacation. You don’t want to buy a home that has a tiny kitchen and
family room if you have a large family or group of friends who won’t
have anywhere to sit. Although if the trade-off is larger bedrooms, then 
it may be worth considering.
 Make sure you have enough bathrooms and bedrooms. You can never
have too many bathrooms. Let me repeat that. You can never have too
many bathrooms. (Make a pit stop at the next section.)
Counting up the all-important 
bathrooms and bedrooms
Does the number of bathrooms and bedrooms really matter for your second
home? When thinking about these rooms, think in terms of the minimum
number of bathrooms and bedrooms you find acceptable, as opposed to an
exact number. This way, you won’t risk missing out on a great house because
it has one too many rooms.
A good rule for bathrooms: Start with one full and one half bath. No matter
what the size of your family, this arrangement allows you to play the odds
that more than two people won’t need the bathroom at the exact same time. It
may happen, of course, but that extra half bath really takes the pressure off.
When considering how many bedrooms and bathrooms your second home
needs, remember the following before making your decision:
 Choose the number of bedrooms and bathrooms in your second home
based on the size and needs of your family. Can two younger brothers
share a room? Does your teenage daughter insist on her own bathroom
or she’ll “just die!?” A good rule: You need one bathroom for every three
individuals in the home. So if six people live there, have at least two
bathrooms.
44
Part I: Seeing a Second Home in Your Future 

Your own situation dictates how many bedrooms and bathrooms you
need in your second home. If you, your spouse, your three children, and
your two dogs (no insult intended to cats, of course, but they tend to be
much lower maintenance animals) are comfortable back home in a four-
bedroom, two-bath casa, then something along those lines should be
just fine for your second home.
 Factor in the needs of any guests whom you plan on bringing along on
a regular basis. Will it be a problem when Grandma, who’s bunking on
the first floor, needs to climb the stairs to use the bathroom in the
middle of the night? If so, look for a home with first-floor facilities.
 Consider the features that are likely to appeal to potential renters. If
you’re going to use your second home as an investment property and
rent it (check out Chapter 11), convenience, privacy, and comfort should
be your watchwords when looking at a second home.
 Look to the future. Your second home’s resale value will probably be
higher if the number of bedrooms is equal to — or close to — the total
number of bathrooms in the home. The convenience of having one bath-
room per bedroom is perceived as a plus to buyers.
These days, a single-family home with at least three bedrooms and two 
bathrooms is highly desirable. Those homes with fewer of each tend to fetch
lower prices or take longer to sell. If you plan to retire to your second home
and not sell it in the foreseeable future, these issues won’t matter as much 
as the comfort of you and your family does. If cleaning just one bathroom is
more than enough, thank you very much, and you and your family have func-
tioned with one loo just fine (the occasional door pounding and “I can’t hold
it!” and “You’ve been in there all day!” incidents notwithstanding), then feel
free to buy that three-bedroom, one-bath unit being offered at a great price.
If you need to double up in certain rooms while you’re on vacation, bunk
beds, rollaway beds, air mattresses, and even sleeping bags are always an
option for the younger kids (who may be at that age when sleeping on the
floor is still considered an adventure and not something that will result in the
need for a chiropractor!). In other words, even if you don’t buy that four-bed-
room home, with some creative accommodations you can still use your two-
bedroom condo to its fullest potential when guests come over!
Time to level: One story 
versus multiple stories
If you want to buy a single-family home, you need to consider how many 
stories you want. Single-story and multiple-story homes both have their
advantages. Keep these points in mind while compiling your criteria list 
for your second home:
45
Chapter 3: Considering Your Second-Home Options

 Single-story homes are conveniently designed and very accessible for
those owners and guests who may need special assistance going up and
down flights of stairs, or who just hate climbing stairs.
Retirees, especially, find these homes to be very attractive. Families with
young children may also feel more comfortable in a single-level home,
where mishaps like falling down the stairs are easily avoided. (But keep
that door to the basement closed!) (Check out the next section for
issues to consider between homes with basements and homes with
slabs.) If you have a single-story home in mind, then you should have 
no problem finding a home that fits your budget.
 Multiple-story homes are attractive from the outside and afford
enhanced privacy, especially if the living spaces and some of the 
bedrooms are separated from an upstairs master suite.
Multi-story homes are great fun to own on the water, overlooking golf
courses, and tucked into the sides of ski slopes — pretty much any-
where there’s a view. In these areas, you’ll find high demand for homes
where you can sit or stand on a deck and take in the sights. Expect to
pay more for these single-family homes, which is understandable, con-
sidering their allure.
46
Part I: Seeing a Second Home in Your Future 
Guess what? They come back
Your kids may be “officially” out of the house,
but there’s “officially” and then there’s really
“officially.”
Just because their rooms are empty right now
doesn’t mean you should immediately move into
that cute — but small — studio apartment in
New York City. Know this well, my friends: Just
because the kids have left does not mean they
won’t come back. It could be for a visit, or it
could be (dare I say it) permanent. And this
homecoming is always because of their life cir-
cumstances: They graduated but can’t get a job;
they’re married but have separated; their new
business ain’t makin’ it and they can’t afford to
pay rent. And so forth. I’m sure you can come
up with your own “circumstances.”
So, instead of downsizing your lifestyle to the
point where only you and your spouse can fit in
the new place, consider a second home that
can accommodate another individual or couple
comfortably for a week (or more, if necessary).
This way, when daughter Joan graduates from
college and needs to stay somewhere for the
summer, you won’t get the guilties when she
has to stay at a friend’s house — or in a short-
term rental you know she can’t afford.
The advice is simple: Live for yourself and enjoy
your retirement years in your second home, but
try to always leave a little room for loved ones
who may need you down the road.

Basement or slab? Is one better?
In some areas of the country, you won’t have much of a choice between
homes with basements and homes with slabs. Homes in Florida, for example,
are nearly always built on slabs, while those in the mountains of
Pennsylvania almost assuredly will have basements.
If you do have a choice in the matter, opt for the one that gives you the most
benefits. If you need the extra storage or living space, for example, then a
basement home will work best. But if you’re looking for a low-maintenance
home with plenty of aboveground space, then a slab will do the trick.
Condos: Fun in the Sun (Or Snow) 
without the Yard Work
If you want a low-maintenance lifestyle — where someone else cuts the grass,
cleans the pool, removes the snow, and maybe even pays the water bill — a
condominium just may be your perfect pad.
What exactly is a condo? In a condo, you live wall-to-wall with your neighbors.
You don’t actually own the land under the condo, but rather share it with
other owners. Legally speaking, you own one unit in a multiunit building. 
You and the other condo unit owners jointly own portions of the common
elements, which include the roof, hallways, swimming pool, fitness center,
parking lot, and so on. Put simply, a condo is like owning an apartment rather
than renting it. Condos have their limitations, though. This section discusses
the pros and cons of purchasing a condo as a second home.
The advantages of condo living
Not surprisingly, a large percentage of condo owners are seasonal residents,
especially in vacation areas. Instead of letting their single-family second
homes sit empty most of the year, hoping that the landscaper shows up and
something major doesn’t break, people who choose condos as their second
home can rest a bit easier. They know that their condos (many of which have
controlled access to the grounds) are taken care of under the watchful eye of
their neighbors and property managers.
47
Chapter 3: Considering Your Second-Home Options

A condo may be good choice if you’re
 Only able to get away to your second home a few times a year, for 
short periods.
 Interested in having a pool, tennis court, and fitness center — but 
aren’t interested in maintaining them.
 Not at all interested in managing the upkeep of a second home.
 Unconcerned about the possibility of hearing other people’s comings,
goings, music, and noises.
 Keen on living on a high floor in a stack of condos.
 Enthused at the thought of having neighbors close by with whom you
can socialize and rely on for safety and security reasons.
The low-maintenance and usually more affordable condo lifestyle can serve
as a perfect stepping stone for a second-home buyer who isn’t ready to 
purchase a single-family home.
The drawbacks to condo living
Owning a condo does have its drawbacks, as many owners will tell you. For
starters, you’re going to share at least one wall, probably two, and maybe
even a ceiling and/or a floor, with other residents. Sounds that wouldn’t make
it from one single-family home to another, for example, can carry quite well
from unit to unit in a condo. If your neighbors on the right have a brawl,
you’ll know it. If your neighbors on the left have a particularly powerful
sound system, you’ll hear it. If they’re moving out upstairs, you’ll feel it. 
You get the picture.
Think twice about that condo if you
 Don’t like the idea of using an elevator to get to your home.
 Have a green thumb and/or love having a backyard to hang out in.
 Want your own pool or hot tub.
 Desire a large amount of square footage and the ability to expand the
home’s size in the future.
 Want to barbecue on your own deck, lanai, or patio. Some condos have
strict rules on this issue. (See the section, “For the good of all: Rules for
condo owners,” in this chapter for more on condo rules and regulations.)
48
Part I: Seeing a Second Home in Your Future 

 Don’t want to pay for community-wide repairs and upgrades through
unexpected assessments. (See the next section for more info on fees.)
 Plan to resell your condo in the near future. (Condos can take longer to
sell than single-family homes.)
 Are the upgrading type and like to modify your home. Commonly, condo
bylaws restrict what you can and can’t do to your unit. Adding a bath-
room, removing or shortening a wall, or doing anything else that may
affect the building’s structural integrity is usually prohibited. (You can
bring proposed modification before the condo association board, of
course, but if an architect’s evaluation is required before they’ll approve
a remodeling, you’ll be the one paying the architect’s bill.)
Pay up: Condo fees and taxes
As a condo owner, you must pay monthly or quarterly condo fees that cover
the cost of general repairs and routine maintenance expenses for the com-
plex’s common areas. The money collected from each owner goes into a fund
and is used to pay the monthly bills and to build a reserve for other uses,
including immediate and emergency repairs, and capital improvements, like
painting, parking lot resurfacing, and roof repairs. Fees vary widely from 
complex to complex depending on each development’s situation, so be sure
to talk to the current owner or your real estate agent about exactly what you
will be expected to pay each month.
So condo fees are a double-edged sword. On one hand, your lawn mainte-
nance, snow removal, and sometimes even your cable bill is taken care of. On
the other hand, condo owners incur a fixed cost that stays in place until they
sell their unit. It’s convenience versus control: Things are taken care of, but
you have no real control over the costs.
A board of directors, which you as a condo owner elect, oversees the fees
and spending. Condo owners also pay property taxes on their individual
units, and the municipality’s tax collector assesses their unit individually.
(See Chapter 14 for more on property taxes.)
Condo fees are “must pay” obligations. Legally, they carry the weight of a
mortgage payment or a tax bill, and a condo association can, in most states,
foreclose on a unit owner who is six months or more in arrears on his condo
fees. And some condo bylaws allow only three months of nonpayment before
foreclosure kicks in.
49
Chapter 3: Considering Your Second-Home Options

For the good of all: Rules for condo owners
Because condo units are so close to one another, owners must follow rules
and regulations that make for peaceful cohabitation. You receive a copy of
these rules (known as the bylaws) before you close on your condo so you can
review them. You must follow them or risk getting warnings, fines, and other
ugly stuff in your mailbox if you don’t. (Not to mention you’ll tick off your
neighbors.) So although you have to obey some rules, you and your neigh-
bors benefit from regulations that are meant to keep any one owner from
interfering with another owner’s peaceful enjoyment of his home. And, in a
sense, condo bylaws are a comfort. How? No single owner is alone. An owner
can always go to the board with problems and questions. And the board
always has access to professionals like lawyers, accountants, and inspectors
if they’re needed.
Some of the most common condo rules include
 Abiding by the hours of operation for certain community amenities.
Pools may be open from 9 a.m. to 9 p.m., for instance, which means 
midnight skinny dips are not only not encouraged, but forbidden (no
matter how much fun they are!).
 Restricting barbecues and other fire-related activities to community
areas where common equipment is sometimes provided for your use.
(You may want to bring some grill cleaner with you!)
50
Part I: Seeing a Second Home in Your Future 
What happens when major work is needed?
When you own a condo, you share the owner-
ship of the land with the other condo owners. So
what happens if the property needs a new con-
crete sidewalk, tile roof, or parking lot resurfac-
ing that isn’t covered by the reserve fund? Or
what if the board decides not to drain the
reserve fund for one capital project? Guess
what? You and the other condo owners will be
assessed for the costs. The project’s total cost
is divided equally between the condo owners. If
the condo building needs a new roof that will
cost $50,000, for example, and if there are 100
owners, then each owner will have to pay $500
on top of any other regular fees that are due.
To ease the financial strain, condo owners often
are allowed to make monthly payments toward
the assessment. If an individual owner’s share
is $500, the board can decide to allow six
months to collect the money, which would only
add $85 or so to your monthly condo fee. This is
possible, though, only if the reserve fund is ade-
quate to pay the repair bill in a timely fashion, or
if the contractor gives the association extended
payment terms.
All interior repairs and upgrades are the condo
owner’s responsibility and aren’t covered by the
condo association fees.

 Keeping the noise level down during quiet times, which is commonly
defined as the hours between midnight and 8 a.m. This ensures that
your party-gal neighbor doesn’t blast heavy metal through the hallways
at 2 a.m. after a night of clubbing.
 Not renting out your condo to a third party for less than a specific
period of time. This can range from one week to as much as six months,
depending on the bylaws.
 Making sure that all renters abide by the condo bylaws. You, the owner,
are responsible for assuring that they do.
 Maintaining a specified speed limit in the parking lot and driving areas.
Also, the number of vehicles a unit owner may have on the grounds is
often spelled out in the bylaws.
The list goes on, and many of the bylaws are just basic common sense. 
If, however, you have a problem with one more of the rules, you may want 
to reconsider your choice of location. Condo bylaws are determined and
enforced by the board and can be difficult to change unless you have a high
percentage of residents in your corner, ready to fight for the cause. And the
odds are against that, because condo bylaws are designed for the good of
everyone, and a single unit owner who wants something changed for his 
benefit is likely to get a chilly response from the neighbors.
Townhouses: Your Own Home and Land
(Really) Close to Neighbors
If you want a little grass around your new place, but aren’t interested in a
single-family home, then you should consider a townhouse for your second
home. This section covers the legal and physical characteristics of town-
houses and discusses some of the issues associated with this property.
What exactly is a townhouse?
A townhouse is one of a series of single- or multi-story units attached to one
another by common walls. Yes, townhouses look a lot like condominiums.
Some townhouse communities, on the other hand, are designed to look like
single-family homes. These types feature just two or three units in their own
building. Other types of townhouse complexes consist of many units that are
linked in a long row. A townhouse can be a great choice for the second-home
buyer who isn’t interested in a condo, but who doesn’t want the responsibil-
ity of owning a single-family home.
51
Chapter 3: Considering Your Second-Home Options

Townhouses differ from condos and mimic single-family homes in their own-
ership structure. Townhouse owners hold title to their individual units plus
the land that lies beneath them. Unlike condos, townhouses can’t be stacked
on top of one another, so you’ll never have anyone living above or below you.
Townhouse owners pay property taxes on their individual units, which are
managed by a property or homeowners’ association that collects monthly or
quarterly fees used to maintain the common areas (such as the grass, pools,
and fitness centers). In this way — and in the fact that maintenance fees
cover exterior maintenance and major repairs — townhouses are similar to
condominium complexes. And like owning a condo, you definitely have to
pay a plumber if your toilet clogs, but you don’t have to pay a roofer if you
end up with a leak in the master bedroom.
Owning a townhouse: Issues 
and benefits to consider
As do all things in life, townhouses come with their own pros and cons. Many
of the same downsides to condo ownership (refer to the section, “The draw-
backs to condo living,” earlier in this chapter) apply to townhouses. Unlike
condos, townhouses typically have small backyard retreats and other outside
spaces where you can entertain and relax. These features make townhouses
especially attractive for second-home buyers who are looking for the com-
forts of home without the responsibility of owning a detached dwelling.
Like condos, townhouses generally have less interior space than single-family
homes. Note: The “bigger and bigger homes” trend is changing this notion
because more townhouses are now being built in the 2,000- to 3,000-square-
foot range. Also, townhouses don’t allow for future expansion. And another
point to remember is that reselling them can take longer than it would to sell
a single-family home, because certain buyers steer clear of such options.
Mobile Homes: More Than a Trailer
If having an affordable, low-maintenance second home is at the top of your
shopping list, you may want to consider a mobile home. A mobile home has
no permanent foundations and can be moved from one mobile home park to
another. They’ve come a long way from the days when the world knew them
as nothing but boxy, single-wide trailers traversing the nation’s highways.
Today, the newer versions of mobile homes are fully updated and built from
top-quality materials. Many models include the latest amenities like floor-to-
ceiling windows and screened-in porches.
52
Part I: Seeing a Second Home in Your Future 

Today’s mobile homes are also wider than their predecessors, and many are
undeniably attractive inside and out. As has been the case for homes without
wheels, aluminum siding has given way to more attractive vinyl siding for
mobile homes, and some units feature carports and long driveways.
This section points out what’s good and what’s not so good about owning a
mobile home and offers some valuable tips and warnings about purchasing
this style of home.
Where to look: Your main options
If you think a mobile home is your ideal second home, you want to know
where to look, right? This section helps. Most mobile homes are situated in
mobile home parks, where multiple owners use the land in one of two ways:
 They own the land under and around the home outright. This option
is the optimal one: It solidifies the mobile home owner’s place in the
park and in the municipality where the park is located.
 They lease land from the park’s owner. In some areas, leasing a spot in
a mobile home park may be the only option, but you should understand
that it’s not the best option. Why? Because the park owners can raise
lease fees at any time, and the owners may sell the park, which also
often results in higher lease fees. (See the “Potential problems with a
mobile home” section for more details on the downsides.)
If you have your eye on a mobile home in a rural area, then chances are good
that the unit won’t be situated in a park, but on a plot of land. Because you
own the land plus the home, this option provides great flexibility if you’re
considering eventually removing the mobile home to make way for a new
single-family dwelling.
Before buying a mobile home, thoroughly investigate the park where your
mobile home is located by talking both to residents and to the park owner.
(Don’t expect the seller to reveal too much, though.) High land costs have
created a hot market for land used for mobile home parks, and many park
owners are leaving their mobile home lessees high and dry by selling out to
commercial buyers who want to build condos and other structures on the
land. Then what? Check out the area and the scuttlebutt about the possible
changes in the park’s future before committing.
If you’re buying an existing mobile home in Florida, whether in a mobile
home park or not, look for one that was built after 1992, the year of Hurricane
Andrew. That storm inflicted substantial damage on mobile homes in the
southeastern portion of the state, and since then, building codes have been
upgraded to reflect the need for more-robust mobile home construction.
53
Chapter 3: Considering Your Second-Home Options

Pros of owning a mobile home
When you first think of a mobile home, images of small, dingy trailers along a
county road or in an overcrowded trailer park with loud kids running around
may pop into your mind. However, in the right setting, mobile homes can make
the perfect vacation or seasonal getaway and can be a good choice for the right
buyer. Owning a mobile home does have three significant advantages:
 Lower cost: Mobile homes cost less and have lower property taxes and
insurance rates.
 Convenience: They’re always one story, which is great for people with
mobility issues.
 Total control: As the name implies, you can move your mobile home to
another location. If you tire of visiting California and decide you’d rather
have a second home in Las Vegas, you can find a mobile home park or
piece of land in Sin City, secure your home and its contents, and find a
mover to transport house and all to your new address.
Potential problems with a mobile home
As affordable and convenient as they are, mobile homes come with their
share of challenges and, yes, drawbacks. Here are a few to consider:
 Structural integrity: The structural integrity isn’t equal to that of a
single-family or attached home, although newer mobile homes are said
to last longer and withstand the elements much better than their prede-
cessors. However, if the mobile home is located in a hurricane-prone
area, you’ll be the first to evacuate, and you may not have much to come
home to after the storm has passed.
 Expensive to move: Moving a mobile home to a new park or location
isn’t cheap.
 Different interest rates: Because mobile homes are classified as personal
and not real property, they are often financed by using loans with interest
rates that are higher than mortgage interest rates.
 Quick loss in value: A mobile home can lose a significant portion of its
value within just a few years of being built, making long-term loans bur-
densome on owners who can’t recoup their investment.
 Stricter local zoning regulations: Certain cities and counties may pro-
hibit mobile homes within their jurisdiction, thus leading owners to put
their homes in inferior or undesirable locations.
 More difficult to sell: Selling a mobile home may take time because the
number of buyers looking to purchase this style of home may be limited.

Buying Land and Building a New Home
Building a home from scratch is generally considered to be the most expen-
sive, time-intensive, and, some say, frustrating way to buy a second home.
You acquire the undeveloped land (with or without sewers, gas, electricity,
and such), potentially hire an architect, and build the house from scratch.
In this section, I walk you through the basics of this time-honored American
tradition, discuss buying a prefabricated home, and help you understand
what really goes into building a second home from the ground up. (Sorry. I
meant from below the ground up, because you’ll also have to take care of
pouring a foundation!) If you’re really serious about building your own home
after reading this section, check out Building Your Own Home For Dummies by
Kevin Daum, Janice Brewster, and Peter Economy (Wiley).
Going the contractor route
If money is no object and a new, custom-designed home is what you
absolutely must have, then a new second home built on a piece of purchased
land is the way to go. After selecting your location (for more about finding
the right location, see Chapter 4), you’ll then scout around for the best new-
home builder you can find — the contractor who will help you bring your
dream to fruition.
Finding a reputable contractor
Before you break ground on that new home, you’ll want to put some time into
finding the right company to handle the job. Here are a few ways to find a
contractor:
 Ask for referrals from family, friends, colleagues, and business associates
who have had personal experiences with specific builders in the area.
 Check out your local newspapers and business journals for published
feedback on the company and its performance.
 Call the local Better Business Bureau and ask if any complaints have
been filed against the particular builder.
 Drive around and look at homes that the contractor has already built.
 Talk to homeowners who have recently worked with the builder. 
The builder should be able to supply you with a list of referrals you 
can contact.
55
Chapter 3: Considering Your Second-Home Options

Asking the right questions
After you develop a short list of potential contractors, take the time to inter-
view each one extensively. By asking the contractors the following types of
questions, you can find out a lot about their experience and which one is
right for you.
 How many houses have you built? The more the merrier. The contrac-
tor who has successfully built dozens of houses is a wiser pick than
someone just starting out.
 How many years have you been building homes? Experience counts.
So you can truly feel a level of confidence if the contractor you’re con-
sidering tells you he just celebrated his 25th year in the business.
 How realistic are your time estimates? This one may be a toughie in
terms of getting a straight answer, but it’s worth asking anyway. If the
contractor tells you his track record is excellent and that he more often
completes jobs on time rather than late, then seriously consider him.
After you choose: Working with and negotiating
After you decide which contractor to use, you’ll likely have several phone
and in-person meetings with him (and possibly members of the contractor’s
team) during which you’ll discuss floor plans (stock, customized, or hybrids
of the two), timetables, the construction process, and what specific amenities
and features are — and aren’t — included in the price.
With the homebuilding industry coming off a multiyear boom, now is the time
to negotiate hard for the extra features and amenities that you want in your
new home. If you want a specific upgrade (such as granite countertops rather
than laminate), don’t be afraid to ask. If you do have to pay for them, haggle
with the builder until you get to a price that you’re comfortable paying. Get
these negotiations taken care of upfront, not after the home is built.
When actually negotiating, my best advice is to do your homework and try 
to get a sense of what the feature you want generally costs. This exercise is
worthwhile. Prices can be all over the place. A friend of mine once needed a
foundation crack sealed and was quoted prices ranging from $50 to $600. Sure,
that’s for a repair, but the principle is the same and applies to new builds:
materials and labor. So ask around, go online, and then throw out a figure 
you feel is fair and reasonable and make it clear that you won’t pay higher.
Putting up a prefab
You can considerably trim the cost of putting up a new second home by
going prefab, a nifty abbreviation that stands for prefabricated home. The
pieces for these homes are built at a factory. Then the pieces, called panels
or modules (which is why these homes often are referred to as modular
56
Part I: Seeing a Second Home in Your Future 

homes), are delivered to your property where they’re assembled to form your
home. Prefab homes are considered single-family homes, but unlike a tradi-
tional home, they require far less onsite construction time because the com-
ponents of the house are premade.
Prefab homes are generally less expensive than traditional single-family
homes, but you get as much bang for your buck. When it comes to the
home’s design, you usually select one of the home designer’s standard avail-
able floor plans, although custom variations are usually also possible. Many
of today’s models have been carefully and beautifully designed by architects
who engineer them in such a way that the typical passerby can’t even tell
that your second home is a modular.
The bottom line? For the second-home buyer who owns land and isn’t inter-
ested in a mobile home or in building from scratch, prefabs can be the perfect
solution. One important caution, though: Be sure to check upfront about the
feasibility of connecting to utilities like water, storm sewers, electrical lines,
and sanitary sewers before you buy the parcel (if you think one day you’ll
probably build on it), or before you visit your prefab dealer so you can answer
these questions when they come up.
Considering costs
Not sure yet if you want to build from scratch or put up a prefab? If cost is an
issue, then prefab may be just the ticket, because these homes generally cost
20 to 30 percent less than custom-built homes. And because time is money,
consider that a prefab home can be ready for move-in up to six months
sooner than a custom-built home.
When erected and maintained properly, prefab homes hold their value and
appreciate at the same rate as the traditionally constructed homes around
them. And if you’re purchasing a home and land together — or if you already
own the land and place the home on it — you should have no problem find-
ing a lender who will offer you a traditional mortgage at the market rate. If
money isn’t your primary concern and you want a lot of custom features,
then building a new house will come much closer to fulfilling your dreams.
Just be sure to get regular updates from your contractor on costs that are
being incurred as those extras are added.
No matter if you choose to build a custom home from scratch or put up a
prefab, you need to be aware of the following costs.
Buying the land
Before you actually start on the house, you need to buy the land. But how
does one buy land? By the parcel. And my advice is to start with a pro. Talk
to a real estate agent and have handy the following info:
57
Chapter 3: Considering Your Second-Home Options

 The cities or towns where you want the lot located
 How much you want to spend
 How big a lot you’re looking for
 What your future plans are for the lot (for example, build and sell what
you build, build and live there, sell later at a profit)
 How “developed” (trees cleared, sewers nearby, for example) the parcel
needs to be
With this info, the agent can scour the Multiple Listing Service (MLS) land
listings and come up with parcels for you to consider. Then when you find
that acre you like, it’s back to basics: financing, building, and everything else
that goes with committing to a second home.
Getting the building fees and permits
After you buy the land and before you can build, your builder needs to secure
the necessary permits and comply with any zoning or building regulations
set forth by your city and/or county. If your builder isn’t handling this aspect
of the process, be sure to check with your local building and zoning depart-
ment for specific requirements and guidelines.
Landscaping your grounds
Plopping a home down in the middle of piece of land just isn’t enough these
days. (Not to mention the danger of structural damage from indiscriminate
plopping. Never a good idea.) Homeowners today strive to create a pleasing
environment outside their homes, and that costs money.
Consider the following issues when landscaping your second home, and
determine how much you really want to spend:
 How often are you going to be there? If you’re not going to be at your
second home at least once a month to mow, weed, and garden, then
select low-maintenance ground cover and trees.
 What do the neighbors have in their yards? Odds are they’ve learned
what works by trial and error, saving you the time. If your second home
will be near other homes, you’ll want to create a landscape that blends
well with and complements the rest of the neighborhood, while still
maintaining a unique look for your own yard.
 What grows well in the area? You don’t want to plant palm trees in
Colorado or gigantic oaks in coastal Florida. Can you grow hibiscus in
Hawaii? Do some research in books or check online to figure out what
species of plants and trees are native to the area and grow well in the
various seasons. (And yes, you can grow hibiscus in Hawaii. It’s the 
state flower!)
58
Part I: Seeing a Second Home in Your Future 

 Do you want to maintain your grounds yourself? For $60 to $200 a
month (depending on the size of your lot and the complexity of the land-
scaping), you can hire a crew to take care of the grounds maintenance
for you. (Check out Chapter 13 for more info.)
Understanding the time investment
When you buy an existing second home, you can usually start using it the 
day of closing, or in some cases, 60 to 90 days after you sign a contract. New
homes don’t work that way. Even prefab homes can take longer than expected
to complete. Custom, onsite homes can be held up for months because of bad
weather, material shortages, and other issues beyond your control.
You should expect a new home that you’re building from scratch to take about
a year or longer to construct. Expect a prefab home to take at least six months
from concept to completion. Be sure to add a few months of cushion into your
own schedule to avoid last-minute stress (and other problems) when the origi-
nal finish date passes and construction continues. Because you’re not buying
a primary home, you may want to put off those furniture purchases and family
gatherings until you know for sure when you’ll have the keys in hand.
Contemplating Other Options If You
Don’t Want to Buy Outright
If, after reading this chapter, you decide not to purchase a second home after
all, that doesn’t mean that you’re completely out of the game. In fact, you’re
in luck because you have several other options available. In this section, you
can find out more about partnerships, timeshares, fractional ownership
opportunities, and rent-before-you-buy options.
Partnership
Also known as co-ownership, a partnership consists of several individuals or
families who purchase a second home together and share the costs and use
of the property. Each of the partners owns a specific percentage of the prop-
erty, and everyone’s names are included on the title and deed as owners. If
the property is financed, they each act as a co-borrower on the mortgage.
Even if your “partner” is a family member, a handshake just won’t cut it. To
protect yourself, use a written, detailed co-ownership agreement that covers
costs, usage rights, and responsibilities — including default and dissolution —
among the various partners.

Chapter 3: Considering Your Second-Home Options

Timeshare
When full ownership of a second home isn’t feasible, a timeshare (or interval
ownership) can be a viable option, especially for those who truly enjoy visit-
ing the same area every year for a set amount of time. When you own a time-
share, you pay for only the time you use it each year, and you become the
exclusive owner of those intervals. You’re the outright owner of the unit, for
which you hold the deed that allows you to rent, sell, exchange, bequeath, 
or give away the weeks just as you can do as the outright owner of a piece 
of property. (If you want more info about timeshares, check out Timeshare
Vacations For Dummies, 1st Edition, by Lisa Ann Schreier [Wiley].)
Some organizations offer timeshare owners the opportunity to trade their
weeks with owners in other locations. The general rule: Select your weeks 
in an area that you want to visit on a regular basis, and expect to use those
weeks each year. If you can swap weeks one year, fine, but you shouldn’t
enter into a timeshare expecting to visit a different place every year.
Timeshares do have their disadvantages. They aren’t always easy to sell.
Their audience of potential buyers is limited by the number of people who
are interested in buying these nontraditional vacation home options. You
need to make sure the place is right for you before you buy. Also remember
that if you’re looking toward retirement, a timeshare won’t fill the bill. You
can’t convert it to a permanent residence, nor buy 100 percent ownership.

Part I: Seeing a Second Home in Your Future 
When you want to cooperate
If New York City’s Broadway plays, Central Park,
and its other cultural attractions (not to mention
its restaurants!) make the Big Apple your favorite
getaway, then you need to know about coopera-
tives or co-ops. Concentrated in New York and a
few other large cities, these properties look like
condos or apartments, but are set up quite dif-
ferently when it comes to legal ownership.
In a cooperative, the title to all associated real
estate is held by a corporation, rather than its
individual shareholders (that is, the property
owners). To buy a co-op, you purchase stock in
that corporation (much like you do when buying
stock in a company) and become a shareholder.
Each shareholder holds a lease to the unit for
the life of the corporation and can sell this inter-
est at any time. The corporation pays the prop-
erty taxes and mortgages, and the shareholders
pay a monthly fee to cover these expenses, plus
the costs required for unit maintenance and
operation. An administrative board elected by
the shareholders is called upon to approve new
co-op shareholders before they can buy into the
complex.
For more about cooperatives, check out the
National Association of Housing Cooperatives’
Web site (www.coophousing.org), which
includes resources for those looking to buy into
a housing co-op.

Inside the United States
Timeshare opportunities are available in most vacation spots nationwide.
Offered at a fraction of the cost of owning outright a second home, time-
shares command annual fees that cover the maintenance and upkeep of the
property’s common areas. The fee also covers some or all of the following:
home and grounds care, taxes, insurance, and utilities.
As to what you’ll pay for a timeshare, prices are really across the board.
When you start looking, you’ll likely find a wide range of prices with, of
course, the most popular spots costing the most. As for finding the perfect
timeshare unit, I heartily recommend hitting the Web first, specifically
www.timesharetravel.com and www.timesharelink.com. These sites
list timeshares available both in and outside the United States and most time-
shares offer three-day/two-night deals during which you can try them on for
size. You’ll stay there, see the presentation, and then you’ll be able to decide.
Outside the United States
If you’ve decided that your second home will be outside the United States,
and you know you plan to visit the area once a year for only a few weeks or a
month, then a timeshare may be just the thing for you. Your first stop should
be the Web, where international timeshare opportunities are listed on the
sites mentioned in the previous section.
Check out the descriptions and photos, and then contact the owners directly
to find out exactly how the sale can be handled from afar. Fax machines and
overnight mail services are efficient tools for getting the paperwork into
everyone’s hands. Also check out the local real estate market and compare
prices among the various properties that are available. (Make sure you check
out Chapter 9 for more info about buying overseas.)
If you own a timeshare in the United States, you can make good use of the
services of a company like Interval International (www.intervalworld.
com). They’ll help you exchange your weeks at locations that are based 
overseas.
Fractional ownership
Fractional ownership offers individuals the opportunity to buy partial owner-
ship of a luxury-type home in a desirable area. The properties are generally
concentrated in coastal areas, on islands, or near ski resorts.
Through this option, the buyer purchases only a fraction of the property
rather than the whole property. Options vary by development and/or prop-
erty. Quarter shares, in which a buyer can use one week out of every month,
61
Chapter 3: Considering Your Second-Home Options

are the most popular choice among buyers, who agree to share the property
with three other purchasers. Under this unique form of strata title ownership
(secure ownership), an owner has a registered title to one-quarter interest in
the condominium, estate, or townhouse.
With fractional ownership, a third party or a homeowners’ association han-
dles property management. One of the biggest attractions for buyers (many
of whom could afford the entire purchase, if they so desired) is the reduced
expense and responsibility of ownership. Some fractional developments also
participate in global vacation exchange clubs, offering buyers the ability to
travel to different properties while maintaining the fractional ownership of
their original home.
The difference between fractional ownership and a timeshare lies in the
prices, the financing, and fees. Timeshares are cheaper. Fractional ownership
costs can run six figures or more. For a look at some fractional ownership
opportunities, check out www.partialowner.com.
Rent before you buy
If you have your eye on a specific unit and/or location, and if the seller isn’t
in a hurry to sell the property, then you can look into renting the place before
you buy it outright. This is a good way to test-drive the home, townhouse, or
condo and determine if it’s in the right location, is the right size, and, ulti-
mately, is the right choice for you and your family.
LLC ownership
LLC ownership stands for limited liability corporation. It’s not necessary for
every second-home owner, because most don’t have partners as co-owners,
but just in case you do have partners and have real estate investing on your
mind, I include this short section. Basically, if you buy a second home with a
partner or partners, and you rent it out for profit, you can form an LLC if you
want to reduce your individual liability. With an LLC, you gain the advantage
of being a corporate entity — a business situation in which shareholder liabil-
ity is reduced or eliminated.
If you have more than one partner, and you want this added layer of protec-
tion, talk to an accountant and real estate lawyer about setting up an LLC for
the “business” of your second home. (If you want more information about
LLC ownership, check out Real Estate Investing For Dummies by Eric Tyson
and Robert S. Griswold [Wiley].)

Chapter 4
A Second Home Is 
All about Location
In This Chapter
 Deciding where you want to spend your retirement
 Choosing the best location for your second home
 Evaluating the community
You’ve probably heard the saying “Location, location, location.” It origi-
nated sometime in the 1950s when a Midwestern real estate columnist
wrote that the three most important features of a home are first, its location;
second, its location; and third, its location. Although it has become something
of cliché these days, the adage’s validity is still solid. And the truth of it doesn’t
change just because you’re buying a second home rather than a primary
dwelling. The fact is, the right location combined with the right amenities 
and a few added niceties can make up for any compromises that you may 
have to make when it comes to home size, interior features, and/or price.
The avid reader who purchases a condo on the beach will love strolling out
onto the sand a few times a year with a book under one arm and an umbrella
under the other. She will be thrilled time after time with her second-home
choice — even though the condo is situated two floors higher than she would
have originally liked it to be. And the family of five that loves to ski together
won’t mind the somewhat cramped quarters of their mountain bungalow
after a long, thrilling day on the slopes.
In this chapter, I walk you through the basics of finding the right location for
your second home. (In Chapter 3, I talk about finding the right second home.)
This chapter helps you review your main options and drills down to some of
the finer points about a community that you should keep in mind when you
make your final decision.

Asking Yourself Where 
You Want to Retire
Admit it: For some of you, retirement is the farthest thing from your mind
right now, right? You’re busy with work and kids and just the general crazi-
ness of life. (Not to mention keeping up with all those shows and movies you
TiVo’ed!) For you, your second home is for vacations, and maybe some rental
income.
But even if you are 15 or more years away from retiring, this doesn’t mean
you shouldn’t at least factor your golden years into the equation when select-
ing a location for your second home. That means choosing somewhere that
you actually like and where you can see yourself living on a full-time basis at
some point. Because one day, you might.
Those of you who are within a few years (or months) of retiring should check
out Chapter 15, where I discuss in further detail how to move into a second
home for retirement.
Three factors are usually involved when purchasing a second home:
 Your ability to use this home as a vacation getaway for the next few
years or even decades
 The opportunity (if so desired, and allowed by the community rules) to
rent the unit out to others when you’re not using it
 The idea that, upon retirement, you’ll move into your second home and
live there full time
If you haven’t considered the possibility of your second home eventually
being your retirement nesting place, you should. If, however, you have already
decided that you will retire to your second home, you want to choose a loca-
tion that fits your idealized future lifestyle — a place that’s all that you want it
to be as both a long-term investment and a place where you want to live.
Because many of you certainly do plan on using your second home one day 
as your retirement refuge, I start this chapter with a look at where you want to
retire so you know where to begin scouting for your second home. If you don’t
plan on retiring in your second home, feel free to skip this section. However, 
if there is the slightest possibility that you will retire to your second home,
check out this important info that can help you select the right location.
64
Part I: Seeing a Second Home in Your Future 

Choosing a location that 
fits your future lifestyle
The fact that your second home will at some point become your primary
dwelling can make a big difference when it comes to choosing a location.
Whatever your preferences, the key is to find an abode that will not only
accommodate you now, but will also be a place you’ll later be happy to call
home on a full-time basis.
If you’re not convinced of this, try taking this short quiz. Feel free to write in
this book:
1. What is your current age?
______________________
2. What is your expected retirement age?
______________________
3. In how many years do you expect to retire?
______________________
4. List the top five or so vacation activities that you enjoy right now:
__________________________________________________________________
5. Picture yourself X number of years down the road and think about
whether your favorite activities will likely change.
Be realistic. Do you now enjoy strenuous activities such as hiking, moun-
tain climbing, surfing, long-distance running, or vigorous competitive
outdoor sports? Can you see yourself continuing these activities in 10
years? 15 years? 20 years? The tolls of time and aging may steer you to
less strenuous sports such as golf, swimming, fishing, or nature walks.
Jot down a few activities that you would like to be doing in your retire-
ment years, and compare them to the favorites you listed in No. 4.
__________________________________________________________________
If you plan on retiring in five years or less, then the types of activities and
amusements that fill your vacation days now may very well be perfect for
your golden years. If, however, retirement is ten or more years away, put your
thinking cap on and come up with a practical, down-to-earth picture of what
you expect you’ll be doing, and where you want to do it, when you retire.
After you develop a realistic picture of your retirement lifestyle, consider
those elements when you embark on your second-home search. If, for exam-
ple, you’ve always wanted to be able to play tennis like a pro, then select a
home that’s in a community that has tennis courts, or that’s situated near
city or country club courts. If fishing is your passion, then find a home within
a few miles of a lake or ocean where you can spend your days happily casting
that reel.
65
Chapter 4: A Second Home Is All about Location

Avoiding places that sound good on paper,
but may not be a good match
When searching for your second home, especially if you’re looking in a loca-
tion far from where you currently live, you may rely heavily on real estate
ads, brochures, and the Internet.
However, don’t fall prey to the gorgeous brochures, expensive Web site mar-
keting, and the sleek ads. Even though the Web and mail are great ways to get
your hands on information about a specific area, neighborhood, or even a
particular unit, you need to use your own two eyes (or at least the eyes of a
trusted family member or friend) to check out the place firsthand before you
buy. When all else fails, use the following logic: If it sounds too good to be
true, it probably is. To avoid any problems in this area, take a short vacation
to the prospective areas (after you’ve narrowed your location choices) to
visit the homes you found on the Internet or the one your in-laws are “just
positive” you’ll love. You’ll thank yourself later.
Real estate ads can be very enticing, right? They have pretty pictures and
often seem to promise every amenity possible. Chamber of commerce and
relocation bureau advertisements can be equally alluring, and understand-
ably so, considering that these organizations spend oodles of dollars to
attract visitors and residents and pump up their regions’ tax bases.
Furthermore, developers’ brochures often feature the homes themselves, but
leave out pictures of or details about the surrounding area. With land prices
in vacation spots soaring, homes are being built on odd pieces of property
that may or may not ultimately be favorable to vacationers (or to the miser-
able homeowner who will have to look out his windows day in and day out at
a not-so-pretty picture). A unit may look great inside and out, yet the area on
the other side of the gate or out the back door may not be as attractive.
Where to Look for Your Second Home
Finding the perfect place for a weekend getaway, a monthly retreat, or an
annual family vacation may be a cinch for some, but a challenge for others. If
you already have a place that you love and visit regularly, then your selection
process for finding your dream second home may not be too difficult.
But if you like a number of locations and really can’t narrow them down to
one place, or if you’re a bit indecisive, maybe you can use some help. This
section provides some great advice on how to check out your main options,
boil them down, and come up with one that meets your needs.
66
Part I: Seeing a Second Home in Your Future 

Surveying your main options
You can buy a second home near a lake. You can buy one on the slopes of
your favorite ski resort. You can buy one in a different country. You can buy
one on an island. You can also buy one just down the street from your pri-
mary home. (Okay, I know you may not want to do that one, but it’s still an
option.) The world is your oyster, and that can make the selection process
fun, exciting, and, yes, more confusing and difficult.
If you’re hung up on where to buy, try whittling down your choices by cross-
ing off those places where you absolutely don’t want to buy. You may be sur-
prised at how short your list is after you’ve wielded your merciless editor’s
pencil! Do as much research as possible, using online and real-life resources
on your top locations. Other homeowners, visitors’ centers, and real estate
agents can be great sources for details on the local market conditions and
availability of homes.
You can also talk to people about the day-to-day issues that come with living
in the area. You might ask residents about traffic congestion issues, grocery
store lines, how quickly potholes are fixed — even how noisy the weekly
trash pickup is! — and other issues. Don’t be afraid to ask a fellow exasper-
ated patron in a local restaurant, “Is this a usual wait time here?” These 
“quality of life” issues can often make or break a place.
When considering your main options and narrowing your list, keep the 
following questions in mind:
 What are you going to use your home for? Is it for family vacations? A
long-term retirement plan? For rental income? Purely for investment? 
A combination of these? (If you’re considering using it as a rental 
property, check out Part III.)
 What type of climate are you most interested in for your second
home? For instance, if you’re a skier, Denver, Colorado, or Lake Tahoe,
California, are your best bets. If you like to sunbathe during your down-
time, then Naples, Florida, or the French Riviera are better choices.
 How far away do you want your second home to be? If you want to avoid
air travel, then pick somewhere that’s far enough away for a vacation, but
close enough to drive to; three to four hours by car is ideal. If you don’t
mind negotiating airports, you automatically expand your options.
 How close do you want your home to be to family and friends? If you
plan a lot of gatherings with those near and dear, then pick an “in the
middle” location that everyone can get to easily. Pick a hideaway if you
don’t want a lot of visitors.
 What types of properties are available? If you’re dead set against 
a townhouse and that’s all that’s available in the area, look some-
where else.
67
Chapter 4: A Second Home Is All about Location

 What is the cost of living? If you’re on a budget, you must consider the
cost of food, taxes, transportation, and other necessities in the area.
 What ages and types of neighbors do you want to be surrounded by?
If you absolutely do not want to be surrounded by neighbors, regardless
of their ages and types, then you should definitely consider a “hide-
away”-type location. Also, if the home is located in a “retirement” area,
and you’re 30 years old, you may not be as happy as you would be in a
neighborhood where most of the homeowners — your new neighbors,
remember — are younger professionals. (Although here’s something to
keep in mind: With all the “50 is the new 30” stuff making the rounds in
our culture, don’t be too quick to dismiss an area simply because you
notice more 50-plus people living there. I personally know people in
their 50s who live in close proximity to singles and couples in their 20s
and 30s, and they are all close friends and really get along well. So
eschew stereotypes and see for yourself.)
 How long are you willing to wait for a home to become available in 
a high-demand area? The real estate market is cyclical, so check into
“days on market” statistics (with a real estate agent) to see exactly how
long the best homes are available for the picking.
After you narrow your list, visit one or more of the areas that you’re inter-
ested in. Eat in the restaurants, shop in the stores, and meet some of the
locals and visitors to get a real flavor for the area before you buy there.
The following sections cover seven second-home locations for your 
consideration.
Near oceans, lakes, and rivers
Mention the word “vacation home” to someone and they’ll likely conjure 
up images of beachfront property with umbrella-lined sundecks. There is
enormous appeal to being near or on the water, and homes built near oceans,
lakes, and rivers rank high in popularity for second-home buyers.
If your idea of a great vacation (and eventually, a fulfilling retirement)
involves fishing on a river, water-skiing on a lake, swimming in the ocean, 
or tanning on golden sands, then you’ll want to focus your home search on
places such as Florida, the Carolinas, California, Hawaii, Mexico, and the
Caribbean, plus other areas where single-family homes, townhouses, and
condos dot the shoreline.
Price can be an obstacle when buying on or near the water, and these areas
are also prone to weather such as hurricanes and extreme heat in the
summer months, so be sure to factor that into your buying decision.
68
Part I: Seeing a Second Home in Your Future 

Mountains
If the mountains are your thing, then check out areas of Tennessee, Georgia,
and the Carolinas as possible second-home locations. The Northeast also
offers its own share of mountain getaways, as do states like Montana and
Colorado. There, you can enjoy the fresh mountain air, along with all the
hiking, horseback riding, skiing, and relaxation that these alpine retreats 
have to offer.
Friends of mine get away to Gatlinburg, Tennessee, every year with their 
families and come back refreshed and revived. They now own a few weeks of
timeshare there, after they rented places for years and eventually discovered
that they could save money by taking the plunge into ownership.
If you’re leaning toward the mountains, keep in mind that homes won’t
always be near the amenities (malls, stores, movie theatres, and cultural
amenities) that you’re accustomed to. Plus, it will almost always take you
longer to get there. (All those long and winding roads, y’know?)
69
Chapter 4: A Second Home Is All about Location
The best of both worlds
What better place than the banks of
Narragansett Bay to own a condominium where
you can vacation for as many or as few weeks
as you want and not have to worry about main-
tenance and upkeep? That’s exactly the logic
that Mitch and Robin Pozez used when they
purchased a condo at a Newport, Rhode Island,
golf course community a few years ago.
Looking for a place to escape Arizona’s summer
heat, the Pozezes had previously vacationed in
California, but they never really felt it was the
place where they wanted to purchase a second
home. During a trip to Cape Cod, Massachusetts,
Mitch wandered into a real estate office and
picked up a brochure for a nearby golf course
community. After noticing the community’s
waterfront location — a key criteria for Robin —
they decided to see it for themselves.
“I drove down there, played the golf course, and
loved it,” says Mitch, who at the time resisted
buying a home that he’d have to close up, leave,
and worry about for nine or ten months out of
the year. Instead, the couple opted for a condo-
style property with three bedrooms, three baths,
and 1,900 square feet of living space.
Their new second home comfortably accommo-
dates the Pozezes and their three children, who
range in age from 17 to 23. The family typically
spends seven to eight weeks at their second
home each summer, during which time they enjoy
golfing, boating, and working out in the fitness
center.
Mitch says he immediately fell in love with the
community’s golf course, which was designed
by British architect Donald Steel. “The more I
play it, the more I like it,” says Mitch, who also
likes having a boat dock and is looking forward
to a new marina that will be built there.
The low-maintenance aspect of condo living
has been especially appealing to the Pozezes
who, for years, have reveled in being able to
close up their unit and know that it will be taken
care of while they’re gone.

Resort and golfing communities
If you’re a golfer, there’s nothing quite like teeing off in your own “backyard” and
playing 18 holes on a course designed especially for your and your neighbors’
use. This appealing lifestyle can be found in golf course and resort communities
nationwide. Packed with amenities such as swimming pools, tennis courts, 
fitness centers, and oftentimes a full social calendar, these environments are
designed for fun, relaxation, and an atmosphere of exclusivity that comes from
being a member of a private community.
Like the waterfront homes, these abodes tend to be more costly than those
that aren’t on the links. They’re also somewhat “microcosmic” in nature
because they’re usually gated, which means your social circle (and activities)
will be somewhat limited to what the community has to offer.
Small towns
America’s small towns can make great vacation getaways if what you have 
in mind is resting, relaxing, and getting away from the daily grind. Sprinkled
with historical sites, antique shops, and people who still enjoy the simple
things in life, such as evening strolls and afternoon tea, these oases of calm
can be found in nearly every state. They are often best discovered in your
own state by simply hopping into a car and driving around for several hours,
getting off the highways, and visiting the small towns the country roads lead
you to.
If that strategy doesn’t work or is too hit-or-miss for you, think back to your
childhood and the places that you and your family visited or drove through
on a weekend afternoon. Was there a farm town nearby where you went on 
a Sunday afternoon to buy fresh vegetables or sample freshly churned ice
cream? How about a small theater that you visited for the occasional play 
or 99-cent movie? Or perhaps you vacationed in a tiny beach town once in a
while or visited a relative who owned a cottage there? You can also pull out 
a U.S. map and find places with fun or famous names to check out, like Gas
City, Indiana, or Rome, Ohio! (Or Hygiene, Colorado, or Santa Claus, Indiana!?
And let’s not forget Frostproof, Florida! Imagine telling your friends your new
address!) Think about it — you may be surprised at what you come up with.
However, you should also realize that the places you loved as a kid may not
be as alluring to you as an adult. Keep that in mind as you make your way
back to those little towns where you grew up.
Cities
If Broadway plays, an active nightlife, and an endless list of cultural attrac-
tions are on your second-home “must have” list, a big city may be your best
choice. You should expect to pay more for a home there than in a smaller
locale, but cities do offer advantages that other areas don’t. For example,
most are within close proximity of international airports, making transporta-
tion to and from your second home that much easier. And the convenience
70
Part I: Seeing a Second Home in Your Future 

factor is unbeatable in a big city, whether it’s restaurants, shopping, or office
space you’re interested in — and many of your destinations could very well
be within walking distance.
If you’re interested in buying an older home that needs a little extra TLC, 
you may find a real gem (and possibly even a bargain) in a big city. Many of
America’s cities are in the midst of an organized, ongoing re-urbanization trend:
Cities are actively trying to lure more residents back within their limits. And it’s
working. The resultant higher demand for city homes, however, has elevated
their sales prices, making them unaffordable for some second-home buyers.
Owning a second home in the city may be especially attractive to country
dwellers in search of more excitement than their hometowns provide. What
might be called the hustle-and-bustle option can also work for someone look-
ing to rent out their second home year-round in anticipation of eventual
retirement. Demand for living quarters in cities is usually high, particularly in
areas with positive job growth, and the second-home owner with an apart-
ment in the middle of or close to lots of action won’t go wanting for renters.
However, cities can be busy, dirty places where unsavory individuals hang
out and where simple things such as parking are a real pain in the butt. Make
sure you’re really in love with the city of your choice before you invest in real
estate there.
College towns
You may think that “college town” and “peaceful retirement” are mutually
exclusive and, in many cases, you’d be right. (Although not every college
town is manic. Some smaller towns like Franklin, Indiana, and its 1,000-
student Franklin College would better be described as “quaint.”) But 
owning a second home in a bustling college town can certainly be a lucrative
endeavor. Parents of college students will often shell out big bucks during the
school year to house their children. They’re eager to get their kids out of the
house and into a semblance of independent living, and in many cases, the
kids love the idea of living in a rented house rather than the dorm. Because
the rent is usually split between several families (depending on the size of the
home, of course), landlords (you!) can command big bucks in college towns
(not all of which are crazy, party-oriented places).
This option may be best for someone who is looking for second-home income
for the majority of the year, but who still wants to use the home during the
summer months — when most of the students have gone home and the resi-
dents happily reclaim their streets, restaurants, and malls.
However, this choice may not be so good for those of you who would rather
archive your college memories after reaching adulthood, and don’t enjoy the
sight (or the sound) of partied-out coeds wandering the streets at 2 a.m. on
Saturday mornings.

Foreign countries
Ready for a Greek villa on the water, a cottage in the Tuscan countryside, or 
a beach house on Grand Cayman? So am I. Regrettably, these options are out
of reach for me and for many others because of cost and distance. But these
spots may be the perfect second-home choice for someone who enjoys over-
seas travel to the same place, and who has the financial resources needed to
pay for and maintain a dwelling overseas.
Being able to get away to another country on a regular basis, experience the
cultural differences, master a new language, and mingle with a more diverse
group of people are just a few of the terrific benefits of owning a second
home overseas. (See Chapter 9 for more details on buying internationally.) 
If you can swing it, you should try it. You may like it.
Going the distance: How far is too 
far away for a second home?
Are you a natural-born driver, flyer, or mass-transit type? Is “traveler” your
middle name? (Mine’s Mary.) If how you get there doesn’t matter to you, then
the distance to your second home probably won’t matter, either. If, however,
you hate to fly, and you detest driving more than two hours to get to your
destination, and you think choo-choos are for basements, then you’ll need 
to carefully consider distance when purchasing your second home.
Here are some key points to consider:
 How much time will you usually have to get to and from your second
home? If you’re working 70 hours a week and only have Saturday and
Sunday to enjoy your getaway, then you’ll want it to be relatively close
by, say within three hours by car — or even closer if you find the
thought of a routine three-hour drive on a Friday night loathsome. On
the other hand, retired or semiretired individuals who have more free
time than they know what to do with can travel across the country — 
or halfway around the world for that matter — because they follow their
own schedules rather than an employer’s. So be sure to factor all this
into your decision on where to buy.
 How often are you going to use the second home? If you’re planning
monthly trips to your new home, and you just know that your budget
won’t withstand buying 48 plane tickets (based on a family of four) a
year, be sure your second home is somewhere within driving distance. 
If you plan to use your home once or twice a year, you can comfortably
opt for somewhere a bit farther away, such as five to eight hours’ driving
or flying time. A long trip a couple of times a year won’t grate on your
nerves or budget, and you’ll have a larger area to choose from.
72
Part I: Seeing a Second Home in Your Future 

 How close do you live to the airport? It can take three hours to park a
car and go through the security lines at an airport these days. Be sure to
factor in this time — plus the time it takes to get to the airport (on both
sides of the trip) — when selecting a location.
 How reliable is your car? Is your primary car more than a few years
old? Do you use it to commute? Realistically, can it handle the additional
several hundred miles to get to and from your second home on a regular
basis? These factors are important if you’re planning on driving to your
second home. What’s that? You have a second car you’ll use to get to
your second home? Great! But keep in mind that the added wear and
tear on an older vehicle may make long, monthly trips a problem. If you
have no plans to buy a newer car in the near future, then you may want
to look at a closer location.
 Who else will be using the home? If you’re the welcoming, “open door”
type and you foresee a crop of family and friends at your vacation house
every month, pick a location that’s central to as many of them as possi-
ble. If it’s just you and your significant other (and Max or Marcy the
dog), you can guiltlessly pick something completely off the beaten path
if that’s what you want.
Ultimately, you want to find a location that is easy to get to but far enough
away that it truly feels like you’ve escaped the day-to-day grind. (It’s a little
more difficult to unwind and recharge when you’re only a few minutes away
from home. “Did I leave the stove on? I’ll run home and check.” “You forgot
your hair dryer? Let me run home and get it.” This scenario is not all that
conducive to relaxation, y’know?) For some, this means a beach house 30
minutes away; for others, it translates into a cottage in the Australian
Outback. It’s your choice.
What to Look for in Your Second 
Home’s Area, Now and Later
We all like to “live in the moment” once in a while, but that’s not the wisest tack
if you’re buying a second home. For a big move like that, you need to consider
both the present and the future before making your decision. By factoring in
things such as the local weather, an area’s cost of living, and the availability of
health-care facilities before you say “I’ll take it,” you have a much better chance
of buying somewhere where you truly want to be now and in the future.
This section takes a more detailed approach to your location search by look-
ing at 13 areas of interest for second-home buyers. In this section, I discuss
everything from the cost of living and the weather, to property taxes and nosy
neighbors. Because financial concerns are a top priority, I begin with cost of
living, and then look at other factors in descending order of importance.
73
Chapter 4: A Second Home Is All about Location

Cost of living
If you plan on retiring in your second home, you must consider the area’s
cost of living. After all, you don’t want to live full time in a place where your
retirement income can’t even cover your basic living expenses. Take Hawaii,
for example. It’s a beautiful place (and I grew up there, incidentally), but even
back in the 1980s a carton of milk and loaf of bread were three times the price
of what you could buy them for on the mainland. So if budget is an issue, you
may want to cross this state off your favorites list.
If you currently live in an expensive locale, like New York City or San Diego,
and are buying in an area with a significantly lower cost of living, like
Fayetteville, North Carolina, to be near your grandkids, for example, consider
the money that you’ll save and factor those savings into your decision.
To check out an area’s cost of living, a number of Web sites offer cost-of-living
calculators that can be used to compare different locales. A great one is
BankRate’s cost-of-living calculator at www.bankrate.com/brm/movecalc.
asp. There, I compared the cost of living in Honolulu versus Tampa, Florida,
and found that even though home prices are about $500,000 higher and
energy bills about $60 more expensive in Hawaii, I can bowl a game in the
Aloha State for about 68 cents cheaper than I can here, and it would cost me
seven bucks less to pay a visit to the vet with the kitty.
You can also talk to real estate agents in your target city to find out more
about the cost of living there, but let’s face it: These professionals’ job is to
sell homes, not spread negative news about their local economies, prices,
and costs of living. Your best source of objective advice are people who live
there, or who have lived there in the past. (Try a “Hi, potential neighbor!”
chat while you’re out looking at homes.) And be sure to check out the afore-
mentioned BankRate Web site for specifics on cost differences between
where you live and where you’re considering moving to.
Good weather
Weather is, for the most part, pretty easy to figure out: January in Fargo, North
Dakota: 10 degrees. January in Miami, Florida: 80 degrees. But there’s much
more than temps to think about when selecting a locale for your second
home. You also need to consider rainfall, fog, snow, floods, humidity, wind,
hurricanes, tornadoes, droughts, brushfires, and other climactic concerns.
What type of climate do you prefer? Would you like something in the middle
like Myrtle Beach, South Carolina, where summers are hot and winters are
bearable? Or are you a “snow bunny” and the colder and blusterier the better?
Your own tolerance for extreme heat or bitter cold will dictate where you
should begin your search on the map. If, for example, getting frostbite on
74
Part I: Seeing a Second Home in Your Future 

your nose while whipping down a ski slope on a snowboard is your idea of
fun, then by all means select a home in the area of the country where the
cold starts to roll in as early as October. If you’re like many of the rest of us,
zero in on somewhere warm.
It’s also important to consider the time of year that you’ll be using the home.
If you want to spend winters in South Florida, for example, then the expected
(bet on it) 90-degree-or-higher days and exquisitely “drippy” humidity of the
summer won’t bother you.
Safety and security
Safety is a critical issue that’s often overlooked when a buyer finds a dwelling
that he absolutely must have. Hailing from out of town and completely enam-
ored with the property, the second-home buyer often jumps into the deal
without ever checking out the area’s crime statistics or talking to other 
residents about things such as break-ins, muggings, and police patrols.
For example, what if it’s widely known locally that a particular resort area has
a high number of break-ins. Or one particular shopping center experiences
lots of purse snatches. Or that there’s a certain neighborhood in a quaint
town where anything left outside vanishes almost immediately. This is the
kind of information you should try to ferret out from locals, real estate
agents, and even the cops. It will help you make the right decision as to
where to buy.
To familiarize yourself with an area’s crime status and safety statistics, check
out the Relocation Crime Lab’s crime indexes for U.S. states online at www.
homefair.com/homefair/calc/crime.html. The U.S. Census also offers
“quick facts” about specific cities on its site at http://quickfacts.census.
gov/qfd. Finally, Sperling’s Best Places also offers crime reports at www.
bestplaces.net/crime. If your area isn’t listed on one of these sites, a call 
to the local police station should produce the information, or at least get you
headed in the right direction. Also, a Google search for your prospective town’s
name will provide you with a slew of info, often including links to local newspa-
pers and other resources that can serve as a window into the area.
Healthcare
With the nation’s population aging and baby boomers retiring in droves,
access to healthcare is becoming a hot-button issue for second-home buyers.
Because illnesses, accidents, and medical emergencies are unpredictable,
you want to make sure that there are a fair number of hospitals, doctors, 
dentists, medical specialists, and clinics in the area where you plan to retire.
75
Chapter 4: A Second Home Is All about Location

To find out what health-care facilities are available in a specific area and what
medical services they offer, talk to a real estate agent in the area, browse
through the local newspaper (many are available online these days) to read
health-related articles, or do your research the old-fashioned way and pick
up the phone book to see what’s out there. Also, the American Hospital
Directory offers a free search on its site (www.ahd.com/freesearch.php3)
for hospitals by city, state, zip code, name, and telephone area code. Search
results provide a list of all hospitals within the criteria with clickable links.
Outdoor activities
Are you and your family outdoorsy people? Do you enjoy taking nature walks,
picnicking by a lake, and swimming all afternoon? If you want to be close to
the outdoor activities that you love, consider the following questions when
looking for a second home:
 Are your favorite outdoor activities available? For example, do you like
swimming and boating? If so, is there safe water access? Do you enjoy
birding and hiking? If so, are there wooded areas nearby?
 Are the activities in quality locations? You want to enjoy your favorite
activities at nice facilities, right? For example, do you want to play at a
golf course with brown greens, or do you want to take your grandkids
swimming at a polluted lake? Of course not. So check out the quality of
the recreational areas if you plan to spend a lot of time there.
 Are the activities close (or too close) to your new home? You need to
consider how long it takes you to drive to and from an activity. For
example, if you have to drive an hour just to play nine holes of golf and
you absolutely can’t live without golf, then is this home right for you? If
golf balls landing in your front yard and bouncing off of your windows
(or, heaven forfend, your noggin) doesn’t sound very appealing, be sure
to select a home that’s far enough away from the links (or other recre-
ational hot spot) so you’ll be left alone.
Active social life
If an active social life is important to you, then you want to buy a home in an
area where homes are clustered together. This kind of proximity often creates
a sense of community and togetherness, virtually guaranteeing that you’ll
form social bonds. Chatting with your neighbors over the back fence is much
less likely in single-family home neighborhoods where houses are on large
lots and are often situated an acre or more apart.
76
Part I: Seeing a Second Home in Your Future 

An active social life also includes having relatively easy access to amenities,
such as good restaurants, entertainment, and shopping. If you’re used to run-
ning out to the store to quickly pick something up, or deciding at the last
minute to go out for dinner, an hour drive to accomplish these things can
rapidly become a drag.
Good restaurants and entertainment
Some people like to cook at home and watch movies on DVD. (You know who
you are. Chinese food and The Devil Wears Prada? I am so there!) Others like
to eat out a lot and go to movie theaters. (And you know who you are.) Most
of us fall somewhere in between: We like to do both, and insist on proximity
to great eateries and entertainment venues. Look around your new environs
and be sure that there are enough of these amenities around to keep you
occupied (and well fed!).
Shopping
I’m convinced that there’s a little shopper in all of us — yes, even those of us
who don’t want to admit it. Look around at the malls, strip centers, down-
town shopping districts, and even the small boutique stores in your prospec-
tive new area. Do they compare with what you’re used to and can they meet
your needs (perhaps, with the help of some Internet shopping as well)? If not,
you may want to consider an alternative location.
If you’re used to and enjoy having these types of amenities nearby, be sure to
pick a second-home location that provides a similar quality and quantity of
places and activities. If, for example, you’re the city type who likes grocery
stores to be a mile or less away, then you’ll want to steer clear of those
attractive, inexpensive cabins in the backwoods.
Active cultural life
If museums, art galleries, plays, and concerts are your passion, then check in
with the convention and visitors’ bureau or chamber of commerce in your
targeted city. They will be happy to offer you a colorful brochure (or point
you to a Web site) that lists all the entertainment, cultural amenities, and
sporting events that a city or town has to offer. They’re proud of their home,
and their literature will usually highlight the most exciting cultural offerings
in the area.
Property tax levels
Every municipality sets it own property tax (or millage) rates. These rates
are used to calculate how much a property owner must shell out annually to
cover the costs of public schools, libraries, and government services. These
77
Chapter 4: A Second Home Is All about Location

rates vary greatly from state to state (and from city to city within the same
state) and are something you should consider before deciding to buy. Your
real estate agent can help you figure out how much you’ll owe in annual taxes
and also clue you in to the rate at which those taxes have increased (or
decreased — hey, it’s possible!) over the last few years.
Many county and city tax assessors’ offices (they levy the taxes) post millage
rates and those for specific properties online. A great site for locating this
information is www.taxsites.com/state.html. Just click on the state
where your prospective home is located, and the link will take you to the
state’s main tax site where you can check out all manner of state tax info.
Note: Some states’ revenue/tax Web sites refer you to the individual town’s
Web site for tax info specific to the town (like millage rates), but starting with
the state’s main tax site makes it very easy for you to get to the site you need.
Zoning
Unless you’re planning on leveling the structure that you’re purchasing and
building another home in its place, zoning issues probably won’t be of much
concern to you as a second-home buyer. If, however, your home is located in
an area where commercial land is located right next door and a large big-box
store is slated to move in, you may want to think about zoning issues. (Zoning
is the process by which municipalities decide what type of real estate devel-
opment goes where within the county and/or city. And zoning can often be
appealed by means of requesting a variance, which allows types of develop-
ment in an area not previously zoned for it.)
The individual owner can’t do a whole lot regarding such zoning issues, but
it’s a good idea to keep an eye out for any activity that can adversely affect
your property’s value and influence your enjoyment of your second home. In
some cases, you and your neighbors may be able to join forces and fight an
unwelcome proposal. If you see something unsavory coming down the pike
(like a massive big-box store eyeing what has long been a pristine forested
area), it may be time to rally the troops to oppose it. Just as residents can
request variances to allow zoning changes, there are also legal means to
protest against such changes.
Covenants
Now for the rules and regulations, often called covenants. Most neighborhoods
and all condos have them, and you have to abide by them if you want to remain
in good standing with the association that created them. The covenants are
handed over to new buyers at the closing table, but can usually be obtained in
advance from your real estate agent and/or the condo or neighborhood board.
78
Part I: Seeing a Second Home in Your Future 

Here are a few covenants you can expect to find in your bylaws:
 Grass and landscaping must be maintained, and grass may be no higher
than (xx) inches at any given time.
 Trash cans can’t be placed on the curb before 5 p.m. on the night before
trash day and must be removed from the curb by 10 p.m. on trash day.
 Property owners cannot add permanent structures (such as decks and
fences) to their units without written approval from the association.
 Pets are limited to (xx) per household.
Sometimes bylaws restrict pet ownership to cats; some contain weight
and height limits for dogs.
 Properties cannot be leased on a short-term basis (the time varies by
community) by any owner, at any time.
This restriction is especially important for owners planning on renting
out their homes to generate income.
If you don’t play by the rules, you can receive a warning or a fine, depending
on the language in the bylaws. If, after reading through the community’s
bylaws, you feel that you won’t be able to abide by one or more of them, 
you may want to cross that neighborhood off your list.
Neighbors
Neighbors are a lot like family: You really can’t pick ’em, and in the end,
you’re stuck with ’em. If you’re only planning on using your second home
once a year, then you probably don’t need to worry much about the neighbor
issue right now. But if you’re going to be there every month — and if the
couple next door lives there year-round — then you’ll almost certainly wind
up forming a relationship with them.
Before you buy, it’s hard to get a handle on who your neighbors are and how
it will be to live close to them. However, sometimes opportunities arise when
you’re shopping for homes.
If your prospective next-door neighbor is watering his lawn when you pull up
with your real estate agent, or his wife is unloading groceries from the car as
you’re touring the grounds, it’s easy as pie to introduce yourself and mention
that you’re considering buying next to them. Most of us can get a pretty good
sense of people whom we meet for the first time. Although this shouldn’t be
the deciding factor, having a warm and friendly chat with someone with
whom you may be sharing a property line can certainly add to the “pluses”
column for a particular property.
79
Chapter 4: A Second Home Is All about Location

Also, an agent may voluntarily offer details on who the people close by are
and what they do. “That house belongs to the Smiths. He’s a chemist, and
she’s a kindergarten teacher.” Or, “Over there are the Browns. They’re retired.
They’ve lived here forever. They both volunteer at the hospital now.”
When you’re a second-home owner, your neighbors serve a key purpose that
goes beyond friendship: They can watch your place when you’re not there.
You don’t want to turn them into property managers, but having neighbors
available during emergencies can be a godsend. You’ll want to swap cell-
phone numbers and home addresses with these folks. Most neighbors are
happy to alert their fellow residents to any problems at their property when
they’re away. Some really close neighbors even swap keys.
Home value and appreciation
Every home has two important numbers associated with it. Home value is the
price that a real estate agent, appraiser, or other authority states that a home
is worth. Home appreciation is the amount of money (usually expressed in a
percentage) that a home increases in value on a year-over-year basis.
80
Part I: Seeing a Second Home in Your Future 
Demographically speaking
Demographics are the common characteristics
of a population in specific areas. Factors cov-
ered include age, sex, family size, level of edu-
cation, occupation, gender, postal code,
location of residence, and income.
These numbers can help you determine
whether you’re looking in the right place for
your second home, and are usually available
through your real estate agent or local chamber
of commerce. You can also find them by typing
words like “demographics” and the name of
your town into a search engine on the Internet.
In doing so, you’ll probably come up with infor-
mation that looks like this:
 Average income for families with children:
$107,208
 Average age: 36.9
 Percent married: 56.1
 Percent with children: 35.6
 Percent high school graduates: 95.6
 Percent college graduates: 66.4
 Average SAT scores: 1077
 Education expenditures per student: $10,726
 Land area: 495.5 square miles
 County population: 873,341
 Population density per square mile: 1,763
 Population growth rate (5 years): 1.5%
 Favorite takeout food: Pizza (Only kidding
about this one!)
This stuff is all great to know when considering
buying in a specific location.

Home values is an area where your real estate agent can really help out,
because home appreciation is one of those hard-to-pin-down, all-over-the-
place concepts. Because agents are in the trenches with home sellers daily
(and those trenches can be kinda dusty, lemme tell ya), they can usually
rattle off home value information off the top of their head, telling you how
this $200,000 home sold in 1999 for just $140,000, and how this $750,000 
penthouse condo hasn’t sold because it’s overpriced.
Your state Board of Realtors may also have reports on its Web site, and 
these reports will often be jampacked with details about specific areas 
where values are going up or down. The Florida Association of Realtors, 
for instance, lists monthly housing reports on its site at http://media.
living.net/releases/archive.htm.
Home appreciation can be a double-edged sword for the second-home buyer:
You want a good deal on the property you’re interested in, but you also want
to see that property increase in value. To strike that balance, seek out areas
where appreciation has remained steady over the past few years, and steer
clear of pockets where property values have risen or fallen wildly, a sure sign
of an uncertain market.
Communities for people older than 55
There’s a place just around the corner from my house where snowbirds make
their annual pilgrimage, descending on the community with glee, eagerly
looking forward to their winter in the Sunshine State. Known as The Top of
the World, the sprawling village is reserved only for buyers who are 55 or
older. Bridge, chess, poker, and shuffleboard bring the joie de vivre to the
community’s residents — those cold-state exiles who merrily spend their
days blissfully oblivious to children or teenagers (and snow and ice).
These communities dot the landscape in many resort and vacation towns and
are particularly appealing to adults who aren’t interested in navigating skate-
boarding teenagers in the parking lot or in getting loaded by the swimming pool.
Because their target buyer falls into a specific age group, these properties cost
less than other second homes, but they can take longer to resell. The narrower
the potential market, the greater the obstacles (or at least, the delays) in selling.
An over-55 community can be particularly attractive for someone looking to
retire to a second home within a few years. But keep in mind that these com-
plexes have set rules for who can own and live in the homes — with a special
emphasis on residents’ ages. If you’re thinking your 30-year-old son may want
to move back in with you after you’re settled into an over-55 community, do
some homework: You may or may not be in violation of the rules if he stakes
a claim in one of your bedrooms. Be sure to read and understand the restric-
tions carefully before moving forward. As always, your individual situation
should influence your decision.

Searching for Your

In this part . . .
A
re you actively searching for a second home but not
quite sure where to look? Are you wondering if you
need the help of a real estate agent? And what happens
after you find the property and are ready to make an offer?
Well, as they say down under, no worries, mate. Just read
the chapters in this part, and you’ll be on your way.
In this important part, I get into the nitty-gritty of finding
your second home, working with reliable professionals,
inspecting the property, securing financing, and purchas-
ing a second home, whether it’s located in the United
States or overseas.

Home: What You Can Do

 Making an offer they can’t refuse
I
f you’ve dreamed of a second home for several years (or even just for 
a few days) and you’ve finally decided that now is the time to take the
plunge, you may be a bit hesitant on where to start the actual search. You
basically have two choices: You can hit the streets in search of your second
home, or you can hire a real estate agent or other professional to help you. 
(If you want to rely on a professional, check out Chapter 6).
However, if you consider finding your second home an adventure, want to
locate your second home on your own, and plan on negotiating and closing
the deal on your own, then what are you waiting for? Your perfect second
home may already be out there, and this chapter provides the necessary
tools and tips you need to make your search (and purchase) successful,
starting with looking for your second home; using resources, such as the
Internet and newspaper, to locate properties; uncovering deals; and finally
negotiating and closing the transaction.
The Do-It-Yourself Approach: Finding
Your Second Home on Your Own
Some people like to do things on their own, while others like a little help. Some
people work best with the support and guidance of a professional or other
knowledgeable individual, and there’s nothing wrong with that. But in this 

section, I address all of you who refuse to ask for directions or hire a plumber
to fix a leaky pipe — the do-it-yourselfer. You know who you are.
Deciding whether to be your 
own real estate agent
I’ve bought homes by using a real estate agent, I’ve purchased for sale by
owner (FSBO) homes on my own (with no agency representation on either
side, except for a transaction broker who handled the paperwork), and I’ve
acquired properties without any agency representation whatsoever, making
good use of the help of the seller’s agent.
In each case, there were pros and cons to my decision. In each aspect of a
real estate transaction, buying a second home compares to buying a primary
home in that your choice of using an agent or not depends largely on your
level of comfort with handling the details of a real estate transaction on your
own. (See Chapter 6 for more in-depth coverage of the types of agents, their
duties, and responsibilities.)
If your second-home purchase looks to be relatively cut and dried with few
challenges or issues to resolve (perhaps you’re buying a home from a friend
or family member and know what you’re getting into with this particular
home), then you may seriously want to consider the do-it-yourself approach.
If, however, you think you’ll have to tackle complex legalities and an exten-
sive negotiation, then you should seriously consider working with a real
estate agent (who is usually paid from the seller’s profits) and an attorney.
(And it never hurts to talk to an accountant, too.)
The pros to being your own agent
Probably the most appealing element of representing yourself is that you’re
the one in charge, so you have total control and all the decision-making
authority. If you feel you’re up to being your own agent, and you have the
time for it, then more power to you.
If you’ve handled real estate transactions by yourself in the past, then buying
a second home on your own is certainly a plausible notion. A huge help in
this endeavor is that most Multiple Listing Services (MLS) are online through
national sites such as Realtor.com and Yahoo! Real Estate, as well as on local
real estate agent sites. Thus, you can access the majority of the information
that an agent would have right from your desktop or laptop.
Doing it yourself also means
 Negotiating on your own
 Determining your own spending thresholds
86
Part II: Searching for Your New Home and Sealing the Deal 

 Dealing with contingencies, such as a mortgage contingency (which
allows a buyer to “get out” of the deal within a certain number of days if
the financing doesn’t come through) or a home inspection contingency
(which allows a buyer the same privileges if an inspection turns up
major problems that the seller isn’t willing to repair)
 Handling the more intricate parts of the transaction, such as setting up
inspections and appraisals
You can also save some money when you represent yourself. See the “How
much you’ll save and is it worth it?” section in this chapter for more informa-
tion about how being your own agent can save you dough.
The cons to being your own agent
When you’re your own agent, you’ll encounter a few downsides. For starters,
if you’re purchasing a second home a fair distance from your own commu-
nity, or you’re buying in a vacation spot that you’re not familiar with, you’ll
lack important market and trend information that the typical real estate agent
can rattle off without hesitation. Without doing some intensive research, you
may not know the following:
 Basic market conditions: This sort of data includes the number of days
it’s taking to sell homes, and how the prices compare to, say, homes sold
one year earlier.
 Current home values: Have they gone up, down, or stayed level over
the past few months?
 The most current property listings available: National Web sites aren’t
always current.
 Communities to consider and those to avoid: Will you know which
neighborhoods are in high demand? How about the one that’s always 
in the news for levying large assessments on its owners?
 Community makeup: After you know which type of property you want
to buy (see Chapter 3), you need to know where those types of homes
are located.
 Sellers’ reactions to offers: If it’s a hot market, for example, some sellers
may be turning down decent offers hoping for higher ones.
Never forget that doing it yourself means you do it yourself. No one else will
set up appointments, shuttle you around to houses, steer you to those list-
ings that meet your criteria, shuffle the paper stack (which is usually, let’s
call it, “abundant”), point you to lenders, and sit next to you at the closing
table. It’s all you.
If, after taking all this into consideration, doing it yourself still sounds like a
good choice, then it’s time to begin your home search.

Chapter 5: In Search of the Perfect Second Home: What You Can Do

How much you’ll save and is it worth it?
There’s no doubt that you’ll save money by being your own agent, particu-
larly if your buyer’s agent commands a fee from your pocket for her services
(many don’t, but some do). In this section, I give you some valuable money-
related information about using an agent versus not using one.
No agent fee
If you decide to search for and buy your second home on your own, you can
save significant money in terms of agent fees. By doing your own legwork,
you don’t have to pay for the services of a buyer’s agent. (Buyer’s agents 
usually represent only the buyer and help her find a home, negotiate the
terms, and get to the closing table on time. They charge for their services 
in addition to receiving a commission check, which customarily comes from
the seller. Check out Chapter 6 for more about buyer’s agents.)
You may not be completely off the hook from some of the agent fees. If you’re
representing yourself and you find a great FSBO (for sale by owner) property
owned by someone who refuses to pay a real estate agent’s commission, then
you won’t have to cover a real estate agent’s fee out of your own pocket. But,
in the event you do use a buyer’s agent and because someone has to pay the
agent for his time, you’ll undoubtedly have to cover his commission (usually
half of the going rate, unless otherwise negotiated in advance) if you pur-
chase the FSBO with an agent’s help.
What’s your time worth?
Ah, time. Benjamin Franklin was right when he said, “Remember: Time is
money.” And time is something none of us ever seem to have enough of these
days. If your time is tight, and you feel like I do about wanting to spend it
wisely, then you may want to reconsider being your own real estate agent.
(You may want to consider using a buyer’s agent to help you.)
For example, say your time is worth $100 per hour, and you include in the
umbrella term of “my time” the time you spend at work, with your family, and
on your own — including sleeping and pursuing leisure activities. All of this
time will be affected (and reduced) by the time you spend searching for a
second home. If it takes you six months at about 10 hours a week to find the
right place, that’s 240 hours, or $24,000, based on your hourly rate.
If that seems like money well “spent” to you, then by all means, forge ahead
on your own. If, however, it makes you think twice about giving up all that
time, then you should reconsider just what a buyer’s agent can do for you.

Tackling the task list
If you have the do-it-yourself gene in you (it’s right next to the “Of course I
know where I’m going” gene), kick off your second-home-buying journey with
this simple to-do list.
 Nail down the details of what you’re looking for in your second home.
You need to know how much you can afford for your second home (see
Chapter 2); the type and size of home you want (see Chapter 3); the fea-
tures that are important to you (see Chapter 3); and where you want to
look for your home (see Chapter 4). If you’re unclear about any of these
specifics, review the appropriate chapter.
 Visit a Web site for a national aggregator and look for homes that 
fit your criteria. Realtor.com (www.realtor.com), HomeGain (www.
homegain.com), HouseHunt.com (www.househunt.com), and Google
Real Estate (www.googlerealestate.com) are good places to start.
Enter as many of your parameters as possible into the search page. (See
“Taking Advantage of Nearby Resources” in this chapter for more infor-
mation on Internet searches.) The results will give you a good feel for
what’s available in the locations you’re interested in, and if your price
range and other parameters are in line with what’s for sale right now.
A virtual tour is a 360-degree Flash or QuickTime tour of one or more
rooms and the exterior areas of a home. Not all listings have them, but
those that do give prospective buyers a detailed look at the property’s
size and floor plan that still photos can’t provide.
 Make an appointment to see the property. After you’ve found a few
properties that interest you, and you’ve checked out their online pic-
tures and information and taken their virtual tours (if available), you can
contact the listing agent — the agent representing the seller and whose
name and contact info accompanies the listing — or the owner (in the
case of a FSBO home) to set up a showing so you can do a walk-through
of the home.
When to Start Looking 
for a Second Home
“For everything there is a season, and a time for every matter under heaven,”
right? There is, in fact, a right time for everything, and that includes second-
home buying. In this section, I help you determine the best possible time to
start your new-home search and give you an idea of how long it will take to
find your new place.
89
Chapter 5: In Search of the Perfect Second Home: What You Can Do

Are you ready to start looking?
Of course, it’s ultimately up to you as to when you want to start poring over
MLS listings, talking to real estate agents, and making offers. The following
scenarios may help you decide if now is the time.
Now is probably the right time if
 Your financial house is in order, and you know that you can afford the
additional responsibility of another home.
 You’ve been vacationing in the same place for the last ten years, you
love it there, and you know you’d love to own a home there.
 The housing market in your area of interest has either leveled off or 
is working in favor of the buyer with lower housing appreciation and 
a glut of listings on the market.
 You’ve been saving for the last ten years to make the down payment 
and the monthly mortgage payment on a second home.
 You already have a home picked out, you know you can afford it, and 
it’s available.
Now is probably not the right time if
 You’re going through a divorce or some other life-altering event that will
impact your finances over the next 6 to 12 months.
 You enjoy traveling the world and haven’t been able to decide on one
place where you’d like to own a second home.
 You’re just not ready to be a landlord right now — a particularly impor-
tant point for those looking to rent out their second homes while not
using them.
 You plan to retire where you live now, and you don’t need a second
home to move into at some point.
 The housing market in your area of interest is off the charts, with very
few listings, high housing appreciation rates, and sellers who are tough
negotiators who stick to their price.
There are variations on each of these themes, of course, but I’m sure you 
get the overall picture: Make sure that your finances, your wants and 
desires, and the relevant market activity are all in order before you begin
your home search.

Part II: Searching for Your New Home and Sealing the Deal 

How long will it take?
Finding your second home doesn’t happen overnight. In fact, it can take quite a
long time, so if you’re wondering what kind of time commitment you’re in for,
take a deep breath and accept that your patience will likely be tested. In fact,
according to the National Association of Realtors’ most recent second-home
buyer survey, the typical buyer searched seven weeks to find her second home
and looked at six properties along the way. But this is all relative, and ulti-
mately, the time you spend will depend on you and your own situation.
Different situations can affect whether you find your second home after a few
days or after a few months. For example, if your brother is selling his home on
the beach and you want it and are ready to buy it, then the journey from home
search to closing table may be much shorter and only take a few weeks.
If you have no idea where you want to buy your second home, and you are
searching several areas of the country for potential sites, you may spend six
months to a year (or longer) looking for exactly the right second home to
meet your needs.
Taking Advantage of Nearby Resources
When it comes time to find the right second home, you have scads of
resources at your disposal. If you have a computer and Internet access, then
the Web should be your first stop. The local newspaper can also be a great
source of for-sale homes. And of course, never overlook what may be one of
the most effective search tools: word of mouth.
This section helps you begin your search on your own and use the multitude
of free resources that are yours for the taking.
Use the Internet to your advantage
The Internet has changed the home-search process like nothing before. In the
primeval, pre-Internet and Web days, real estate agents compiled and
hoarded thick, bound books of MLS listings and doled out the information in
these tomes to clients very carefully. Today? That information is all over the
Web. The trick is to find what you want to know without becoming utterly
overloaded with useless information.
91
Chapter 5: In Search of the Perfect Second Home: What You Can Do

Surfing for a house: The how-to
The Internet can quickly become a vast, frustrating abyss for the second-
home buyer who is looking for information about specific listings, neighbor-
hoods, and regions. To start your Internet search
 Begin by using authoritative national Web sites (see the “Starting 
with the best sites” section in this chapter) to get a good overview 
of what’s for sale in the areas that you’re interested in.
 Check out informational sites like EscapeHomes.com and
ReloHomeSearch.com for state-by-state information, listings, 
and articles on second-home buying.
If you’re looking for a newly constructed home or one that’s currently being
built, you probably won’t find it on the major MLS sites. A local real estate
agent working in the area can often be a big help, or you may need to contact
the builder directly (perhaps by visiting or calling the sales office) to get
information on pricing and availability. To find a good builder, check with
your local builders’ association, which will provide you with a listing of 
members who are working in the region.
After you know what types of homes are available in your chosen area and 
the features you want in your second home (see Chapters 2, 3, and 4 for more
specifics), follow these steps to search the Internet for your perfect second pad:
1. Enter the number of bedrooms, bathrooms, price range, and so on
into the search fields on the site’s home page.
2. Hit “Search” and check out the homes in the area that meet your
requirements.
3. View any or all still photos, virtual tours, and basic information about
the home to get a feel for it, its surroundings, and its size.
The Internet is a great place to preview homes, but nothing replaces an
actual, in-person showing. Real estate agents aren’t usually photographers,
so if you think a home has a good shot at being “the one,” but you’re turned
off by a poorly taken photo or bad video footage, you may want to consider
seeing it in person before crossing it off your list.
If you do find a house online that interests you, but you want to see more 
of it, call or e-mail the real estate agent who has listed the home to set up 
a showing or to find out what else is available in the area. Often, the agent
may have an inside track on other listings that aren’t yet in the MLS, such as
brand-new construction. If you only want information on a single home —
and if you’re not interested in working with that particular agent — let him
know your intentions. That will save both of you time, because the agent who
thinks he has a “hot one” on the hook will likely continue to follow up with
you repeatedly.

Part II: Searching for Your New Home and Sealing the Deal 

Protecting yourself online
As a potential home buyer, you walk a fine line when it comes to accessing
the information you need and protecting yourself from online fraud. Online
identity theft and fraud are very real problems in today’s technological, infor-
mation-based society. Defined as the act of deliberately assuming another
person’s identity, identity theft is a crime that finds crooks rummaging
through garbage cans (dumpster diving) to find old bank and credit card state-
ments, and hacking into and stealing personal information from computer
databases of organizations that store large quantities of this type of data.
To protect yourself, you can keep in mind these two helpful hints:
 Only deal with companies that you trust. If you’re in the market for a
second home, you may have to give personal information to Web sites
such as online lenders or homeowners’ insurance companies to get
quotes and tap opportunities. Make sure the companies you deal with
are reputable. Check with your local Better Business Bureau to see if
complaints have been lodged against the company.
You can also figure out if a company is trustworthy by googling the
name of the company and add keywords like “complaints,” or “prob-
lems.” The results will often be illuminating.
 Use caution when revealing more than your e-mail address and name
on a Web site. On the Internet, identity theft often begins with an e-mail
scheme known as phishing. Criminals target consumers’ personal iden-
tity data and financial account credentials through spoofed e-mails —
e-mails that look like they’re from a legitimate company or bank and that
lead unknowing users to counterfeit Web sites of “hijacked” brands.
After they’re on the site, victims are tricked into divulging financial data,
including credit card numbers, account user names, passwords, and
Social Security numbers. An unsuspecting person voluntarily gives out
sensitive information to a party that looks like a legitimate firm, such as
a bank or government agency, but which, in fact, is a criminal endeavor
to rob them blind.
If you get an uncomfortable feeling about what’s being asked, go with
your gut and pick up the phone to call the company, instead of just
doling out the information that the Web site requests. If you call a com-
pany you have questions for, you’ll be talking to a legitimate rep from
that firm. Credit card companies, PayPal, eBay, the IRS, and banks do not
e-mail people and ask them to visit their site and confirm their personal
info and login details. Correspondence from these financial entities
comes in the U.S. mail or in a personal phone call.
It’s also a good idea to have a “public” e-mail address that you can use
for Web pages that ask for one — an address that can always be deleted
without affecting your normal correspondences if you start getting
blasted with spam and phony phishing e-mails at that address.
93
Chapter 5: In Search of the Perfect Second Home: What You Can Do

Starting with the best sites
Many Web sites offer real estate information, but not all of them are rep-
utable, current, or regularly updated. But fear not. Over the past few years,
several sources have established themselves as good places to go online to
find a second home.
Here are a few I personally recommend and that you’ll want to check out:
 The Real Estate Book, www.livingchoices.com: This is the online
version of those little, full-color magazines that you find in racks on
street corners and in grocery stores.
 Realtor.com, www.realtor.com: The granddaddy of all real estate
sites, the bulk of the nation’s MLSs post their listings here.
 Coldwell Banker, www.coldwellbanker.com: This large real estate
franchise offers a simple property search online.
 HomeGain, www.homegain.com: You can find listings for existing
homes, foreclosures, and new construction on this site.
 Private Islands, www.privateislandsonline.com: Okay, I had to
include this one, in the event that price is no object (congrats!) and
you’ve always wanted a second home on your own island.
For homes that owners are selling themselves, try:
 Help U Sell, www.helpusell.com
 Assist 2 Sell, www.assist2sell.com
 For Sale By Owner, www.forsalebyowner.com
Here are some other popular sites to check out:
 Foreclosurenet.net, www.foreclosurenet.net: This site lists (for a
fee) foreclosed properties. (Foreclosed properties are those that owners
have stopped paying for, and that lenders have taken back and are sell-
ing via foreclosure.) For more about them, see the “Keep an eye out for
second-home deals” section later in this chapter.
 HUD Homes & Communities, www.hud.gov: This U.S. Housing and
Urban Development Web site offers a free search of all properties HUD
has foreclosed on and is selling. Click on “HUD Homes” on the left-hand
rail, and then click on the state where you’re looking for your second
home. You can search by zip code or price, and the site provides details
on all properties offered, including location.
 EscapeHomes, www.escapehomes.com: You can search this site by
location, interest (in wine country, along the beach, near golf courses),
or by property type.
94
Part II: Searching for Your New Home and Sealing the Deal 

 Vacation Rentals By Owner, www.vrbo.com: Before you plunk down
thousands of dollars for a second home in an area you’re not very famil-
iar with, check out this site that lists rental units. You can visit the area
first to see whether it suits you. This site can also help you figure out
how much rent to charge if you plan on renting your second home when
you’re not using it.
Read the newspaper (Not the funnies)
In days of yore, the only way people knew a home was on the selling block
was through the newspaper. Sometimes yard signs and word of mouth spread
the news, but the local paper’s classifieds section was the only surefire place
to find out what was for sale. The Internet has definitely stolen some of the
old black-and-white’s glory, but real estate agents and owners continue to list
their properties for sale in the paper, particularly on Sundays.
Starting with the Sunday extravaganza
The Sunday paper is thick for a good reason: It’s jampacked with ads. One
thing you can be sure of finding in the Sunday paper is a plentiful supply of
full-page, color ads placed by real estate agents and offices proudly display-
ing their latest listings, as well as a slew of smaller ads from agents and
owners in the plain ol’ classified columns.
To make your life even easier, many larger newspapers in the United States
place their classified ads online. So even if you’re considering buying a home
outside your geographical region, you can always search that city’s newspa-
per’s classifieds on the Web. If the newspaper that serves your desired loca-
tion doesn’t place its real estate classifieds online, you’ll want to subscribe to
that paper. Remember, however, it may take a few days for the paper to land
in your mailbox, and any hot listings may be sold by the time you get the
paper and pore through it.
In the Sunday paper, you’ll also find listings of open houses, many of which
will likely be happening on the very weekend that you’re reading through 
the ads. Open houses are a great way to get out and look at homes without
having to deal with any high-pressure sales tactics that a listing agent may
try on you when you’re dealing with them one on one.
If you do come across a for-sale ad that strikes your fancy, be sure to act fast.
You can probably get your hands on more information about the property on
the Internet. Many ads include Web addresses for the agent’s office and/or the
individual property, as well as phone numbers that will provide info via an
automated system. Don’t waste any time. You can bet dollars to donuts that
you’re not the only one poring over the real estate ads on a Sunday morning.
95
Chapter 5: In Search of the Perfect Second Home: What You Can Do

Monitoring the classifieds
Don’t assume that one stroll through the Sunday paper will hand you the
second home of your dreams on a silver platter. It takes seven weeks, on
average, for buyers to find a second home, which means that you’ll need 
at least that many go-rounds (if not more) with the classified section. In 
addition to the Sunday paper, you can also check out the daily classifieds 
in case a new listing pops up.
Put time into your second-home search, and combine your newspaper
perusals with Internet searches and yard sign spotting (see next section 
for more information on lawn signs) for the best results.
Take a road trip
When you’re looking for a second home and the area where you’re buying is
within driving distance, there is simply no substitute for hitting the road and
looking around for both existing and new properties. You can discover a lot
about available real estate simply by taking an afternoon drive. Look for open
house signs, and use these events to take quick tours of homes that you might
be interested in. You may also find FSBO properties on your wanderings.
Hit the road, drive around a little, and check out what’s sticking up out of
people’s lawns. Many signs offer detailed information sheets on the home, as
well as flyers that list prices and even comparable properties that are avail-
able in the area. Some signs provide phone numbers you can call to obtain
automated information (known as talking houses), and all will include the
agent or owner’s contact information.
Keep a pen, paper, and cellphone handy at all times during these jaunts, and
be prepared to jot down the info from the sign. Grab any info sheets housed
in those plastic tubes or boxes hanging from the sign, read them thoroughly,
and then, if you like what you see, make the necessary calls to the owner or
agent to set up a showing.
No matter how great that two-story beach house looks, don’t approach the
owner directly about a showing (unless, of course, he’s selling it on his own).
Most sellers list their properties with agents for a reason, and that’s because
the agent acts as a buffer and handles all the contacts, showings, and negotia-
tions for the property.
Some developments restrict or outright prohibit the use of “for sale” signs by
property owners. If you’re very interested in a specific complex or neighbor-
hood, you’ll almost certainly do better using an MLS search (versus driving
around looking for yard signs) to determine what’s on the market.
96
Part II: Searching for Your New Home and Sealing the Deal 

Rely on the MLS
The Multiple Listing Service (MLS) is to real estate what the Kelly Blue Book
is to cars: a gold standard for the industry and a source that everyone in the
business has used and relied on for decades. The definitive resource for
many different types of home listings, MLSs serve a purpose by aggregating
all the listing data in one place where buyers can efficiently browse through
their second-home choices.
Defining an MLS
An MLS collects and displays real estate listing data for Boards of Realtors
and real estate associations nationwide. An MLS area is an area of a county
that has been designated a name and number, which allows the potential
buyer to specify the geographic area where she wants to concentrate her
second home search. (For example, if you’re looking for a second home in
downtown Chicago, you tap the Northern Illinois MLS, which lists all homes
available in and around the city). To find the MLS that includes listings in
your area of choice, type “MLS” and the county name and state into a search
engine, or ask a local real estate agent for the information.
Many real estate Web sites run by individual real estate agents and/or offices
have MLS data posted on them. National aggregators like Realtor.com actu-
ally purchase the data from the national MLSs, and then display the informa-
tion in a consumer-friendly format online.
Working like a Realtor
The MLS was once a thick, somewhat overwhelming book that was delivered
on a weekly basis to every real estate agent’s desk. Later, the info was put into
an electronic format that was accessible by computer, but it was still only
viewable by agents who were members of the specific MLS or Realtor board.
Times have changed. Today if you’re searching for a second home on your
own, you can rely on a consumer-friendly version of that info now available
on the Web from various sources (see “Use the Internet to your advantage” 
in this chapter). And although it’s not the same exact information that agents
have access to (specific street addresses, for example, are sometimes omit-
ted from what are known as “public” sites), this Web info still gives second-
home buyers a good look at what’s on the market and at what price.
So don your real estate agent hat (You don’t have one? That’s okay. You can
hunt for houses chapeau-less!) and peruse some of these sites. Enter your
parameters and criteria, and the MLS will find one or more homes that fit
your wants and needs. Agents routinely check the MLS in the morning and
afternoon to pick up any new listings that have come on the market during
the day. If something catches your eye, do as the agents do and jump on it!
97
Chapter 5: In Search of the Perfect Second Home: What You Can Do

Keep an eye out for second-home deals
Perhaps you’re in the market for a second home, but you want to try and
score a hidden deal. A few nontraditional ways to score a great second home
include foreclosures, auctions, and bargains that come about because of
divorce, death of a family member, or last-minute relocations. Here’s how to
navigate the bargain-basement terrain.
Foreclosures
If you’re up for rooting around for information and don’t mind a bit of leg-
work, then you may have a shot at getting a second home via the foreclosure
process. Basically, these homes are in the process of being foreclosed upon —
that is, taken back — by lenders who haven’t been paid. (Because the house
or real property always secures a mortgage loan, if you don’t pay, the lender
takes the house.)
Foreclosures could take up an entire chapter, or even a book, so I’ll wrap
things up here with this: Although they can present good opportunities for
those who are willing to do the extra work involved, buying foreclosed homes
can be risky business for the uninitiated. If you’re seriously considering
buying a foreclosed home, don’t do it alone. Be sure that you have good 
professionals (attorneys, real estate agents, accountants, and so forth) on
your side before getting into it.
Web-based services like RealtyTrac (www.realtytrac.com) provide info 
on foreclosures that are taking place or are about to take place nationally.
Second-home buyers can search through the listings (available via paid sub-
scription) by state or many other criteria for properties that meet their needs
and budgets.
Auctions
You probably already know about homes being sold to the highest bidder 
on eBay, so it’s quite possible that you as a second-home buyer can find 
your perfect vacation and retirement home at a traditional auction. If going 
to for-sale auction events attended by other potential buyers is something
you’d consider, you may want to think about purchasing your second home
at auction.
Real estate auctions come in three varieties:
 Absolute sale: At this type of auction, the house goes to the highest
bidder, with no minimums or reserves.
 Minimum bid: At this auction, sellers agree to sell at the highest bid
above an established sales price.
98
Part II: Searching for Your New Home and Sealing the Deal 

 Reserve: These auctions allow sellers to set a reserve price that is above
the minimum starting bid and not revealed to bidders until it has been
met. Should the bidding not exceed that reserve, the seller doesn’t have
sell the property. (Yes, just like they do on eBay for ordinary everyday
auctions.)
Check with a real estate agent or call an auction house in the area where you
want to purchase your second home to find out where auctions are taking
place. Another good resource is the local newspaper’s classified section,
which often lists current and upcoming home auctions, along with the home’s
basic information and starting bid price.
Bargains
Bargain is an umbrella term I use to describe any house or piece of property
that can be purchased at a price below market value. These homes don’t
always become available through foreclosures or auctions. Sometimes an
owner will have to sell, and price becomes secondary to unloading the 
property. Possible scenarios include
 The quick sell: Your cousin just got a new job 3,000 miles away at
double the salary and has to sell his house and move like, oh, yesterday.
You happen to know that his mother (your aunt) left him the house and
that it has no mortgage. (Lucky him, right?) It isn’t far-fetched to imagine
him selling it to you, his beloved cousin, for much less than he could get
if he had more time and was willing to wait. Make a (low-ball) offer and
you may be pleasantly surprised.
 The “just-get-rid-of-it” sell: The couple down the block is getting
divorced and rancor abounds. They now not only loathe each other, 
but they also each loathe the house they lived in. Make a discrete
inquiry about buying, and they may be happy to get rid of it and give
you a rock-bottom price.
 The regretful sell: The elderly widow who lives on the water and whom
you know through your mother has decided to move into a retirement
community. She just can’t maintain her house on her own anymore. A
conversation with her about you possibly taking it off her hands may
result in you scoring a lovely beach house for a great price.
Keeping your ears open can lead to a wonderful second home at a terrific price.
Making an Offer and Negotiating
After you’ve found the perfect second home — the one that meets all your
criteria, including location, features, and price — you can make an offer to
the seller. In this section, I give you a brief look at how this process works,
and some advice on how to handle it on your own.
99
Chapter 5: In Search of the Perfect Second Home: What You Can Do

Knowing what the listed 
price really means
In today’s traditional real estate market, you’ll rarely find a home that’s
underpriced, so be prepared to make a reasonable offer based on market 
conditions, the home itself, and recent and comparable sales (comps), and
not so much on what the seller thinks she can get for the home.
As a buyer, you need to follow one rule: Make darned sure that the price
you’re offering to pay is based on professional knowledge and data, and not
on someone’s opinion of what her home might be worth. Make sure that the
person who advises you on what to offer knows what they’re talking about.
Bargains are out there, of course, but in the majority of cases, you’ll likely be
paying a market value based on informed advice. And you won’t pay higher
than the “right” price if you do your homework.
Using an appraiser to help you 
determine a good offer
An appraiser evaluates the property’s condition and size and determines how
much it’s worth. He reviews several aspects of the home, including
 Comparable, recent sales in the area
 The property’s location
 The home’s square footage
 Replacement costs
 The structure’s construction quality
 The age of the property
 The property’s amenities (such as pools and patios)
You can get an appraisal before you make an offer on a home, as long as 
you don’t mind shelling out $250 to $500. This can be a particularly good
strategy in a situation where you know that the house is overpriced, but 
can’t otherwise prove it. Appraisers usually come on the scene after a pur-
chase contract has been written and an appraised value is necessary to
obtain financing.
100
Part II: Searching for Your New Home and Sealing the Deal 

An appraiser doesn’t necessarily need access to the property’s interior, 
but keep in mind that if you don’t get the seller’s permission to conduct 
an appraisal, you risk upsetting her to the point where she won’t entertain 
or accept your offer. Be careful about making an end run that could alienate
the seller.
Sooner or later, you have to have an appraisal done on the home you plan 
to buy if you’re taking out a mortgage. A lender will always require an inde-
pendent appraisal of the market value of your second home before closing.
Why? Because the loan amount generally cannot exceed 95 percent of the
appraised value or purchase price, whichever is lower. But check your financ-
ing options carefully. Some lenders loan 100 percent to well-qualified buyers.
Mastering the art of the offer
When you’re ready to make an offer, here’s a rundown of what needs to be done:
1. Decide on the amount you’re prepared to offer on the home.
A good rule of thumb is about 10 percent lower than the asking price,
unless there are extenuating circumstances (such as a hot seller’s
market where ten buyers are bidding on a home at the same time, or 
a home that you know needs major repairs and is not worth anywhere
near the asking price). So for a $300,000 townhouse, you might start 
at $270,000.
2. Prepare a written offer on a Purchase Agreement.
You can get a complete, inexpensive “Offer To Purchase Real Estate” 
kit at an office supply store. Include information such as the offer price,
proposed closing date, any conditional issues (such as a financing 
contingency that says your deposit will be refunded if you can’t obtain
financing), and the amount of earnest money (essentially your “deposit,”
which typically ranges from $500 to $2,000) you plan to fork over with
the offer. Be sure to include a time frame during which the offer will be
valid and a stop date.
3. Present the offer to the seller.
4. Allow the seller a specific amount of time to think about the offer and
make a counteroffer.
Give the seller three or four days. (An example of a counteroffer: The 
listing price is $300,000, you offer $270,000, and he comes back with
$285,000.)
101
Chapter 5: In Search of the Perfect Second Home: What You Can Do

5. Mull over the counteroffer and decide if you’re willing to accept it.
If you don’t want to accept the counteroffer, evaluate whether you want
to continue the process until no more negotiating is feasible and it’s all
over, ending either successfully (you and the seller agree on a purchase
price) or unsuccessfully (you walk away from the home and continue
your search).
6. After the seller accepts the final, written offer, you and the seller sign
the document.
At this time, the document becomes legally binding. Be sure that you
read and understand everything on the contract before signing. When
you’re handling the purchase of your second home yourself, compre-
hending what you’re signing is absolutely critical.

 Using a transaction broker
 Calling on other pros for help
R
eal estate agents serve a purpose in the world of second-home buying,
but some of you may want to steer clear of these professionals altogether.
Perhaps you’ve bought and sold dozens of properties in the past, or maybe
you know the home seller and the property well enough to not need an inter-
mediary to help the transaction along. (If you plan to take the do-it-yourself
route, check out Chapter 5.) Either way, how you purchase your second home
is a highly individualized choice that rests largely with you, the home buyer.
You already own a primary residence, so you know how stressful the entire
home-buying experience can be. Furthermore, buying a home is a huge time
and financial commitment. Now that you want to buy a second home, you
may know that you don’t have the time, energy, or motivation to devote your-
self (almost) full time to such an important process.
You needn’t worry though, because plenty of professionals — everyone from
real estate agents to buyer’s agents and transaction brokers — can help make
your home-buying process go smoothly. These professionals make a living
out of helping people just like you get from the initial offer to the closing
table in the most seamless way possible.
This chapter explains the roles a real estate agent plays in the home-buying
game in the United States and how you can rely on buyer’s agents, transac-
tion brokers, and other professionals to purchase your dream second home.
(If you’re considering purchasing a second home outside the United States,
check out Chapter 9 for more info.)

How the Real Estate Game Is Played
(And Possibly Has Changed)
In days past, around the time your parents bought their first home, they dealt
with a real estate agent who operated as a listing agent. This agent probably
represented sellers, while occasionally helping a buyer navigate through the
home-buying maze, albeit without any binding obligation to the buyer. Those
days are gone. As real estate transactions became more complex, and baby
boomers began buying homes in record numbers beginning in the ’60s and
’70s (in a sense, foretelling their later interest in second homes), the market
and the professionals involved in it needed to change and adapt. Today,
many of the professionals’ services now overlap.
Today’s real estate agents are different, and they fall into two general 
categories (and one subcategory):
 Listing agents: These agents, also called real estate agents or Realtors,
list homes for sale, advertise and market them, show them to interested
parties, and put them on the Multiple Listing Service (MLS).
Realtor is a trade name and copyrighted — not all real estate agents are
Realtors. Only members of the National Association of Realtors can be
called Realtors, and they are bound to a strict Code of Ethics.
 Buyer’s agents: These agents work mainly (or solely, depending on the
agent) with buyers, hooking them up with properties, negotiating for
them, and remaining by their side until the property closes. For more
about these folks, see “Making a Buyer’s Agent Your Right-Hand Man 
(Or Woman)” later in this chapter.
 Transaction brokers: These professionals typically fall into one of 
the above categories, but also handle deals on a “piecemeal” basis. 
For instance, they take care of the paperwork for a for sale by owner 
(FSBO) deal where no listing or selling agent commission is being paid.
Transaction brokers can work out a deal with the buyer, the seller, or
both, and they are paid at closing for the work performed. To better
understand how these pros can help you, skip ahead to the “Using a
Transaction Broker” section in this chapter.
Every real estate transaction is different. Just because the last transaction
you wrapped up went like a well-oiled machine doesn’t mean that you’ll be
able to buy a second home without at least a few challenges.
The next two sections look more closely at what real estate pros can do to
help you find your ideal second home.
104
Part II: Searching for Your New Home and Sealing the Deal 

Making a Buyer’s Agent Your Right-
Hand Man (Or Woman)
If setting up showing appointments and calling title companies isn’t your bag,
then you want a buyer’s agent on your side during your second-home pur-
chase. For most people, it makes sense to have a knowledgeable, hardwork-
ing individual in their corner, making sure that all the steps have been
covered before the two of you converge on the closing table.
Some states allow a practice called dual agency (also known as designated
agency). This is when one agent represents both the buyer and the seller. The
intent of dual agency is to streamline the transaction. And many people in
states where it’s allowed — on both sides of the transaction — have been
pleased with a dual agency arrangement when they bought or sold a house.
However, because of the potential for ethical and conflict of interest issues,
full disclosure of a dual agency is required, and both parties must agree to it.
A dual agent is forbidden to reveal to the seller what the buyer is willing to
spend, and likewise forbidden to reveal to the buyer what the seller is willing
to take, meaning you’re on your own regarding coming up with an offer if
you’re buying. Many people don’t feel comfortable negotiating such a huge
financial transaction without the advice of a trusted pro working solely for
them. That’s why, if at all possible, I recommend you avoid dual agency and
go with a buyer’s agent or transaction broker (see later in this chapter for
more details on these two types of real estate pros).
Normally, in return for shepherding a client through the real estate transac-
tion, the buyer’s agent earns a commission when the deal closes. That com-
mission is paid by the seller at the closing, and the amount is split fifty-fifty
between the two agents who are co-brokering the transaction. That’s good
news for you, as the buyer, because you don’t have to pay any out-of-pocket
fees for the benefits of agent representation.
If you decide to use a buyer’s agent, be sure to ask her about possible situa-
tions in which you would be asked to pay her commission. Any agreement
you reach with a buyer’s agent should be in writing. For example, if you
decide on a for sale by owner (FSBO) home, the seller may not be willing to
shell out a commission, and you, as the buyer, may have to compensate your
real estate agent for her services.
This section delves into the roles of a buyer’s agent and how she can help
you find your second home. This section also helps you find a buyer’s agent
who is right for you and discusses what you need to know when signing an
agreement with a buyer’s agent.
105
Chapter 6: Relying on the Experts When Buying Your Second Home

Defining a buyer’s agent’s responsibilities
Unlike selling agents, who work harder at representing sellers and market-
ing their listings, buyer’s agents put their time into working with people 
just like you.
A buyer’s agent’s duties include, but aren’t limited to
 Getting the best possible price and contract terms for you.
 Disclosing all material facts (problems with the roof, plumbing issues,
and so forth) about the property (that they have knowledge of) that
you’re interested in buying.
 Sharing with you any relevant, personal facts about the seller that could
affect your negotiating power, such as an impending divorce, foreclosure,
or the fact that the condo has been on the market for two years without
so much as a nibble.
More specifically, buyer’s agents perform myriad tasks for second-home
buyers, including (but, again, not limited to):
 Pointing you in the direction of financing: Your agent arranges 
a meeting with at least three lenders, who can prequalify you for a 
second-home loan, thus putting you in a strong negotiating position
when you’re ready to make an offer on a home.
 Figuring out what you want: Expect to sit down or chat on the phone
with your agent for a few minutes to provide some key information that
she can use to find the right second home for you. Your agent may ask
you about the number of bedrooms, baths, and total square footage you
want, as well as information on the minimum lot size, and what ameni-
ties and other features you’re looking for. (See Chapter 3 for more details
on defining what you want in your second home.)
And because you get more than just a building when you buy a home,
you and your agent can easily access info online about neighborhoods,
schools, shopping, taxes, and other important factors to consider. (See
Chapter 4 for info about the location of your second home.)
 Searching for eligible properties: With your wish list in hand, your
agent hits the streets (well, not literally anymore) to find out what’s on
the market. She may use the following resources:
• The local Multiple Listing Service (MLS): She can look at the MLS
where all homes listed by real estate agents are posted.
106
Part II: Searching for Your New Home and Sealing the Deal 

• Other real estate offices: She can call real estate offices in areas
where you’re looking to buy (if they’re outside of the agent’s typi-
cal area). She can also contact local new developments and talk
with area builders.
• The Internet: She can look online at Web sites, such as www.
realtor.com (a national hot spot for real estate listings).
 Previewing properties: With a printout in hand (either from your own
Internet research or from the material provided by your agent from the
local MLS), your buyer’s agent will likely preview several potential prop-
erties to avoid wasting your time. She can do this in person or online via
virtual tours, which give potential buyers a pretty good idea of what a
home looks like without having to visit it.
 Taking you to see properties: Your agent will tell you when it’s time 
to pile in the car and check out the inventory of possible homes. The
Internet has made this process much easier and less time consuming
because it allows you and your agent to look at properties and eliminate
those that don’t match your criteria before you spend hours driving all
over the city.
 Negotiating on your behalf: When the right property comes along, a
buyer’s agent will refer to the MLS to come up with a stack of recent
sales on comparable properties, and then work with you to come up
with a feasible starting offer that includes price, terms, and conditions.
After you and your agent determine a solid starting offer, your agent 
presents the written offer to the seller through the seller’s agent. Both
professionals then negotiate in concert with their clients over the offer
until there is an acceptable contract, or the buyer moves on to another
property. When the buyer and seller are both satisfied with the outcome
of the negotiating process, the deal can move forward.
 Standing by at the closing table: Yes, your buyer’s agent may even
attend the closing if round-table closings are the norm in your area. If
not, an escrow agent will handle all the paperwork, and you won’t have
to be present.
Your buyer’s agent can be ready to answer your questions and help 
with last-minute issues that crop up. She’ll serve as your go-between
with the selling agent and other professionals who are on hand to see
the deal through to closing. Because your agent represents you, you 
can feel confident that your interests will be protected. The closing 
is also when the real estate brokerage collects a check for a job 
well done.
107
Chapter 6: Relying on the Experts When Buying Your Second Home

Finding the right professional
You want to use a buyer’s agent to help you find and purchase your second
home, but you don’t know where to find this illustrious individual, right? The
following are great ways to find the right buyer’s agent:
 Talk to the agent who sold you your first house. This is a good place 
to start because you already have a relationship with this professional.
And even if he can’t help (perhaps he doesn’t work in the new area
where you’re moving to), he can certainly point you in the direction of
someone who can, and perhaps receive a referral fee (from the agent
you do work with) in the process.
 Ask for referrals from friends, family, and colleagues. Referrals are
always the best way to get a good, reputable agent. Talk to people you
know who have purchased second homes in the last few years and find
out who they worked with, but understand that if they bought a vacation
home on Maui — and if you’re looking in New England — that the person
may not be able to help. Ask them what the experience was like, what
the person’s good and bad points were, and how it all worked out in 
the end.
If you don’t like what you hear, talk to the next person until you hear
about a buyer’s agent who sounds like a good fit. If, for example, your
best friend tells you that her agent called her ten times a day over a
four-week period to introduce properties that weren’t at all up to par
with what she was looking for, then you’ve found an agent to avoid.
If, however, the guy in the office next to you bragged up an agent who
negotiated a great price on a beachfront condo, and then pointed him in
the direction of a great local furniture store that helped him save a ton of
money outfitting the place, then you just may have yourself a keeper.
 Go online. Conduct a Web search for agents in your geographic area
who bill themselves as agents who work only with buyers. You can find
an agent who works only for or primarily with buyers through the Real
Estate Buyer’s Agent Council (REBAC) at www.rebac.net. Click on
“home buyers” on the bottom of the page and then “Find a Buyer’s 
Rep.” Enter the area where you plan to purchase your second home, 
and you’ll get a directory of accredited buyer’s representatives who
serve that area.
A simple REBAC search by state may return an overwhelming number of
agents (sometimes in the thousands). Enter the zip code (use the closest
big city’s zip) to narrow the list of agents to a more manageable number.
108
Part II: Searching for Your New Home and Sealing the Deal 

There are a lot of good agents working in the market, so don’t get discour-
aged if the first few you talk to don’t pan out. Just keep looking, keep asking
for referrals, and sooner or later you’ll find a great match.
Choosing your agent
So you’ve found an agent you think can help you. He listens when you speak,
seems knowledgeable, and has a pleasant, nongrating personality. So how do
you know if your instincts are accurate? Easy. You ask questions. When you
find a buyer’s agent whom you think you’d like to work with, here are a few
key questions you should ask:
 How long have you worked in this area? Someone who moved into the
area just last week, or who hasn’t sold anything in the vicinity you’re
considering for a year or more, may not be very helpful.
 How many clients do you typically work with at one time? You want
someone who’s busy, but not overly busy. If the agent is handling 40 (or
more) different clients at once (yes, there are agents who do this), he is
probably not going to have the time to do a thorough search for you
(particularly if what you want is going to take a few months to find).
 Are you familiar with the type of home I want to purchase? If you’re
looking for a condo and the agent works only with high-end, single-family
homes, then choose another agent. Likewise, if the agent specializes, say,
in condos and commercial properties, he may not be knowledgeable
enough about single-family homes.
 Are you comfortable searching for homes in my price range? Again, 
if this person is working in the $100,000 to $200,000 range and you’re
looking for a $1.5 million waterfront mansion (or vice versa), continue 
to look and find someone who specializes in what you’re in the market
for. (For example, you can take a drive down by the water to see which
agents have signs out in the yards of the large homes that are for sale).
 Are you an effective negotiator? Odds are the agent’s response to this
question will be a resounding “Yes!” so expect it. But the reality is that
you can’t tell for sure if this is true until you see him in action. In the
meantime, it doesn’t hurt to ask questions like:
• How much money do you typically save your clients over the
asking price?
• What other terms do you typically negotiate for (a quick move-in
date, for example)?
The real house-buying process begins when you find a place you love, so
you want an agent who knows how to finesse the transaction to save
you as much money as possible and get you the best deal.
109
Chapter 6: Relying on the Experts When Buying Your Second Home

When you’ve found someone who’s a good fit, it’s time to formalize the 
relationship (see the next section).
Signing an agreement 
with a buyer’s agent
Because real estate agents earn their keep by helping buyers and sellers
through to the end of the transaction, they don’t receive a dime for their 
services until closing day. Buyer’s agents use legal contracts called buyer
agency agreements to outline the business terms between you and your
buyer’s agent. These agreements can be exclusive or nonexclusive, and 
they answer questions like:
 Will the buyer’s agent be paid from the commission the seller pays at
closing? Are there situations where this may not happen? If yes, what 
are they?
 Is this an exclusive agreement with one agent, or is it a nonexclusive
contract that frees you up to work with other buyer’s agents?
 What’s the duration of the agreement? How long will you work with 
this agent?
 How will the buyer’s agent represent you if you decide to make an offer
on a home that she has listed or on a property that another agent in her
office has listed?
 Is the agreement valid only in a certain geographic region, or does it
cover real estate that you purchase anywhere?
 Is the contract renewable? Can it be canceled without penalty? If not,
what are the consequences if I cancel it?
Every contract comes with its own terms, so be sure to go over these points
carefully before signing.
Read the fine print before signing the buyer agency agreement, because most
of them generally specify that the seller will pay the buyer’s agent’s commis-
sion, but this occurs only if the seller has agreed to pay. If the seller isn’t will-
ing to pay, however, the buyer — you — may have to pick up the tab if it’s
stated in the buyer agency agreement. Look for specific language that says
something like “buyer hereby agrees to pay to the agent a commission of X
percent or $0000.” This commonly means that the seller has already refused
to pay and the agent’s fee is coming out of your pocket. If you can’t live with
this, don’t sign, and then renegotiate the terms.
110
Part II: Searching for Your New Home and Sealing the Deal 

The buyer agency agreement is negotiable, which means that if something
stands out as being “not right” about the contract, you don’t have to sign 
it. Ask the agent to modify the contract until both of you are satisfied with
the end result. Consider asking one of the professionals I talk about in the
“Depending on Other Professionals during the Purchasing Process” section 
to review the contract.
Using a Transaction Broker
What is a transaction broker? A transaction broker is a real estate pro who
represents both the buyer and the seller, but has no binding financial respon-
sibility to either person and does not act in the capacity of a full-service real
estate agent. A transaction broker facilitates the deal — and helps the parties
reach an agreement. He handles the paperwork for the transaction for a fee
when you’re not working with a buyer’s agent. He must abide by all laws, as
well as all professional codes of conduct and ethical standards.
You don’t need a transaction broker if you’re working with a buyer’s agent 
or other real estate agent who is representing the deal and handling the
paperwork.
This section highlights what a transaction broker can do for you and what
you need to know before you decide to use one.
Do you really need a transaction broker?
Should you use a transaction broker? The following questions may help 
you determine if a transaction broker is right for you and your second-
home purchase.
 What are the benefits of using a transaction broker? A transaction
broker is a neutral party. He looks out for the accuracy of the process,
the correctness of the paperwork, and the professional execution of the
sale. And he’ll charge less than an agent.
 Is a transaction broker an agent? A transaction broker is not acting in
the capacity of a real estate agent — although he may, in fact, be a
licensed real estate agent. The transaction broker is simply an interme-
diary seeing the transaction to its successful completion. If you don’t
need the services of a real estate agent and just need someone to handle
the paperwork, then a transaction broker can help, but he’s not acting
as a real estate agent on your behalf.
111
Chapter 6: Relying on the Experts When Buying Your Second Home

 What services won’t a transaction broker perform? He won’t negotiate
price, he won’t shop for houses, he won’t find you financing. A transac-
tion broker is simply someone to handle the paperwork and serve as a
go-between when you don’t need a full-service real estate agent.
 What will a transaction broker cost me? As the buyer, it won’t cost you
anything. The transaction broker receives a flat fee, which the seller pays.
 Will a transaction broker negotiate the best price for me? A transaction
broker will not negotiate price in your favor — or the seller’s favor — but
does act as an intermediary in discussions of price, offering advice and
information. Remember that the transaction broker has no financial
responsibility to either party — a transaction broker is a “non-agent”
(even if he has a real estate license) but can be a valuable asset in seeing
the deal to a happy conclusion.
Finding a reputable transaction broker
Many listing and buyer’s agents will perform the limited services of a transac-
tion broker for those buyers who do not want (or need) to work with a full-
service agent working at a full commission rate (ranging from 5 to 7 percent
of the sales price, depending on the area where the home is located).
When you sign a buyer agency agreement, you can forget about wondering
whether to hire a transaction broker. Your agent will take care of everything.
Depending on Other Professionals 
during the Purchasing Process
Financing, real estate, the law, and taxes are complex fields, strewn with all
kinds of land mines, and dangerous to naively stride through unassisted and
unprotected. That’s where professionals of every stripe come in, and during
the process of buying your second home, you may need help from one or all
of these experts.
Also, if you’re using a transaction broker (or tackling the home-buying
process alone — and if you are, make sure to read Chapter 5) to buy your
second home, these pros can be key to not only assuring the professional
execution of the transaction, but also to letting you sleep nights.
The following list focuses on other important people you may need to hire
when buying a second home. These people can guide you in making wise
decisions and protect you and your new investment.
112
Part II: Searching for Your New Home and Sealing the Deal 

If you’re using a buyer’s agent, you may not need to use some of these people
because a buyer’s agent can take care of many, if not all, of the important
details.
 Lawyers: A popular billboard says, “Buying a House? Call a lawyer first.”
Because a group of attorneys sponsored the billboard, it’s easy to under-
stand the sentiment, but perhaps it isn’t necessary to call a lawyer first.
Granted, it can’t hurt to call one at some point, but it’s your decision
whether to retain a private attorney to represent you in your second-
home purchase. And it’s perfectly okay if you do. But in many cases, your
attorney will be duplicating the work of the other professionals handling
your deal — meaning you’re paying twice for the same services — not 
a smart move. Some states do require an attorney to handle real estate
closings, so depending on where you live, you may have no choice. But
check out the requirements before retaining your own lawyer at your
own expense. Both listing and buyer’s agents can answer questions about
the legal requirements and, if necessary, possibly even recommend a
local attorney experienced in representing home buyers.
 Accountants: If you have an accountant prepare your taxes, have a chat
with Ms. CPA before you begin looking for your second home. Your
accountant can discuss your current tax situation with you and what
will change if you take on additional financing, begin receiving rental
income, and need to spend money to maintain an income-earning prop-
erty. An accountant can also help with long-term planning for your
future and retirement, as well as advise you on the tax consequences
when you decide to sell your primary home and move into your second
home. (Refer to Chapter 14 for more info on the tax implications of
owning a second home.)
If you don’t have an accountant, your buyer’s agent can probably recom-
mend someone who will offer a free consultation and help you deter-
mine whether you need professional accounting services at the moment.
 Appraisers: Home appraisers are knowledgeable about comparable
home values in the neighborhoods where you’re thinking of buying.
They figure out a property’s value by looking at factors such as the 
property’s age, size, and condition. Establishing a relationship with an
appraiser can help when you need an appraisal of the property you’re
considering buying and don’t want to use the seller’s appraiser or the
ones recommended by the agent. Appraisers are especially important in
areas where vacation homes are skyrocketing in value. See Chapter 5 for
more information on appraisals.
Your lender will also appraise the property you’re considering buying,
and that appraisal alone may be enough to qualify you for financing.
Then you won’t need a “second opinion.”
113
Chapter 6: Relying on the Experts When Buying Your Second Home

 Loan officers: The loan officer at your bank can fill you in on financing
opportunities for your second home. The mortgage field constantly
changes, and banks are always creating new programs for borrowers
(see Chapter 8). A chat with a loan officer can prepare you for that time
when all the price and fee negotiating is over and you have to decide
how to pay for your second home.
It’s a wise idea to get preapproved for a mortgage and request a 
preapproval letter from a potential lender. This way, you know you can
secure a loan when the time comes to make an offer on your second
home, and it will give the seller a better idea of you as a buyer. If a seller
knows you’re preapproved for a mortgage, she’ll take you seriously and
possibly negotiate a better price with you.
 Mortgage brokers: Like a loan officer at a bank, a private mortgage
broker can fill you in on a slew of borrowing programs, from hundreds 
of companies offering financing. You may want to stick with the bank
where you have your first mortgage, but it can’t hurt to talk to an inde-
pendent broker. Also, having a bank and a mortgage company competing
for your business can only help you.
 Insurance agents: You’ll need homeowners’ insurance on your second
home. Talk with your insurance agent before you start looking for your
second home. Sometimes insurance companies offer discounts when
existing clients add coverage to their policies. (Check out Chapter 8 for
more on insuring a second home.)
 Home inspectors: You’ll want to have the home you’re thinking of
buying inspected, and you’ll want it inspected by someone working for
you, not the seller. (Check out Chapter 7 for more about finding the right
home inspector for your second-home purchase.)
 Title company reps: I have been to closings involving nothing but a 
title company representative, who handles the research to determine
whether the seller has clear title (ownership of land that is without com-
peting claims or other defects so it can be sold without complications)
on the property she is trying to sell you. You need to know earlier, rather
than later, if there are liens on the property, and a title company can pro-
vide peace of mind for a reasonable fee.

O
nce upon a time, real estate agents considered home inspectors to be
the ultimate “deal breakers.” If there was any one person who could
come in and quickly make a purchase unravel, it was the home inspector.
Times have changed, though, and as society became more litigious, and
agents found themselves tied up in lawsuits brought by home buyers who 
felt duped into purchasing unsound properties, home inspectors have
become the agents’ best friends.
In today’s real estate market, inspectors can also be your best friend as you
navigate your way through the final days of your second-home purchase, but
they can also be the bearers of bad news. They typically charge anywhere
from $250 to $500 (depending on geographic location and the size and com-
plexity of the home) to scour a home’s physical structure and major systems
looking for problems. If your inspector finds problems during the inspection,
you can save a significant amount of money and hassle by first, knowing
about them, and then either resolving them or saying “no thanks” to the deal.
In this chapter, I discuss the importance of a second-home inspection, help
you find a good inspector, advise you on the right questions to ask, and
explain how to spot areas of a home that an inspector may overlook. And
when inspections turn up problems, I show you how to either resolve them
or walk away.

Recognizing the Importance of Your
Second Home’s Inspection
No matter how many homes you’ve closed on in the past, and no matter how
savvy you are about housing construction and the ins and outs of home heat-
ing systems and plumbing, it always pays to have a second set of eyes give
the home a thorough once-over before signing on the dotted line. Home
inspectors can point out common problems with homes in the area. For
example, if the region is known for having sinkholes (those large pockets of
land that open up and swallow everything sitting on top of them), the inspec-
tor can clue you in to this issue. Inspectors can also point out home-specific
issues, such as how mold can cause big problems for second-home owners
whose abodes are in humid, damp climates.
An inspection typically takes place within ten days or so of the buyer and
seller executing a purchase agreement. It’s a good idea to include an inspec-
tion contingency in your offer, stating that if serious problems are uncovered,
you can either renegotiate the purchase price or back out of the deal com-
pletely without losing your earnest deposit money.
An inspector won’t tell you if you’re getting a good value for your money, 
nor will he establish a “home value” for you, so avoid asking these questions.
Instead of putting the inspector on the spot, take the solid information the
inspector provides and use it to form your own opinions.
This section explains why the home inspection on your second home is
important, pointing out what gets inspected, what often gets overlooked, 
and what your rights are as a prospective owner.
Knowing your rights and options
When buying a second home, you have every right to have that home
inspected by a professional (check out the section about finding and hiring a
reputable inspector). For a fee, your inspector will give the place a good once-
over, scouting out any problems and issues that could turn into real headaches
down the road. Even if you’re looking at a brand-new home, you should still
arrange an inspection. Let’s face it, they don’t make ’em like they used to!
Your goal is to protect your investment and avoid problems that could crop up
later. The last thing you want is for your central air conditioning unit to sud-
denly fail at your housewarming party on a hot July afternoon in Texas. Trust
me. It won’t be a pretty picture. The builder assuring you, “It’s a brand-new
unit! Trust me!” is not enough these days. Understand what warranties the
builder is offering and get it in writing. If you’re buying a preowned property,
116
Part II: Searching for Your New Home and Sealing the Deal 

consider purchasing a Home Warranty insurance policy (or ask the seller to
pay for one) to cover most of the components for the first year or so.
If the seller refuses to allow a home inspection (which is, for the most part, 
a rarity, but still . . .), politely ask her if she needs any help raising that red
flag up the flag pole in front of her home. Refusing an inspection means she’s
probably trying to conceal a problem — major or minor — and is not disclos-
ing whatever is wrong on the mandatory seller disclosure — which she’s
required to do by law in most states. (See “Understanding Disclosure
Statements” later in this chapter for more information.)
The problem could be as simple as a couple of (or eight) leaky faucets, or as
major as an entire mold colony growing in the basement. Regardless of the
suspected seriousness of the problems, if the seller won’t give you the oppor-
tunity to discover what they are, say, “thanks, but no thanks,” and walk away
from the property.
What gets inspected
As they search for defects or other issues that can turn into significant prob-
lems down the road, home inspectors focus on the safety and construction of
❑Electrical wiring: Homes can have insufficient electrical service, makeshift
wiring connections, poor overload protection, and safety issues.
❑Heating and air conditioning systems: Broken controls, unsafe or 
inadequate venting and exhaust removal systems, cracked heating
exchanges, faulty thermostats. HVAC equipment tends to be the 
Achilles’ heel in many homes.
❑Roofs: Usually the most expensive component of a home to replace,
roofs that leak cause consistent problems that range from water pene-
tration and rotted joists, to mold and ruined sheetrock — and every-
thing in between. And the problems only get worse with time.
❑Plumbing: Defects in this category can range from minor stuff like a faucet
needing a washer, to more involved problems like old and incompatible
pipes, cracked toilets, faulty fixtures, leaky pipes, and major clogs.
❑Structural issues: Foundation walls, attic rafters, windows, doors, ceil-
ings, and floor joists are all vulnerable areas where home inspections
may turn up problems.
❑Surface grading and drainage: Water can penetrate into a basement or
crawl space very quickly when the area around the home doesn’t drain
properly. I once knew a man whose backyard became a pond when it
rained. Needless to say, his basement always had water.
❑Maintenance problems: This category includes cracked and peeling
paint, broken appliances, cracked floor tiles, broken doorknobs, torn
carpeting, and other costly annoyances.
117
Chapter 7: Inspecting Your Second Home before You Sign on the Dotted Line

You can also have the home inspected for termites (often it’s a requirement)
and radon at an additional charge and, in most cases, you’ll need an expert if
you want absolute assurance the house has neither. A standard inspection
may include a visual check for termites and a meter reading for radon, but a
specialist will always go the extra mile and really make sure the structure is
clear of both.
Using a checklist-style procedure, the inspector will slowly work his way
through the entire home, front to back, top to bottom, and room by room,
using a critical eye to uncover any and all defects and problems that are
immediately apparent or waiting in the wings to descend upon the owner
later. He’ll make notes on his findings and transfer them to a final report 
after he completes the inspection. A typical inspection takes two to three
hours and sometimes more, depending on the size of the home and how
many problems turn up.
What inspectors often miss
Inspectors aren’t infallible, and inspections aren’t the final word about a
home. Even the most experienced professionals often can’t uncover every-
thing that’s wrong with a home during their inspection.
They can’t, for example, see behind walls. And they can’t lift up the entire
length of carpeting in a hallway to look for problems (most will peel back a
corner or two to check it out). Hidden damage inflicted by insects, mold, rot,
and unwanted water are among the biggest “misses” to look out for. Other
issues include roof-related problems (hire a roofing contractor to inspect the
roof more thoroughly if you suspect problems), and problems with major
components (like central air conditioner units) that may look and sound okay
during the inspection, but that may unexpectedly die on you within a year of
buying the home.
Four years ago, I bought a home in Florida “as is,” but had an inspection
anyway, just to be sure the house didn’t have any major problems. The
inspector (who did a very thorough job) told me at the time that the home’s
tile roof had at least “another good 15 years on it.” Two years later, though,
the roof was leaking like a sieve and in need of replacement. Turns out the
previous owners (obviously do-it-yourselfers) had taken it upon themselves
to replace about 50 tiles, and they tore the underlying tar paper in the
process. This created hidden holes that the inspector’s eye didn’t catch. You
can’t do anything about eventualities like this, but you can at least be aware
that — as I discovered — inspections are not the final word about a home.
118
Part II: Searching for Your New Home and Sealing the Deal 

Don’t look at the inspection as the end-all statement about your second
home. If you see black mold growing up the side of that gorgeous little cot-
tage on Long Beach Island, take a closer look, point it out to your inspector,
and get a second opinion on its presence and possible danger, if necessary.
When you’re at the home for showings and meetings, make a list of the things
you’re concerned about and discuss them all with the inspector. Are there
curling shingles that don’t look right? Bring it up. A long crack in the drive-
way? Bring it up. A large chunk of cement missing from the corner of the
foundation? Bring it up. You’ll be glad you did.
Finding and Hiring a 
Reputable Inspector
Hundreds of home inspectors in your area are ready to spring into action and
uncover any and all problems with your second home, from leaky faucets to
worn-out roofs.
And their fee is a bargain, considering the value of the information. For just 
a few hundred bucks, they’ll go through the place with a fine-toothed comb
(it’s a pretty big comb, though) and tell you what you need to know before
you decide whether to go through with your purchase. An inspection is a
great service for the money, considering that it may save you $15,000 for a
new roof or $2,500 for a new air conditioning unit in six months.
In this section, I help you sift through the slew of home inspectors to find one
who will work as your advocate, and tell you exactly what’s wrong (and right,
by the way) with the dwelling you hope will become your second home. And,
because some states don’t require home inspectors to undergo any special
training or licensing, I explain how to make sure your inspector is on the up-
and-up, even if your second home is in one of those states.
Uncovering potential leads
Home inspectors have reputations that they need to protect, uphold, and
even enhance to stay in business.
To keep their companies afloat, they rely heavily on referrals from “happy
home buyers” whom they have serviced. This means that your first stop on
your home inspector shopping trip should be friends, family members, and
colleagues who may have had positive experiences while working with an
inspector and would be happy to tell you all about it.
119
Chapter 7: Inspecting Your Second Home before You Sign on the Dotted Line

If at all possible, try to hire an inspector who is a licensed contractor or
structural engineer. These professionals typically have more in-depth knowl-
edge of residential structures and can provide straightforward, informed
advice and information on the expected longevity and operability of major
systems and structural components in your prospective home. Ask the
inspector if he’s a licensed contractor and/or engineer, and if the answer
sounds shaky, ask to see a copy of his license for proof.
If your second home is in an area where you don’t have friends or family, then
your best bet is to ask for referrals from your real estate agent, go online, and
check professional directories to find a good one. The following sections give
you some more in-depth info. After you’ve found a couple of inspectors you
think you can work with, use the questions listed in the “Knowing what to ask
a potential inspector” section later in this chapter to find one whom you like
and who is reputable and experienced.
Getting referrals from your agent
Your agent probably won’t refer you to just one home inspector, but almost
certainly will provide you with a list of several reputable inspectors from
which you can choose the one you want to work with. Why? Because recom-
mending one inspector could be construed as a conflict of interest if a prob-
lem should arise. By offering several names of inspectors, agents avoid a
conflict of interest that could be alleged if a buyer were sent to the agent’s
“inspector of choice” to receive a clean bill of health for the home in order to
ensure a smooth closing.
Checking real estate guides
Home inspectors regularly advertise in those full-color, real estate magazines
that line the street corners and grocery store entrances in nearly every town
across the country. You’ve seen them, right? And until you started looking for
your second home, you ignored them, right?
Well, they’re a gold mine of information, and you should make a point of pick-
ing one up on a regular basis. Flip through them, get some names, make some
calls, ask some questions, and choose your inspector.
Going online
The Internet is another good place to find a quality home inspection firm to
check out your second home. To acquire lots of names with very little effort,
type the words “home inspection,” the name of the town where your poten-
tial home is located, and your state into a search engine, such as Google.
Don’t be surprised if the results include thousands of names and firms. See
the upcoming “Contacting professional inspector organizations” section for
more details on using professional organizations’ directories to find a quali-
fied inspector you’ll want to work with.
120
Part II: Searching for Your New Home and Sealing the Deal 

An attractive Web site with lots of bells and whistles does not necessarily
mean its owner is a qualified, reputable home inspector. Keep this in mind 
as you peruse the Web for good candidates, and always ask questions.
Asking other experts for advice
Your attorney, accountant, or even your insurance agent may know of a great
home inspector in your area, so don’t be afraid to ask around. If these profes-
sionals have worked directly with an inspector — or if they have clients who
have — then they can surely point you in the direction of a good one.
Unlike asking a real estate agent to recommend an inspector, it’s not a 
conflict of interest for a professional whom you depend on for good advice 
in non–real estate transactions to provide a name or two. Because their 
commissions aren’t hinging on the closing of the sale (they get paid anyway),
these pros can usually point you in the direction of the best possible source
of services and/or information.
Contacting professional inspector organizations
Professional inspector organizations are great ways to find good inspectors
who follow their organizations’ codes of ethics and performance. Two
national home inspector organizations allow second-home buyers to locate
home inspectors in their area.
 American Society of Home Inspectors (ASHI), www.ashi.org: I punched
my zip code into the “find a home inspector” link and came up with the
names of 25 home inspectors in my area. (To have a similar list mailed to
you, call ASHI at 800-743-2744.)
 National Association of Certified Home Inspectors (NACHI), www.
findaninspector.us: This site gave me a very long list of inspectors
within a 20-mile radius of my zip code.
Looking into licensing requirements
Unfortunately, home inspectors operate in what I like to describe as “a highly
unregulated environment.” That’s right, folks. Home inspectors are entrusted
with uncovering problems that can impact one of the largest financial trans-
actions you’ll make in your lifetime, but in many states, they don’t even need
a license.
The following states do not require any type of licensure and/or criteria for
home inspectors: California, Colorado, Delaware, Georgia, Hawaii, Idaho,
Iowa, Kansas, Kentucky, Maine, Michigan, Minnesota, Missouri, Montana,
Nebraska, New Hampshire, New Mexico, North Dakota, Ohio, Tennessee,
Utah, Vermont, Washington, West Virginia, and Wyoming.
121
Chapter 7: Inspecting Your Second Home before You Sign on the Dotted Line

Please be aware that new laws are being enacted all the time, so check with
your state department of business regulation if you’re unsure of whether
inspectors are licensed in your state.
If you live in one of these states, you can protect yourself and ensure that
your inspection is on the up and up by working with ASHI or NACHI members
(see the previous section) who have to follow a code of ethics and take con-
tinuing education classes to maintain membership.
Those states that do require home inspectors to be licensed have strict para-
meters for their licensees. In Illinois, for example, all home inspectors must be
at least 21 years old and have a high school diploma or equivalent course of
study (GED). All candidates for licensing must successfully complete 60 hours
of prelicense education and pass the Illinois Home Inspector License Exam.
The states that require inspectors to be licensed have similar guidelines.
States with home inspector licensing requirements have a supervisory board
or department that handles anything to do with the licensing process. (In
Massachusetts, for example, it’s called the Board of Registration of Home
Inspectors; in North Carolina, it’s the Home Inspector Licensure Board.) If
you have a problem with a particular inspector or have any questions regard-
ing home inspection, you should call the department in the state where your
second home is located.
Knowing what to ask a potential inspector
When hiring an inspector, be sure to ask questions and not just select the one
with the most impressive Yellow Pages ad, or the toughest-sounding name.
Just because a guy calls himself The Inspectinator doesn’t mean he’s got
inspection superpowers. When checking the experience and knowledge of 
a home inspector, remember that rule No. 1 is “the more, the better.” The
“Finding and Hiring a Reputable Inspector” section can help you compile 
a list of potential inspectors.
After you have your list, call those inspectors and ask them the following
questions, which will help you determine who’s the best of your inspector
candidates:
 How much do you charge for a typical inspection? It should range from
$200 to $300.
 What is your education, training, and experience? Look for someone
who has been in the business for five or more years. If someone just
started in the business last week, don’t walk away: Run.
122
Part II: Searching for Your New Home and Sealing the Deal 

 What are your professional certifications or credentials? Ask to see 
a state license and proof of membership in a group like ASHI or NACHI.
This is particularly important in states where inspectors aren’t licensed,
and where almost anyone can claim to be a home inspector. (See the
preceding section for more on licensing.)
 How many other homes like mine have you inspected in the past 12
months? You don’t want someone who specializes almost exclusively 
on condos to inspect your new, 15-room castle on the beach.
 What is your availability? Make sure the inspector can meet your 
timeline.
 Do you have any conditions or stipulations, such as me having to 
be present when conducting an inspection? This will cut down on 
surprises on inspection day.
 When you perform a home inspection, who are you working for? The
answer should be the same every time: the home buyer.
 Can I tag along during the home inspection? You don’t want to get
underfoot, but being there can make a big difference, especially if 
problems turn up.
 Can I ask you questions during the inspection? The inspector should
be more than willing to explain everything, answer questions, and
address any and all of your concerns. After all, he’s working for you, 
and you’re paying his fee.
 Will you provide a written report? This is pretty standard, but ask
anyway. You’ll want a written record of what went on during the inspec-
tion, details on all problems that were uncovered, and the inspector’s
written opinion on issues like roof age and status of major systems.
 Can you provide an approximate written estimate of repair costs?
This can come in handy when negotiating with the seller over necessary
repairs.
 Can I call you at a later date for information and advice? You may
want to chat about that furnace that the inspector red-flagged as being
“old and outdated,” so you need to know if he’s willing to keep those
lines of communication open as part of his service.
From inspectors’ answers to these questions, you should be able to whittle
the list down to one inspector whose experience and credentials match what
you’re looking for, and whom you trust and have confidence in for something
as important as an inspection.
123
Chapter 7: Inspecting Your Second Home before You Sign on the Dotted Line

Using the Inspection Report
A top-of-the-line home inspector will give you a written report that details
exactly what is wrong (and some of what is right) with the second home that
you plan to purchase. The reports can range from just a few pages to 20 or
more, are usually organized by area or room of the home (kitchen, bathroom,
and so forth), and may even include digital photos.
If your inspector is tech-savvy and online (which, truth be told, probably
describes 99 percent of real estate professionals today), he may also, upon
request, e-mail you a digital version of the report as a PDF or other file.
When you receive the inspector’s written report, don’t just file it away with-
out reviewing it. First, slowly read through the opening pages of the report.
Doing so gives you an overview of the home’s major components (roof, foun-
dation, and so on), systems (plumbing, electrical), and condition.
Next, go through the report and check out the negative findings, or areas the
inspector identified as needing attention. The following list gives examples of
the types of comments an inspector is likely to make. These are the concerns
that you and the seller will need to hash out before closing day.
 The wood deck is showing signs of wear and tear. Maintenance and pro-
tection (painting or staining) is needed in the near future to preserve the
wood and extend its life.
 A buildup of soot and creosote exists in the chimney. This is a danger-
ous situation and should be evaluated by a qualified professional and
cleaned out as soon as possible.
 The central vacuum unit in the basement is nonoperational.
 The stopper in the tub in the main bathroom is missing.
 There is a water stain on the first-floor bathroom ceiling, which is
directly below the master bath. My best guess is a toilet leak, probably
from a worn-out wax seal. A plumber is needed to correct this problem.
But just because the inspector finds problems doesn’t mean you should grab
your earnest money (the deposit you put down when you signed the contract)
and run. The seller may not even know that her air conditioning unit is on the
blink or that all her living room windows are in sore need of replacement.
After you’ve reviewed the report, you need to think about the problems the
inspector identified and make some decisions:
124
Part II: Searching for Your New Home and Sealing the Deal 

 Which items need to be addressed? Prioritize the problems the inspec-
tor identified. Which issues do you want to bring up with the seller, and
which ones are minor enough that you can take care of yourself at a
later time?
 Who will be responsible for fixing the most-pressing items? You can
ask the seller to take care of the repairs (including paying for them), or
you can plan to have them done after you own the home.
 If you plan on taking care of the repairs, do you want to ask the seller
for a reduction in the purchase price? This may come in the form of a
check from the seller to you at closing.
 Should you still go through with the purchase? If any of the problems
are too costly for you to repair or call into question the integrity of 
the structure, rethink whether you want to invest so much money into 
this home.
The next section covers in more detail your options for handling problems.
What to Do When the Inspection 
Turns Up Problems
No home is perfect. And the problems in a home can range from the trivial —
missing electrical faceplates on the outlets in the living room or a bathroom
sink stopper that needs to be replaced — to the major — a pool that leaks 
an inch of water each day or an air conditioning condenser that needs a good
swift kick to get it going every morning. It’s a given that your second home
will come with a few relatively minor, let’s call them, “idiosyncrasies.”
In some unfortunate cases, your second home will have major defects. You’ll
want to get these ironed out before you buy, or you’ll need to accept a few per-
sistent problems and their subsequent aggravation as part of the ownership
process. If you and the seller can’t agree on solutions to major problems, you
may want to walk away from the home. In this section, I help you work through
these issues.
Getting the seller to fix problems
In some states, sellers are required by law to disclose any known defects 
with a property as soon as they put it on the market (see the “Understanding
Disclosure Statements” section). If the home inspection turns up more prob-
lems than those that are listed on the disclosure statement, then the seller is
normally the first in line to take care of the repairs.
125
Chapter 7: Inspecting Your Second Home before You Sign on the Dotted Line

Threatening to walk away from the deal is one way to get the seller to sit up
and take notice. You can also ask the seller for concessions (you fix this major
issue, I’ll take care of the smaller problems) that will help both of you get to
the closing table in a satisfied state.
If the problems are small, the seller will usually deal with them to keep the
sale moving forward. If the repairs are large (and, thus, costly), then the
process outlined in the next section will commonly kick into action. Everyone
jumps into the fray — the seller, the buyer, the real estate agent — with a
single, common goal: Get the deal to the closing table.
Instead of fixing the problems herself, the seller may be flexible with the pur-
chase price or contract terms if major problems are found. If you’re willing to
accept a price reduction and then take care of the repairs yourself (or not, if
you don’t care about some of them — not everyone wants a central vac, for
instance), then this option may work in your favor.
Otherwise, it’s up to you and the seller to negotiate a solution to the repairs
that you can both agree to, or accept that the transaction will likely fall
through. If you take a more flexible approach and decide that a few loose roof
shingles, a broken dishwasher, and a leaky faucet in the guest bathroom are
“minor,” then by all means close on the home and have them fixed yourself.
Negotiating over major repairs
Sometimes a home inspection will turn up problems that you and/or the
owner simply don’t want to deal with. For example, say that gorgeous Myrtle
Beach pool home that you’ve had your eye on for two years is actually a
money pit in disguise. According to the home inspector’s report, the pool
needs an $8,000 resurfacing job (and is now leaking as a result), the heating
and A/C unit doesn’t run well and may soon fail altogether, and the steps
leading up to the front door are rotted and need to be replaced.
How can you handle these issues? Keep the following potential steps in mind
when dealing with inspection problems:
1. The process starts with the seller, who — as long as the home isn’t
selling “as is” — must shoulder the responsibility of doing whatever 
is necessary to bring the home up to “selling shape.”
As the prospective buyer, you don’t have to deal with these issues.
(Check out the earlier “Getting the seller to fix problems” section.)
2. If the seller doesn’t want to shell out the money it’s going to cost to
resolve the potential problems, then negotiate.
If you want the home badly, and the price is right, perhaps you can split
the cost of the repairs.
126
Part II: Searching for Your New Home and Sealing the Deal 

3. The listing real estate agent may kick in some of her commission to
make the transaction work.
(Hey, don’t laugh. This is an entirely feasible scenario if the agent wants
to sell the house badly enough.)
4. If none of these strategies work, however, then you’re faced with a
tough decision, which boils down to precisely two choices:
• Pull the plug on the transaction.
• Pay for the repairs yourself.
Because no two real estate transactions are alike, you’ll have to look carefully
at your own situation to help you decide whether it’s worth closing on this
second home. You need to understand that every home (yes, even brand-new
ones) will have at least a short “to fix” list after a home inspector makes his
way through it. It’s up to you to decide whether that list is short enough and
determine if the seller is willing to do the necessary repairs or maybe com-
pensate you (by cutting the price) for the cost of fixing them.
You may walk away from this property, but the next buyer will also want a
home inspection, and that one will turn up the identical problems that yours
uncovered. Make sure that your agent explains this to the seller before you
back out. It may give you some bargaining power in getting those critical
items fixed — or scoring a significant enough reduction in the price to pay 
for the repairs yourself.
This Is It! Deciding Whether 
to Buy the Home
A home inspector can go through the second home you have under contract in
a thorough, professional manner. He can point out problems, suggest improve-
ments, and probably give you an idea of repair costs. He can send you a volu-
minous report detailing nearly every inch of your potential domicile, and he
can back up his evaluations based on past experience and industry knowledge.
What he can’t do, however, is make the final decision on your home purchase.
You have to do that yourself, based on the information he’s provided you, what
you already know, and what you know you want out of your second home.
Before buying, carefully consider the questions in the following sections that
look at basics of the home, the inspection report, and your own needs.
127
Chapter 7: Inspecting Your Second Home before You Sign on the Dotted Line

Accepting the home’s basic features
Some factors you just can’t change about a home, as much as you may want to.
If you can’t live with these features today, you can be certain you won’t want to
live with them every few months during visits, or a few years down the road, if
you plan to retire to your second home. Think about these questions:
 How old is the home that you want to buy? It’s no big secret that older
structures need more TLC and upkeep — all of which costs money. And
takes time. And causes headaches. Older homes can, in some cases, also
be harder to finance. Banks may not want to lend on a very old home,
and insurance may be more difficult and/or expensive to obtain.
Also keep in mind that there’s a difference between a house’s effective
age and its chronological age. (Yes, just like people and their health pro-
files! You’ve heard of situations where 50-year-olds are said to have the
“blood pressure of an 18-year-old.” Same thing.) A house’s effective age
reflects how old a home is based on its condition and improvements,
whereas chronological age is the actual age from time of construction.
For example, if a house is 75 years old, but it has a brand-new 30-year
roof, then obviously that’s what you take into account when calculating
the longevity of the roof.
 What is the home made of? Wood is good, but concrete slab and block
construction is safer when it comes to a fire risk. Insurance companies
take into consideration what homes are built of and rates will vary — 
up and down — based on a home’s construction. You may even see a dif-
ference in mortgage rates if you buy a brick house. You don’t like brick
houses, you say? Fine, but just be aware of the differences in construction
when looking at second homes and know what these differences mean.
 Is the home’s “great outdoors” not so great? Take a good look at the
grounds, the condition of any trees on the property, the state of the lawn
and bushes, and any other external elements. Huge patchy spots on the
lawn, obviously sick trees, yellowing or dead bushes, huge puddles of
standing water, and any other blatantly “not right” exterior basics are
worrisome and can cost you big bucks down the line.
Envisioning yourself in the home
Whether you spend only a few weeks of the year in your second home or
nearly every weekend there, you need to know that you’re going to be happy
in it. If you’re buying this property as the place you’ll live in after retirement,
it’s doubly important to make sure that you’ve found a homey dwelling.
Consider these factors:
128
Part II: Searching for Your New Home and Sealing the Deal 

 How many levels is the home? If you had your heart set on a single-level
ranch, but that gorgeous bi-level called out to you during a showing,
think twice and be sure that you end up buying something that suits your
lifestyle. If, for example, an extra floor — and its extra set of stairs — will
make visits from an elder relative difficult, you may want to reconsider
your choice. Multilevel homes are spacious and afford more privacy, but
they also bring with them stairs. A rhyming reminder: Stairs can be a
bear for those for whom we care. (And I’m a real estate expert, not a
poet, by the way — and you can probably tell why.)
 What are the individual spaces like? Take a good look at all the rooms
in the house and try to picture your family using them. Is one of the 
bedrooms big enough for your daughter and her doll collection? Is the
master suite large enough for your liking? And for your furniture’s liking?
Is there plenty of closet space? Are there enough bathrooms? Will every-
one be cramped and in the ideal situation to annoy each other? Or will
they be comfortable enough to enjoy themselves? The features of a
home that affect our day-to-day lives often become the most important.
Take all these things into consideration before buying.
 Is the kitchen big enough? If you’re not really into cooking, dining, and
socializing in and around your kitchen, then skip ahead. A good-sized
kitchen probably won’t matter that much to you. However, if you’re 
like a lot of us, you tend to gravitate toward this room more than once
during the course of a day. (If “How long are you going to stand there
with the refrigerator door open?” sounds familiar to you, take an extra-
good look at the kitchen.) Make sure the kitchen is big enough for your
lifestyle, and that the appliances are on par (or replaceable) for how you
expect to live in your second home.
Taking the inspection report into account
You didn’t spend a couple of hundred dollars on a home inspection and a
good chunk of time with the inspector to just disregard his findings. It’s 
critical to think about the following questions:
 What does the roof look like? Here’s where an inspector can help — big
time — by telling you the age of the roof and giving you his assessment
of its condition. He’ll most likely say something like, “There are X
number of years left on this roof.” You should pay attention to him when
he says this. A roof can be one of the most expensive elements of a home
to replace, so think about this information carefully. “X” years will be
here before you know it, y’know?
129
Chapter 7: Inspecting Your Second Home before You Sign on the Dotted Line

 How old and how efficient are the major systems? Water heaters, air
conditioning units, heating systems, and plumbing are all expensive to
repair or replace, so check the estimated age of each system and be sure
that your inspector gives you his opinion of how much life is left in each
of them. If the homeowner is present, you can also ask her if she’s had
any problems with any of those systems and if she’s made any repairs to
them in the last few years, or if she’s replaced anything big (or ask your
real estate agent to get this information for you). For example, a central
A/C unit that’s only a couple of years old is a plus. Likewise a relatively
new water heater. Also talk about her utility bills with her: electric, gas,
water, heating oil. You can determine how efficient these systems are
when you have an idea of what these expenses run each year.
 What else could go wrong with this home? Pools, hot tubs, and fire-
places are all great, fun amenities in any second home, but they can also
be nightmares if they’re not operating properly. As you give the home in
question a good hard look, ask yourself: What could go wrong with these
various “toys”? Pools and hot tubs leak. Fireplaces stop venting prop-
erly. Built-in intercoms stop working. And on a personal note, every one
of these things happened to me in my Florida home, despite the fact that
I had a thorough home inspection before I bought. Keep these issues in
mind as you ooh and ahh over the delightful extras that come with the
home, and as images of romantic nights before the fireplace and glorious
summer days by the pool cloud your thoughts. As Cher said to Nicolas
Cage in Moonstruck, “Snap out of it!”
Handling Long-Distance Inspections:
How to Protect Yourself
Don’t fret if you’re buying a home that’s outside of your geographic area and
you simply can’t be present for the inspection.
Just be sure to select a reputable inspector (use the guidelines from the
“Finding and Hiring a Reputable Inspector” earlier in this chapter to make
sure you do precisely that) and, if possible, have your real estate agent (or
another trustworthy person) attend the inspection and report back to you
any problems or issues that come up. (You may want to make attending the
inspection a condition of your agent’s representation. Why not? It’s one more
house call for them, and you’ve got peace of mind.)
If you can’t attend the inspection, schedule a follow-up phone call with the
inspector as soon as possible after the inspection. Ask for his thoughts on
the overall condition of the home, and question him about details of the
report that require more explanation.
130
Part II: Searching for Your New Home and Sealing the Deal 

Remember that home inspectors rely heavily on their reputations to score
new and repeat business. This means that a high percentage of them are care-
ful to prepare accurate, helpful reports that can help second-home buyers
make the right purchase choices. The fact that you’re not watching him like a
hawk as he moves around the home has nothing to do with his ability to con-
duct his inspection and prepare a report that you can put to good use when
purchasing your second home and negotiating any repairs with the seller.
Home inspectors put their reputations on the line with each report they write.
This should bolster your confidence in the process and assure you that you’ll
be properly taken care of. As long as you hire a pro, you’ll be in good shape.
Understanding Disclosure Statements
Sellers must disclose facts about the home that can negatively affect the 
purchase price or a buyer’s interest in the property. If the seller knows 
something about his house that he is almost certain would turn off a buyer, 
as much as he hates to do it, he has to spill the beans and disclose it.
The seller’s real estate agent will have him fill out a disclosure statement.
Disclosure statements were created to protect consumers from making 
uneducated home-buying decisions. These statements give you, as the
home’s prospective buyer, an idea of what defects the home has, or at 
least the defects the seller knows about. That’s why you need to get the
home inspected — to reveal problems that may not show up on the 
disclosure statement.
Some disclosures are straightforward, such as admitting that a pool leaks 1
inch per week during the dry season. Others are a little more, well, curious.
Like whether a death occurred in the home within the last three years.
(Believe it or not, this is required in California and some other states.
Apparently enough people don’t want to buy homes in which someone 
has died that disclosing it needed to be codified into law.)
Some states require disclosures about whether the home is in an earthquake
zone; what natural disasters have occurred in the area; whether those lovely
trees up on the ridge pose a fire hazard; and the fact that the noise from
incoming jets is so loud you won’t be able to have a conversation with your
mother in your backyard when a 747 is coming in for a landing. Your real
estate agent will help you navigate these waters by pointing out which disclo-
sures are required in your state. For example, the lead-based paint disclosure
is an example of a fairly clear-cut disclosure. The seller of a home built before
1978 must disclose whether he knows if any lead-based paint was used in the
131
Chapter 7: Inspecting Your Second Home before You Sign on the Dotted Line

home. This only applies to homes built before 1978 because, after that, 
lead-based paint was outlawed. (Unfortunately, you can still buy it in some
places.) If this is an issue with your second home — either the seller is cer-
tain the paint was used, or simply doesn’t know — then you’ll have ten days
to conduct an inspection for the problematic substance. After you know, then
you can decide how to proceed.
Take disclosure statements with a grain of salt. It’s nice to think that every-
thing “bad” about a property will be listed on them, but it’s unrealistic to
assume that every homeowner is going to be 100 percent honest when filling
them out. That’s why God made home inspectors.
Use the disclosure statements to support your home-buying effort. If the
statements turn up something disturbing that you can’t afford to manage,
negotiate your way out of, or that you simply don’t want to deal with, then
move on. There are lots of homes out there for sale.
If, however, the statements are clean enough to keep you moving forward and
counting the days toward that closing date, then forge ahead and proceed
with the purchase.

Financing Your Second Home 
and Closing the Deal
In This Chapter
 Beginning to finance your second home: What you need to know
 Looking at different financing options
 Paying with cash
 Preparing for closing day
 Insuring your property
 Wrapping up the purchasing process
H
ave you found the second home you want to buy? Have you signed 
a contract and are you ready for the “fun stuff,” also known as the
financing? No need to be scared. Although negotiating all the financing for
your second home may at first be intimidating, I’m not going to leave you
treading water.
This chapter explains the major aspects of financing, including discussions
on the differences between a primary mortgage and a secondary mortgage,
credit scores, taxes, and homeowners’ insurance, all of which will at some
point be blips on your second-home-buying radar screen. Big green blips —
important blips — that should not be ignored or treated lightly.
For you cash-rich buyers (you know who you are), I include a section on 
how to make the right choices when you have the luxury of avoiding the 
traditional mortgage system and forking over cash for your second home
instead. There are pros and cons to this strategy. I go over both so you can
make the right decision if you’re sitting on a pile of cash that keeps nagging
you to spend it on a second home. Understand that this chapter isn’t really a
“how-to” on financing your home, but instead a look at the different options
you can choose from. For the heavy stuff, you’ll want to talk to a pro. But this
chapter will give you a solid foundation of info you need to know before you
get too deep into the financing process.

Starting the Financing Process
When you buy a second home, you’ll pay cash for the home, take out a 
mortgage for it, or — as most people do — use a combination of these two
payment options. In this section, I explain why a second-home mortgage is
different than a primary-home mortgage (at least to the lender), how your
credit score factors in (and how to improve it), and how to be sure that your
own financial house is in order so you’re ready to purchase a new property.
Understanding how second-home loans
differ from primary-home loans
Second-home loans are different than primary-home loans. And you need to
know how they’re different when you embark on the second-home safari.
For starters, when you buy a second home, you’re promising a lender that on
top of the basic expenses associated with owning your primary home, you
can also take on the responsibility and added expenses of another property.
For some, this is just not possible, considering that a good portion of the
average American’s paycheck goes for mortgage payments, property taxes,
insurance, repairs, and maintenance. (And we still have to eat, too!)
With a second-home mortgage, consider the following differences:
 Higher down payment: At closing, you’ll probably have to come up with
20 percent or more of the purchase price as a down payment, because
lenders know that in the event of a financial emergency, the second-
home mortgage payment will be a lower priority. Because of this reality,
lenders like to see a substantial down payment, which signifies a gen-
uine commitment to the purchase and the debt.
 Slightly higher interest rate: Mortgages on second homes historically
have higher interest rates and closing costs than those on primary resi-
dences. It isn’t uncommon for second-home mortgage interest rates to
run a quarter to a half point higher than a first mortgage.
 Higher mortgage payments: Your second-home mortgage itself may 
be more expensive because of the higher interest rate. Also, the homes
themselves are more expensive, probably because so many are located
in highly desirable areas — places vacationers flock to on a regular
basis. The same two-bedroom, two-bathroom townhouse in Indianapolis,
Indiana, for example, would certainly cost more if purchased in Myrtle
Beach, South Carolina.
134
Part II: Searching for Your New Home and Sealing the Deal 

A lender may offer a variety of mortgages that require that you pay points. A
point is 1 percent of the mortgage amount, usually paid in cash at the time of
the closing. Why pay points? To get a lower interest rate on your mortgage.
Points are essentially interest you’re paying early to reduce the amount of
total interest paid. Lenders offer a wide array of products both with and with-
out points, so shop around and see which plan works best for you, factoring
in the amount upfront as a down payment and then the monthly payments
until you find the one you’re most comfortable with.
Lenders also want to know if your home will be owner occupied or empty, or
rented out for any period of time during the year. If you’re planning on renting
it (see Chapter 11 for more info), then lenders will view your second home as
an investment property, and use a different set of rules to determine whether
they should loan you money for the purchase. Your mortgage interest rate, for
example, will likely be higher than it would be if you were using your second
home as a traditional vacation home. Some lenders may not even be willing to
get involved in financing a second home that will be used as a rental property.
This is because selling these loans on the secondary market (that’s where
lenders sell the loans in packages to other lenders) can be difficult.
But you can get around those rental issues. You’ll have an easier time of get-
ting a loan if you can prove that the property will, indeed, generate cash flow
on an annual basis. You’ll probably be asked for a cash-flow statement show-
ing the income you can expect from the property.
The good news is that, like the primary mortgage market, second-home
lenders have become more lenient over the last few years, and now offer a
variety of options for second-home buyers. Don’t be discouraged, and do be
prepared to put some extra elbow grease into finding the right lender, and
your efforts are sure to pay off.
Fe, FICO, fo, fum: A look at credit scores
You may be earning big bucks — say, $500,000 a year — and paying for your
expensive cars, big-screen TVs, elaborate vacations, and luxury goods in
cash, but if your FICO credit score is considered poor by mortgage industry
standards, you won’t get a good interest rate on financing for your second
home. (FICO stands for Fair, Isaac & Co. Inc., the company that first evaluated
individuals’ credit histories.)
If your credit score is really subpar, you may not even be able to get financing
at all. That’s because lenders look at your past payment history before they
look at anything else. All of your financial activity — both positive and 
negative — is wrapped up into that one neat little number.
135
Chapter 8: Financing Your Second Home and Closing the Deal

Understanding what your FICO score really means
The numerical FICO score range is 375 to 900 points. The lowest numbers 
are the worst and the highest numbers are the best. To come up with a FICO
number for you, the three credit-reporting bureaus analyze your credit his-
tory, factoring in the following issues:
 Late payments on revolving debt (such as credit cards and other 
mortgages)
 How long ago you established credit
 How much credit is used versus how much is available
 How long you’ve lived in your current home
 How long you’ve worked at your job and other employment history
 The presence of negative marks against your credit, such as bankruptcies
and collections
These factors are in order of importance. Thus, the bureaus consider late
payments the most serious problem when evaluating potential borrowers.
Historically, anyone with a 700 score was considered an “A” credit risk, while
anyone with 720 or higher was “AA” credit. This changed in 2006 when the
three credit bureaus, Equifax, Experian, and TransUnion, devised the follow-
ing simplified scale:
A = 901–990
B = 801–900
C = 701–800
D = 601–700
F = 375–600
If you’re unsure of your own grade, request an updated credit score for your-
self and any other borrowers to find out exactly where you all stand before
you apply for a mortgage.
To request a free credit report, visit www.annualcreditreport.com. A
credit report shows how long you’ve held employment, how much of your
available credit you’re using, and how long you’ve lived at specific addresses,
thus creating a complete financial history. Check all these details carefully.
Errors are common on credit reports and you should correct any that you
136
Part II: Searching for Your New Home and Sealing the Deal 

find as soon as possible. Contact the reporting agency and ask about the 
specific procedure to correct mistakes.
You can request a free report once every 12 months from each of the credit-
reporting companies: Equifax, Experian, and TransUnion. Make sure to check
all three credit reporting companies because the credit score for each will be
different because each one uses its own criteria and the lender will always
look at all three before approving a loan. But keep in mind that free credit
reports don’t include your credit score. You can check it over for mistakes
and make sure everything is accurate, but you’ll have to buy your credit
score from one of the agencies if you want to know what it is.
If after you receive your report, you don’t like what you see, read on.
Improving your FICO score
You can improve your credit score in several ways, but most of them take
some time to implement. Knowing your score before you start applying for 
a mortgage gives you time to start correcting any problems. Here are some
basic steps you can take:
 Pay your bills on time. Late payments and collections can have a 
significant negative impact on your credit score.
 Avoid filling out every credit application that comes your way.
Applying for too many credit cards makes it look like you’re trying 
to get credit from a number of sources — not a good sign to a lender. 
This, too, can negatively impact your overall score.
 Don’t max out your credit cards. The higher your balance relative to
the total credit line, the worse off you’ll be, so reduce your credit card
balances as much as possible.
 If you don’t have credit, get some. It’s important that your credit record
shows paid as agreed. You need this paper trail.
 Get more credit if you need it. Not having enough available credit —
which proves that you’re capable of paying on a revolving basis — can
negatively impact your score. If you need to boost your levels of credit,
apply for one or two credit cards and use them monthly (and, if possi-
ble, pay them off in full every month).
It can take months for “positive” marks (made possible by creditors who
report your payments or payoffs) to find their way onto your credit report
and improve your credit score. It doesn’t happen overnight. If your credit
score is in need of an upgrade, start working on it now.
137
Chapter 8: Financing Your Second Home and Closing the Deal

Getting your financial house in order
Before you fill out any second-home mortgage applications, cash out your IRA,
or hit up your family and friends for cashola, make sure your own financial
house is in order. (Maybe you already did this in Chapter 2, but you can’t be 
too cautious.) Take a close look at the following areas, taking into consideration
exactly how much you’re spending each month, how much money is coming 
in the door, and how much “extra” you have left at the end of the month.
 Your monthly income
 Your total liquid assets (cash, along with investments that can be easily
turned into cash)
 Your monthly expenses (bills, repairs, maintenance, your kid’s room 
and board at college, money you send your parents, and so forth)
 How much extra money you need to keep in reserve as a life cushion
(money that shouldn’t be allocated to a down payment or monthly 
payments on a new loan)
 How much money you have left over to pay the mortgage payment,
taxes, insurance, and other expenses of your second home
If everything’s working, you’re ready to proceed with your second-home pur-
chase. If your review reveals problems — for example, you discover you’re
spending way too much on luxuries that you can easily cut back on — shows,
restaurants, shopping splurges — then make some adjustments so the ins
and outs better line up.
Get your financial house in order three to six months before you plan to buy
a second home. With enough advance planning, any issues that come up can
be resolved well in advance of the home’s financing and ultimate purchase.
Okay, you’ve checked the numbers and you’re ready to take the plunge.
Now’s the time to start making copies of the pertinent paperwork that you’ll
be required to show to a lender, beginning with the following basics (you’ll
also need copies of the same documents for all cosigners):
 Pay stubs
 Tax returns and copies of W-2s (for the last three years)
 Checking and savings account statements (for the last 12 months)
 Additional documents that can prove your income (such as copies 
of alimony checks, child-support payments, and so forth)
 Any other paperwork that would support any income that you’re 
claiming, such as rental income on other properties
 Your driver’s license and Social Security card
138
Part II: Searching for Your New Home and Sealing the Deal 

While you’re tuning up your financial house, you can start putting together 
a file of these papers. It’s often easier to do it well in advance of when you’ll
actually need all this stuff.
You can expect your lender to ask for more documents, but having these
handy will expedite the process and make it easier when the time comes to
fill out a mortgage application and turn over the supporting documents.
How not to end up house poor
House poor is a phrase that’s thrown around a lot in real estate circles. It basi-
cally defines a situation in which the homeowner pays out nearly all of his
monthly income in housing payments, maintenance, utilities, and repairs. The
outgo is so great that there’s not much left for dining, entertainment, movies,
concerts, or any other fun stuff. The thought of having two significant drains
on a budget can be scary, but if you plan it out carefully and correctly (using
the self-assessment information covered in Chapter 2), you can conquer the
challenge.
To avoid ending up house poor, keep the following pointers in mind:
 Don’t stretch yourself too thin. If you know that $5,000 comes into your
bank account every month, and $4,500 of it is spoken for, then don’t take
out a mortgage that sets you back another $1,500 a month.
 If your current financial situation puts you out of the running for the
chance at a second home, check into some alternative options. You
can consider timesharing or fractional ownership, whereby several
owners go in together to purchase a second home. (See Chapter 3 for
more on these options.)
Getting preapproved for a mortgage 
before you find your home
Getting a preapproval letter from a lender before you start looking for a home
can help you gain an edge on the competition — those other buyers who may
be eyeballing the very home you’ve decided you absolutely must have. Being
preapproved means, in a nutshell, that a lender has committed, in writing, to
lend you the money for your second home.
A preapproval letter is an especially valuable tool in a hot market where
homes are selling fast and sellers don’t want to bother with buyers who can’t
afford to buy. (No seller wants to lose a sale they’ve committed to because
the buyer’s financing “fell through.”) Preapproval gives you peace of mind,
139
Chapter 8: Financing Your Second Home and Closing the Deal

knowing that you can afford what you’re looking at — and being able to state
this with certainty to the seller.
Keep in mind that there is a difference between being prequalified and preap-
proved. The prequalification process isn’t nearly as thorough as being preap-
proved and boils downs to nothing but an “estimate” of what you can afford.
Yet, you go through the same motions during the process — credit approval,
income verification, and so on — that you do when you apply for a loan. My
advice is to avoid prequalification and shoot for the preapproval process.
Knowing Your Financing Options
The good news is that you have many lending options available to you as a
second-home buyer. You can use traditional mortgages to finance your pur-
chase, or you can investigate innovative loans. You can put lots of money
down upfront or just a little bit. You can ask friends, family, or even the seller
for funds. The bad news is that sorting through all these choices to find the
one that’s right for you is no easy task. This section gives you a brief overview
of the basic financing options and some tips on how to tap into them.
Relying on traditional mortgages
Cash is always king when it comes to buying a second home — if you’ve got
that kind of cash at your disposal — but many buyers take on a mortgage to
finance the property. In this section, I show you the most common loans that
buyers use.
The two most popular types of mortgages are adjustable-rate mortgages (ARMs)
and fixed-rate mortgages. The main difference between these mortgages is in
the interest rates; the interest rate fluctuates (or adjusts) over the life of an
ARM, while the interest rate remains exactly the same (or fixed) for the life 
of a fixed-rate mortgage. (Now you know how they got those creative names.)
Adjustable-rate mortgages (ARMs)
An adjustable-rate mortgage (ARM) uses an interest rate that is linked to 
an economic index. The lender periodically raises or lowers the loan’s inter-
est rate and your monthly payments as the index fluctuates. The lowering 
of the rate and payments is the ARM’s advantage; the disadvantage is when
your rate and payments go up.
140
Part II: Searching for Your New Home and Sealing the Deal 

There are different types of ARMs, such as those loans that start out
adjustable (for two, three, five, or more years, usually) and then transform
into fixed-rate mortgages for the remaining number of years. Or an ARM may
always be variable: For as long as you carry the loan, the interest and pay-
ments will fluctuate based on the index.
The most common index used for calculating ARM interest rates is the one-
year U.S. Treasury note. The interest rate is recalculated weekly, although
ARMs adjust according to the terms of the loan. The lender will add a margin
(the fixed portion of your loan rate which, when added to the index rate,
equals your full interest rate) to the rate of the most recent one-year note at
your adjustment date, and voilà, that’s your new interest rate. Talk to your
lender for the specific details and rates.
Be sure to check out the current mortgage and real estate market before
taking out an ARM. The historically low interest rate environment of the early
2000s made ARMs extremely desirable. Why? Because their rates reflected
the industry’s steadily falling rates. But this period passed, and as rates
began to climb, ARMs fell out of favor as many buyers scrambled to “lock in”
low rates with fixed-rate mortgages.
141
Chapter 8: Financing Your Second Home and Closing the Deal
Using a retirement savings account 
for your down payment
You can tap your Individual Retirement Account
(IRA) for your second-home purchase, but care-
fully investigate all the advantages and disad-
vantages before making such a move. Your IRA
is your retirement nest egg, after all, and you
don’t want to leave yourself short later, or
scramble to make up for what you cashed in.
For those of you have larger 401(k)s (compared
to your IRAs), you may consider tapping that
resource first because the same rules apply.
You can tap your IRA for a down payment with-
out paying penalties, if you’re a first-time home
buyer. The IRS defines first-time home buyer as
someone who hasn’t purchased a home within
the last two years. So if you purchased your pri-
mary home 15 years ago and are still paying the
mortgage, you qualify as a first-time home buyer
to the IRS and can make use of the benefits
regarding using your IRA as a down payment.
You can withdraw a maximum of $10,000 from
your IRA to put toward your down payment.
That’s the limit the IRS allows each person. If
both you and your spouse have IRAs to tap, the
total you can use is $20,000. The money has to
be used within 120 days of receiving it.

Fixed-rate mortgages
The interest rates on fixed-rate mortgages are locked in for the life of the
loan, typically 15, 20, or 30 years. Monthly payments are steady and pre-
dictable, but if interest rates happen to bottom out when you’ve owned 
your second home for ten years, you’ll have to refinance to take advantage 
of them.
Considering financing your 
home through the seller
Depending on market conditions, some builders and owners may be willing
to personally finance the sales of their homes in order to unload them —
meaning that you, the buyer, pay the builder or seller directly instead of a
bank or mortgage company. When you finance through the seller, expect to
make monthly payments and a down payment on the loan.
This arrangement is particularly useful when you can’t obtain any other 
kind of financing, or when you’re purchasing the home from a friend or 
relative whom you know and trust. Trust is the key here. Anytime you enter
into a financial relationship with an individual rather than a company, you
take a risk.
Even if you have every reason to trust the person with whom you’re dealing,
follow the first rule of business: Put the deal in writing. An attorney is an
absolute must for such deals, and you should consult one before you sign
anything or hand over any cash to the seller. And it should be your attorney
who drafts the paperwork.
If you explore this financing option, remember that you don’t always have to
rely on the seller for all the financing. You can get part of the financing through
a lender, with the seller providing the balance of the funding you need.
Adding a second mortgage 
on your primary home
One way to pay for your second home is by taking out a second mortgage on
your primary home. You borrow money against the existing equity (the sales
price of your primary home, less the amount of money owed on the mort-
gage) in your primary home and use the money to pay for your second home.
142
Part II: Searching for Your New Home and Sealing the Deal 

The two main types of second mortgage loans include
 Home equity loans: You borrow a lump sum amount against the total
amount of your home’s value. A homeowner with a $500,000 house that
she only owes $200,000 on (in the form of a mortgage) can theoretically
borrow up to $300,000 in equity from the home (based on the individual
lender’s requirements and approval).
Many home equity lenders cap the amount they’re willing to loan against
equity at 75 or 80 percent. Some will go to 100 percent of the equity, but
a reduced percentage is more common.
 Home equity lines of credit (HELOC): A lender gives you a revolving
credit line that works like a credit card and only incurs interest on the
amount of money that is borrowed — meaning the amount you actually
spend from the credit line amount.
You can use a line of credit to pay for some or all the home’s sales price
and closing costs. But the lender will want something as collateral to
secure the credit line. That can be a business you own, another prop-
erty, that gold coin collection hiding in your closet, or that comic book
collection you’ve had for decades and were just offered 50 grand for.
Second-mortgage lenders take on significant risk when they make these
loans. The first mortgage always gets paid, well, first in the case of foreclo-
sure, and there may be little or nothing left over for the second guy to collect.
Thus, the interest rates are higher for second-mortgage loans than they are
for primary mortgages.
Using a home equity loan to buy a second home can create problems if you
default on your first mortgage and your primary home goes into foreclosure.
Speak to your financial experts and advisers about what could happen to
your second home if you lose your first home so you go into the situation
with your eyes open. Also check out Personal Bankruptcy Laws For Dummies
by James P. Caher and John M. Caher (Wiley).
Using a reverse mortgage 
to buy a second home
If you’re not 62 or older, you can skip this section. However, if you’re nearing
62, like the many baby boomers who are purchasing second homes today, or
if you’re the child of a baby boomer who has purchased a second home, then
make sure you read this section.
Most seniors commonly have a large amount of equity in their homes. A
reverse mortgage provides a means for tapping home equity without creating
monthly payments for the homeowner. A reverse mortgage isn’t like a 
143
Chapter 8: Financing Your Second Home and Closing the Deal

conventional mortgage in which you make a monthly payment to a lender.
Instead, you receive monthly payments or a lump sum of cash from the bank
in return for a mortgage on your home. You can use this money to pay off an
existing second-home mortgage, make a down payment on a second home,
pay off debt, or simply have money to live on.
The property is used as security against the loan, which is paid off when you
pass away or when you sell the property and move to another home (per-
haps your second home). To be eligible, you must be 62 years old, and you
must own and live in the home you want to mortgage. When you take out a
reverse mortgage, you pay no monthly mortgage payments, but you’re still
responsible for property taxes, homeowners’ insurance, and maintenance
expenses. For more on reverse mortgages, check out Chapter 17.

Part II: Searching for Your New Home and Sealing the Deal 
Finding mortgages on the Net
The Internet has become the place to go for
prospective home buyers who are looking for
information on how to buy and finance a house.
You can get reams of facts with nothing but an
e-mail address and a zip code.
Granted, many of us are reluctant to give out
personal and financial information via the Web
(and for darned good reason), but as with all
financial matters, if you deal with established,
trusted institutions that protect customers’
information from fraud, theft, and misuse, you
shouldn’t have a problem. It’s done every day,
and security breaches are rare enough that
they make the news when they do happen. If
you’re questioning the legitimacy of a company,
pick up the phone and call the company. If it
sounds shady, it probably is.
A good place to start when searching for 
mortgage info on the Internet is at a site 
like LendingTree (www.lendingtree.com),
which aggregates consumer information, shares
it with lenders, and sifts through the information
to come up with multiple options for the buyer.
National mortgage lenders like Wells Fargo
(www.wellsfargo.com), GMAC Mortgage
(www.gmacfs.com), or CountrywideFinancial
(http://my.countrywide.com) are also
aces in my book. From these sites, you can check
current interest rates, read and find out about the
various programs offered, apply for loans, and
take myriad other steps toward second-home
ownership.
Also, be aware of Online Transaction
Management (OTM) if your second home is
some distance away from your primary home.
OTM companies can provide both sides of a
transaction with secure access to a Web site
where all the transaction’s pertinent documents
are stored and can be modified by either party
before the signing. When all the terms are
agreed upon and the forms completed, hard
copies of the documents are then sent to the
parties (mail-away transactions, they’re called)
for physical signing. OTM is fast and accurate
and may be right for you.

Borrowing money from family and friends
Got a well-off relative? A wealthy friend? And do these people like you? A lot?
If yes, then these folks may be great sources of money for a second home.
Your first challenge will be finding someone with the money to lend. But you
probably already have a short list of “People with Money” whom you know.
You then need to convince one of these people that you are not only set on
buying that second home, but that you can also afford to pay them back for
the amount borrowed.
If you borrow from a family member or friend, make sure it’s a personal loan
that is unsecured. This means that nothing you own, or will own, will be used
as collateral to secure the loan. Document the amount borrowed and how
you’ll pay it back. The lender will want to know.
If all goes well and your benefactor forks over the dough, this money can be
used to reduce the amount you need to borrow from a lender for a mortgage.
But know this well, my friends: Borrowing from family or friends comes with
more than the simple financial obligation of paying these people back; such
moves come with baggage. If all goes well, and you meet your repayment oblig-
ations on time, then nary a peep will be heard. But the first time you miss or
are late with a payment, then expect static. “You couldn’t pay me this month,
but you could go to Atlantic City for the weekend?” Bear this in mind when
deciding to borrow from people with whom you are personally involved.
Above all, these types of arrangements need to be done right, and that means
in writing, with everything — amount, payments, interest — spelled out in
detail. Have a legal contract drawn up and have everyone involved sign. “I
have to have a contract with my own mother?” you may be asking. The
answer is an unequivocal “yes.” Why? Because if something should happen to
your mother and she has property, then the borrowed amount becomes part
of the estate. When everything is in writing, then everything is clear. If all
these factors don’t spook you, then such loans can provide a solid founda-
tion for your second-home purchase.
Considering interest-only loans
Interest-only loans allow the second-home buyer to purchase a home with no
principal payments. You make payments only for the amount of interest that
accrues on the loan over a specified term. The loan terms are usually one to
ten years, at which point the principal is due. You then have two choices:
 Refinance to a more traditional loan option. This entails taking out an
entirely new loan for the balance owed (with closing costs and associ-
ated lender fees) under new terms.
145
Chapter 8: Financing Your Second Home and Closing the Deal

 Pay off the balance entirely. This equates to the original purchase price
plus any other closing costs that are wrapped into the mortgage, such
as prepayment penalties. (You can request a payoff amount at any time
from your lender.)
These loans have come under fire recently because many borrowers are 
getting hurt when the loan’s term expires. They need to refinance, and they
get hit with much higher monthly payments that they can’t affordably pay.
Interest-only loans can be useful for several types of buyers. If, for example,
you’re expecting a big payoff sometime in the foreseeable future — maybe an
inheritance, a large raise, a big commission payment, a significant bonus, a
lottery settlement, an insurance settlement, or a stock sale — using this type
of loan now and then paying off the total loan amount when it comes due
could be a good move.
Managing the Cash Deal
If you’re fortunate enough to be sitting on a pile of cash that you’re not cur-
rently using, then you may want to use some or all of it for your new second
home. When you pay cash for a home, you walk out of the closing with 100
percent equity. In this section, I look at the pros and cons of this strategy and
help you decide if paying cash is the best move for your situation.
The advantages of paying cash
If you’re bent on owning your second home outright, paying cash may be 
a smart alternative for you if you have a nice-sized stash that isn’t already
spoken for. If you’re seriously considering paying cash, the following are a
few advantages to doing so:
 You don’t have any liens or encumbrances hampering your enjoyment
of your place. You begin reaping the rewards of housing appreciation
right out of the gate because you don’t have a mortgage or interest to
pay off.
 You don’t have to worry about the interest costs and other administra-
tive fees that are typically associated with a mortgage. Closing costs
can be steep, but you don’t have to pay lender fees or credit check fees.
But just because a bank won’t be breathing down your neck about
appraisals (required when you get a mortgage) and pest inspections
(mandatory by some lenders), you’ll still want to have one of each before
you purchase. In fact, because you’ll become the immediate owner of
146
Part II: Searching for Your New Home and Sealing the Deal 

your new place, you need to have peace of mind that, first, you’re paying
the right price for the second home, and, second, that it isn’t infested
with wood-destroying insects such as termites. You should also have 
the home inspected (see Chapter 7 for more info on inspections).
 You could “flip” your house and make a nice profit. If the real estate
market really heats up shortly after you buy your second home and your
place appreciates enormously in value, you can sell it quickly and make
a nice profit. You may not want to do this if you love your new place and
are more interested in enjoying it than profiting from it, but this is a nice
option to have when you pay cash. Anything over your purchase price is
pure profit! (For more on flipping houses, check out Flipping Houses For
Dummies by Ralph R. Roberts and Joe Kraynak [Wiley]).
When you pay cash for a second home, in addition to the full selling price of
the home, you also have to come up with the transaction’s closing costs out
of pocket.
The disadvantages of paying cash
When considering paying cash for your second home, you need to think
about more than just whether you have the money to cover all the related
costs. You also need to keep in mind long-term tax strategies and the econ-
omy of the area where your second home will be located. Second-home
buyers sometimes view these factors as disadvantages to a cash deal:
 When you file your federal income taxes, you don’t get to deduct the
mortgage interest that you paid. You lose out on this key benefit of
homeownership. You need to figure out exactly how much money you
would save on taxes by taking out a mortgage, and compare that with
how much money you would save by not paying monthly principal and
interest payments. If calculating this is out of your realm, talk to an
accountant or financial advisor who is knowledgeable about the tax 
benefits of homeownership. She can set you straight as to which is the
smarter financial move. (Check out Chapter 14 for more info on the tax-
related benefits of mortgage interest.)
 The value of your new place may depreciate before it appreciates if
the home is in an area where home appreciation is stalled or heading
downward. If you’re paying cash, make sure your intended home is in an
area where appreciation is on the upswing. You’d also be smart to buy
where homes are priced below market value and ripe for an increase in
value. Talk to a real estate agent to determine which way the market is
headed. If he tells you that homes are losing value, consider saving your
money and taking out a mortgage.
147
Chapter 8: Financing Your Second Home and Closing the Deal

When is a mortgage the smart move?
When you pay cash for a house, you avoid the entire mortgage process:
choosing a lender, filling out never-ending piles of paperwork, figuring out
what sort of mortgage is best for your financial situation, and all the rest. 
But sometimes the application process is worth the hassle. A mortgage 
can be useful if:
 Mortgage interest rates are extremely low and outpace any investment
return that you can score by putting your money elsewhere. (We saw
this exact scenario during the real estate boom years of 1999–2005). If
the expected appreciation in your second home will result in a higher
return than putting your money into a CD paying almost nothing, then
you’re better off taking out a mortgage for your real estate investment.
 You want to keep your cash available to make other investments,
instead of pouring some or all of it into a second home.
 You don’t want to risk your entire cash investment should the home be
foreclosed upon. (Hey, it can happen. If, for example, you take out a
home equity loan at a later date and default on it, the second home
would be taken.)
 You want to take advantage of the generous mortgage interest deduction
offered by the IRS. (See the preceding section for more on this.)
Who does the transaction?
When you pay cash for a home, you and the seller have a couple of choices
as to how to close the transaction:
 Work with a real estate agent: If either or both of you are working with
a real estate agent, she will typically handle all the paperwork for you,
set up the closing, and tend to all the other required steps.
 Hire a professional who is familiar with real estate transactions: If
you’re buying an FSBO (for sale by owner) home and aren’t working 
with an agent, you can hire a transaction broker (see Chapter 6 for 
more on how to work with these professionals) for a flat fee to handle
the paperwork involved with the deal. You may also want to hire a real
estate attorney to review the paperwork and provide feedback.
Check out the statutes in the state where your second home is located to find
out whether a real estate lawyer is required for cash home-purchase transac-
tions. Some states require an attorney to oversee the paperwork.
148
Part II: Searching for Your New Home and Sealing the Deal 

As for the closing itself, it can take place at a title company or attorney’s
office. The seller may choose the location. A title company or escrow officer
can handle it. In this case, you and the seller don’t need to be present. (See
“Knowing What to Expect when Closing on a Second Home” for more details
about this process.)
As far as the buyer’s (your!) role in all this, it’s pretty simple and boils down
to two steps:
1. Have a cashier’s check made for the final amount (as calculated and
prepared by the pros you’re using).
2. Hand it over.
Knowing What to Expect when 
Closing on a Second Home
When it comes to real estate transactions, all roads lead to the closing table.
On that momentous day, the various parties convene at the closing table 
to sign the documents, turn over cashier’s checks, and walk away richer in
terms of money or —in the case of the second-home buyer — with a new set
of keys in hand.
But you just can’t walk in, sign a few papers, and walk out. You’re getting
ready to close on a significant investment, so you want to make sure that 
you come prepared, including bringing the right people and paperwork and
knowing what questions to ask. On the other hand, an escrow agent may
handle the closing, and all you have to do is pick up your keys. There are 
two types of closings, a round-table closing, which is when all parties involved
are present, and an escrow agent closing when just key people attend. This
section helps you get ready for that day and explains how to ensure that
nothing prevents you from walking out with the keys to your new castle.
Pulling all the paperwork together
The world revolves around numbers on paper. At least in financial matters 
it does. And nowhere is this more evident than in real estate transactions
where every amount is calculated to the penny, and every element of the 
deal is spelled out in precise detail.
149
Chapter 8: Financing Your Second Home and Closing the Deal

As you know from buying your primary home, lots of papers are created
when you buy a house. The settlement statement, the inspection report, the
proof of insurance, the sales contract, mortgage papers, and so on, and while
your agent will take care of requesting and compiling much of this stuff, by
the time closing day arrives, you will be in possession of most of them and
will be required to bring them with you. 
You need to bring these papers to a round-table closing, where you, the seller,
your agent and/or attorney, and the closing agent will be present to sign the
closing documents and close the deal:
 Your good faith estimate, given to you by your lender just after you
applied for your loan.
 A homeowners’ insurance policy or binder. (Check out “Buying the
Appropriate Homeowners Insurance on Your Second Home” later in 
this chapter for the lowdown.)
 The HUD-1 settlement statement that you received 24 hours (sometimes
earlier) before closing. (See the “‘Sign and date’ ad infinitum” section for
more details.)
 Your closing funds in the form of a cashier’s check.
 A driver’s license or picture ID.
Being prepared: Who to bring with you
At your closing day for your second home, you should have the following
people attend your round table closing:
 All your cosigners
 Your real estate agent (if you’re using one)
 Your real estate attorney (if you’re using one)
The title company or other closing agent will be on hand to orchestrate the
event. The seller typically chooses the closing location, which can be the title
company’s office or the seller’s attorney’s office.
If you want to bring your parents, kids, or supportive friends, by all means do
so, but understand that you’ll be conducting an important business transac-
tion in a professional environment. There will be no toys to occupy your kid-
dies, nor will questions by curious friends be entertained. So think twice
about whom you ask to accompany you to your closing.
150
Part II: Searching for Your New Home and Sealing the Deal 

“Sign and date” ad infinitum
At an escrow closing, which is what’s used in some states, neither party is
present. Because you’re likely more interested in the round-table closing —
and for good reason, because that’s the one you attend — the following 
information applies to that type of closing only.
Because you’ve purchased real estate before, you know that closing day
equals carpal tunnel syndrome, right? You go home on closing day with a
sore writing hand because you sign a ton of paperwork. You or your lawyer
should read all the documents. The closing agent will also explain some of
the wording in simpler terms. If your lawyer has read the ten-page homeown-
ers’ insurance declaration, you can probably skip reading every word of it if it
essentially boils down to “I have homeowners’ insurance in effect.”
Also, if you have questions about anything at anytime, don’t be afraid to pipe
up and ask. And do not sign forms with blank lines or spaces. If something
makes the hair on the back of your neck stand up, ask your real estate agent,
attorney, or closing agent for further explanation before signing. And sign
only after that hair has settled back into place.
You may have seen most of these documents when you closed on your first
home, but I want to give a quick overview of the major documents you’ll be
seeing (again):
 Your HUD-1 settlement statement: This is a detailed list of all costs
related to the home’s sale. Similar to the good faith estimate that you
received from your lender (the rough estimate of the numbers that were
refined to the penny for the closing), the HUD-1 reflects the actual settle-
ment costs that both you and the seller must pay (and both of you must
sign this document).
Settlement charges listed on the HUD-1 include, but aren’t limited to:
• Loan origination fees
• Appraisal fee
• Credit report fee
• Mortgage insurance application fee
• Mortgage insurance premium
• Hazard insurance premium
• Title examination fee
• Recording fees
151
Chapter 8: Financing Your Second Home and Closing the Deal

Before you break out your pen for this one, though, check the statement
carefully against the good faith estimate to ensure that the costs don’t
differ greatly. Some minor adjustments are okay because there were
bound to be small changes made between the signing of the purchase
contract and the closing.
When you compare the two forms, question any amounts that are
• Higher than what was originally quoted
• Added to the form where previously no charge was listed
If you aren’t satisfied with the answers you receive, don’t sign anything!
Speak up immediately to the closing agent about the discrepancy, and
let the professionals hash it out among themselves until the mistake is
corrected, or a legitimate explanation is presented — and accepted by
you. You can, of course, defer to your experts’ advice, but make sure
you’re satisfied that they’re sure it’s been corrected or explained. (Also
see the “What questions to ask” section later in this chapter.)
By law, you have the right to review the HUD-1 statement 24 hours
before closing. Avoid surprises by taking advantage of your legal right 
to review this document.
 Final Truth in Lending Act statement: You get the first copy of this
statement when you apply for a mortgage and the final version of it on
closing day. The TILA statement includes the cost of the loan and the
annual percentage rate, as well as any interest rate or point changes that
were made between the time you applied for the loan and closing day.
 Mortgage note: This is the biggie. When you put your John Hancock on
this one, you promise to repay the mortgage on your second home. This
document includes the amount of the loan and the loan terms, as well as
a gloriously specific summary of the bad stuff the lender can do to you
or your home if you fail to make your payments.
 Mortgage (or deed of trust): This document secures the mortgage 
note and provides the lender with the power to take your home if 
you fail to comply with the terms of that note — like, y’know, not 
paying it, for starters. The mortgage is, essentially, the written pledge
stating that your house is the collateral for the loan you’re taking out 
to pay for it.
 Certificate of occupancy: This is only applicable for newly constructed
homes. Buyers of new-built homes must sign this document to take
occupancy of their new domiciles. Some communities in some states
have a Point-of-Sale inspection ordinance before the title can transfer 
to the new buyer. Be sure to check this out before you get started.
152
Part II: Searching for Your New Home and Sealing the Deal 

What questions to ask
By the time you finally sit down at the closing table, you’ll have hopefully
asked — and had satisfactorily answered — any and all questions relating to
your second-home purchase. The closing table is not the place to “spring”
things on any of the parties. Seriously. Surprises are not looked on favorably
at these events, and unexpected major issues can delay the closing and jeop-
ardize the deal.
But that doesn’t mean you should not speak up about concerns you may
have. You should question documents you find confusing and ask whatever
other questions come to mind. You may, for example, want to know when
your first payment is due, or whether you will need to take care of any other
tax or legal issues after closing.
What if something’s different on 
paper than what you were told?
While carefully reading the paperwork that you’re signing, you notice a dis-
crepancy, what do you do? For example, if your $200,000 loan has magically
transformed itself into a $225,000 loan overnight, bring it to your real estate
agent’s or attorney’s attention immediately.
As soon as you notice any discrepancies in any numbers or terms, alert your
real estate agent or attorney immediately. They will then address these issues
with the lender or whoever drew up the paperwork (the problem may be a
clerical error). If the problem can’t be immediately resolved, and you’re sure
the problem is valid, then the closing should be delayed or postponed until
the issue is resolved. Don’t just sign something for expediency’s sake that
you’ll later regret. And don’t worry about inconveniencing the agents,
lawyers, and lender. This is their job and they’re not there out of the good-
ness of their heart. To them, your deal is another day’s work. But this is a
major financial event for you, so if you’re concerned, reschedule.
Buying the Appropriate Homeowners’
Insurance on Your Second Home
All second-home owners have to purchase insurance coverage for their
abodes. Some may be required to by their lenders; those paying cash must
simply protect their valuable investments on their own. If you’re buying prop-
erty in an area that’s particularly prone to natural disasters, you need to be
even more diligent about getting the right kinds and amounts of insurance.
153
Chapter 8: Financing Your Second Home and Closing the Deal

For example, in 2004, four hurricanes ripped through Florida — a popular
state in which to buy a second home — leaving behind a swath of destroyed
and damaged homes in need of repair and replacement. Homeowners
reached for their phones, and insurance providers reached for their check-
books. By 2006, the hubbub of settling claims had mostly subsided, but the
state of insurance affairs was very tenuous in one of the nation’s hottest
spots for vacation homes. It didn’t take a genius to recognize the value of —
and elusiveness of — good homeowners’ insurance for Florida residents.
In this section, I guide you through the basics of obtaining coverage — a step
that must be taken before closing on your home.
How much homeowners’ insurance 
do you need for a second home?
You’re getting ready to purchase a large investment. You want to protect that
investment, don’t you? To ensure that you get the appropriate coverage for
your second home, when you approach an insurance agent or other provider
for homeowners’ insurance, ask for a quote on the following:
 The home’s structure: You need enough insurance to cover the cost of
rebuilding your home at current construction rates. That means that
your $150,000 single-family vacation home may require $250,000 in 
structural coverage to build it from scratch today.
 Your personal possessions: Most policies cover your personal posses-
sions at the equivalent of 50 to 70 percent of the total structural insurance
you’ve taken out on your home. Talk to your insurance agent about the
limitations in this coverage area. Jewelry, for example, may be limited to
$1,000 to $2,000. If you plan to keep a $20,000 diamond necklace at your
second home, talk to your agent about additional coverage. You may want
to leave your expensive stuff at your first home because insuring high
value items at both homes can get costly.
 Additional living expenses: If your second home is damaged and you’re
forced to live elsewhere while it’s being repaired, the policy generally
covers your living expenses for a set period of time while your home is
rebuilt or repaired. This coverage is definitely necessary after you’ve
moved into your second home full time (see Chapter 16 for more on
moving into your second home). The amount offered varies from com-
pany to company.
 Liability coverage: Most homeowners’ insurance policies provide $100,000
of liability insurance (which covers you in case someone is hurt on your
property), although more coverage is available. Because of our increas-
ingly litigious society, more homeowners are buying $300,000 to $500,000 
in liability coverage.
154
Part II: Searching for Your New Home and Sealing the Deal 

Talk to your insurance agent about how much insurance to buy for your
second home. You need to decide on a comfortable self-insurance figure you
can live with, and your agent can help you figure that out. Being self-insured
simply means that you’ll foot the bill for whatever costs come up that are not
covered by your insurance in the event of a major loss. It’s a balancing act:
Total replacement coverage for absolutely everything in the house is expen-
sive, but maybe you want that type of protection and can afford it. If not, then
a lesser dollar amount that you feel will protect you in most circumstances
may be fine. Talk to your agent.
Considering flood insurance
If you’re buying a home that’s in a flood plain, then you definitely need to buy
flood insurance. No ifs, ands, or buts, unless you want to come home one day
to a foot of water throughout your house with no insurance to cover the
damage. Most standard homeowners’ policies do not cover flood damage
(read that part again, okay?), and also keep in mind that some lenders won’t
talk to you if you’re in a risk area and you decline to buy flood insurance.
Flood insurance covers losses to your property caused by flooding. So if a
hurricane hits your second home and causes major water damage from flood-
ing, your primary insurance probably won’t cover the flood damage, but your
flood insurance will. (Your homeowners’ insurance will cover damage caused
by wind or flying debris from the hurricane.)
A standard flood policy covers
 Structural damage inflicted by the flood (including damage done to 
furnaces, water heaters, and air conditioners)
 Cleanup of flood debris
 Repair or replacement of floor surfaces
 Damage from sewer backup if it’s caused by flooding (Damage from
sewer backup caused by a blockage or a broken pipe isn’t covered 
under standard flood policies, but may be covered by your standard
homeowners’ policy.)
 Contents that have been damaged by the flood (if you’ve purchased 
contents insurance)
How can you determine if your new home is near a flood plain and if you
need flood insurance? (I hope you did that research before your closing day.)
You can check out the National Flood Insurance Program’s Web site at
www.floodsmart.gov. Review the “What’s Your Flood Risk” determiner.
The site also offers a premium estimator tool that homeowners can use to
155
Chapter 8: Financing Your Second Home and Closing the Deal

figure out how much insurance they need on their second homes. On its
Quick Quote Residential page, for example, the NFIP cites a premium of
$2,053 per year for a building (and its contents) located in Zone A, which is
considered a high-risk flood area with a 1 percent annual chance of flooding.
Finding the best insurance deal
In the past few years, the insurance industry has been hit by high losses from
a large number of devastating storms (such as hurricanes and tornadoes)
and massive catastrophes (such as the terror attacks of September 11, 2001).
As a result, “deals” on property insurance have been harder and harder to
come by.
Your second home’s location plays a large role in just how much you pay for
the insurance, as does the fact that it’s a second home. Because you’re not
there all the time to keep an eye on the place and maintain it, insurance often
runs higher for these properties.
Going with an agent for help
When shopping around for homeowners’ insurance, first check with any
insurance agent or broker whom you’ve worked with in the past. If he can’t
help you, he likely knows someone who can. Check with consumer guides,
online insurance quote services (mentioned in the next section), and 
organizations like the Independent Insurance Agents & Brokers of America
(www.iiaa.org), whose “Find an Agent” link allows consumers to search its
membership directory by location.
Some insurance companies offer discounts (usually around 10 percent) if you
have multiple policies with them. For instance, if you insure your cars and
your home with the same company, you may be able to save some money.
And some companies even offer renewal discounts if you stick with them
year after year. Talk to your agent. Every little bit helps, right?
Looking online
A good place to look for insurance rates is online. Check out the following sites:
 Esurance.com (www.esurance.com) or Insurance.com (www.
insurance.com), both of which offer quotes to consumers on a 
variety of insurance packages, including homeowners’
 Major individual insurance companies, such as State Farm (www.
statefarm.com) and Liberty Mutual (www.libertymutual.com), 
for rate quotes and information about coverage
156
Part II: Searching for Your New Home and Sealing the Deal 

To make sure you’re getting the best deal, be sure to shop around and com-
pare quotes from different companies before purchasing a policy. Be sure to
compare apples to apples by looking at exactly what is and isn’t covered by
each policy, and then compare the premiums you’ll have to pay.
You can check up on the financial stability of insurance companies by visiting
the Web sites of rating companies such as A.M. Best (www.ambest.com) and
Standard & Poor’s (www.standardandpoors.com).
If you’re buying a second home in Florida, make sure you allow adequate time
to find an insurance provider, and expect to pay a hefty annual sum for the
coverage. Hurricanes Andrew, Jeanne, Frances, and Ivan — among others —
all took their toll on the state’s insurance industry. Consumers now have
fewer carrier choices and must pay high annual premiums.
What Happens After Closing Day? 
All the Paperwork and Such
The keys are in your hand, the papers are signed, and the stress of closing
day is behind you. But before you toss that thick file of paperwork you hope
you never have to look at again (yes, I know the feeling) into the spare bed-
room closet and start enjoying your second home, read this section to help
you get organized and plan for the future as a second-home owner.
157
Chapter 8: Financing Your Second Home and Closing the Deal
What about contents insurance 
when you don’t live there?
If you don’t live in your second home, and you
want to protect its contents, you need to carry
contents insurance. Most standard homeown-
ers’ policies include contents coverage. If, for
some reason, you don’t have contents coverage
as part of your policy, you’ll want to take it out
separately. Also, keep in mind valuable items
that you may leave at the second home from
time to time. (For example, if you have your
grandmother’s $20,000 diamond necklace, you
probably need contents coverage.) If your
second home is in an area where you’ll be hit-
ting nightclubs and fancy restaurants, and you
routinely keep your best jewelry there rather
than in your primary home, then that’s the home
where your contents coverage should include
these items.

After the closing: A checklist
You’ve signed all the important paperwork and walked out with your new set
of keys. However, the hard work has just begun because you’re responsible
for two homes now. After you leave the closing table or receive a call that the
title has transferred into your name, make sure you do the following:
 Call the municipal office for garbage pickup and recycling removal.
 Get the power and phone activated, and establish a turn-on date for 
the next time you’re ready to use the home.
 Replace or rekey all exterior locks.
 Have a home security system installed or upgraded.
 Change all the batteries in smoke detectors and carbon monoxide 
monitors (and record the dates that the batteries were changed).
 Change all the air filters in the home.
 Set up a maintenance schedule for the furnace, pool, air conditioner, 
and other major systems (and record the dates for this schedule).
 Take any home inspector recommendations to heart and set a comple-
tion schedule for them.
 Check the lawn, garden, and other equipment needed to keep the place
maintained.
File everything on time
After you leave the closing table, a number of documents will need to be filed
with local government offices. The closing agent (the title company employee,
attorney, or other professional who is handling the closing) should handle
most of this for you, but you’ll need to do a few things yourself. For example,
the lender will probably give you a first-payment coupon to use if your first
mortgage statement doesn’t come in time to make that initial payment. Keep
this in a conspicuous place — or set it up for automatic bill pay — so you
don’t forget about it.
You will also want to file an application for a homestead allowance, if your
state offers this perk. A homestead allowance exempts a certain percentage of
your home’s value from property tax assessment. Check with your local city
or county assessor’s office to find out if your second-home state offers this.
(And remember, if a homestead allowance is offered, most states have cutoff
dates for filing for it.) Make a quick call to the closing agent a week after the
closing and make sure the deed and any other forms were filed with the
appropriate parties.
158
Part II: Searching for Your New Home and Sealing the Deal 

Storing important papers
You can expect the closing agent to hand you one neat (and thick!) file 
of signed documents and other important papers related to your home 
purchase.
Keep this file in a safe place — preferably in a safe with the rest of your
important papers. You need this file when it comes time to pay your taxes
(see “Pay those taxes,” later in this chapter), when you want to look at your
property lines (on your property survey), or if you have momentary brain
lapse and forget how much you paid for the home, or how many points you
paid for your mortgage, or even what your new zip code is.
Knowing what to do if you lose important papers
In today’s digital environment, losing important papers simply isn’t as 
catastrophic as it once was. Because real estate sales involve so many 
parties — all of which have their own paperwork and pertinent documents —
misplacing that mortgage coupon or property contract isn’t the end of the
world. You can almost certainly request another copy from the relevant 
entities for a fee. So don’t panic when you realize you’ve lost, misplaced, 
or thrown out something important.
If something is missing, start with your real estate agent or closing agent,
both of whom are required to retain a year’s worth of files associated with
their work. If you need a deed or other legal document showing your owner-
ship rights, the city or county clerk’s office in your community should be able
to point you in the right direction.
Transfer the deed
A deed is the document that transfers ownership of real estate. The deed 
contains the names of the previous and new owners, as well as a legal
description of the property. At a round-table closing, the person transferring
the property signs the deed, and a notary must notarize the deed before it’s
accepted for recording. This transfer will happen at the closing table, and the
closing agent will have it recorded (or filed) at the Register of Deeds (usually
located in the courthouse) in the county where the property is located. At an
escrow closing, the escrow agent handles the deed transfer.
Pay those taxes
Depending on the time of year you close on your second home, you’ll have
either paid for or been reimbursed in advance for property tax payments.
This is known as prorating or sharing, and the amount you pay becomes a
deductible expense on the current year’s tax return.
159
Chapter 8: Financing Your Second Home and Closing the Deal

These tax prorations are calculated by dividing the taxes between buyer and
seller, based on the date that those taxes are due in your state. (This varies
from state to state.) In some states, there is a difference between the
assessed period and the collection period for real estate taxes.
If the seller paid taxes to cover a period that extends beyond closing, the
seller will be credited for this expense. If the taxes weren’t paid yet, the total
amount will be charged to the buyer and added to her closing costs. If there
is any doubt in your mind as to how — or how much of — the property taxes
are to be paid, make sure your attorney and agent look into the specifics for
your state, and that you pay everything according to the law.
When the next tax hit comes, it will be all yours to take care of. The county tax
collector will first send you a TRIM (truth rate in millage) notice, announcing
the amount you owe and when it’s due. Shortly thereafter, you’ll receive a final
tax bill that will either be paid from your escrow account (if you have taxes
and insurance folded into your loan) or out of your own pocket.
If your second-home mortgage payment includes principal, insurance, and
taxes, then your monthly payment will cover any tax bills and the lender will
pay it. If this is the case, be sure that the tax bill is sent to the lender. If it
comes to you by mistake, forward it immediately to your lender. (And if you
do receive a bill and your lender is paying the taxes, be sure to read it care-
fully; sometimes tax offices send a duplicate bill to the homeowner for her
records, even if the tab is being paid by the lender.)

Thinking Like a Global 
Home Buyer
In This Chapter
 Deciding whether to buy a second home outside the United States
 Knowing the differences in the foreign home-buying process
 Keeping your eyes open for pitfalls
 Considering some popular locales
S
o you have your eye on that little cottage in Tuscany or that lovely chalet
you stayed in last time you went skiing in Switzerland (and were excited
to find that it was for sale). Admit it: You’re even surprising yourself, right?
You’re seriously considering buying property in a foreign country!
Although the concept of owning a second home outside the United States
may seem far-fetched for many people, the practice is becoming more popu-
lar for U.S. buyers who want to go beyond that beach house on Jersey Shore
or that mountainside cabin in Tennessee.
Why the growing popularity, you ask? Well, this chapter explains why more
and more people are looking outside the United States for a second home.
This chapter also helps you through the basics of buying overseas and even
points out a few “hot spots” to consider during your home search. Although
this chapter could be a book in and of itself, consider it just the need-to-know
info of how to break into the international home-buying market. You can then
take it from there.
Contemplating Whether an Overseas
Home Is Right for You
Purchasing a second home is a big deal, period. Purchasing a home overseas is
an even bigger deal. After you’re outside the United States, many home-buying

processes are done differently, and you need to be familiar with the details to
make your ownership of property in a foreign country go smoothly. For exam-
ple, getting there for emergencies won’t be as easy, and following the rules of
the road may be more complex. (Check out “Considering Key Issues When
Buying a Home Overseas” later in this chapter for some differences and how 
to deal with them.)
People purchase second homes, including ones overseas, for a wide variety
of reasons. As you try to figure out whether buying a second home overseas
is right for you, consider the following reasons to buy outside the U.S. of A:
 You frequently travel and visit far-off locations. You travel overseas
extensively, dropping a bundle on hotel rooms and meals in the process,
and you’re the type to spend six weeks (or more) a year in your favorite
international spot.
 You have friends or family in a foreign country and need a nice place
to stay while you’re visiting them. You’ve reached the point where
hotels just don’t cut it, and you can’t (or won’t) stay with your family,
yet you fly to your homeland a few times a year to see your aunts and
uncles, grandparents, and cousins, no matter what.
 You have the time required to tend to and take full advantage of a
property that’s located thousands of miles away from your primary
home. Homes require maintenance and TLC, neither of which you’ll be
able to provide personally if you don’t have the time to get to the home.
 You have plenty of money to spare. Owning and maintaining a second
home overseas isn’t cheap. In addition to the routine costs of financing
and upkeep, you’ll likely have much higher travel costs, overseas phone
calls, and other expenses. If you’re thinking these costs might be an
issue in your current financial situation, buy domestic.
 You like the idea of being able to say you own a home overseas.
Owning a home overseas comes with some bragging rights. Although
being able to brag shouldn’t be your sole motivating factor, you can still
have some pride when telling others you own a home in a foreign land.
If you find yourself nodding your head in agreement with one or more of
these points, then an overseas second-home purchase may be right for you.
But not everyone is a jet-setter flying all over the world. The following are
some reasons that you probably should stay away from an overseas second-
home purchase:
 You can’t afford buying overseas and you know it. Owning and maintain-
ing a second home isn’t cheap. Owning overseas when dealing with differ-
ent currencies, exchange rates, property values, and such can be even
more difficult. (Check out “Understanding how financing differs abroad” for
more info on pricing and financing.) I also suggest you check out Chapter 2,
which can help you determine whether you can afford a second home.
162
Part II: Searching for Your New Home and Sealing the Deal 

 You want to own a home overseas almost solely for the bragging
rights. You have one annoying friend in mind to whom you would do the
most bragging. As I’ve mentioned, bragging rights should not be your
primary motivator. Buy a home for you, not to show off to others.
 You have too many responsibilities. You know that no matter how
much you twist and turn, you absolutely can’t get away from the grind of
your daily life often enough to justify the travel associated with owning
an international second home.
 You just saw the movie Under the Tuscan Sun. After the movie, you
realized that you absolutely must own a home on the Italian countryside
before you die. You simply must! (Okay, probably not the smartest ratio-
nale for buying overseas.) Stay rational about this significant decision,
and steer clear of far-fetched ideas that might turn into debacles down
the road. Rash, emotion-based decisions almost always end up being a
problem because they’re not thought through carefully.
After considering the factors that apply to you, you should be able to come
up with a reasonable justification for or against purchasing an international
second home. Buying is an emotional decision, so the ultimate decision, after
determining whether you can buy the house, boils down to one question: Do
you want to buy the house? These guidelines are practical info. And even if all
the factors are in your favor and you really don’t want the particular house
you’re considering — for whatever reason — then you’re not going to buy it.
(See Chapters 3 and 4 for more info on how to choose the right home to pur-
chase and where to look for the best options.)
And if your conclusion is “Am I crazy!?” (or something of that ilk), don’t
forget that many places in the United States can serve as a pleasing substi-
tute for the conditions you found so appealing in Italy, France, or wherever. A
chateau in California’s wine country, for example, can be your own little place
in the Tuscan wine region, or a condo on Myrtle Beach can be surprisingly
similar to a place on the shore of France. And don’t forget you don’t need a
passport to fly to California!
Considering Key Issues When 
Buying a Home Overseas
If you’ve decided that you want to pursue an international second home or
just want a tad more info about the whole process, you’re in the right place.
(If you haven’t decided, check out the previous section, which can help you
make your decision.) You’re about to undergo an exciting, yet complicated,
undertaking, but there’s no need to worry.
163
Chapter 9: Thinking Like a Global Home Buyer

Yes, you’ll face different issues when you buy a second home overseas than if
you were to buy a second home in the United States. However, this section
helps you through some of the key issues you may encounter as you make
your way through the transaction.
Relying on a pro to help with the purchase
Purchasing a second home in an international market can be daunting. You
have to navigate different rules and regulations. You need to make sure you
get all the correct paperwork signed and so on. How can you guarantee that
you’ve dotted all your i’s and crossed all your t’s? A real estate agent, local 
to that specific market, can make all the difference. In fact, unless you’re a
seasoned, foreign real estate investor with a slew of in-country contacts, you
probably won’t be able to get through the real estate transaction without
some assistance from a real estate agent working in your country of choice.
If you don’t know any real estate agents in your country of choice, don’t fret.
To find a real estate agent in the country where you want to buy a home, go
to the International Consortium of Real Estate Associations (ICREA) Web 
site at www.icrea.org and search through the group’s member listings.
Furthermore, most of the large, U.S. brokerages (Coldwell Banker, RE/MAX,
Century 21, and so forth) have their own overseas offices, so you may want
to ask your local agent for a referral within his own organization. Trust me, he
will be happy to help. Your favorite agent will get a small commission on the
transaction at closing (through the referral network), and you’ll get an agent
who comes highly recommended.
And don’t dismiss the possibility of a referral even if you’re using a small,
two-person agency. One certainty in my business: Real estate agents know
other real estate agents. Ask. You may be pleasantly surprised at who your
agent refers you to.
Hook up with a real estate agent in your target country before putting too
much time into your search. You have to consider foreign currencies and
exchange rates, different taxation systems, and various other issues that
have to be handled carefully, and your agent can help.
Just as you would if you were buying a home in the States, you want to inter-
view real estate agents before deciding which one to work with for your over-
seas or outside-the-U.S. purchase. In addition to the basic questions in
Chapter 6, here are a few additional questions to ask prospective agents:
164
Part II: Searching for Your New Home and Sealing the Deal 

 How often do you work with American home buyers looking for second
homes in your country?
 What challenges do American buyers typically face?
 How do you help Americans work through any problems they face?
 How many deals have you lost that involved U.S. buyers purchasing in
your country?
 What do you need to do to get the financing on the transaction worked
out? (Check out the next section for more details.)
 How much will you charge me for your services? (In the United States,
the seller pays, but that’s not always the case in other countries, so be
sure to ask.)
From the agent’s answers, you can determine if this agent will be a good
match for your situation. If, for example, she’s only handled two deals for
Americans — and lost them both (and actually admits that to you!) — then
you probably want to look elsewhere for representation.
Understanding how financing differs abroad
Overseas transactions are complicated, especially for those buyers who have
never dealt with the intricacies of foreign trade. You’ll probably get a little
anxious when documents start getting faxed and overnighted from another
country to you, but it’s done all the time. Just be sure to have someone in
your corner and you’ll be fine.
Don’t be surprised if you hear that cash is king in your country of choice. 
In fact, it very well may be your only financing option. The truth is, the mort-
gage systems in foreign countries aren’t always as sophisticated as those of
the United States where dozens of lenders stand by ready, willing, and able to
lend out hundreds of thousands of dollars to individuals looking to purchase
homes. As a result, you have two main choices:
 Pay cash from personal savings if you can afford it (or borrow it from
friends and family).
 Take out a domestic mortgage and use the cash proceeds to pay for
your foreign house.
The United States has a very sophisticated financial system in place, and
often, there’s a shorthand when dealing with bankers and closing attorneys
and agents. Our system makes it easy to buy — but to buy here. It may take a
little more effort to find the deal you want, with terms you’re comfortable
with, when you’re buying overseas.
165
Chapter 9: Thinking Like a Global Home Buyer

If you do find a U.S. lender for a foreign home, be prepared to put down 40
percent or more as a down payment. Because of the transient nature of the
foreign-home buyer, and the fact that the property securing the loan is out-
side U.S. borders, this is a customary practice. Lenders ask for higher down
payments to reduce the risk they’re assuming by making a loan for a foreign
purchase. Also, if the documents come through in the language of the foreign
country, you have to pay translation costs.
Comparing property values
Evaluating property values on a potential second-home purchase in the
United States isn’t that difficult. You ask a real estate agent to pull up some
comps, and voilà, you’re presented with a few recent sales on comparable
homes that you can use as a baseline for your own home purchase.
However, in a foreign market, comparing property values isn’t so cut and
dried. When you compare property values in an overseas market, go into 
the adventure with open eyes. Gather the pertinent information that can 
help you better understand your country of choice’s real estate market.
Doing so ensures that you get the best value for your dollar.
The following guidelines can give you an overall sense of the real estate situa-
tion in the area of the foreign country in which you’re considering buying.
These guidelines are similar to what you do domestically, but the info is
somewhat more difficult to acquire. That’s why having a real estate agent is
so important. (Check out the section “Relying on a pro to help with the pur-
chase” earlier in this chapter for more info.) I recommend that you not tackle
this list as a do-it-yourself effort.
 Look carefully at recently sold properties in the region. Your agent
can help you with this. Look closely at what similar homes are being
sold for in the country you have in mind.
 Consider market trends in the area. Is it a buyer’s market? A seller’s
market? A balanced market? (Check out Chapter 1 for more info on these
types of markets.)
 Compare estimated property values to the asking price. This info is
available through a real estate agent who has access to the area’s MLS.
 Ask ahead of time (when you write the offer to purchase) about the
closing process. Don’t assume a foreign country has the same safe-
guards as the United States. Ask about title searches, title guarantees,
deed restrictions, escrow procedures, and so on. A good real estate
agent can be very helpful at this stage of your buying experience.
166
Part II: Searching for Your New Home and Sealing the Deal 

Don’t get bogged down comparing overseas prices to U.S. asking prices for
homes. Make sure you’re comparing like to like. You may find yourself automat-
ically doing it: “They want how much for that small one-family in Germany?
Didn’t so-and-so two blocks over pay such-and-such for almost the identical
house just a couple of weeks ago?” This is distracting and self-defeating. You’re
not buying so-and-so’s house two blocks over that he paid such-and-such for.
You’re interested in a similar house in Germany on the River Rhine.
Buying a place sight unseen
You may live halfway around the world from your second home’s country,
but you’re still interested in purchasing a home. You may not be able to drop
everything and fly 12 hours to see the place before you put an offer on it. In
years past, if a client had asked me if he should buy a house sight unseen, I
would have unequivocally said no. My advice would have been to go see it,
no matter what it took to get there.
But times change. And so has my advice. And it all boils down to the Internet.
The Internet has changed the rules — drastically — regarding buying homes.
The Web has helped home buyers worldwide purchase abodes without ever
setting foot in them. You now have several ways of knowing precisely what’s
for sale:
 Real estate agent/MLS descriptions, as found in the local MLS: You can
access this info yourself (ask your agent for the Web addresses), or your
agent can mail or e-mail it to you. This info tells you how many bed-
rooms and bathrooms and so forth.
 Virtual tours: You can take a video tour of the home’s inside and outside.
 Still photos: You can view digital pics of the home’s inside and outside
posted on a Web site.
 Your own knowledge of the area in which you’re buying: This comes
from surfing the Web, reading about the area, and talking to people.
However, I recommend that you take this tack only if you have to. For instance,
if the market is just so darned hot that four other buyers are interested in a
property you’ve had your eye on, and you know that an extra week of travel
arrangements and packing would probably cause you to lose the deal on the
home that you just have to have, then go for it.
But if you have the luxury of time, and if you were planning on going to the
area where you plan to buy your second home within the next month or so,
then take your time and go see one or more properties before buying.
167
Chapter 9: Thinking Like a Global Home Buyer

If you do decide to buy a home sight unseen, be sure to hire a qualified
inspector to go through the home before you sign on the dotted line (see
Chapter 7).
Pinning down property taxes
Property taxes vary from country to country, so be sure to go over your
obligations in this regard long before you get to the closing table.
Get the answers to these questions before you sign so you don’t have any
surprises when (property) tax time comes around. You need to know the 
following from your real estate agent or a local government source:
 How the property tax on your property is calculated.
 How often the tax can change.
 How often you will be billed.
 How you will pay it. For example, can the tax be included in your 
mortgage and your domestic bank can pay it? Or will you receive a 
bill from the foreign tax assessor? Will the bill be mailed to your U.S.
address or the foreign property? And so on.
Dealing with problems after 
you’ve bought your home
Handling problems at overseas properties — locations that you can’t get to
within a few hours by car — can be tough. For example, what happens if high
winds break a window, a pipe bursts, or something else bad happens and no
one is nearby to take care of the problem?
If you take a few precautionary measures, you can protect your investment
when problems, both small and large, happen. (And they will.) To handle
problems with your property as they arise, do the following:
 Establish your own network of friends and neighbors who can help
out while you’re not there. You can have peace of mind knowing that
your overseas friends and/or neighbors can be at your overseas place
within minutes if something happens. Seek out and meet people living
close by your place. After you’re friendly, you can broach the subject of
keeping an eye out and helping out when necessary. If you have relatives
living nearby (and you may if that’s one of the reasons you bought
where you did), then they should be first on your network list.
168
Part II: Searching for Your New Home and Sealing the Deal 

 Consider hiring a professional property manager. You pay a property
manager to regularly check on your property and handle any issues 
that arise.
See Chapter 13 for more info on how you can rely on a reputable property
manager to maintain your home and for details on how to set up a safety net
of real estate agents, repair companies, and neighbors to keep an eye on
things while you’re away.
In addition, to protect your investment when something happens, make sure
you insure your property. The best place to start is with the insurance agent
who handles your U.S. home. If such policies aren’t something your agent’s
company handles, she can do the research and provide you with some info
and the names of some people to talk to.
Marketing your international 
home and finding renters
If you own a second home overseas and want to snag some rental income
from your place, you need to do many of the same things that a domestic
homeowner does, only on a larger, more geographically dispersed scale.
However, some things will be a tad different. For starters, assume that you’ll
be using your foreign home less frequently than would the New York City
folks who buy a home on the Jersey Shore.
Because you’ll have to fly to get there, and because weekend drop-ins are
probably not very feasible, your place will probably be available for rent for 
a good portion of the year. (And that’s only an assumption. If you will be in
your Swiss chalet or house on Italy’s Lake Como for two weeks out of every
month, more power to you!)
Keep the following initial steps in mind when marketing your overseas digs
and searching for renters:
1. Figure out when you want to use your home and when it will be avail-
able for rental.
Think about what seasons or times of the year you do or don’t want to
use your home, and what times of the year renters will be interested in
using your home.
2. Identify your sphere of interest.
Much like the owner whose second home is in the United States, a
sphere of influence provides a great network to use to spread the word
about your fabulous home. Ask yourself:
169
Chapter 9: Thinking Like a Global Home Buyer

• Who do I know who would like to go to [insert the country here]
for a week or more this year or next year?
• What type of business or social events will I be attending soon, and
can I brag up the property a bit?
• Which of my friends, family, and close acquaintances really need a
vacation to a place like [insert the country here] right now?
The answers to these questions can help you come up with a list of
potential prospects for your international vacation home.
3. Get the word out to your contacts.
Not everyone knows someone who owns property overseas, so you
want to tell your own network of friends, family, neighbors, and col-
leagues about your vacation getaway. Many of these acquaintances may
make good customers for your foreign rental. Talk to these folks about
the home, e-mail them photos and updates, and take other measures to
help spread the word about your new place.
4. Hit the Web.
Go to the Internet, where sites like iVacation (www.ivacation.com),
Holiday-Rentals (www.holiday-rentals.com), and VacationVillas
(www.vacationvillas.net) cater to a largely international audience.
By spending the $150 to $200 a year that it takes to get the word out
about your place on these popular sites, you can start racking up a fan
club of past and future renters for your property.
If this prospect sounds scary to you, you should consider hiring a property
manager in the country where your home is located. Someone who can speak
the language, who knows the terrain, and who understands the local real
estate market may be well worth their salt. This approach is similar to
American companies that do business overseas hiring local operators. Being
in the zone can be an enormous help to you when you’re thousands of miles
away from your property and hoping for all to go well.
Ultimately, your goal is to find good renters who are willing to pay the fees
you’re asking, follow house rules, and treat your property with care while
staying there. These kinds of people are in every country all over the world,
so don’t limit yourself in terms of who stays at your place while you’re not
there. Even a local may be interested in your place and, with the proper sup-
port from area pros, you could end up with a very nice — and lucrative —
rental agreement.
Reporting rental income to Uncle Sam
You must claim any money you earn from an investment that is located out of
the country as income. The IRS taxes you and whatever you earn; it doesn’t
matter where the money comes from. (This may be a “duh!” moment for
170
Part II: Searching for Your New Home and Sealing the Deal 

many of you, but you wouldn’t believe how many people wonder if what they
earn from outside sources is taxable as U.S. income.)
You’ll absolutely be required to pay income tax on the rental income, claim-
ing it on Schedule E, Supplemental Income and Loss, of your IRS Form 1040.
(Check out Chapter 14 for more specific tax-related issues when renting a
second home.)
Some of the common questions involving overseas earnings include
 What about the exchange rate? If I’m paid in euros, do I claim the
euros or convert them to dollars? On your Schedule E, include the
income at the exchange rate that was current when you received the
rent. If you receive 1,000 euros a month as rent, you claim as income
around $1,300 (based on, for example, today’s exchange rate).
 If I have to pay fees to have the funds converted, are those
deductible? Yes. The fees are an expense of doing business. And, 
exactly as you do with a domestic rental property, you can deduct all the
expenses related to the rental, such as repairs, depreciation, insurance,
property taxes, and maintenance. And as with all business matters, be
sure to keep all supporting documents and paperwork.
If you own a home overseas that you’re renting, you can also deduct
expenses like long-distance phone calls to check on the property, the
cost of Internet advertising to find tenants, and the travel costs associ-
ated with managing the property.
 If I get stiffed on the rent from my tenant, can I claim it as a loss? If
your tenant doesn’t pay, you probably won’t be able to deduct it as a
loss, even if a lease is in place. However, if the tenant damages the place
and moves out, and you can’t rent it to someone else, ask your accoun-
tant if you apply for any loss of income provisions.
Avoiding Pitfalls When Buying Abroad
After you begin the process of buying your overseas second home, you may
run into a few roadblocks along the way. So before you can bask on the beach
in Rio de Janeiro, or sit gazing at the vineyards while sipping espresso on the
little balcony off the master bedroom of your Tuscany cottage, read on.
This section discusses some potential pitfalls you may encounter when
buying a second home overseas, including knowing what to do if you hired
the wrong real estate agent, and dealing with the unavoidable geopolitical
issues that may hamper your ability to do business (in this case, transact 
real estate) in certain countries.
171
Chapter 9: Thinking Like a Global Home Buyer

Using the wrong real estate agent
Sometimes in life, after you’ve worked a while with a business associate, you
unfortunately realize that you’re not a good fit. This definitely can happen
when working with a real estate agent. Perhaps she’s not finding the types 
of properties that you want. Perhaps she’s not staying within your budget.
Perhaps she’s not submitting the required paperwork on time.
If you discover at any time during your overseas second-home search that
you’ve hired the wrong agent, don’t fret. Thank her for her services. You may
need to go back, find another real estate agent, and start your search over.
You may not have to completely restart your search, but now is the time to
take action. You don’t want to wait until it’s too late and you find yourself
stuck in a situation over your head without an agent’s help. Don’t waste any
time. See Chapter 6 for details on how to find the right agent.
Considering a country’s troubles
Geopolitical issues and problems are a fact of life in today’s world. In fact,
economic, political, cultural, religious, military, criminal, terrorism, environ-
mental, and transportation troubles can break out anywhere these days.
(Sometimes makes you want to stay locked in the house, doesn’t it?)
172
Part II: Searching for Your New Home and Sealing the Deal 
Grappling with ownership issues overseas
When you purchase a home in the United
States, you receive a warranty title stating that
you’re the property owner. Sometimes the bank
holds this title (if you have a mortgage, for
example), but the basic point is that the owner
holds the title, plain and simple.
Getting the title to your property isn’t quite so
plain and simple overseas, however, and you’ll
want to talk to your real estate agent, attorney,
or other knowledgeable professional about the
ramifications in your specific country well
before you buy.
What can happen if you don’t do this important
piece of homework? A lot. Because the land
transfer procedures and physical boundaries in
foreign countries are different than those in the
United States, you may well find yourself going
head to head with the great-great-great-grand-
son of the land’s original owner, who has
decided to make a claim on the land. It happens.
The good news is that the burden of proof lies
on the person who is making the claim. By
working with a notary who can help read the
land’s title history to ensure that it’s “free and
clear” and able to be purchased, you’ll know
whether the title has any problems that need to
be cleared up before you buy.

Any of these upheavals — many of which can happen in an instant — can
affect an entire country’s economy, housing market, residents, health and
welfare, and everything in between. Unfortunately you can’t guarantee the
future of any country. But the odds are that the more stable and the more
free a country is, the better the chance you’ll enjoy your second home
abroad in peace and comfort for years to come.
Before you buy in a particular country or region, do yourself a favor and
check with the U.S. State Department about the stability and safety of the
countries where you’re interested in purchasing a home. The agency’s Web
site is www.travel.state.gov. Armed with this info, you can make the
right decision for your own situation. For example, if you know that the 
country’s grape farmers have been striking for the past three months, caus-
ing all ground transportation to slow down, you may want to reconsider that
country. Watch carefully, and as you decide whether or not to buy a home,
take into consideration anything that happens that you suspect could impact
your peaceful enjoyment of your place.
Where to Look for Your Foreign Home
If you’re serious about owning your own slice of heaven outside the United
States, you have unlimited choices in nearly every country in the world. So
where exactly do you start? This section looks at a few favorite places where
second-home buyers buy consistently. Also check out Chapter 18 for a more
extensive list of areas to consider.
When choosing a location, keep in mind travel costs. The multitude of 
new budget airlines has made foreign travel more affordable than ever for
Americans. If your travel budget is a key factor in your buying decision, first
do a little research on a site like www.orbitz.com or www.expedia.com to
figure out how much it will cost you to go to and fro on a regular basis. Also,
prices vary by season, so if when you travel isn’t critical, you may get a
better rate at a different time of the year. And sometimes choosing a different
airport that’s still close to home can also save you some cash. For example,
sometimes flying out of Hartford, Connecticut, instead of New York City can
make a big difference and score you a terrific cost-saving fare.
The neighbor to the north: Canada
So close, yet so far away, Canada offers buyers an international location
that’s fairly accessible, as well as being super-friendly to Americans and, 
in some aspects, quite similar to the United States. In fact, traveling to your
Canadian second home will be fairly easy, unless, of course, you opt for a
place far from civilization, way out in the cold wilderness. Then you may
need a kayak or two.
173
Chapter 9: Thinking Like a Global Home Buyer

If you’re into outdoor activities like hunting, fishing, water skiing, and skiing,
consider shopping for your second home in Canada. Lots of Americans have
discovered that Canada is a great place for a vacation getaway and a second
home. Calgary (in Alberta) and Ontario are especially popular areas for
second homes.
The neighbor to the south: Mexico
In close proximity to the U.S. mainland, Mexico boasts myriad options for
second-home buyers in search of
 Warmer weather
 Varied cultures
 Proximity to home
 Affordable real estate
 Mexican food!
Mexico offers an enormous number of resorts, condos, and cottage-type
buying options. And people know it, too. The latest reports show that 1 mil-
lion Americans now live both full time and part time in Mexico. This is up
from only 200,000 in 1996. The major areas where Mexico lovers have settled
down include Southern Baja (including Cabo San Lucas and La Paz), Puerto
Vallarta, Sonora (on the Sea of Cortez), and the ever-popular Cancun region.
174

Take advantage of the exchange rate
Exchange rates can make a big difference in
how much you ultimately have to pay for your
overseas home. At press time, for example, the
exchange rate for the euro wasn’t working in
your favor. The American dollar was worth
about 78 cents compared to the euro at the end
of 2006, which isn’t the best news for buyers
looking to purchase homes there. But when you
look at the amount of home you can get, it can
still be a great opportunity to fulfill your dream.
At the end of 2006, the euro was trading for less
than $1.32, down from $1.35 in January 2005. So,
a property that in 2005 cost $300,000 euros was
actually $405,000 American dollars, while one
selling for the same price in 2006 would only go
for $396,000 — a savings worth considering.
And for currency conversions online, I recom-
mend www.x-rates.com/calculator.

Something for everyone: South America
Okay, now I’m stepping a bit further outside the box (and the States!), but
that shouldn’t deter you from considering South America for your second-
home hideaway.
People today are looking at countries like Peru, Uruguay, Argentina, Brazil,
and Chile as potential second-home spots. With the glorious South Pacific 
on one side and the Atlantic on the other, this vast continent offers a wide
variety of environments, from rain forests to beaches, and everything in
between. If you’ve been to South America and loved it, or you have family
there that you want to visit more regularly and for longer periods of time (say
for a month or more), then a second home there may make sense for you.
The economies of the various South American countries fluctuate, sometimes
drastically, and many of them are greatly affected by geopolitical issues.
Before you buy in South America, be sure to talk to a knowledgeable real
estate agent in the area. You should also do your own homework to make
sure you’re getting the best return for your money. Look at housing prices,
days on the market, appreciation, and other issues that can affect your
investment. Also, try to uncover a little about the political goings-on of the
country where you’re interested in buying. Hey, coups happen.
Where has everyone gone? Europe
Foreign ownership of European properties has been on the rise for years, so
if you’re considering buying a home there, now is probably a good time to
start making some moves to make it happen. The “big three” are France, Italy,
and Spain. They’re the most popular choices, but the less touristy countries,
such as Portugal and Ireland, have their own allure and are also lately attract-
ing Americans who truly want to “get away from it all” while on vacation.
Property prices in certain European countries (such as France) may be par-
ticularly attractive for Americans. You may be used to shelling out an arm
and a leg for even the smallest abode, so you may be surprised at how much
house you can buy in a European country for what you want to spend. In fact,
a decent place just outside Paris may cost half of what you would pay for a
New York City apartment. That’s right. Half. So shop around and do your
homework before you buy. Like I said, you may be pleasantly surprised.
175
Chapter 9: Thinking Like a Global Home Buyer

Tropical paradise: Island homes
I have traveled extensively through the South Pacific and the Caribbean. I can
tell you unhesitatingly that the islands would be my first choice for a second-
home location.
Also consider Puerto Rico, Caribbean locales like Grand Cayman, and South
American options like Aruba. (Plus, don’t forget Hawaii! It’s still a tropical
paradise, so add it to your list if you want to stay local.)
Visit a few of these places first for a vacation, and be sure that they can pro-
vide all the wonderful amenities — beaches, pools, scuba diving, windsurfing,
and so on — that beach bunnies just can’t live without.
You’ll almost certainly pay a premium for an overseas island home. Anything
that’s waterfront with a view tends to command a high price these days. Shop
around, work with a real estate agent, and do your homework before buying.

Making Your
Second Home a
Smart Investment

In this part . . .
A
second home can be a great investment for someone
looking to diversify his or her portfolio by adding a
nice healthy dose of real estate to it. And because every-
one wants to make smart investments, and because real
estate has long been an investment winner, in this part, I
show you how to do precisely that as it pertains to your
second home.
From furnishing and renovating it, to advertising it, to rent-
ing it out for the short or long term, I help you with every-
thing you need to know about turning your second home
into a profit center — if you want to. You get a good look
at how professionals such as property managers can — for
a fee — take on certain responsibilities that you’d rather
steer clear of.
I also include an important chapter on the financial impli-
cations of renting out your second home and the different
tax situations that may crop up. After all, you definitely
want to keep Uncle Sam happy, right?

Chapter 10
Setting Up Your New Digs
In This Chapter
 Outfitting your second home
 Buying furniture
 Settling into the neighborhood
You found the perfect second home, you had it inspected, you secured
financing on it, and— Ta Da! — you closed on it. Now it’s time to create a
real feeling of home in your new abode. For many people, doing so is the fun
part. For others, it will be an unpleasant chore — but no matter how you look
at it, getting settled is definitely a task that is worth the effort.
After you have your second home just the way you want it, you can then
move on to experiencing other facets of living in your new place. You’ll want
to get out and explore your new environment. You’ll also want to meet your
neighbors and make new friends. Both of these endeavors can sometimes be
a challenge, but in the long run, they’re more than worth the effort.
In this chapter, I take you through some of the basic considerations involved
in making your new place livable, and I help you set up your new home
according to your budget, wants, and needs. I also show you how to make 
the most out of the people, places, and things in the area.
Furnishing Your New Home
A second home is great to have, but if it’s nothing but an empty space with
some futons thrown on the floor, you’re not going to be happy or comfortable
there. The good news: You don’t have to spend an arm and a leg to furnish
your new abode in a way that’s both pleasing to the eye (and other body
parts) and also functional. Domestic accoutrements can range in price from
free to “Are you kidding me!?” expensive, and everything in between.

If you plan on retiring to your second home within the next three to five years,
consider buying furnishings that will serve a dual purpose: They’ll be comfy
for vacations and, later, suitable for permanent residence. For example, if the
queen-sized bed is only $50 more than the double, go for the larger one, know-
ing that it will be more practical down the road for year-round use — not to
mention it’ll give you and your significant other lots more room!
When furnishing your second home, take as much time as you need to pick
out just the right sofas, tables, chairs, and so on. Don’t hastily spend thou-
sands of dollars on items that you may not need. You have the luxury of time
when outfitting your second home, especially if you’re not spending much
time there during the first few weeks or months that you own it.
In this section, I help you sort through your various options and help you
budget for those options so you can create a living space that you, your
family, and your friends (and potentially your renters) can enjoy for years.
Knowing how to budget
If you’re on a budget, you’ve come to the right place. Before you purchased
your second home, you probably thought about what items you would need
in the new place, and allocated a guesstimated amount of money for furni-
ture, appliances, drapes, decorations, and other home accessories. The
budget covered how much you could spend and afford, balanced against
what you wanted. You’ll want to do the same thing for all the furnishings.
Write out a budget — and then stick to this budget — even if it means shop-
ping around more for stuff than you typically do for your primary home.
To create your all-important budget, you need to know two things:
 How much you want to spend on the extras for your home
 How much you can spend on those goodies
With your daunting house-buying search-and-borrow mission successfully
completed, you can now turn your attention to the fun part of owning a
second home: dressing it up!
Here’s a simple, fairly cut-and-dried method of coming up with some num-
bers: If you dole out $3,000 a month in second-home related expenses, and 
if your extra pre-second-home income was $6,000, then you have roughly
$3,000 a month to work with. Cut that number in half, and set funds aside for
180
Part III: Making Your Second Home a Smart Investment 

maintenance and upkeep; you’ll have a workable amount of discretionary
income. So, if you have $1,500 set aside per month, a typical scenario would
have you using that money to buy a $650 loveseat, a $250 ottoman, a $200
rug, and a $400 end table one month. The next month, you may use your
$1,500 set aside for a $1,500 air handler. Be sure to factor in any extra savings
or resources that you may have already stashed away for setting up your new
home. (Check out the next section for actually budgeting for different furni-
ture items.)
You may want to spring for more dinero on your second home by purchasing
it completely or partially furnished or decorated. For example, say that
during the showing, you see one or more items that you’d not only like to
own, but you immediately know are the perfect thing in the perfect place, and
that it would save you time if the items were there when you moved in (like
that top-of-the-line toaster oven in the kitchen, or that mahogany shelving
unit in the family room). Mention these items to the seller and ask if you can
work out an arrangement to buy them (and be sure to get that agreement in
writing, for your own protection). If the answer is yes, you’ll save time and
money — and get some things you already know that you’ll enjoy.
Budgeting for couches, curtains, 
and other homey touches
The amount you budget for home furnishings and decorations for your new
place will rely, of course, heavily on your own personal resources. As a guide-
line, the National Association of Homebuilders reports that owners of new
homes spend an average of $8,900 to furnish, decorate, and improve their
homes. About 77 percent of that money (about $6,800) goes toward furnish-
ings and changes and improvements to the property, while the remainder is
typically spent on appliances.
So what particular items should you furnish your second home with and how
much should you spend? You may want to include the items in Figure 10-1 in
your new second home. All these items cost money, ranging from peanuts for
a bath mat or artificial plant, to thousands of dollars for living room furniture
or a new computer. Feel free to photocopy this worksheet and carry it with
you. After you create a budget for furnishing and decorating your second
home, use this worksheet to help you stay on budget. Figure out how much
money you want to spend per category and per item and write that amount
in the allotted space. After you buy a piece of furniture or other goods,
record the amount that you spent to keep track of how much you’ve spent
per category.
181
Chapter 10: Setting Up Your New Digs

Don’t feel like you have to spend thousands of dollars to outfit your second
home. If you have the time, you can surf the Internet or spend hours roaming
around furniture wholesalers, consignment stores, flea markets, and local
shops and markets to find the best possible bargains. The key is to stick to
your budget and to only purchase those items that contribute to the result
you want: a tasteful, comfortable living space where you can enjoy your time
away from the rat race of everyday life.

If you’re contemplating how to furnish your home, your first thought may 
be that you have to spend thousands on brand new furniture for your new
second home. However, you’ve already spent a boatload on the home. Even

Chapter 10: Setting Up Your New Digs

If you’re strapped for time, if the prices meet your budget, and if the styles
match what you’re looking for, then buying new from a major retailer is often
the easiest and fastest way to completely outfit your new second home.
Most national and some local furniture stores offer terrific “same as cash”
offers to customers who sign up for their credit cards. You’ve probably seen
TV commercials (they generally air around major holidays) for furniture retail-
ers in which they advertise extended credit for up to a year or more with no
payments for 12 months and no interest charged if the balance is paid off by a
certain date. If your home-buying experience has left the coffers a bit low, the
big boys can be good furniture-buying options for you to check out.
If you’re feeling a bit adventurous, however, and you want unique or unusual
pieces to add to your home, then think outside of the (furniture) box and
scope out these resources for slightly used furniture with tons of character:
 Online furniture wholesalers: Search online for “furniture wholesalers”
for furniture resources, including comprehensive directories of suppliers.
 Local consignment shops: People who want to sell stuff bring it to one
of these shops that then take it on consignment, meaning the shop gets a
percentage of the selling price, but only if the item sells. People often
put unusual things on consignment, and you may just find that perfect
table or mirror you’ve been looking for.
 Area thrift shops: People have donated the items in these shops, and the
original owner has nothing to do with the goods anymore. You may be
able to negotiate a rock-bottom price for that rocker or chest of drawers.
And often, part of your purchase supports a local nonprofit agency, so
not only do you get a bargain, but you also give back to the community.
184
Part III: Making Your Second Home a Smart Investment 
Choosing your style
Just as you did with your primary home, you’ll
want to choose a style for your vacation home
that fits its personality. If your new place is near
the beach, for example, you can consider light-
colored furnishings, seaside landscape pic-
tures, seashell decorations, and a light oak
kitchen table and chairs. Perhaps a few wicker
pieces for the porch would be nice.
If you bought a log home in the country, you can
opt for a more rustic theme that includes bur-
gundy or hunter green couches and chairs, a
picnic-table-style dining table made of pine
that’s been stained a dark color, and rough-cut
wooden bunk beds in the kids’ room.
By deciding on a theme before you start shop-
ping, you avoid accumulating a hodgepodge of
different furniture styles and a mishmash of
decorations in your new home. Instead, you can
create a warm, welcoming environment — on
any budget — that you can truly call your own.
The furniture and decorations should have an
identity. Just like you do!

 Auctions: They can be hit or miss, but are definitely worth a shot if you
have the time and wherewithal to get out there and bid on stuff that
you’d probably never find in a modern furniture shop (or even a pawn
shop, for that matter).
 Garage sales: Garage sales are usually hit-or-miss in terms of finding
what you’re looking for, and you may have to visit a lot of them on a
weekend. However, when you do find something you like, the price is
often incredibly low. Make sure you have access to a truck to bring
home your purchases.
 Flea markets: Flea markets are more organized than garage sales,
although their offerings are similar. Flea markets, also called swap meets,
are where people pay a fee to rent a space and sell whatever it is they
want to sell. The smaller flea markets commonly offer household goods
and a wide range of other objects, often at low prices. The larger flea
markets often have established retailers offering their goods in an out-
door venue. The plus of browsing a flea market is that you’re, in a sense,
hitting dozens of garage sales at one time and in one place.
 Classifieds: Either in the paper or online (at a site like www.craigslist.
com — check out your local area first to avoid shipping issues), these
advertising vehicles can be great sources of furniture and odds and ends
for a second home. And don’t overlook those weekly “flyers” that come 
in your mailbox, where sellers post ads (usually for free) for affordable,
used items.
 Your neighbor’s curb: That’s right. Your neighbor’s curb can be a great
source of furniture for your new vacation home. You know what they
say: One man’s trash is another man’s treasure. This definitely holds
true when it comes to used furniture. That nightstand sitting next door
on the curb may have lost its appeal to your neighbor for a variety of
reasons — it’s scratched, the hinge is broken, one of the drawers needs
a new bottom, whatever. But if you’re handy and you know that the
defects can be easily remedied, then you may be able to score a lovely
piece for your second home for zero money down, and zero money due
later! So give a peek out the window when it’s bulk pickup time and see
whether anything out there catches your eye. Plus, if you do rescue a
bookcase because you know you can refinish it and make it a lovely
addition to your den, that’s one less contribution to the landfill!
If your new second home is more than a few hours away by car or plane, 
you should seek out new and used furniture resources in the town where 
the house is located, or relatively close by. Otherwise, you’ll spend an 
undue (and aggravating) amount of time and money trying to coordinate 
the purchase and delivery of goods to your across-the-miles abode.

Chapter 10: Setting Up Your New Digs

Putting the right amount of personal
touches in your home
You probably won’t use your second home in the same way or with the same
frequency that you use your primary home (although if you plan on retiring to
your second home, you may later use it similarly to how you currently use
your primary home). So you need to decide what you really do need in your

The pros and cons of used furniture
When furnishing a home, the vast majority of
buyers buy new furniture. Many people would
never even consider buying used furniture. But
this is a little shortsighted, especially if you’re on
a budget and want the most for your dollar. You
buy used cars, right? And used musical instru-
ments, used window air conditioners, used
books, used bicycles, used TVs, and, of course,
“vintage” clothes. So why not the occasional
“preowned” piece of furniture? If you’re com-
pletely against the idea, I may not immediately
persuade you to change your mind, but indulge
me, okay? Read through these pros and cons of
used furniture. You may discover something.
Pros
 You can find older, more unusual styles not
available in modern furniture stores.
 You can haggle with the seller for a better
deal. (You’ll be amazed at the offers people
will accept!)
 You’ll spend less than you would on new
furniture (unless, of course, you plan to
outfit the home with one-of-a-kind antique
furniture — then you’re venturing into a
whole ‘nuther world!)
 You may be able to talk to the owner about
the piece and discover any flaws or prob-
lems with it. (Often, flaws in older pieces are
perceived to add to its character. Also, don’t
expect a furniture salesman to reveal this
kind of information!)
 Hunting for used furniture will be right up
your alley if you’re the type who likes to pick
through flea markets and consignment
shops for undiscovered gems.
Cons
 You may not be able to find “complete” sets,
or create a uniform look in your second
home.
 The items may be dirty or damaged and
need cleaning or repairs, or both.
 You won’t get a warranty for the goods,
which will be sold “as is.” As is means as
is: If a cabinet has a missing shelf and you
didn’t notice the holes for it until you got
home, you’re on your own. Sure, you can
call the seller and ask if they forgot to give
you the shelf, but if it’s gone, you either live
with the cabinet as is, or try to replace the
missing shelf.
 You never know who used the furniture, or
what they used it for. And if this notion
grosses you out, used furniture may not be
for you. Also, here’s a friendly Biohazard
Alert: Stay away from used mattresses and
toilet seats — even if they’re free. Seriously.

new second home, and what you really don’t need. Needs and wants: They’re
often at odds, but these questions will help you differentiate between the two.
To figure this out, you have to know how you’re going to use your new place.
Ask yourself the following questions, and answer realistically based on your
work and lifestyle:
 How often am I going to use this home?
 How long will the home be rented out to others?
 Will my family and friends be using the home?
 Will I rent the home on a full-time basis until I plan to retire there in five
(or however many) years?
 Am I going to use the home a few times a year and rent it for the rest of
the time on a seasonal basis?
The following examples are three different scenarios pertaining to your
second home. In each one, consider what to include when you outfit your
place, as well as what not to include:
 You plan to use your second home only for your own vacation purposes.
If this scenario rings true for you, feel free to fill your second home with as
many or as few personal touches as you want. If you envision blue carpet-
ing, avocado appliances, and that Hawaiian hula girl lamp that everybody
but your husband hates, then decorate to your heart’s content because
you’ll be the only ones who have to navigate it.
 You plan to use your second home a few times a year, and rent it the
rest of the time. Here’s where you want to create a cross between a 
comfortable “homey” home and a hotel room. Doing so means bringing
in the basics (and making sure that they’re both tasteful and functional),
as well as throwing in a few personal touches that say, “Yes, you’re using
this home now, but it belongs to someone else.”
 You’ll rent the home on a full-time basis until you retire there at some
point. Stick with the basics and avoid the personal touches if this sce-
nario applies to you. Go with some tasteful living room and dining room
furniture, basic bedroom sets, and enough bathroom accoutrements to
keep a renter comfortable. Eschew the “you,” and the pic of your daugh-
ter’s ballet debut, and let them bring their own shampoo.
Ultimately, your goal is to create an enjoyable living space without exceeding
your budget. Because this won’t be your primary home (at least not yet), 
my suggestion is to adopt an “out of sight, out of mind” philosophy. In other
words, forgoing that $5,000 grandfather clock that you know would look 
great in the foyer probably isn’t a bad idea. You won’t get to see it every day
anyway, and why spend that kind of money for an unoccupied house or to
make guests or renters happy? Use common sense when spending, create a
sense of style that you like, and stick with it for the best results.

Clothing Matters: Packing It 
or Keeping It in Your Home
Packing is a drag. You know it, I know it, and yet it’s one of those things that
must be done. But you can avoid packing suitcases and lugging luggage every
time you visit your second home, which brings me to an important question:
Do you need to pack your clothing every time you visit your second home or
can you leave some there?
To ease your packing woes, consider leaving at least some of your clothing
and toiletries in your second home. It’s not absolutely necessary, of course,
but doing so is a wise move if you plan to use the place on a regular basis.
And, as you figure out which clothing and belongings you want to keep per-
manently at your second home, my advice is to stick to the basics and avoid
going overboard.
Avoid leaving valuables (such as jewelry and collectibles) at your second
home if other people rent it, stay there, and/or use it for day trips. I’m not sug-
gesting that your renters are thieves. But you’re courting trouble when you
leave valuables lying around when you’re not there. Better safe than sorry.
This section helps you decide what to pack and what to leave at your second
home so you aren’t lugging extra suitcases each time you visit. This section
also looks at how much you plan to use your second home so you know how
much to leave there and how much you need to pack each time you visit.

Shoot for simplicity
That gorgeous plush velvet couch may be
screaming your name from the consignment
shop window, but if buying it means you’ll spend
half of your vacation with a lint roller in hand,
removing Fido or Fluffy’s hair from its folds, then
you may want to steer clear of it.
Instead, aim for a low-maintenance furnishing
approach. Think about the daily maintenance
required of the pieces you’re buying, and shoot
for items that need little or no hands-on atten-
tion beyond regular, routine cleanings.
A good general rule when outfitting a second
home is “less is more.” After all, you can always
add more at a later date if you’re feeling
deprived — or if you simply can’t stand that
empty foyer one second longer!

Beginning with the basics
Keeping outfits and other necessities in your second home doesn’t have to
break the bank. You can have the basics without spending a fortune. Start
with the essentials and avoid overdoing it right out of the gate, lest you find
yourself up to your ears in too many boxes and outfits. Keep in mind that you
can always bring more stuff later.
Here’s a list of the things you’ll likely need to live comfortably for a week or
more. Season to taste as needed.
 5–7 casual, everyday outfits
 2–3 dressy outfits (if you plan to socialize and eat dinners in fancy
restaurants)
 3–4 pairs of shoes (including casual, athletic, and dress)
 Enough sleepwear and undergarments for a week to 10 days
 Bathing suits, ski outfits, workout clothing, and/or other items you’ll
need to enjoy recreational activities
 Duplicate sets of toiletries, makeup, and hair accessories
 A first-aid kit and over-the-counter medicines that you have at your 
primary home and use on a daily or semiregular basis
 Soap, towels, washcloths, toilet tissue, paper towels, bed linens, blankets
 Laundry and kitchen essentials like soap, bleach, softener, dish washing
detergent, scouring pads, cleanser, window cleaner, and all that neces-
sary “stuff” for cleaning
 A small clock, a few tools, a flashlight, pencil, and paper pads
 Games, novels, puzzles, playing cards, and such
 Any gadgets or other items that you simply can’t live without (like that
high-end espresso maker, your favorite lighted makeup mirror, or a copy
of whatever emergency repair programs you use when your computer
crashes — computer woes seem to never take vacations, right?)
Don’t forget your prescription medications. Explain the situation to your
doctor, and be sure to get extra refills on those medications that you take on
a regular basis. You don’t want to have to run to the nearest drugstore the
day after you move in.
Having an enormous selection only means more to rummage through when
you’re looking for that perfect outfit . . . and more laundry to do! As long as
your home is equipped with a washer and dryer — and as long as you’re not
planning to stay more than a month or two at a time — you should be able to
get away with a week’s worth of clothing and goods.
189
Chapter 10: Setting Up Your New Digs

Stashing the right stuff for your stays
You truly don’t need to bring everything but the kitchen sink to your second
home. Instead, use a more calculated approach to stocking the place with
exactly what you (and any of your renters) will need. You wouldn’t schlep
your entire household with you if you went on a week’s vacation, right? Just
because you own the place you’re vacationing at shouldn’t change your
thinking as to what you should bring.
Just how much you bring to — and leave — in your second home depends on
a few factors:
 How much time you plan to spend in your second home: If you’ll only
be visiting your place for two weeks out of the year, then lugging your
belongings on each trip probably isn’t that big of a deal. However, if
you’re fairly certain that weekend trips to the home are in the cards,
keeping the basics on hands instead of dragging them with you every
single time will be much easier (see the preceding section about what 
to keep at your house). If you return home on Sunday night and have to
work the next day, those suitcases may not get unpacked before
Thursday or Friday rolls around and it’s time to pack again.
 Whether other people will be staying in the home: If you plan to rent
your villa during the times that you’re not using it, you don’t want your
underwear drawer with all its exotic sundries to come under the
scrutiny of others. Use your private owner’s closet for storage of private
stuff and keep the dressers and closets empty for your guests to use.
I’ve stayed in dozens of privately owned condos over the years and have
found that most owners reserve one locked closet in which they keep
their own personal items (like wine, pictures, books, and things they don’t
want used by others) out of sight, secure, and untouched. Commonly
called the owner’s closet, it provides a place to stow things when renters,
family, or friends are using your second home.
 How much space is available to store the goods: Space won’t be an
issue if
• You’ve purchased storage furniture such as dressers or closet
organizers.
• No one else is going to use the home while you’re not there.
If you fall into these categories, then you can, of course, spread your
stuff all over the house any way you want to. However, if space is lim-
ited, or if others will be prowling around, you’ll want to keep your cloth-
ing and personal effects in a safe place.

Adjusting to Your New Environment
Moving is never easy. And, yes, purchasing a second home and establishing a
new life in a new place — even if it’s only part time in the beginning — counts
as moving. Although you aren’t leaving your primary residence behind (at
first), you do have to adjust to your new home’s surroundings so you can
truly enjoy your new dwelling.
This section provides some pointers for getting acclimated to your new sur-
roundings. By exploring the neighborhood and meeting your new neighbors,
your second home can start to feel like home, sweet home.
Get to know your new community
Ultimately, you’ll leave your primary home and live in your second home full
time. You’ll leave behind dear friends, familiar routines, and favorite places.
Then you’ll need to make new friends and uncover new favorite places in
your second hometown. This sounds daunting, but it need not be.
Instead of hiding behind those four walls, though, get out and explore your
new environment. If in the past you’ve spent significant time in the area that’s
home to your second home, you may already be familiar with some or all the
attractions, parks, restaurants, entertainment venues, shops, and shopping
malls. If not, familiarize yourself with the activities and amenities available —
both in the immediate neighborhood and in the city or town where you’ve
touched down. If the area is all new to you, however, start at the area’s con-
vention and visitor’s bureau or the chamber of commerce. You can find them
online or in the phone book.
By spending a few minutes at these places, you can get your hands on
 The most recent, magazine-style publication touting the area and its
attractions, eating establishments, and stores
 Brochures advertising individual attractions and entertainment venues
 Maps of all kinds
 Info for new residents (directions to the post office, how to get your
water hooked up, and so on)
 Tips from the locals; you can uncover some amazing tidbits during a
friendly conversation with the woman at the visitor’s bureau or the 
man at the chamber of commerce
191
Chapter 10: Setting Up Your New Digs

Expensive advertising can lure diners in, but one of the best ways to find the
top restaurants in the area is by asking neighbors or acquaintances where
they like to eat. Because everyone’s perception of a “good restaurant” is 
different, be sure to specify whether you want “value” (big portions at good
prices), “high-end” options (higher prices and impeccable service), or just
the best tasting food available. Also, be sure to specify what types of food
you’re really into. If you love Italian, and want to know the best Italian restau-
rants and pizza places in the area, say so. After all, a sushi restaurant just
won’t satisfy your pizza craving, so ask about your faves.
Now comes the fun part. Armed with this info, you can explore the area and
try different places without getting lost. As you make your way around, be
sure to note which places and restaurants are worth one or more repeat
visits and which aren’t. You can do this right on the guides that you’re using
to find the places or in a separate notebook.
Keeping a visitor’s notebook in your second home is a great idea if you plan
on renting it. The notebook doesn’t have to be fancy. Just use a plain spiral-
bound notebook with one page for restaurants, one for shopping venues, one
for theaters, and so forth. And be sure to include your comments about each
place. For example, be sure to inform your renters about that little strip mall
that has a dollar store, or the takeout place that offers free delivery. The
renters will appreciate your thoughtfulness. Figure 10-2 shows a sample index
card. You may want to keep track of this info on index cards or in a file on
your computer. You can then transfer the most relevant stuff to your visitor’s
notebook when you get a chance.
Name of the venue:
Location (travel time to get there) (approximately):

192
Part III: Making Your Second Home a Smart Investment 

Because you’ll be living in your new community on a part-time basis — and not
immersed in it year-round — having this info handy is useful for future visits
and can help you avoid those places that simply aren’t worth returning to.
Meet your new neighbors
Back home you probably have a network of friends and family with whom
you socialize, eat meals, gossip, play games, travel, barbecue, and otherwise
enjoy spending time. Depending on your personality and socialization skills,
you’ll probably start forming similar bonds in your new environment.
One of the best times to get out and meet your neighbors is in the first few
weeks after you buy your second home. During this period, neighbors are
usually very interested in knowing
 Who you are and where you’re from?
 Why you moved into the area or purchased a second home there?
 How long you plan to stay?
 How often you’ll be there?
 What are your hobbies? (If you’re into fishing, for example, and the guy
across the street has a boat and likes to fish, you’re in luck.)
 What they can do to help you move in and get comfortable?
Being neighborly is especially important for second-home owners who aren’t
around to watch their properties throughout the year. By making friends with
the families next door, across the street, or across the hall, you can make
arrangements to watch each other’s places while you’re away. You can 
establish your own little security team, and you’ll sleep better knowing 
that a trusted friend is keeping an eye on things.
If you’ve purchased a home in a 55-plus community, a country club environ-
ment, or other socially oriented development, then chances are good that at
least one event will be held annually to get the owners together to meet and
mingle. Whether you play bingo, enjoy cocktail hour, or participate in a neigh-
borhood garage sale, these events provide a great way for new homeowners to
get to know everyone and form bonds with those who share similar interests.
If it turns out that one or more of your neighbors are unfriendly or downright
unsavory, don’t let it ruin your weekend getaways or family vacations. Just
chalk it up to the fact that it takes all kinds, and go about your business with-
out worrying about whether the guy next door likes you.

Renting Out Your Second Home
to Pay for Itself
In This Chapter
 Renting your second home for profit
 Understanding your rental options
 Using property managers
 Marketing your second home
 Watching the market
O
ne of the nicest aspects of second-home ownership is that, if you want
to, you can rent out your abode for cashola. That’s right, folks: If you
plan on using your second home for only a few weeks or months out of the
year, you can turn the place into a moneymaking machine by renting it out to
visitors or vacationers. And it’s your call as to how long to rent it for; from a
few summer weeks to vacationers, to six-month or longer stretches to some-
one who needs a retreat for a few months.
Renting your second home doesn’t necessarily mean you’ll be dealing with a
long line of strangers who want to use the place for a week at a time. You can
choose who to rent to and when to allow them access to your new digs,
although if you have property in a prime location, such as the beach, you
may end up renting it to people you don’t know during peak summer months
when you aren’t using the home. If you’d rather not deal with strangers, you
can rent your second home to friends and relatives. Your second home can
provide a versatile, lucrative revenue stream, depending on your preferences.
In this chapter, I show you how to rent your home by using a property man-
ager or by managing the property yourself. I also review the basics of adver-
tising your second home to the eager-to-rent masses and discuss how to
price your rental and screen renters who will be staying there.

How to Turn Your Second Home
into a Cash Cow
Put on your entrepreneurial cap for a minute. (Even if you’ve never worn it
before, I’ll betcha it fits just fine!) Now take a good long look at your second
home — but not through your rose-colored glasses (you removed them
before you put the cap on, right?). Don’t look at your second home as only a
place where you and your loved ones can gather around a cozy fire with a
cup of cocoa and sing holiday carols, but rather as a component of your
investment portfolio and as a potential moneymaker.
This section helps you cash in by explaining a few key points you need to
understand before you actually rent your second home. I help you tackle con-
cerns about location and whether the community where the home is located
allows rentals, how much to charge, and most important, making sure you
spend some time in your home away from home.
Will you have to follow someone else’s
rules when renting your home?
Before you start filling out the deposit slips for your rental profits, be sure to
check the neighborhood covenants of the community in which you’re consid-
ering buying. Community bylaws vary from development to development, but
many prohibit anything other than owner-occupied units. Be sure you’re
allowed to rent your home before you start looking for renters.
This issue is important for those of you who are considering renting out your
place on a short-term (couple of weeks) or super-short-term (weekends to a
week at a time) basis. Full-time residents in many areas of the country have
been crying foul over the loud partying and raucousness sometimes associ-
ated with those who come in, vacation for a week, and then leave. As a result,
many communities have instituted “minimum stay” rules for vacation homes.
Make sure that the place you’re purchasing meets your needs when it comes
to rentals. If renting out your second home is important to you, “Can I rent
out my unit?” should be the first question you ask an agent when he suggests
looking at a condo in a prime vacation spot. If renting is unequivocally not
allowed, then you need to consider a different location. Check the rules —
and then double-check them — if you’re thinking seriously about renting out
your second home.
Often, even if a community does allow rentals, many boilerplate condo
bylaws these days forbid rentals of less than six months. This won’t work for
you if you’re thinking about renting your place out for a week at a time from
196
Part III: Making Your Second Home a Smart Investment 

June to September every year. And in many cases, the bylaws also require
that the association’s executive board approve the tenant. This gives the
board veto power over your potential tenant. You need to know all of this
before you sign your purchase agreement.
If you can’t get your hands on a copy of the neighborhood or community
rules, speak with a real estate agent or attorney in the area about the issue.
They should be able to answer your questions and give you some free advice
before you buy.
This concern is, of course, irrelevant if you’re purchasing a log home situated
on 20 acres in rural New York, and you have no one to account to but you. But
if you have your eye on a condo in Fort Lauderdale from which a vacationer
can gaze out onto the glorious Atlantic Ocean, you need to do some serious
investigation into whether the condo rules allow you to rent your unit to a
third party.
Location is key
Location is everything in real estate, particularly for those of you who are
looking to rent out your second homes to willing customers. Buy or build a
mansion smack in the middle of the Mojave Desert, for example, and your
pool of potential renters will be pretty limited, no matter how great it is. But
snag a place by the seashore in just about any state and you’ll probably find
yourself turning down potential customers during the high season. See
Chapter 4 for more information on selecting the right second-home location.
Think about the following factors — all of which are relevant to renting out
your place:
 The location of your second home: Is it in an area where seasonal or
year-round visitors like to go on a regular basis?
 The style and size of your home: Do the features of your place lend
themselves to short, frequent stays by other individuals or families?
 The home’s and/or community’s amenities: Just how enticing are they
to other individuals or families?
If, for example, you own an oversized two-bedroom, two-bath condo on the
beach in Naples, Florida, and it’s in a complex where the community resi-
dents have access to a pool, tennis courts, fitness center, and private beach,
then finding renters to pay a premium to spend a week in your home during
the in-season should be a breeze.
If, however, you and yours are the rustic type and you own a log cabin in
Tennessee where “roughing it” is the name of the game, then your pool of
potential renters will be significantly smaller, as will the number of weeks
197
Chapter 11: Renting Out Your Second Home to Pay for Itself

that you’ll be able to feasibly rent your home out during the year. It’s a given
that more people — especially vacationers — are “beachy” rather than
“woodsy.”
How much to charge
If you’re seriously considering renting your second home, then you need to
know how much to charge the renters. The price will depend on several fac-
tors, including the going rate in your second home’s market, the demand for
rentals, and your costs.
To determine a fair rent to charge for your second home, ask yourself the fol-
lowing questions:
 How much are other owners charging for similar properties? This
question is likely the most accurate indicator of what you can get for
your rental. That’s because, all things being equal, price will almost
always prevail when someone goes on the Internet or flips through the
Sunday paper looking for a two-bedroom, two-bath home for rent on
Long Beach Island, New Jersey. The one that’s $5,000 a month may be
beautiful and have great amenities and a spectacular view, but the simi-
lar, tad more “adequate” one that rents for $3,000 a month will probably
get more attention because of its comparable affordability.
 How much are people willing to pay for home rentals in the area?
What will the market bear? The more homes available for rent in a par-
ticular area, the lower the demand will be for yours, and the lower the
rent you can charge. It’s basic “supply and demand” Economics 101, and
exactly the opposite is true in areas where supply is scarce.
Put yourself in a renter’s shoes. Compile information on comparable
properties as if you were looking to rent one. There’s nothing like first-
hand data to shine a light on areas of uncertainty and provide facts you
can use. Get out and shop around the area where your second home is
located with your renter’s cap on. Surf the Internet, and check out area
newspapers for current rental prices. You can even ask real estate agents
who handle rentals to dig up this information for you. The agent who sold
you your second home may also be able to help you with this info.
During this research, pay attention to the following:
• The condition of the homes you look at and how they compare
with your house.
• The homes’ sizes and the number of bedrooms and bathrooms.
• The differences in amenities between your home and the homes
you look at. If you have a hot tub on your deck and the other ones
don’t, you may be able to fetch a little more for your house.
198
Part III: Making Your Second Home a Smart Investment 

• How much the rent is and what it includes.
• Whether the season makes any difference in what’s being charged.
In some areas, you may be able to command higher prices — even
on long-term rentals — during a peak season, like summer in beach
areas, fall in foliage areas, and winter in ski areas.
• Any other selling points property owners are using to snag a higher
price. You may be able to use comparable features in your home as
justification for a higher rent. Consider high-speed Internet access,
telephone, cable TV, and central air to justify a higher price.
 How much cold cash do you need to bring in to break even or earn a
profit on your second home? After you figure out what to charge by
using the previous questions in this section, whip out that calculator
and plug in the total monthly cost of owning your second home (check
out Chapter 2 for more info). If the numbers show you breaking even, or
even better, earning a profit, then you’re in business. If they don’t, then
you may want to reconsider your rental price, or completely rethink
what to buy and where to buy it.
If you’re rental minded, think of your second home— at least until you move
into it full time — as a business. It must be competitive with other homes on
the market to be attractive to renters and (ideally) turn a profit.
Vacationing in your second home
Even if you plan on regularly renting out your second home to others, be sure
to carve out some time for you and yours to spend there during the year. The
second-home owners from whom I’ve rented all do the same thing when it
comes to their own vacations: They mark out their weeks first on a calendar,
and then accommodate their guests and renters on the remaining weeks.
It’s a simple exercise, but it ensures that your own desires and needs are sat-
isfied before you invite the rest of the world into your home. Start by coming
up with a few days, weeks, or months during the year that you think you’ll be
able to get away to your getaway. Grab a red marker and a calendar, and put a
big X through all the days you want. This is your way of declaring, “These are
my days to enjoy my second home!”
Thus, when the lure of rental income beckons, you can look at your calen-
dar and work the renters in around your days, which — as a second-home
owner — you deserve. And if a potential vacationer really needs a certain
week, and it’s no big deal to adjust your plans, you’ll do it, right? But blocking
out your time is a good way to start.
199
Chapter 11: Renting Out Your Second Home to Pay for Itself

Considering Your Rental Options
If you’re considering renting your second home, you have two basic ways to
do so: short term and long term. However, you can also be a bit more creative
to generate bucks from your abode.
This section takes you through the basic rental options and also discusses a
few innovative methods for renting out a second home. I also explain how to
resolve the inevitable “family” issue — y’know, when your family or best
friend wants to stay in your second home for free? — and I show you how to
do it in a way that doesn’t upset Uncle Ted and Aunt Fran (and any other kin
who may feel a sense of entitlement to your place).
Comparing long- and short-term rentals
When you decide to rent your home, you’ll likely consider a variety of fac-
tors: how much time you’ll allow the house to be rented, how much income
you want the home to generate, and how often you want to deal with the
turnover in tenants. Your decisions about these factors will influence
whether you establish your second home as a long- or short-term rental.
 A long-term rental is exactly what it sounds like: A family or an individual
lives in your second home on a year-round basis, usually with an annual
or month-to-month lease.
This plan is terrific for someone who wants to purchase a second home
now, but doesn’t need to, or want to, live in it (or even visit it) immedi-
ately. If you’re thinking about retiring and moving into the home ten years
from now, for example, then you would be a good candidate to offer the
place as a long-term rental. You’ll own it, it’ll appreciate in value (I hope),
you’ll know where you’ll be retiring to, and, in the intervening years, the
home can earn money for you.
 A short-term rental provides you with some “second-home time,” yet still
allows you to reap some of the financial benefits of renting out your
place. Short-term rentals can range from weekend and single-week
rentals to vacationers, friends, and family, to longer, one- to six-month
stints for visiting executives, professors, and others who need a place
for a short period and prefer to live in a home rather than a hotel.
Short-term rentals are particularly common if your second home is in a
popular vacation spot. If you’re buying a second home in a hot vacation
spot, then there’s a good chance that you’ll be able to rent it out to vaca-
tioners on a fairly regular basis, particularly during the in-season periods
of the year. In Florida, for example, in-season is between November and
April, when the rest of the nation is shivering in its britches. In Colorado,
the in-season is during ski season, when vacationers flock to the state
for its powdery slopes.
200
Part III: Making Your Second Home a Smart Investment 

Vacation rentals, especially during the right season, can be lucrative for
owners. If you expect your home to be vacant during certain times of the
year, you’ll definitely want to consider offsetting some of your expenses
with rental income.
The Internet has opened up the rental business to virtually anyone, making it
much easier for renters and owners to find each other and pair up. By post-
ing a description of your home and its location, a few photos, whether it’s a
long- or short-term rental, and a calendar on a site like www.vrbo.com or
www.vacationrentals.com, owners can expose their vacation homes to
the world and do business with renters from around the globe. If you’d rather
focus on finding a long-term tenant, consider placing an ad on the Web site
for the local newspaper in the area where your second home is located.
Look at your own situation and determine which option is best for you. If
you’re buying now to prepare for a retirement that’s coming several years
down the road, then a long-term rental is a good idea. If, however, you’re
planning on vacationing at your second home three or four times a year, then
the short-term rental option may be your best bet.
Doing business with family and friends
Okay, you’re a good person. You may have already planned on “giving away
your house” to select friends and special family members from time to time
throughout the year. And you would never think of charging cousins Ricky
and Gladys rent, right? Think again.
Give some serious thought to actually charging your friends and family for the
use of your home. If it makes you feel better, you can give them a discount, but
collecting at least something in rent is a good way to recoup some of your
monthly investment. Your family and friends would have to pay full price
somewhere else, right? So why not charge them a reduced rent to make up for
the wear and tear on your place? A modest fee (perhaps half your regular
rental price?) is well worth the enjoyment they’ll get out of using your place.
This is a good way to raise some additional cash to pay for your investment,
while also instilling responsible practices in your own kin and acquaintances.
Come up with a fair price based on what you would normally charge a
stranger to rent the home, but factor in the related renter’s budget and ability
to pay. (And because we’re talking about people you’re close to, you’ll proba-
bly have a pretty good sense of their financial particulars.)

Chapter 11: Renting Out Your Second Home to Pay for Itself

The IRS looks carefully at rental properties that are being run (and deducted)
as for-profit “businesses,” but that aren’t being rented out for anywhere near
fair market prices. Keep that in mind when you slash prices for your friends
and family. (Check Chapter 14 for more info.)
Using Property Managers to Handle
the Rental Process
If you’re toying with the idea of renting your second home, but you aren’t all
that thrilled with wearing the title of “landlord,” you have an alternative.
Instead of dealing with phone calls from potential renters at 3 o’clock on a
Sunday afternoon, you can unload the responsibility onto a property manager
who — for a fee — will handle almost everything having to do with the rental
and maintenance of your second home. Property management firms can be
especially useful for off-site owners who need help finding renters and filling
the rental calendar.

Part III: Making Your Second Home a Smart Investment 
Home exchanging can let you see the world
Bet you didn’t know that other second-home
owners are ready, willing, and able to “exchange”
their homes with you for a week or two, did you?
They are, and by connecting with them, you can
travel the world and stay in other people’s vaca-
tion homes. The practice is called home exchang-
ing, and second-home owners do exactly what it
sounds like they’re doing: They exchange proper-
ties with one another on a short-term basis as
way to see more of the world.
Done on a formal or informal basis, setting up a
home exchange can be as easy as thumbing
through the classifieds or browsing an online
rent-by-owner site to find someone who is rent-
ing out a vacation home in an area that you’d
like to visit. By offering your own home for a
week or two in exchange for a couple of weeks
in theirs, you’re essentially setting up your own
home exchange.
More formal arrangements can be made, too.
Several reputable Web sites list homes available
for exchange. Targeted at second-home owners,
these sites include ExchangeHomes (www.
exchangehomes.com), HomeExchange (www.
homeexchange.com), and TradingHomes
(www.tradinghomes.com).
Of course, nothing is free these days. Searching
for area-specific listings is usually free, but
expect to pay a membership fee to join these
exchanges and get the contact info you need to
set up the exchange. HomeExchange, for exam-
ple, offers a $59.95 yearly membership, or lower
rates for those who join for more than one year.
The service also accepts rental listings (as
opposed to straight exchanges), which are
placed into their own category and accessible
through the site’s online search features.

In this section, I discuss the property manager’s role, how much you can
expect to pay for one, and how to find one who can help you rent out your
valuable vacation property.
The property manager’s role
If you think you want to rent out your second home, but aren’t sure about all
the ins and outs of finding and keeping track of renters from afar, a property
manager can be your best friend. Property managers serve as a liaison
between you, as the home’s owner, and your tenants. They provide a valuable
service to those owners who can’t physically be onsite, ensuring that their
properties are rented, maintained, and safe. If you can’t oversee the rental of
your second home yourself, the peace of mind is certainly worth the money.
(You can also use a property manager to maintain your second home,
whether you’re renting it out or not. Check out Chapter 13 for more info.)
If you have only one second home, and if your schedule (and your primary
home’s proximity to your second home) allows for frequent visits, you may
not need a property manager. Weigh the manager’s fees (check out the next
section for more on fees) against what it would take to rent out, maintain, and
inspect the property yourself. If doing it on your own is significantly less
expensive than hiring help, nix the property manager. (But just be prepared
to be on call whenever a renter is in the house.)
How much they charge
The fees charged by property managers can vary greatly. The factors that
determine what a typical property manager charges include the following:
 The location of the property: If your home is in a hot vacation spot where
there are a lot of second homes (and, thus, probably a lot of rental activ-
ity), expect to pay more than if your place is in a less popular area.
 Demand for managers in the area: If demand is high for property man-
agers in the region, you’ll pay more than you would in an area where
there is a glut of managers and a scarcity of properties to represent.
 The size and complexity of your home: The owner of a one-bedroom
condo will certainly pay less for management services than the owner of
a five-bedroom, six-bath single-family home on two acres of land.
 The services you need: Property managers will be more than happy to
provide an array of services not included in their flat fees — the fee they
charge for the most common, routine services. Whether you want or
need these extras is entirely up to you.
203
Chapter 11: Renting Out Your Second Home to Pay for Itself

 The number of individual units that the property manager is handling
at a time (the size of the management company): To help their business
survive and grow, most property management firms oversee multiple
properties. If you’re dealing with a large firm with hundreds of proper-
ties, you may pay a little less than you would for one that handles just a
dozen homes.
If you hire a property manager to manage your second home, you can expect
to pay the following fees based on your situation:
 One month’s rent or 5 to 10 percent of the income for long-term rentals:
Most property managers charge a month’s rent or 5 to 10 percent of the
total rent collected on a property that’s rented out long term. Expect to
pay at least this much while you’re renting out your home on a full-time
basis and using a manager. When the time comes to retire to your second
home, you probably won’t need or want a property manager’s rental ser-
vices, although you still may want to retain one on a limited scale to
handle grounds maintenance and other routine chores.
 A flat fee: Some property managers nix the commission route and
instead cover their own expenses by charging owners a flat monthly fee.
These fees vary greatly, so be sure to shop around before you choose a
manager to handle your property.
The flat fee route may work if you’re not using a management company
for anything but the basics — maintaining the property. If you’re having
the rent sent directly to you, and you have a plumber cousin, and you
have no problem doing a top-to-bottom cleaning when the tenant moves
out, then talk to property managers about an a la carte deal in which
you pick the services you want and pay a flat rate.
 25 to 50 percent of the income for infrequent rentals: If you’re renting
your home out on a less predictable basis (a few times a year, perhaps),
you’ll probably pay 25 to 50 percent of the rent in property management
fees. The higher fees are because there is more involved with keeping
such frequently unoccupied properties maintained, rented out, mar-
keted to the masses, and in an appealing, safe condition.
Before you agree on any fees and before you hand over your home’s keys to a
property manager, put everything you discuss in writing, and make sure all
significant parties sign on the dotted line (including you). You may also want
to have an attorney review the agreement just to be sure that the language is
clear and the deal is solid.
The agreement should clearly spell out the property manager’s duties and
state exactly how much you’ll pay on a monthly, quarterly, or annual basis for
those services. It should also list a termination (or renewal) date, all contact
information for the owner(s) and property manager, and the terms for solving
any breach of contract issues.
204
Part III: Making Your Second Home a Smart Investment 

Finding a reputable property manager
If you’ve determined that a property manager is the way to go to keep an eye
on your second home when you’re not around, check with the following
people in your search for a reputable property manager:
 Other second-home owners who have used these professionals: These
folks can tell you the good, the bad, the ugly, and even the wonderful of
working with specific managers. Some of your neighbors or friends may
even be willing to recommend a good manager to handle your property.
 The staff at the National Association of Residential Property Managers
(NARPM): If you don’t know any other second-home owners in the area,
contact the NARPM, which has local chapters around the country. Check
out the group’s Web site at www.narpm.org. Click on the “Search
Property Managers” link, which allows you to fill out a search form and
retrieve names of NARPM members based on your criteria. These mem-
bers are required to follow a code of ethics and stay current on their
educational requirements.
 Anyone you know who owns or lives in a condo or apartment com-
plex maintained by a property management company: Property man-
agers handle condo developments, senior housing complexes, and
apartment buildings, as well as individual homes. You can ask a friend
who owns a condo who manages her property, what services are
included, and what she thinks of them.
After you find a property manager located near your second home, check out
his credentials. You also can call your state’s Division of Real Estate or Division
of Business and Regulation for specific property management requirements
for your area. In certain states (not all, though), property managers must
be licensed and must meet initial and continuing education requirements.
Property managers must also carry liability insurance, and many are associ-
ated with trade groups that set forth their own ethical guidelines and profes-
sional requirements.
Does that mean the property manager with the most designations after his
name is the best one to work with? Not always, but it does mean that that
person has put out the money and agreed to the time commitment involved
with getting as much education as possible in the field.
Asking the right questions
As you narrow the list of prospective property managers to a few, call them
and ask the following questions. You want to ensure that they’re going to take
care of your property.
205
Chapter 11: Renting Out Your Second Home to Pay for Itself

 How long have you and/or your firm been managing properties? You
want someone with experience, not someone who is new to the business.
 How many second homes/vacation homes have you managed in the
last five years? Have you worked in the community where my second
home is located? Steer clear of property managers and firms who work
only with commercial properties (such as apartment buildings) and who
don’t know your neighborhood.
 Is licensing required in this state and, if so, are you licensed and is
your license current? It’s important to work with someone who has to
abide by the rules of their licensing agency.
 Do you belong to any trade groups, and/or do you have any other pro-
fessional credentials? This is a good indicator that the property manager
cares about his reputation and about what’s going on in the industry.
 Do you carry liability insurance? If the answer to this one is “No,”
move on.
 What type of marketing program do you use to attract tenants? Have
them go over in detail the marketing programs they’ll employ to get your
rental calendar filled.
 What specific services do you offer and at what cost? Are your costs
negotiable? Have a good idea of exactly what the manager will do and
for how much money.
 How often will you inspect the property? You want inspections to take
place after tenants vacate the home and on regular intervals (such as
quarterly).
 What types of security measures will you take in the event of a natural
disaster or emergency? This will be particularly important for out-of-
state owners whose homes are in places prone to natural disasters,
which include floods, blizzards, ice storms, brush/forest fires, earth-
quakes, and hurricanes. Also, as disconcerting as it is to consider, many
regions today are prone to terrorist attacks, and this must also be taken
into account when preparing for emergencies.
 How available will you be to answer renter’s questions? How quickly
will you respond to maintenance calls? You want someone who is avail-
able and responsive.
 Will you provide me with the names and contact numbers of three
second-home owners who you’re currently representing? Ask the ref-
erences what their experiences, likes, and dislikes are as they relate to
the property manager and his services.
206
Part III: Making Your Second Home a Smart Investment 

Renting Out the Home on Your Own
If a property manager isn’t in the cards for you, and you want to rent out your
home on an annual or short-term basis, then you’ll have to take it upon your-
self to create a marketing campaign to get the word out about your rental.
Can you just throw a free ad online, sit back, and wait for the renters to e-mail
or call you? Sure. If, for example, you only want to rent your place out for three
months out of the year, and your luxurious, yet affordable condo is in a highly
desirable location, then you may just get lucky with this no-frills strategy.
But if your home is swimming in a sea of equally great rental properties,
you’ll need a more aggressive and wide-ranging approach to score renters.
You’ll also need to screen renters, to ensure that the folks renting your home
won’t leave it in shambles. In this section, I help you figure out what will work
best for you.
Getting the word out
To maximize profits and keep your home occupied during the weeks that
you’re not using it, you need to consider it less a home and more a business.
That means doing what real estate agents do: They talk up their listings (in
this case, your home and its amenities, price, and availability), they ask for
referrals (from happy renters), and they spread the word about how wonder-
ful the getaways are that they represent. This is by far the easiest and most
economical way to fill those empty weeks.
The easiest place to start soliciting renters is in your own backyard. Neighbors,
friends, co-workers, relatives, and old high school and college buddies are basi-
cally your own sphere of influence (a term real estate agents use to describe
their individual networks of potential, future, and current clients). By tapping
this network first, you get free, unlimited advertising for your second home.
I say “unlimited” because when you tell four friends, and they tell four friends,
and they tell four friends, and so on, you exponentially expand your pool of
potential renters. Word of mouth can be very effective. And because you proba-
bly share similar interests with at least some of these people, there’s a good
chance that someone in this network will give your place a shot when it comes
time to fill in those vacation weeks.
When these folks have a good time at your place, there’s an equally good
chance that they’ll then spread the word to their own networks. This contin-
ues to increase your sphere of potential renters, a gold mine of potential
leads you create by simply mentioning at a lunch event that your lovely place
on Galveston Island is up for grabs for a few months this summer.
207
Chapter 11: Renting Out Your Second Home to Pay for Itself

Identify your market
Your own network of potential renters should be easy to contact. You probably
already have their phone numbers and/or e-mail addresses, and you should
have no problem making each of them aware of your rental property. But if you
want or need to reach out into the large World of People You Don’t Know to
find short-term or long-term renters for your home, then you need to identify
exactly who you’re trying to reach.
And how do you accomplish this seemingly overwhelming and daunting task?
You do what good marketing pros do: You pinpoint your target market before
going after it. To get started, ask yourself this key question: What kind of
person, couple, family, or group would want to rent my second home?
Answer the following questions to get a pretty accurate profile of your ideal
renter:
 What type of person typically lives or vacations in the area where my
second home is located? Moms, dads, and kids? College students?
Young professionals? Empty nesters?
 What kind of amenities do these folks look for, and does my home (or
the community where it’s located) offer them? If you’re in a beach
town, but the beach is miles away, then you may want to focus on one or
more amenities closer to your home.
 If I’m looking for a year-round renter, what type of person or family do
I want to see renting it? Remember that you can’t discriminate based on
race, color, creed, or religion, but you can choose young or old, kids or
no kids, smokers or nonsmokers, singles or couples, and so on.
 What age group does the typical renter fall into in my area or commu-
nity? If you purchased a second home in a 55-plus mobile home park, for
example, then your target market will have to meet the age rules of the
community.
 Where would I typically find this type of renter? Is he surfing the job
boards online? Is she leafing through the newspaper? Are they work-
ing with a real estate agent? The answer to this question will clue you
in to the best place to spend your hard-earned advertising dollars and
most effectively implement your marketing strategies.
After asking yourself these questions, you can conjure up a pretty clear
image of potential renters for your unit.
Set an advertising budget
Now you need to set an advertising budget to reach that now-defined target
market. This is important because you don’t want to discover later that the
six print ads and three Web site promotions you invested in ate up all of your
rental profits.
208
Part III: Making Your Second Home a Smart Investment 

To get started, set your budget at a relatively low 10 percent of your esti-
mated profits. Then adjust your ad expenditures from there based on how
well the advertising and marketing is performing for you.
Be sure to track your expenses for tax purposes, because you’ll be able to
write off the cost of advertising at the end of the year.
How much money you allocate to advertising your rental depends on a few
key factors, including:
 The frequency at which you plan to rent out the home: If your place is
a year-round rental that someone will move into and not leave for a year
or more, your budget will almost certainly be minimal. If, however, you
plan to use the home yourself for two months and rent it out the other
ten (probably to different individuals in week-long or month-long
blocks), then your budget will be considerably larger.
 How desirable the home’s location is: A great location can be a double-
edged sword. Sure, you’ll attract more renters to your lovely condo on
the sands of Myrtle Beach, but your unit will also be up against hun-
dreds of other rentals in the area. And this means you’ll need to spend
more, and spend more frequently, to stand out from the crowd.
And if your second home is in a location that isn’t as popular with
tourists, you can’t just sit back and wait for renters to inquire about
your home. Granted, your log cabin in the West Virginia wilderness will
likely have little competition for renters, but that means that getting the
word out about it may take a little more elbow grease and more time and
money to bring your place to the attention of potential renters.
 How good you are at networking and spreading the word: Your per-
sonal networking tools include face-to-face conversations at business
meetings and chats at social gatherings during which you rave about
your place, as well as talking it up in online blogs and forums. The more
of this stuff that you can do on your own, the smaller your advertising
budget can be.
 Your own financial situation: If you can afford to put half-page ads with
photos in the local newspaper for your mountainside chalet, by all
means go for it. But if you can’t, be sure to create a realistic monthly or
annual budget for your second-home marketing efforts.
Figure out your advertising strategy
An advertising strategy is basically a plan in which you determine how often to
advertise, where to advertise, and how much to spend on advertising. I cover
much of this in the previous sections, but an important point to remember is
that oversight is crucial. You need to keep track of all the elements of your plan
and note the response. For example, if you made a point of telling 15 friends
209
Chapter 11: Renting Out Your Second Home to Pay for Itself

and colleagues about your home for rent, and the response was one call that
went nowhere, then obviously your existing circle of charming cohorts does-
n’t boast potential renters.
Or say you ran an ad in the small, local newspaper in the town where your
second home is located and received 19 calls within a two-week period. Bingo!
You have found a medium that the people you’re looking for check out on a
regular basis, and this is where you should target your ad budget.
Your advertising strategy is often a hit-or-miss situation that may seem in the
beginning like you’re just throwing money at newspapers, posting ads online,
talking to people, and getting nowhere. That’s why you need to be diligent in
keeping track of your attempts, assigning a relative value to each one
(“worthless,” “not bad,” “excellent”), and writing notes to yourself.
The following are a few advertising strategies. One of the most popular, using
the Web, is so important that I give this topic its own section. Check out
“Advertising your home online” later in this chapter.
Use real estate agents
Real estate agents who work with rentals can serve as great go-betweens for
owners and potential renters. Find an agent who works frequently with rentals
(not all do, so just ask) and who already has multiple rental listings to offer
renters when they call the office looking for a place to stay. You may want to
start with the agent who sold you your home, or ask him to refer to you an
agent who specializes in rentals.
You’ll find the most helpful (and willing) agents in areas where rentals are
especially popular. The downtown Chicago market, for example, is one area
where agents work regularly with condo owners looking to farm out the
advertising, marketing, tenant screening, and rent collection duties to some-
one else. Beach and vacation areas also abound with agents who are accus-
tomed to potential renters calling to ask, “What do you have for rent on the
beach this summer?”
For annual rentals, expect to pay one month’s rent or 5 to 10 percent of one
year’s total rent in commission to the real estate agent. For vacation rentals,
the rates vary. Talk to your real estate agent about her fees, and negotiate
accordingly.
Rely on the out-of-town newspaper
The local newspaper is still a good way to reach potential renters in the
immediate area, although the fact that the paper is such a mass medium
makes it hard to pinpoint specific audiences. Expect to pay anywhere from
$150 to $300 for a few lines in the classified section. Larger display ads are
more costly but do draw a reader’s eye to them on the page.
210
Part III: Making Your Second Home a Smart Investment 

You should understand that some of your potential customers probably don’t
live in the town where your second home is located, so if you’re on a budget
you may want to skip to the next strategy. However, many people like to vaca-
tion locally, and I personally know families who rent beach cottages for a
couple of weeks in the summer only ten minutes from their home.
Measure your success
Unless you’re on an unlimited budget (and congrats if you are!), the last thing
you want to do is throw a bunch of money out there for dozens of different
advertising methods and then sit back and wait for the renters to come.
Instead, stick to two to three advertising strategies and measure each one’s
success (preferably over 6 to 12 months) before nixing them or adding any
new ones. This targeted approach will ensure that you’re spending your
advertising dollars wisely and aren’t wasting them on strategies that simply
aren’t generating business for you. If you get zero responses in six months
from newspaper classifieds, but ten calls from a Web site listing, then you’ll
know where to put your money. (Check out “Figure out your advertising strat-
egy” earlier in this chapter for more info.)
When a new renter comes your way, immediately ask her how she found out
about your place. This is very valuable info. Keep notes on this type of feed-
back and use the information to make smart advertising decisions in the
future. If, for example, 50 percent of your renters come your way through ads
placed in their local papers, then you’ll want to keep using that strategy.
Advertising your home online
One of the more popular strategies to advertise your rental property is just a
click away. The Internet is a godsend for second-home owners looking to rent
their homes to those eager nomads who love vacations.
The Internet can also be a terrific resource for the owner who is looking for a
long-term tenant. Web sites like Rent.com (www.rent.com) and Move.com
(www.move.com) charge a fee for rental listings, which potential renters from
all over the world then browse. In this section, I get into the basics of finding
short-term renters online and tell you how to avoid chasing bogus inquiries.
Online rental sites for owners
Second-home owners are making good use of the Internet these days. Folks
with homes to rent post their information on sites like Vacation Rental By
Owner (www.vrbo.com) and Vacation Rentals (www.vacationrentals.
com), and then travelers looking for homes to stay in (instead of hotels) hit
those same sites to find great deals on condos, cottages, and houses.
211
Chapter 11: Renting Out Your Second Home to Pay for Itself

212
Part III: Making Your Second Home a Smart Investment 
The sites charge a membership fee for second-home owners, and they also
offer enhanced listing features (such as virtual tours — 360-degree views of
the home’s interior) for additional fees. You can include descriptions, photos,
contact information, availability calendars, and other features that help lure
in potential renters.
Check out several sites before you choose the one (or ones) on which you
want to list your property. Along with the two listed above, I also recommend
CyberRentals (www.cyberrentals.com) and GreatRentals (www.great
rentals.com) as potential online showcases for your listing.
Because they compete with one another to score your second-home listings,
online sites charge a fairly standard rate for their services. Prices vary, rang-
ing from $150 to $200 for a one-year membership that includes a listing and
multiple photos.
Dealing with bogus leads
Bogus leads are a routine occurrence for anyone who does business on the
Internet these days. Over time, you’ll sense what to look for when determin-
ing the validity of a lead. In the meantime, make up a boilerplate “initial
response” to send to people who express interest.
In that e-mail, introduce yourself as the property owner, and ask the potential
renter for contact info (name, home address, phone number, hat size, and
e-mail address) and when they want to rent the property.
After you receive this information, give the renter a quick call to check the
phone number and make sure the person isn’t a teenager pulling an online
prank. If you hit a dead end upon dialing (she gave you a phony number or
the number’s not in service), there’s a good chance that the person may not
be as interested as you might hope.
But it can also mean that the person enjoys the anonymity of the Internet and
just doesn’t want to give out her phone number, so don’t throw away the lead
too quickly. And if her response to your introduction is, “We want to come
June 1–30. Where do we send the deposit?”, then you’re in business.
Maximizing your online presence
You can increase the number of “hits” that your vacation home receives and
maximize its exposure by using the following tactics:
 Develop an individual Web site for the home. Set up shop online for
your home by establishing a Web site where potential renters can view
pictures, get rates, check the availability calendar, and contact you
directly. If you don’t know how to set up a Web site, check out Creating
Web Pages For Dummies, 8th Edition, by Bud E. Smith and Arthur Bebak
(Wiley).

 Use search engines, keyword searches, and other advertising strate-
gies to increase the flow of visitors to that site. The higher up on the
search engine rankings your site is, the better the chances are that
potential renters will see it. Maximize search engine results by adding
relevant words to your page: “vacation home,” “vacation rentals,” “vaca-
tion getaway,” and other keywords that search engines will find when
people look for rentals online.
 Choose and work with one or more of the online vacation home sites
mentioned earlier in this chapter. These sites aggregate listings of vaca-
tion rentals from all over the world and spend oodles of money on
advertising to get renters to check out their listings.
 Carefully hone the wording used on the site to describe the home and
its amenities, and include information about the surrounding commu-
nity. Accentuate the positive, steer clear of the negative, and create a
marketing pitch that will lure in potential renters.
 Post only those photos that show the home in its best possible light.
Include photos of the living room, master bedroom, and any other rooms
that look great in pictures. (Avoid photos of bathrooms, for example, no
matter how pretty you think yours is.)
 If your home is in a picturesque setting, include one or more photos
of the view from a deck, lanai, or front porch. This will give renters an
idea of what they’ll see when they get there.
 Update the home’s Web site, listing, or other posting regularly to
reflect upgrades, remodels, or new amenities or community offerings
that would help lure in a renter. Seeing the words “recently upgraded
kitchen and bathrooms” is music to a renter’s ears. If you’ve invested in
the home recently, be sure to mention it.
 State your rates. One of the first things someone browsing your site will
want to know is “What’s the rent?” (Remember the Seinfeld episode
where that was the first question asked when anyone mentioned an
available NYC apartment?) People will have in mind a price they’re will-
ing to pay, and by stating yours upfront, you’ll weed out renters who are
looking for a dirt-cheap deal and for whom even your reasonable price
(it is reasonable, right?) is too much.
Protecting your investment
One of the best ways to keep tabs on your property and the people who are
using it is by conducting regular, physical inspections of the property. This
can be handled by a real estate agent or property management company, but
you should also do some hands-on looking around (maybe “eyes-on” looking
around is a better way to describe it?), because often you will pick up on
problems much faster than someone who isn’t as familiar with the property.
213
Chapter 11: Renting Out Your Second Home to Pay for Itself

When an inspection turns up a problem, be sure to address it right away. It
could be as simple as throwing out a $15 toaster with a plug that “gets too
hot” or as serious as replacing a roof on a single-family home. Even though
it’s not your primary home, you’ll want to keep your second home in good
working order to protect the investment, reap the rewards of property
appreciation, and create happy tenants.
Creating a home that’s fit for the pages of Better Homes & Gardens is nice,
but it’s not a very practical way to decorate and furnish a second home that
you’re planning on renting out for a significant portion of the year. If your
second home will be rented out regularly, stick to the basics and avoid scat-
tering a lot of breakable, valuable items throughout the place.
Doing Business with Renters
If you market your home effectively, you may have dozens of people who
want to spend a few days or a few weeks in your home (not all at the same
time, I hope!). But you don’t want to hand over the keys to your second home
to just anyone. And you want to treat your renters right, because you want
them back, same time, same place, next year. (And maybe for a bump in the
rent?) So when it comes time to actually work with your tenants, you need to
know who’s living in your home, make the agreement official, and follow up
with them after their stay.
Screening renters
As an individual renting out your own property, you need to be careful that
you don’t give the wrong people access to your home and belongings. You can
safeguard yourself by screening your potential renters. You want to know a
little bit about them, their rental background, and their credit rating and abil-
ity to pay for the rental period. You’ll also want to ask for a security deposit
upfront (about $200 to $300) to cover any damage they may inflict on your
place or any additional cleaning that may be necessary after they vacate.
I’ve rented dozens of condos and townhouses directly from individual
owners, and I’ve never been “screened” for anything. In the back of my mind,
as I’ve spent time in the properties, amid the owners’ possessions and fur-
nishings, I’ve always thought to myself: “I can’t believe no one asked any
questions, or requested referrals from past condo owners I rented from.”
214
Part III: Making Your Second Home a Smart Investment 

So the moral of the story is this: By taking some time to screen potential
renters, you’ll be ahead of the game when it comes to intercepting people
who may be problematic renters. However, you may also chase some tenants
away, because, from my experience, it seems like very few owners are doing
it themselves (although their real estate agents and property managers very
well may be).
Finding out whom you’re dealing with
You can screen potential renters without offending them by asking for some
basic information during your first conversation or e-mail exchange with the
renter. Here are a few good basic pieces of info to ask for:
 The prospective renter’s name, and the names of all others who will be
staying in your home
 The ages of any children who will be living at or visiting the place
 Home address (getting a business address isn’t a bad idea, either)
 Home phone number
 Cellphone number
 E-mail address
During the exchange, you can also talk about other condos or homes that the
person has rented, their experiences with those homes, why they’re visiting
the area, and their likes and dislikes. This casual, friendly type of conversa-
tion can help you informally screen renters without them even realizing it! To
protect yourself further,
 Keep an eye out for red flags such as fake names, addresses, and
phone numbers. Do a cross-check on a site like Switchboard.com
(www.switchboard.com) — it offers reverse phone lookups — to find
out if a phone number matches up with a name.
 Do a background check on potential renters to make sure they’re
legitimate. This involves contacting the person’s local police or sheriff’s
department to see whether the applicant has been involved in any run-
ins with the authorities.
 Google applicants. See if they show up in any articles that raise eyebrows.
 Do a quick online search of their state’s public records, including civil
cases. If you discover your potential tenant is being sued by a credit
card company for lack of payment, or is involved in a lawsuit for hitting
a pedestrian, you may want to think twice about that person.
215
Chapter 11: Renting Out Your Second Home to Pay for Itself

Putting the agreement in writing
When you’ve found a renter you think you can trust with the keys to your
second home, and their security deposit check didn’t bounce (see the next
section), you now need to make the agreement official by sending a confirma-
tion letter. This letter should include
 The dates that the home will be rented
 The cost of the rental, including security deposits and other fees
 Check-in and check-out times
 Locations of keys (for getting into the place)
 Parking information
You’re not a visitors’ bureau, but when you send out the confirmation letter
to your renters, it would be nice to include a few brochures for area attrac-
tions, dining and shopping suggestions, and a map of the area. (These materi-
als are available from local visitors’ centers and chamber of commerce
offices.) This small gesture can make your renters feel like you really care
about their stay and can lead to repeat business and referrals.
Taking security deposits
and collecting the rent
Some owners take security deposits, others don’t. A security deposit basi-
cally ensures that you’re going to get your home back as it was when you
rented it (within reason). If you don’t, you can use the money to make any
necessary repairs or take care of any cleaning that goes beyond the basics.
You decide on the security deposit amount you’d like to collect. This can range
from $200 to $300, depending on the size of the home and length of the stay.
Any higher and you’ll almost certainly price yourself out of the market. Any
less and you won’t be able to cover minor damage inflicted by your renters.
You should collect the security deposit after you and the renter have made a
verbal agreement that she can use your second home for a specific time and
price. After you have deposited the security deposit, you should send the
renter a confirmation letter (see the preceding section).
Getting what you’re due: The rent
As a general rule, I recommend that you collect all the rent for a short-term
rental in advance. If you’re renting your beach cottage to a family for two
weeks, the total rental amount should be in your hands before you hand over
the keys. If you know the people and want to allow them to pay the second
week’s rent at the beginning of the second week, that’s fine. It’s your call. But
as a general rule, get the money upfront.
216
Part III: Making Your Second Home a Smart Investment 

If you’re renting out the unit on a multiple-month basis, you can ask for one
month’s rent, plus a security deposit, upfront. The monthly rent would then
be due on the first of every month, and you can also give the renter a five- or
ten-day grace period to get the check to you.
Returning the security deposit
You should return the security deposit promptly after the tenants have left and
you’ve inspected for damage. In the past, I’ve waited months for a paltry $200
deposit to be returned, which did not endear that particular landlord to me.
You need to realize that “normal wear and tear” is typical in any home, and
that a place being used by multiple individuals and families during the course
of a year is bound to show its age faster than an owner-occupied unit. Before
you snag $100 or more from the security deposit and risk alienating a poten-
tial repeat client, though, be reasonable and ask yourself if the dings on the
kitchen splashguard or the inoperable microwave were really her fault, or if
they can realistically be attributed to normal wear and tear. This is especially
important when it comes to appliances. When appliances break, they break. If
it had been you, rather than your renter, who turned on the 10-year-old dish-
washer when it broke, you would have chalked it up to “it’s time to buy a new
dishwasher.” If, instead, the renter is unlucky enough to be the one to turn it
on that one last time, she shouldn’t be held responsible for replacing it.
Following up with renters
After your renters’ stays are complete, take a few moments and follow up
with them. You can send a quick e-mail or make a short phone call to see how
the stay went. Doing so is a great way to do an informal inspection. By talking
to the renters, you can find out about problems with the property without
even being there.
So whether it’s ants in the kitchen, a toilet that takes an hour to flush in the
guest bathroom, a few “streaks” of water coming down the wall in the foyer,
or “hot” water that ain’t all that hot, you can probably find out a lot from the
folks who recently lived with these issues for a week or more.
Being Aware of the Downtimes
Your vacation home can be a cash cow, but only part of the time because
some factors are simply out of your control. For example, geopolitical issues,
a faltering economy, high fuel costs, and catastrophic storms can all louse up
people’s vacation plans.
217
Chapter 11: Renting Out Your Second Home to Pay for Itself

And even though these issues may not have affected you directly in the past,
they will most certainly impact your bottom line as a second-home owner
looking to rent out a unit to vacationers who are spending their discretionary
income.
If you’re renting your property out as a residence full time, you aren’t exempt
from market fluctuations. Even the best places on the Atlantic Ocean in
Florida can be affected by events such as hurricanes, a bad economy, or
insane gas prices, so adopt a practical approach to most efficiently manage
the financial aspect of second-home ownership.
Realistically, no property that is also used occasionally as a residence can be
rented out 100 percent of the time. Don’t go into renting your second home
thinking that you can rent it every day of the year. If that’s what you want,
then you should buy a rental investment property that you’ll never stay in.
One of the best ways to estimate just how often you’ll be able to rent out
your place is to talk to other owners in the surrounding area. Ask them these
questions:
 How many weeks out of the year is your place rented out to third parties?
 How long do your renters usually stay?
 What’s the going rate around here? (They may not tell you the truth, but
it’s worth a shot!)
 Have you ever experienced a dip in demand for your place, and if so,
when and why?
 Was your home ever empty when you didn’t want it to be? Why?
 Where do you advertise/promote your rental?
If you can’t find an owner to talk to, a local property manager or real estate
agent should be able to help, although the latter tend to paint fairly rosy pic-
tures (for obvious reasons!) of their markets even when things are less than
great. Use whatever facts you can come up with through your own research
to prepare for the inevitable lean times.

W
ho doesn’t want to buy an existing, state-of-the-art home that’s com-
pletely upgraded, fully functional, and, well, just plain perfect? Nobody,
that’s who. That’s right: No one wants anything less than the perfect house —
but as the song goes, “You can’t always get what you want.” Unless you’re
buying a newly constructed home built exactly the way you want it, you
almost certainly will want or need to upgrade areas of your second home —
some more than others.
In this chapter, I help you decide which areas of your second home need the
most attention and which improvements can produce the best possible
returns on your investment. Whether you’re looking to add a bathroom,
remove wallpaper and throw on a coat of paint, or get rid of those antiquated
thermostats and old-fashioned doorknobs, you’ve come to the right place.
Understanding the Value of Renovating
Your Second Home
Renovating your second home is one of the best ways to increase the value of
your investment, but don’t think you have to start tearing down walls. Plenty
of resources are available to help you tackle a multitude of projects, from the
simple ones, such as painting a bedroom, to more complex ones, such as ren-
ovating a kitchen and adding a bedroom.

Even a small project or two can increase your home’s value. In the last few
years, American homeowners have seen significant increases in their homes’
equity. High housing appreciation has spurred many homeowners to do
extensive and elaborate renovations to their homes. This growth in equity,
combined with the fact that some of the nation’s homes are getting older,
drives the upward trend in dollars spent on home remodeling.
The payoff from investing in remodeling projects is significant. According to
Remodeling magazine’s most recent survey comparing construction costs
with resale values over the past four years, homeowners have gained the
best returns on bathroom and kitchen remodelings.
However, before you jump into a project, keep this point in mind: Don’t spend a
lot of money on a project that won’t yield a significant return if you want to get
back what you put into it. The return on remodeling projects varies based on
the area of the country and the state in which your second home is located. If
recouping your outlay is important, be sure to talk to local real estate agents,
property managers, and homeowners about specific projects — and their
payoffs — before sinking any money into your second home.
Keep in mind that there’s more than monetary value to remodeling a home.
Ripping out that awful green-and-orange wallpaper or replacing those avo-
cado-colored appliances can result in a great deal of satisfaction for second-
home owners worried less about recouping their costs and more about
creating a great place to live. (Unless, of course, you like avocado-colored
appliances. Then you can leave things as is and you’ll be a happy camper!)
In this section, I discuss the value of renovating specific areas of your second
home, from the bathroom to the roof, and everything in between. This sec-
tion explains which projects are worth undertaking and which aren’t.
Adding and remodeling bathrooms
If your second home is cursed with outdated bathrooms, toilets that don’t
run right, drippy faucets, peeling floors, cracked tiles, and antique shower-
heads, then the bathroom is probably where you should begin your remodel-
ing. A bathroom renovation is the selective replacement of specific elements
of a bathroom: sink, fixtures, lighting, toilet, and so forth. A bathroom addi-
tion is the construction of a brand-new bathroom in a spot where there
wasn’t one.
According to remodeling and real estate experts, owners recoup 102 percent
of their investment for a typical bathroom renovation (new tub, toilet, tile, fix-
tures, vanity, medicine chest, flooring, and wall covering). That’s all the
money you put into the project plus some more. That means that on a $10,500
bathroom remodeling project (which would be a pretty big job), you’ll get
back $10,710 when (and if) you sell your place.
220
Part III: Making Your Second Home a Smart Investment 

So if you’re considering adding or remodeling a bathroom, keep the following
do’s and don’ts in mind.
Do:
 Take a good look at every component of the bathroom in question
and decide what needs to be changed (or eliminated). Focus on floor-
ing, lighting, cabinetry/vanity, fixtures, and accessories.
 Decide on a budget ahead of time and get prices for the things you
want done. Always factor in both materials and labor so you won’t have
any surprises.
 Determine what jobs you and your loved ones can do and what jobs
you need professional help with. Make a list of the tasks you and your
loved ones feel comfortable tackling, such as installing stick-on floor
tiling, mounting a new medicine cabinet, and painting. You also can
make a list of the tasks that you’ll need a pro for, such as plumbing, elec-
trical, and major carpentry work.
 Keep in mind the amazing difference the simplest of things can make.
New luxurious towels, for example, are very impressive and relatively
inexpensive. A lovely wall hanging and a wrought iron shelving unit can
also add a lot of eye appeal for not too much moolah.
Don’t:
 Rip stuff out and order supplies without keeping track of your spend-
ing. Doing so is an easy way to overextend your budget. Plan what you
want to do and keep track of every expense.
 Decide to replace big, expensive fixtures like the tub/shower, toilet,
or sink because you’re excited about the remodeling project. Be con-
servative. If the tub is a mess, though, and it needs to be replaced, then,
of course, go for it. If the toilet’s ancient and temperamental, then that
can go, too. But don’t replace things just for the sake of getting some-
thing new when it’s unnecessary.
 Be reckless to save money. If you’re not experienced with electrical
wiring, hire an electrician to put in that beautiful new lighting fixture.
Likewise with plumbing. If you’ve never even changed a washer on a
faucet, don’t start taking apart the bathroom sink and assume you’ll
figure it out as you go along.
If you’re considering adding a bathroom and you have the space, make sure
the plumbing work won’t be prohibitive (for example, you have to cut a sup-
port wall — not the best decision). If you purchase a home that has, say, one
or one-and-a-half bathrooms, and adding a bathroom in the master bedroom
or even in the basement is feasible, do so. It’s a great way to add not only
comfort and convenience, but also value. For extensive info on how to
remodel bathrooms, check out Bathroom Remodeling For Dummies by Gene
and Katie Hamilton (Wiley).

Chapter 12: Investing in Your Investment: Renovations That Pay Off

Remodeling kitchens
A kitchen remodel can range from a simple $5,000 cabinet refacing job in a
mid-size kitchen, all the way up to a $30,000, the-sky’s-the-limit complete
replacement of cabinets, sinks, fixtures, countertops, appliances, and floor-
ing. If you’re considering a remodeling job, it will probably fall somewhere in
the middle of the range, and will almost certainly translate into a good return
on your investment because the kitchen is often the room that “sells” the
house. Show a prospective buyer a great kitchen, and help her visualize a
houseful of friends gathered around the breakfast bar, and you’ve won half
the battle. (You can discover more about kitchen remodeling in the book
Kitchen Remodeling For Dummies by Donald R. Prestly [Wiley].)
Know that a little goes a long way when remodeling this all-important room.
Keep the following do’s and don’ts in mind.
Do:
 Take steps to increase the functionality (a larger sink), durability
(countertops that don’t scratch), and eye appeal of the kitchen. These
moves will pay off big time for you.
 Opt for less-expensive improvements, such as cabinet refacing. A
process like this uses existing cabinetry foundation and costs 40 to 50
percent less than the cost of new cabinets.
 Add in a new, reasonably priced kitchen set and a pretty new paint
job or some attractive wallpaper. The change will be breathtaking.
Don’t:
 Assume that you have to completely gut the kitchen to add value.
Even the most outdated kitchen may not need an entire overhaul.
 Forget to update the hardware (drawer knobs and handles) in the
kitchen. Doing so can give the room a fresh look without draining the
budget.
Assuming the typical remodeling job costs about $15,000, Remodeling maga-
zine reports that most homeowners recoup 98.5 percent of their total remod-
eling investment (or $14,775). That’s an excellent return, considering that
many improvements don’t come close to recovering their costs. The actual
numbers vary by geographic location, but it’s clear that such projects defi-
nitely pay off when it comes time to assess the value of and/or sell your
second home.
222
Part III: Making Your Second Home a Smart Investment 

Renovating master suites
Master suite is a term used to describe the master bedroom, a private bath-
room, and additional amenities, such as a walk-in closet, sitting room, a
window seat, and other conveniences and luxuries within the same space.
The master suite is often a home’s showpiece. It’s the space that commonly
elicits the most oohs and aahs (also known as sales appeal), and if yours isn’t
up to snuff, you may want to think about an overhaul soon.
Unlike some other renovations that result in you recouping more money than
your original investment when you sell (like bathrooms; see the “Adding and
remodeling bathrooms” section), master suite remodels usually don’t bring a
100 percent return. They do, however, add significant sales appeal to the
property and, depending on the market at the time you sell, can warrant a
higher price when selling.
When renovating your master suite, keep these do’s and don’ts in mind.
Do:
 Change the lighting and the wall coverings or paint. These moves are
relatively inexpensive and can make a dramatic difference in a room.
 Consider small accessory touches. They include items such as artificial
plants, mirrors, throw rugs, objets d’art, and other touches that can
freshen up a room without having to completely overhaul it. (Don’t
forget that you’ll take most of these goodies with you when you sell, but
they can nonetheless work their magic when they’re on display in your
home. You’ll enjoy their aesthetic appeal, and if you do eventually sell,
they’ll show buyers how pretty the rooms can be.)
Don’t:
 Put in hardwood floors just for aesthetic reasons. Sure, they’re nice,
but they’re costly. If the carpeting is in good shape, and it’s clean and
attractive, leave it. If the color is bad, though, replace it. (And if that’s
the case, that’s when you decide to go with costly hardwood — or not.)
 Rip out bathtubs, showers, and toilets in the master suite unless you
absolutely have to. Replumbing homes is expensive, time consuming,
and messy as all get-out.
Adding storage space
Newer homes, built in the last 20 years or so, usually have ample closet and
storage space. However, older homes seem to have been built for people
who had seven outfits, a coat, two towels, and a mop and bucket. Consumer
223
Chapter 12: Investing in Your Investment: Renovations That Pay Off

goods — including clothes, appliances, books, DVDs, and more — now
fill homes, and storage space is always a problem in closet-challenged
residences.
Like other renovations, adding closet and storage space can increase the
value of a second home. So if your second home falls into the closet-strapped
category, you’ll be eager to find ways to increase the amount of available
storage space. Using a two-bedroom, two-bathroom townhouse as an exam-
ple, here’s what you should shoot for:
 Ample closet space in both bedrooms (walk-ins are nice!)
 Linen closets in or near one or both bathrooms (with lots of shelves for
towels and stuff)
 A utility closet (if the home has a garage, a corner can double as a utility
space)
 A pantry or other space for kitchen overflow (y’know . . . like those cafe-
teria-size cans of tuna and olives you bought at the warehouse store
because you couldn’t resist the price!)
Is your second home wanting for any of these areas? If so, consider what
extra space exists in your home that can be converted into storage space. If,
for example, the master bathroom includes a 2-foot-x-2-foot space that’s just
sitting there unused, consider making it into a linen closet.
The easiest way? Purchase a prebuilt linen closet from a home furnishings
store like HomeGoods or Home Depot (which offers lavatory valets, which 
are furniture-like bathroom linen closets), or online at a site like www.
homedecorators.com. Prices range from very inexpensive for cabinets
needing assembly and painting or staining, to elaborate units with glass
doors, drawers, and lots of shelves. Linen closets start around $100 and
come in all shapes and sizes.
And if that one-car garage houses only a small sports car, you can take advan-
tage of the excess space by building a utility closet and even a small pantry
for your canned and packaged goods out there. You can also line an entire
wall with inexpensive metal shelves that can store huge amounts of stuff. Get
creative and make the best use of your unused spaces. You’ll be pleasantly
surprised at what you come up with.
If you prefer to go beyond do-it-yourself efforts and make major structural
changes to your home to add more closet or pantry space, talk to a couple of
residential remodeling contractors about the projects. Figure out how much
you’re willing to spend, and you should be able to find someone who can
help design and build add-ons to make a more storage-friendly second home.
224
Part III: Making Your Second Home a Smart Investment 

If you want to take advantage of the storage space you already have, check
out some of the closet organizer kits available for $20 to $100 at national dis-
count stores. And if your budget allows for a $500 to $1,000 investment, hire a
professional organizer to install the hardware and organize your stuff.
Replacing the roof
“And the roof is brand new!” is a proud proclamation you’ll often hear coming
from the mouths of eager home sellers and their real estate agents. And you
can easily understand why this fact is front and center in their sales presenta-
tion, because replacing a home’s roof is expensive. It can run $15,000 to
$35,000 and more, depending on the size of the home and style of the roof
and its coverings.
However, putting a definitive return on investment on a roof replacement or
major repair isn’t easy because the item is a functional, critical part of the
house. The roof is also the Achilles’ heel of any home: When it goes bad, it
can result in leaks, interior damage, mold, and myriad other problems. In
other words, if it’s seriously broke, fix it. Your decision to replace or not to
replace what looks to be a still-viable roof depends on one thing: how many
times a year you have to call the roofer to come and fix leaks. (And keep in
mind that some leaks may be hidden from view.) When those repair visits
become necessary more than a couple of times a year, replace the roof.
Before you start soliciting estimates for your second home’s roof, ask an expert
to tell you how many years are left on it. Most roofs these days use 15-, 30-, or
50-year shingles or coverings (such as tile), and if the one on your second
home was replaced five years ago, then it’s certainly not time to replace the
whole thing. If the roof is leaking, a roof repair can often remedy the problem.
Improving the outside
When you pull up to a home, what’s the first thing you notice? Do you notice
its dingy color and flaking paint on the house’s exterior and overgrown
bushes and wild weeds overrunning the flowerbeds? Curb appeal — that ini-
tial (hopefully positive) reaction from people when they first see your house
and grounds — adds a ton of value to a home. It’s one of the most important
elements of showing your home. Like the old adage goes, “You only get one
chance to make a first impression.”
225
Chapter 12: Investing in Your Investment: Renovations That Pay Off

Because of this critical first-impression factor, many homeowners work hard
to keep their homes looking sharp and clean on the outside as well as the
inside — all the time, not just when looking to sell. Think about how you feel
when you drive up to a run-down property versus an attractive, clean one. To
assure a smile rather than a frown when people see your place, take a walk
around the perimeter of your home and look at it through a stranger’s eyes.
Lots of stuff you overlook every day when you live in a place is immediately
noticeable by someone who is seeing the home and grounds for the first time.
Don’t forget that exterior improvements can increase a home’s value. By just
how much depends on exactly what you’ve done to the home and how much
the home is worth overall. But these types of improvements and enhance-
ments are about as close to a sure thing as you’ll find when trying to increase
your home’s value.
When looking at your home’s exterior and grounds, ask yourself the following
questions:
 Are the lawn, hedges, flowerbeds, trees, and other natural elements
trimmed, neat, and good looking? If anything is rotted or overgrown,
that’s your starting place for making the outside look great.
 Is the home painted a pleasing color, and is the paint job in good
shape? Is mold growing on the outside walls, or do peeling paint chips
regularly dot the ground? If so, it’s time for a good painting.
 Is the roof clean? A good pressure washing can make a tile roof look
like new.
 Is the vinyl siding clean? A pressure washing can make an enormous
difference in the home’s appearance.
 Is the garage door in good condition? Replacing an old, ugly, banged-up
door with a shiny new one (particularly if it’s a two-car or larger struc-
ture) can really add to the look of a home.
 Is the entryway to the home appealing and welcoming? Adding features
such as crown molding around the front door, replacing an annoying
buzzer doorbell with a new, melodic one, and fixing any missing tiles on
the walkway leading to the front door can spruce up a home’s exterior. A
fresh coat of paint can transform the front door into a welcoming asset.
 Are the windows in good shape, or do they need to be replaced? A
complete window replacement can be costly, so if you don’t have the
budget for such a large project, try focusing only on the windows that
are visible from the street, and replace those first. Then work your way
around the home as your budget allows.
226
Part III: Making Your Second Home a Smart Investment 

You can undertake dozens of different projects to make the outside of your
second home look better. Condo owners are a bit luckier in that the home-
owners’ association is responsible for the exterior of the unit. But this means
they’re also more limited as to what they can do on their own. If you’re a
condo owner, consider using plants and attractive patio furniture on your
lanai or deck to create a pretty exterior for your individual unit.
Updating the house for the 21st century
If you purchase a second home that was built within the last ten years, chances
are good that it’s already equipped with all the trappings of modern technol-
ogy. Updating your house for the 21st century can definitely increase its appeal
to buyers who want to be able to hook up their laptops and wi-fi adaptors
quickly and easily. The more accessible your home is to today’s technological
innovations, the more attractive it will be for those who want to rent it, use it,
and/or buy it. If your home is missing any of these high-tech delights, read on
for info on how to upgrade your place.
Cable
Cable providers are always happy to come into a home without cable and
wire it. These days, many homes have TVs in every room, which means you
need to have a cable TV outlet (or satellite TV receiver) in several locations
throughout the house. Expect to pay little or nothing for this wiring service.
What you will pay is a monthly fee for service that will range from $40 to
$150, depending on what types of channels and services you order.
When you’re setting up your cable system, ask for a digital video recorder or
digital video recorder (DVR) box. (Often, a DVR service can be switched on
by using the same digital cable box without needing another piece of equip-
ment.) These setups allow you to record and replay favorite shows, as well as
pause and rewind live television. Both you and your renters will enjoy this
perk, which you can use as a selling point when renting out the place.
Be sure to have the cable installed in all rooms where you expect to place a
television, both now and in the future. Doing so saves you the trouble of
having to add outlets later. Check your phone book for the names of the pri-
mary cable providers in the area and get a couple of quotes before selecting a
provider. Check online forums and Epinions.com (www.epinion.com) for
subscribers’ opinions on your local company’s performance.
Satellite TV
If you’re unhappy with the pricing, features, or service of the cable company
in the area where your second home is located, consider subscribing to satel-
lite TV. Close to 30 million households in the United States now receive satel-
lite TV services. And as with other technological amenities, satellite TV adds
appeal to a home.
227
Chapter 12: Investing in Your Investment: Renovations That Pay Off

You purchase service from a satellite TV provider that provides the equip-
ment and hooks up your TVs. You can buy outright the equipment and gear,
or rent the equipment, similar to a cable box arrangement. The provider
attaches the satellite signal receiver to the outside of your home and hooks it
into equipment inside your house for receiving satellite TV signals. You pay a
monthly fee that varies based on the service and channels you order.
The two biggest satellite TV providers are DIRECTV and the DISH Network.
The DISH Network (www.dishnetwork.com) has the most channels.
DIRECTV (www.directtv.com) has the most sports programming. Both
offer a variety of packages; pricing ranges from under $20 to $100 a month.
High-speed Internet service
Internet access is as much a part of life these days as coffee in the morning,
cellphones, and watching your favorite TV show. And hitting the Web with
high-speed service has overtaken dial-up and is now the standard. As of
March 2006, 22 percent of U.S. Internet users were still on dial-up, as com-
pared with 42 percent who had broadband Internet access. So a high-speed
connection is a definite renting point and adds appeal to a home. After all,
the more conveniences the better.
You can purchase cable broadband service through your cable provider, you
can go for DSL from the phone company, or you can buy service directly from
your Internet service provider. Check with your cable provider and phone
company for prices on these services; compare their offerings; do a little
browsing online for comments, compliments, and complaints about each
company’s service record; and then make a decision based on your needs.
Many cable providers offer a lite Internet service (which has slightly slower
download and upload speeds than full-blown packages) for a cheaper fee
than the full-blown high-speed service. If you’re only going to use your
second home for a few weeks every year, and you don’t have to consider
renters’ needs, you may think about this less expensive option.
Digital thermostats
A digital thermostat provides a much more accurate view of exactly how hot
or cold it is in the home. This device allows you to make smart, energy-saving
decisions that can save you money. Plus, your renters will love how easy it is
to adjust and monitor the home’s temperature. (One thing to consider: You
should tell your renters the maximum temperature they’re allowed to set the
thermostat to or, better yet, if you have a programmable thermostat, show
them how to program it. You don’t want your ski chalet heated to 80 degrees
all day while your guests are out!)
228
Part III: Making Your Second Home a Smart Investment 

If the home you’re buying has a traditional round dial thermostat, you may
consider investing in a digital one that more precisely tells dwellers just how
hot or cold it is in the house, while allowing you to adjust the unit to the
exact temperature you want. Also, digital thermostats add to a home’s appeal
and perceived value. It’s a terrific selling point.
Digital thermostats have a multitude of features, including programmability,
remote control, frost protection, and even energy-use monitoring. Many allow
you to program four different temperatures for four times of the day, for each
day of the week, allowing total control of the home’s interior environment.
These are called comfort levels and use advanced technology to monitor and
adjust temperature for — depending on how many heating/cooling zones are
in your home — individual rooms or the whole house.
You can purchase a digital thermostat from a hardware store or online for
$100 or less. If you can’t install it yourself, expect to pay an HVAC profes-
sional another $100 or so to install it for you.
Deciding Whether You Want to Renovate
The case for remodeling is pretty simple: By upgrading kitchens and bath-
rooms, replacing flooring, and even adding features such as swimming pools
and decks, second-home owners enhance the value of their homes — always
a smart move. And if you’re renting it out, the additional creature comforts
and amenities can often justify a higher rent coming your way.
But do you want to renovate your own home? Seeing all the benefits in print
is one thing, but actually doing the work and/or paying for it are definitely
important factors to consider. Be sure to do the following when you’re think-
ing of remodeling your home:
 Make sure you have the money. Remodeling a home can be an expen-
sive undertaking, so be sure you have the financial resources to complete
the job before you get started. Work up an estimate and then add a cush-
ion (say, 20 percent) to protect you in case of cost overruns. (Prices go
up, or you may change your mind and decide on a more expensive tile.)
 Have an eye for design. Remember that remodeling projects should
improve the home’s comfort and livability for you, while also increasing
the property’s sales appeal for potential renters and buyers. Make sure
you plan the work before jumping into a project. (Check out the next
section for more info on planning a project.)
 Keep up with the times. Updating kitchens and baths and undertaking
other improvement projects in older homes can be particularly benefi-
cial, especially if other homes in the surrounding area are newer or their
owners have already upgraded them to more modern standards.
229
Chapter 12: Investing in Your Investment: Renovations That Pay Off

 Concentrate on the kitchen. Be sure to remodel wisely. Sellers often
want to update the entire house before placing it on the market, but cer-
tain rooms need more attention than others. In most cases, the kitchen
is the deal breaker. It’s the heart of the home. An inviting, comfortable
space is mandatory. (The “Remodeling kitchens” section earlier in this
chapter has more pointers on freshening up this area in your home.)
By thinking like an investor, you can profit from your remodeling. Detach
yourself emotionally and think of your second home as a business. Then
pretend you’re a stranger coming upon your place for the first time and doing
a walk-through. This exercise can give you a good sense of the condition of
various aspects of your home, and help you decide whether it’s necessary,
economically feasible, and advantageous in the long run to renovate.
Planning Your Renovations
A successful remodeling project starts with a well-thought-out game plan. Are
you wondering what to include in your plan or even where to start?
A renovation master plan includes three things:
 Your goals for your home: List the specific changes you want to make
during your renovation. For example, your goal list may include new
wallpaper in the dining room, an above-the-stove microwave in the
kitchen, new fixtures and a new vanity in the downstairs bathroom, and
new carpeting in the master bedroom.
 An estimated budget: You need to figure out the costs of materials and
the cost of contracted labor (for the work you can’t or don’t want to do
yourself), and you also need to build in a surplus. Shop around online,
make a few trips to local stores, and request estimates from contractors
for the jobs to get an idea of how much you need to spend.
 Short- and long-range timelines: As always, be realistic, and do the
math. If you plan on doing the wallpapering yourself, and you know from
your research that your size dining room would take a professional three
eight-hour days to complete, then add a “do-it-yourself” time factor (25
to 50 percent is a good start). For you, estimate it to be a 36-hour pro-
ject. If you know you can put in six hours each Saturday until it’s done,
voilà! In six weeks your dining room will be finished.
230
Part III: Making Your Second Home a Smart Investment 

You need to know these specifics before you start removing kitchen cabi-
netry, steaming off wallpaper, and tearing up carpet. In this section, I help
you create such a plan, and then give you some advice on how to find the
right people to carry it out as efficiently and economically as possible.
Developing a renovation master plan
Before you start any renovations, sit down and develop a plan. Doing so is
important. If you do, although some things can go wrong, overall everything
will run more smoothly and you’ll be happier with the end result. Also bear in
mind that even though defining your final goal when you’re planning a project
(new wallpaper in the dining room) is key, you also need to look at the smaller
steps to take along the way to get there (cover the furniture, buy the wallpaper,
lay down sheets, and so forth). Break down your overall vision into incremen-
tal, manageable steps, and you should be able to complete your remodeling
projects without an overabundance of stress.
Use Figure 12-1 as a guideline for creating your own renovation master plan:
After you have this initial plan written down, you need to break down your
“next three months” list into a more detailed overview, including:
 What part of the home the project will take place in: Bathroom,
kitchen, bedroom, outside.
 Exactly what needs to be done: Be specific: Replace a leaky toilet, patch
a roof leak.
 Who is going to handle the work: If you’ll do it yourself, identify those
projects; if you need a pro, do likewise.
 How much you can afford to pay for it: Be realistic. Don’t allocate $200
for the installation of a new water heater when you know it’ll be triple
that at the very least.
 What challenges or obstacles may come up during the process: If, for
example, you want to install a whirlpool tub in your master bathroom,
and you know space is tight, it could pose a challenge.
If you decide to use a contractor, get at least three estimates for the project.
Look not only at the bottom-line cost, but also at the array of services that
the contractor offers and his reputation for doing good work, on time, and
with no surprises. Don’t forget to ask for and check a contractor’s references,
and if possible, visit one of the homes where work was done to see the con-
231

tractor’s efforts in person. Ask past customers about workmanship quality,
timeliness, neatness, and follow-up service. Botched remodeling jobs are
fairly commonplace. Be sure to check references before working with a con-
tractor with whom you don’t have a prior relationship. See the “Deciding to
use a professional” section later in this chapter for more hints.

Part III: Making Your Second Home a Smart Investment 

Figuring out how long you intend
to own the property
Do you know how long you plan on owning your second home? You need to at
least think about it, because your answer can have an impact on how much
money, time, and effort you put into remodeling and upgrading the place.
Everyone’s case is different, but here are a few scenarios that can help you
gauge your own need to remodel your second home:
 You’re investment minded, and you plan to own your second home
for a short while, improve it, and then resell it at a profit. If so, you’ll
want to make improvements that truly increase your home’s value, such
as kitchen remodels and flooring replacements.
 You’re vacation minded, and you plan to own your second home for
five to ten years, use it only once a year during that time, and then
sell it. If your home is just a getaway for your annual vacation, and you
plan to rent it out for the rest of the year, then you’ll want to make some
minimal changes, but not break the bank trying to make the place look
like Hearst Castle. Take whatever steps are necessary to make it com-
fortable for you and your guests, but stay away from the big projects.
 You’re retirement minded, and you plan to own your second home for
five years and then move into it full time when you retire. Outfit and
upgrade the home in ways that are both pleasing and functional for you
and anyone else who will be living with you when you retire. The bottom
line: You come first in this scenario, because your second home will
eventually be your retirement home.
Every situation is different. Use your best judgment when determining just
how much money to pour into renovations. Also, be sure to talk to your real
estate agent and/or other professionals about how much of your renovation
investment you’ll recoup. You need to know how much value certain
upgrades will potentially add to your home.
Doing the work yourself
If you enjoy watching a designer tear down walls, put up wallpaper, and
replace fixtures on television, and you automatically grab a shopping cart to
load up with materials when you visit your local home improvement store,
you just may be the perfect do-it-yourself homeowner — even if you’re not
totally confident about tackling certain projects.
233
Chapter 12: Investing in Your Investment: Renovations That Pay Off

Are you seriously considering doing some of the renovations yourself? When
I say do it yourself, I don’t literally mean that you’ll be doing all the work
totally by yourself (unless, of course, you want to). If you ask nicely, you can
probably score some help from friends, family members, and neighbors who
can assist with the projects and help you see them through to completion. If
you plan to go the DIY route, keep some of the following points in mind
before you turn your home into a construction zone.
Finding dependable help
Start by checking in with any friends or family whom you know are handy or —
if you’re lucky — even a pro skilled in certain areas of construction or remodel-
ing. (My father is a general contractor, so guess who gets the first phone call
when it’s time to undertake a remodeling project?)
To persuade people to help, you may have to offer them an incentive. You
may, for instance, offer to help them with their own projects in the future,
such as moving or remodeling. You can also stock your second home with
food and beverages for them to enjoy while working. Or pay for pizza or
Chinese food for everyone. Whatever it takes to get the job done.
234
Part III: Making Your Second Home a Smart Investment 
Check out your surroundings
Too often, second-home owners, eager to
update their abodes, ignore the basic rules of
financing and contractor selection and, as a
result, end up disappointed. Some neglect to
look for the best equity loan package. And
sometimes others simply throw restraint to the
wind and go over the top with their changes,
often ending up with extreme “improvements”
that turn buyers off. Like an $88,000 bowling
lane, or a $20,000 indoor pool, or a regulation-
size basketball court on the grounds (all of
which are real additions made to homes). Some
of these improvements will never recoup their
investment, but some second-home owners do
them anyway.
To avoid these mistakes, first, be sure to shop
carefully for your loan if you’re using home
equity to pay for the renovations. Also, check
out the homes in your neighborhood and take
note of how many have been upgraded in the
past few years. If, for example, your home is the
only one without an in-ground swimming pool,
then that may be a good project to consider.
The reality is that if many of your neighbors have
upgraded their kitchens and bathrooms, then
such projects will likely pay off well for you.
However, if every house on the block has a two-
car garage, then adding a third or fourth bay to
your own garage may not be the best move if
recouping your investment is a priority.

Don’t bite off more than you can chew
Ever been to someone’s house and are stunned by how many projects they
have going on at once? The first thought that goes through your mind is, “How
can they live like this?”, right? When I have come upon these manic hives of
activity, I’ve often wondered how the owners prevented themselves from get-
ting completely overwhelmed by all the sawdust, paint, and plywood — not to
mention how they didn’t go completely nuts.
To avoid falling into this trap, carefully pore over the plan you drafted earlier in
the “Developing a renovation master plan” section. (You did develop a plan ear-
lier in this chapter, didn’t you? If not, now is the time to do it!) You should
decide on a practical, workable schedule that allows you to reach your goals —
but without having to tear up your entire home at one time.
This approach also helps you stay within your budget. If you have three pro-
jects going at once, and if one or more suddenly require more money or time
than you originally estimated, you can quickly find yourself grappling with
unexpected financial concerns.
Deciding to use a professional
The typical homeowner just can’t do some projects on his own. Replumbing
bathrooms and installing new heating and air conditioning units, for example,
are jobs that should definitely be turned over to the pros. And unless you or
someone in your family or circle of friends is an electrician, you should leave
any major rewiring or electrical-related projects for someone who is a
licensed electrician. No joke: It’s one thing to try to replace a toilet, make an
ungodly mess, and then need to call in a plumber. It’s quite another to risk
electrocution or serious injury because you don’t want to pay an electrician.
Finding a professional
Are you planning on major projects and need a professional to help? If so, use
the following resources to find a good contractor or service professional:
 Ask friends and neighbors for referrals. The best place to start is with
friends and neighbors who’ve hired and used specific pros. They can
give you the lowdown on the person’s performance and professionalism.
Professionals in all fields rely on this type of word-of-mouth business
and commonly try to cultivate it by leaving stacks of business cards
behind when they leave a job site.
235
Chapter 12: Investing in Your Investment: Renovations That Pay Off

 Call your real estate agent. Do so if you can’t get a good referral from a
neighbor or friend. Most agents have a long list of reputable service
providers in all fields and are happy to provide the names of one or two
good ones whom you can call.
 Go online. Go to a search engine and type in a few keywords (and your
town or county and state) to find professionals working in your area.
Also, a search for a specific contractor after you’re considering someone
may turn up some valuable info.
 Read your local newspaper’s classified ads. Contractors and profes-
sionals continue to advertise in their local newspapers, which remain a
good source of potential candidates.
 Try the Better Business Bureau or consumer organizations. Folks at
these groups (which include firms like Angie’s List) can usually point
you in the direction of a few good choices.
 Open the phone book. The Yellow Pages is a good place to look for
pros, although a fancy display ad doesn’t necessarily translate into a
reputable professional. (In fact, the understated, two-line listing in the
middle of the page may very well belong to the best contractor.)
Asking for references
If you’ve chosen a professional from anywhere other than a personal referral
(the phone book, online listings, newspaper ads), use her references and
check licenses before signing a contract for services.
When you call or visit the person providing the reference, ask the following
questions:
 What are your overall thoughts on the contractor’s workmanship?
 How well did the contractor meet the timeline?
 Why did you pick this contractor?
 How well has the project stood the test of time since its completion?
 Was the contractor available and receptive to follow-up customer ser-
vice calls?
 Would you recommend this contractor to your mother, should she ever
need remodeling work done?
Before you sign on the dotted line or hand over any deposits for work to be
performed, do your homework. Even if you have to wend your way through a
dozen different contractors before you find the right one to work with, do it.
236
Part III: Making Your Second Home a Smart Investment 

The payoff will be well worth your effort when your project is completed pro-
fessionally, on time, and within budget. In most states, contractors must be
licensed to perform a specific type of work (such as drywall, HVAC, or electri-
cal). Ask your contractor for his license number and check with your state
board of licensing to make sure that the license is current and that no com-
plaints or charges have been filed against this particular business.
Paying for the improvements
No matter if you do the work yourself or you hire a professional, you need to
make sure you can afford the work. If you’re doing the work yourself, then
you only need to budget for the materials and supplies you’ll need to get the
job done. (The labor is gratis, thanks to you!)
If you’re hiring someone to do the work, then their final quote will include the
materials. (In some cases, you may be able to shop for and buy the tile, wall-
paper, wood, and so forth, but most contractors will handle that for you. If
you provide materials, then you only pay for the labor.)
Make sure that you budget carefully. You don’t want to put yourself in a hole
with your remodeling projects by not knowing what you’ll be spending and
where the money is coming from.
To come up with a budget, you need to know exactly how much extra money
you can reasonably allocate to the project, be it from your monthly savings,
income surplus, or perhaps a home equity line of credit (borrowed against the
equity in your second home). If, for example, your home is worth $300,000
and your mortgage is for $250,000, then you can reasonably expect to borrow
up to $50,000 to cover the improvements (but understand, of course, that
you will also incur a new, monthly bill to pay off that loan).
To budget for a project, you’ll need to divvy up the cash by the room or the
job. For example, if the living room only needs painting, you can allocate
whatever that job will cost and then move on to the bathroom, kitchen, and
so on.
Keep these steps in mind when budgeting:
1. Identify the job.
Do you want to reface the cabinets? Add a new vanity?
2. Get a few estimates as to what each will cost.
Go to a store like Lowe’s and ask a professional.
237
Chapter 12: Investing in Your Investment: Renovations That Pay Off

3. On a piece of paper, make two columns, one for estimated cost and
one for actual cost.
You can also create a Microsoft Excel document.
4. As you tackle each remodeling job, deduct the costs of each job from
your total budgeted amount for the entire upgrade.
If one job ended up costing more, you have the flexibility to juggle the
other numbers to balance everything. For example, if the new fixtures
for the bathroom vanity were 25 percent higher than you planned on,
you may decide that a cheaper grade of tile for the foyer will do just fine.
The idea is to remodel or upgrade your second home in a way that makes it
pleasing and comfortable for you (and any guests or renters), while at the
same time adding to its value so that if and when it comes time to sell, you’ll
recoup your investment. Keep this in mind as you set and follow your budget.
How long will the renovations take?
As someone who was once promised that a quickie kitchen job was going to
take five days to complete, and the job ended up taking a month (yes, a
month), I’m here to tell you that everything takes longer than estimated when
it comes to home remodeling and renovations.
A good general rule: Add a minimum of an extra 50 percent onto the original
timetable developed by you and/or your contractor. For example, you may
estimate that it will take two weeks to complete a bathroom remodeling pro-
ject that replaces the flooring and installs a new tub, vanity, sink, and mirror.
However, if you add a minimum of an extra 50 percent, then the more realistic
completion time for this project is three weeks. By factoring an extra time
cushion into your renovation schedule, you avoid any last-minute confusion
and stress caused by unrealistic timelines.

B
ecause you already own a home, you’re aware of all the time and money
you spend maintaining it. Owning two homes doubles the amount of
responsibility, and so protecting your investments is extremely important.
For example, who’ll mow the lawn and keep the grounds maintained when
you’re not around? And who’ll deal with more pressing issues, such as when
the toilet starts leaking or there’s a sudden, small fire in the kitchen?
Some of these maintenance and upkeep questions are particularly important
if you live several hours away from your second home. If you get a phone call
in the middle of the night from your renter, you can’t exactly hang up and
drop by to handle the problem.
No matter how you maintain your home, whether by hiring a property man-
ager to help with maintenance, upkeep, and emergency issues, or by doing it
yourself, this chapter provides the helpful info you need. After reading it, you
can have a good handle on exactly what it takes to maintain your second
home and keep it in tiptop shape, year-round.
Deciding Whether to Maintain the
Property Yourself: Yes or No?
Many second-home owners handle the maintenance, upkeep, emergencies,
and other responsibilities of their second home. Whether you can success-

fully manage your own property depends on several factors. Ask yourself
these questions to see if maintaining your second home is right for you:
 How close is your primary home to your second home? If it’s less than
a couple of hours away by car, you can probably visit every two weeks
or so. Of course, this also depends on your schedule and other obliga-
tions. If you live far away from your second home and you want to main-
tain the property, check out “Managing Your Second Home from Afar”
later in this chapter for specific info.
 How handy are you? If you and/or your significant other can patch dry-
wall, repair pool filters, edge lawns, and change a faucet washer, then
you can probably handle the upkeep of your place on your own. If, how-
ever, you have a lawn maintenance company, a pool guy, and a house-
cleaner at your primary home, and you have your plumber on speed
dial, don’t expect to do everything on your own at your second home.
 How much can you afford to farm out? If your budget allows you to
hire a housecleaner (if you’re renting out the home) and a lawn mainte-
nance firm on your own, then you can probably get away with taking
care of your second home without the help of a property manager.
 What kind of home is it? If your second home is a condominium that
you can button up and leave without worrying too much about it, then
forgo the property manager and do what needs to done on your own.
But if you have a six-bedroom, five-bathroom single-family home with a
pool and spa, then it may take a bit more elbow grease to keep your
home in tiptop shape while you’re not using it.
If you discover that maintaining your second home is just a tad too stressful,
you may want to turn to a professional. If you want to hire a property manager
to maintain your property, check out the next section for more specific info.
Relying on a Property Manager
to Maintain Your Property
For most people, handling the maintenance on a primary home is more than
enough work, thank you very much. At any given time, you have a lawn to
trim, a fence to paint or repair, some major electrical or plumbing contrap-
tion to keep in good working order, one or more kitchen cabinets to clean
(and sometimes adjust so the door doesn’t come off in your hand when you
open it), and a multitude of carpets to vacuum and clean. Add in a second
home, and most people simply don’t have the time, motivation, or financial
resources to make themselves a full-time property manager or maid. And
even if you did have the time, desire, or money to do it, wouldn’t you rather
invest it somewhere else?
240
Part III: Making Your Second Home a Smart Investment 

Taking good care of your second home when you can’t (or don’t want to) is
where a professional property manager can help. Even though hiring a prop-
erty manager is an additional expense of owning a second home, it can be
well worth the cost. A dependable property manager can save you money in
the long run. For example, when she notifies you that several shingles blew
off your roof during a storm, you can take care of the roof before the next
storm. But the cost of a property manager is exactly why some second-home
owners choose not to hire a pro.
In this section, I offer advice on hiring a property manager to oversee your
second home’s upkeep and show you how these whizzes can help you keep
your second home shipshape. (Property managers can also help you market
and rent out your place. See Chapter 11 for details.)
Asking the right questions
You want a property manager who can — and will — go the extra mile to
truly maintain your second home and not just trim the grass once a week and
hope the place stays intact until you come back. You want a property man-
ager who is proactive and will make sure that more than the mere basics are
done. What you want is a property manager with enterprise.
If you didn’t hire a property manager to rent out your second home, check
out Chapter 11 to help you locate good referrals. After you find a person or
firm you believe may be able to handle what you need done, ask the following
questions:
 How much experience do you have managing second-home proper-
ties? You want to work with someone who has experience working with
and managing second homes, as opposed to rental apartment units or
commercial buildings.
 May I have the names of three or four other clients with whom you
work? Get feedback from these folks on what it’s like doing business with
the property manager. This type of info is valuable and enlightening.
 How many other properties do you manage? If they say, for example,
110, be sure to also ask how many employees they have. You want to be
sure they have the staff to handle their workload.
 Exactly what do you offer in terms of property maintenance and
repair? Do you, for example, offer the following:
• Lawn maintenance and service.
• Basic cleaning services.
• Thorough cleaning services.
241
Chapter 13: Handling the Maintenance and Upkeep on Your Second Home

• Regular inspections (and if so, what is inspected and how often?).
• Repair and maintenance of major systems and/or exterior spaces.
You want someone who will take charge and actually call the
plumber when a leak is detected, not call you to report the problem.
 When something goes wrong at my home, who will handle the repair?
If the property manager has someone on staff, all the better. However,
many property managers probably call a third party, like a plumber,
roofer, or HVAC professional, to handle it.
 How do you charge for these services? Even if he can’t put a specific
price on certain repairs, ask the property manager to quote an hourly
labor rate, flat fee, and/or other ballpark estimate to help you determine
whether you can afford his services.
 How often will you report problems and concerns to me, and how will
you contact me? A phone call should be a property manager’s first
choice, and is usually the best way to reach you, even if he gets your
machine or voice mail; then an e-mail if the situation isn’t too urgent;
then a fax. Megaphones shouldn’t even enter the picture.
After you have the answers to these important questions, think about them
and consider the idea of hiring a property management firm. Review your
financial situation and decide whether using a property manager is a feasible
way to handle the ongoing maintenance of your second home.
Going over the fine print
Before you sign a contract with a property manager, read the document in its
entirety and make notes. If there’s anything you’re not clear about, or if any
phrases or wording doesn’t make sense to you, ask about it. You can also
have your attorney review the contract to make sure you’re getting a fair
deal. And be sure the contract includes a few sentences outlining your right
to terminate the agreement when warranted on 30 to 60 days’ notice.
Figuring out how much to pay
After you’ve found a property manager who can handle your needs and
you’ve decided to do business with him, then it all comes down to the money.
See Chapter 11 for details on how much property managers charge and how
much you should expect to pay. Understand that the property manager who
helps you both rent out the home and maintain it, versus the one who only
handles the maintenance, will likely charge more. And his monthly fees don’t
include the costs of repairs. Be sure to factor these monthly/quarterly costs
into your overall cost of second-home ownership.
242

Considering a part-time property manager
After reading the fine print and considering the final costs, are you thinking
that you can’t afford to have a full-time property manager take care of your
second home? Fear not. One option you have is to try to work out a part-time
deal with a reputable company. Most companies should be willing — for a
fee, of course — to come in on an as-needed basis to handle inspections,
report problems, and even cut the grass. This is similar to keeping a com-
pany on retainer: You use them only when you need them. When the firm
kicks into action, you’ll be expected to pay for the services provided.
This way, when something big happens, you can have the firm mobilize and
handle it without having to pay large monthly fees or commissions for ongo-
ing service. If you establish a relationship with a property management firm,
no matter how limited, then you’re an established customer and they’ll be
there for you when you really need them.
Developing a working relationship
with your property manager
If you’ve decided to trust someone to take care of your second home on
either a part-time or full-time basis, make sure that you sow the seeds of
a solid relationship right from the start. This is, of course, true with any
professional relationship, like the one you have with your attorney, real
estate agent, accountant, feng shui consultant, or doctor, and it should
be standard operating procedure with your property manager as well.
Establish open lines of communication with your property manager and
agree on expectations.
Property management companies differ, but you can expect to have one or
more key people with whom you work and whom you call with questions or
for service problems. All firms keep accurate records of visits and the action
taken, and your rep can discuss everything with you. You should also inquire
whether they provide online access to management reports and other
records pertaining to your property.
Communicating with your property manager
When working with a property manager, the first thing you need to do is
come up with a good communication plan. Any professional relationship is a
two-way street. Each side — no matter how busy one of them is — must do
its part to make the relationship run smoothly. You need to be equally as
available to your property manager as you expect him to be for you, and
you’ll be on your way to developing a great working relationship.
243
Chapter 13: Handling the Maintenance and Upkeep on Your Second Home

Here are the two key points you need to discuss with your property manager:
 How will we communicate with each other? Will it be by phone, in
person, or by e-mail? The property manager who assures you he’ll be
calling you on a regular basis is a real pro.
 How often will you be in touch with me? Will we only talk when there
is a problem? Or when I owe you money? Or will you set up a regular
communication schedule (such as monthly chats or e-mails)? Again, the
manager who keeps the lines of communication open is a winner.
You also need to decide under what specific circumstances, outside of regu-
larly scheduled contacts, you want to hear from your property manager. For
example, which incident would you consider important enough to warrant a
call from your manager: a small hole appears in a screen door, the front
porch light bulb goes out, the stove dies, or a neighborhood kid hits a base-
ball through the living room window?
Of course, you can tell your manager to take care of everything, up to a
preset dollar amount, and bill you for the time and replacement costs.
However, doing so can be risky, considering the slew of problems that can
crop up at any given time with a second home. Then again, it can be a smart
solution if your home is in fairly good condition from the beginning.
Nail down these details early in your relationship with your property man-
ager. He should know precisely what he can do on his own and what you
want to be notified about. And be specific. One way to do this is to set a
dollar limit. Any repair or service that costs you, say, $100 or less, he can
take care of without notifying you. Get this in writing so you don’t get any
surprises — like your property manager authorizing a $1,500 air conditioner
repair and sending you the bill.
What to expect from your property manager
In today’s busy world, property managers handle myriad tasks for second-
home owners. If you’re expecting him to manage the maintenance of your
home, he can
 Handle tenant complaints and answer tenant questions
 Repair the property and keep it in good working order
 Contract and oversee lawn maintenance and gardening (although some
property management firms have their own grounds people)
 Clean the home (after a short-term renter vacates the property, for
example)
 Remove snow, leaves, and other debris that clutters the property
 Collect rent from short- and long-term tenants
 Handle payment of property taxes, expenses, and fees
244
Part III: Making Your Second Home a Smart Investment 

 Check in with the owner periodically to update her on the property, dis-
cuss problems and issues, and assure her that the property is in good
shape and well cared for
 Evict tenants (in the case of long-term rentals)
 Take care of other specific tasks that are discussed in advance and, prefer-
ably, written into the property management contract. A few examples:
• If your second home has its own pool, the property manager may
coordinate the care of that pool and pay a pool company to main-
tain it.
• If you use the home twice a year but keep a lot of personal items
and clothing at the house year-round, the property manager may
oversee the professional storage of these items while you’re not
there, and take care of delivery of your possessions to the home
when you arrive.
• If you own a home in a remote location — mountain, island,
country — the property manager may set up increased security
monitoring or housesitting on an as-needed basis.
Your property manager’s primary responsibility is to you. If you rent your
place, her secondary responsibility is to the tenant, with whom she also has
to create and maintain a good working relationship. Keep this point in mind
when you ask the property manager to do something that may upset your
tenant. The tightrope your property manager walks has to balance out on
both sides. For instance, refusing to authorize an immediate refrigerator
repair will almost certainly put your property manager in a very uncomfort-
able situation with your tenants.
Checking on the property
Your property manager should conduct regular, in-person visits to your
second home to make sure that it’s still standing, that all systems are in good
working order, and that it’s in the same shape it was when you last left it.
In your contract, have the property manager include a specific checkup
schedule for your home. In most cases, I recommend a minimum of once a
month. During these visits she can walk through the home and around the
outside looking for any signs of problems with your place. However, your
property manager may offer you a different schedule. Common inspection
schedules are quarterly or every-other-month visits, and it’s up to you to
decide whether this will work for you.
If, for example, you’ll be using your second home every month, then quarterly
checkups may be fine. However, if your home is in Europe, and you’ll be there
one month out of the year, and the property will be rented out for the other 11
months, then you should request — and spell out in writing — more frequent
visits.
245
Chapter 13: Handling the Maintenance and Upkeep on Your Second Home

To ensure that the property manager does a thorough checkup, make detailed,
written arrangements for an inspection and cleaning after each tenant leaves,
and outline the specific preparations necessary for the next tenant to take pos-
session. Also request an update on your property after each of these checkups,
preferably in writing.
Dealing with emergencies
Emergencies are something no homeowner can avoid. From natural disasters
and weather-related issues, to fires and structural catastrophes, to more
common stuff like an overflowing toilet, Murphy’s Law (anything that can go
wrong will go wrong!) really applies quite frequently to homeownership.
Keep the following in mind when discussing with your property manager how
to handle emergencies:
 Ask your property manager how she’s handled emergencies in the past,
and ask her to be specific with real-life examples. Discuss lots of “what
could go wrong” scenarios with her. Decide what really constitutes an
emergency (not a leaky faucet, for example) and together determine how
to handle them. You may instruct her to call the police or fire department,
for example, and then notify you. Then you’ll ask her to deal with tenant
concerns, report the incident to your insurance company, and handle any
other details.
 Always keep your property manager informed of your most current
contact info. This includes current phone numbers (home, cell, and
work), e-mail addresses, and physical addresses. You don’t want your
property manager to get a “We’re sorry, that number is no longer in ser-
vice” message when she calls to tell you that an 8-foot alligator broke
through your pool screen and is swimming in your pool. (That’s a true
story, by the way; it happened in my neighborhood about a year ago.) Be
sure to give your property manager an emergency contact, just in case
she can’t reach you when the incident occurs.
 Make sure that you have the proper insurance coverage to protect
your investment and that your property manager is aware of this cov-
erage. If your home is located in an area where hurricanes, flooding,
earthquakes, or other natural disasters seem to occur on a fairly regular
basis, you need the proper insurance coverage to protect your second
home. Talk to your insurance agent about your coverage, and purchase
any additional insurance (such as national flood coverage) that will help
you rebuild in the event of an emergency.
Covering these points in a conversation will help you develop a good working
relationship with your property manager. Use open lines of communication
and a detailed contract and plan for any and all events that could affect your
property. Then take comfort in the knowledge that both you and your prop-
erty manager are interested in keeping your second home safe and sound.
246
Part III: Making Your Second Home a Smart Investment 

Managing Your Second Home from Afar
If you decide to maintain your second home yourself and you live a fair dis-
tance away from your second home (or even if you only live an hour away),
your busy life probably doesn’t allow you to drop everything to deal with
issues. You’re certainly not alone; many people lead busy lives that preclude
them from taking time away to maintain a second home.
Even though you may hate the idea (or even feel guilty about it), you should
abandon the notion of achieving and maintaining perfection with your
second home. If there’s a small nick in a cabinet door, or a toilet that runs a
minute too long, or an air conditioning unit that is just a tad louder than you
would normally tolerate, remember that you’re only spending part of the
time there. Obsessing over these little details will drive you crazy. If, how-
ever, any of those little issues turn into larger problems, be sure to address
them quickly. Strive to achieve a balance regarding your priorities and rele-
gate your second home to second on your list when it comes to taking care of
absolutely everything that can use some attention.
247
Chapter 13: Handling the Maintenance and Upkeep on Your Second Home
Who should the tenant call with problems?
Sooner or later, you’ll get a frantic call from your
tenant at an inconvenient time telling you that
something has gone terribly wrong in your
house. Maybe it’s 2 a.m. on a Saturday when
your tenant calls to say that the central air con-
ditioning unit has broken down in the middle of
a Texas heat wave. You can handle the situation
in one of three ways:
 You can handle it yourself and schedule the
repair by calling in your own cavalry, which
usually is comprised of one or more area
contractors qualified to handle the specific
problem.
 You can have the tenant call the property
manager, if you hired one.
 You can have the tenant call someone else
who is handling on-site maintenance issues
for the property. This can be a neighbor, rel-
ative, friend, or anyone else who has
agreed to handle things like this on your
behalf.
Understand that not all complaint calls will be
about leaky toilets and broken stoves. Problems
can range from noisy neighbors who are blast-
ing music until 3 a.m., unwanted pests and
insects that have invaded the home while you
were away, and countless other issues.
By dealing promptly and courteously with these
and other problems, you’ll cultivate good tenant
relations, and you’ll probably minimize the
number of late-night and weekend calls that
come your way. Small problems can easily and
quickly turn into big problems, so taking care of
even minor nuisance calls with the same atten-
tion you’d give to emergencies will certainly pay
off in the long run.
Be sure to leave clear instructions about “who
to call, and for what reasons” prominently dis-
played on the refrigerator in your second home,
especially if you expect to rent out the home to
multiple vacationers over the course of a year.

This section identifies the important areas you need to consider if you decide
to tackle your second home’s maintenance and upkeep yourself. I give you
the lowdown on people who can help you maintain the property, discuss
lawn maintenance and regular inside cleaning, and share some important
points about safety. If something bad happens, don’t worry. I have you cov-
ered as well, and I tell you how to handle mishaps and accidents.
Identifying who you can rely on
No matter if you live 300 miles or just 30 miles from your second home, you
may not be able to drop by your second home whenever you feel like it.
That’s why having reliable people you can check in with about your home’s
condition is important.
If you’re maintaining your second home, the following individuals can serve
as your eyes and ears and make your job a lot easier:
 Landscaper: Landscaping and lawn maintenance crews can mow and
edge the lawn and pull weeds. For a few extra bucks, most landscapers
also trim hedges and trees as needed. (Check out the next section for
more detailed info about lawn upkeep.)
 Cleaning crew: Second-home owners can use cleaning companies on an
occasional basis to clean up the home after renters leave or spruce up
the place after they themselves leave. This can give you peace of mind
for your next trip, knowing that you won’t be opening the door to a
mess. (See the section “Cleaning your digs: Inside upkeep” later in this
chapter for more detailed info.)
 Handyman: These folks can do the odd jobs around your house that you
don’t want to do or that you don’t know how to do. If, for example, a per-
manent mirrored tile is lifting off the living room wall, or if some of the
popcorn ceiling is shedding in one of the upstairs bedrooms, a handy-
man can fix it for you, and charge you by the job or by the hour.
 Security: If you’re not going to be living in your second home full time,
invest in a security system. These systems can be helpful in warding off
potential crooks (sometimes the company’s yard sign is enough to scare
them off) and can alert you to any intrusions. I just had my security
system overhauled for $700 and, for $50 a month, the security company
monitors it closely enough that they once called the police to my home
because my cat was jumping around and setting off the motion detec-
tors. The money is well worth the peace of mind.
 Neighbors: Getting friendly with at least one or two of the folks who live
close by your second home can be invaluable. They can make a quick
phone call to you if they notice something that seems amiss. See
Chapter 10 for more info on how to get to know your neighbors and a
discussion of the rewards that can come from making new friends.
248
Part III: Making Your Second Home a Smart Investment 

 Attorney: Some people like to do things on their own. Others like sup-
port, assurance, and reassurance. You may fall somewhere in the
middle. When the time comes to sign an important agreement or make a
key decision that can affect you legally, consult with an attorney for
peace of mind. Expect to pay anywhere from $250 to $400 an hour.
You can ask the preceding service providers to call you if they see something
that’s awry — even if it has nothing to do with the service they’re providing.
Granted, the landscaper isn’t responsible for notifying you if a couple of shin-
gles blew off your roof, but professionals will almost certainly provide this
courtesy if asked. It builds goodwill, and every businessperson knows how
valuable that commodity is for long-term success.
Have a list of local service personnel on hand at all times at both your pri-
mary and second home. The list of phone numbers should include plumbers,
HVAC repair shops, electricians, lawn care services, roof repair companies,
and other firms that you can call on for help.
Keeping the lawn and garden looking
good: Outside maintenance
Just because you’re not at your second home year-round doesn’t mean you can
let the grass grow waist high, the free weekly newspapers pile up in the drive-
way, and the garbage cans roll around in the street. Doing so won’t keep you on
your neighbors’ good sides. (If you own a condo, skip to the next section.
Outdoor maintenance on such properties is generally the responsibility of the
condo association and paid for through your monthly common charges.)
249
Chapter 13: Handling the Maintenance and Upkeep on Your Second Home
Start your own network
If you’re going to be away from your second
home for an extended period of time, and if
you’re not using a property manager, then you’ll
want to make friends with your new neighbors.
Quickly. These folks can serve as your eyes and
ears while you’re away and can keep you
informed of anything strange or worrying that
may be going on at your property.
Provide these wonderful neighbors with an
updated list of contact information, the dates
that you plan to be at (and away from) your
home, the names of anyone whom they can
expect to see there while you’re away, and
descriptions of what they drive. (If Aunt May
has a key and drops in once in a while, be sure
to mention it.) Provide any other details that may
be helpful to the people who will keep an eye on
your place for you.
You may also want to leave a house key with a
trusted someone nearby just in case access is
required. If, for example, you’re 1,200 miles
away and someone needs to let service per-
sonnel in for an emergency repair, handling the
call will be easier if a house key is nearby.

To keep your second-home investment intact and your neighbors happy, con-
sider hiring a lawn maintenance firm to do the following tasks on a regular
basis. They charge as little as $60 to $80 a month to mow and edge the lawn
and pull weeds, plus a few more bucks for extra tasks.
 Maintaining the lawn weekly (mowing and edging)
 Weeding and trimming the hedges and trees monthly or bimonthly
 Checking the pool and spa filters and chlorine applications (weekly)
 Securing any trash cans in a designated area
 Pressure washing the driveway and adjacent concrete (yearly)
 Painting the exterior (every three to five years, depending on the
weather and other elements)
 Removing leaves regularly in the autumn
 Maintaining the mailbox and any other outdoor fixtures (such as
lighting — no dark bulbs!)
Your second home may have other outdoor elements that need regular atten-
tion, but by staying on top of these areas — either on your own or with the
help of friends, neighbors, and local service providers — you’ll have a good
handle on exactly what needs to be done.
If you’re not around your second home for a while, your lawn maintenance
workers can also help with outdoor cleanliness. Ask them to keep an eye out
for any garbage, free newspapers, or other items that may clutter your lawn
and driveway. Explain that you’re going to be away for a certain length of
time and that you’d appreciate any extra cleanup help they can provide
during that period.
Cleaning your digs: Inside upkeep
Keeping your property clean from across the miles is difficult to do on your
own (unless, of course, you’re a Jedi and can sense a disturbance in the Force
from afar). Line up a combination of professional and personal help to ensure
that your second home doesn’t become an eyesore during the times that
you’re not in the house. This chore is particularly important for owners who
are renting their second homes by the week or the month: It doesn’t take long
for daily usage to create a real mess in a home.
250
Part III: Making Your Second Home a Smart Investment 

You have a few choices when it comes to dealing with the odious task of
cleaning:
 You can clean the place yourself. You clean whenever and however you
want.
 You can hire a cleaning crew to come in regularly (for about $60 to $100
a week) and clean the home.
 You can hire a cleaning crew to come in and clean the house on an as-
needed basis (for about $80 to $120 a shot).
251
Chapter 13: Handling the Maintenance and Upkeep on Your Second Home
What if the tenant offers to do some 
of the maintenance?
Your tenant may offer to help around your
second home and do some of the maintenance
work. There’s nothing wrong with having willing
tenants handle some of the maintenance, as
long as they know what they’re doing. (And it
certainly shouldn’t take long to figure that out.
“So that’s what a lawnmower looks like! I’ve
never seen one before!”)
Short-term rentals (a week or two) probably
won’t be suitable for this maintenance
approach, because you can bet that people
who have a week at the shore aren’t going to
want to spend part of it cleaning your house.
But many long-term tenants are often willing to
handle at least some of the day-to-day tasks.
Lawn maintenance — mowing and edging — is
a good starting point for three reasons: It needs
to be done regularly, hiring someone to do it
costs money, and doing it yourself takes time.
Show your tenants the property lines, the equip-
ment, and any special techniques you use to get
the job done, and they should be on their way.
And be sure to give them specific instructions if
there’s something you insist on: “The lawnmower
blades must be wiped off after every mowing.”
All interior cleaning should be the responsibility
of the year-round tenant. Your tenants probably
don’t want you snooping around their living
space every couple of weeks or so anyway. And
that’s perfectly understandable.
However, you should consider making regular,
yearly, announced inspections to make sure
problems don’t pile up to a point where you
have to spend tens of thousands of dollars to
get things back in order after your tenants move
out. You’ll be looking for signs of problems with
plumbing, leaks, and so forth. But a look around
can also tip you off to the fact that your tenants
now have five cats, along with their requisite
litter boxes, and that your beloved second home
now smells like cat urine.
Your tenants will probably resist helping with
repairs (unless they’re retired, super-handy, and
enjoy the work). Most tenants feel that repairs
absolutely are the owner’s responsibility — and
they’re right.

To find outside help, ask friends and neighbors for referrals. Choose a service
that’s bonded and insured, and that has experience handling homes the size
of yours.
Preventing accidents: Safety is key
Second-home owners sometimes overlook the issue of safety. A second home
has more people in and out of it, especially if you’re renting it. So maintaining
your home safely is essential. What do you need to watch out for? Basically,
anything that can cause injury. For example, a rug corner that’s come loose
and is sticking up can cause someone to trip and fall; a tub without a no-slip
mat or decals is a danger zone; and missing or nonfunctioning smoke detec-
tors and carbon monoxide detectors can result in a perilous situation.
When maintaining your second home, make your place as safe as possible.
Take a walk through and around your house and run through some imaginary
scenarios in your mind. Yes, someone could trip on that piece of carpet,
right? And, yes, someone could fall in the pool inadvertently, right? Take the
necessary measures to prevent accidents. Better to be safe than sorry.
Handling mishaps and accidents
You receive a phone call that something has happened on the property. You
don’t need to worry too much if you plan ahead and know how to handle the
inevitable mishaps and accidents.
The best way to keep abreast of mishaps and accidents from afar is by having
at least one trusted friend, neighbor, or family member within a few minute’s
drive of your second home. These mishaps can be as simple as a tree limb
that snaps off and breaks a window, or as complex as a serious pipe break
that floods the upstairs bathroom and sends water gushing out under the
front door. (I’ve seen that one happen myself. The owners were away, and
their neighbor noticed the problem and immediately called the condo man-
agement company, the fire department, the police, and the owners.)
Make sure that you inform this trusted person every time you or anyone else
occupies or vacates the home, and tell him of any potential problems that
may come up. Give him a copy of your service professionals’ contact list (see
the “Identifying who you can rely on” section for details) and authorize him
to call anyone needed if something nasty comes up. Let your trusted contact
know how to contact your tenants in case of a problem. Also consider how
long you’ll wait before entering the property in these situations. You should
handle a big mishap (a tree through the roof after a tornado, for example)
immediately, while you can take care of something minor (a small hole in the
screen door) on your next visit.
252
Part III: Making Your Second Home a Smart Investment 

If someone gets injured while on your property, call your insurance agent
immediately. Keep this insurance agent’s number handy, and share it with the
trusted individual who watches your home while you’re away. Your insurance
agent will want to know the following:
 Who was injured and what is their address and contact info?
 A general description of the person’s injuries: “Her knee was bleeding
profusely and she may have broken her wrist.”
 The exact circumstances of how she was hurt: “She was walking up the
front steps, tripped, and fell onto her right knee and right wrist.”
 Who witnessed the mishap?
 What medical attention the injured person received and where?
 Were the police called?
 Was an ambulance called?
 The name of the injured party’s insurance company.
 Any damage to the premises and/or property as a result of the mishap.
 What, if anything, the injured party said to the homeowner.
Coping with theft or major
property damage
Theft and property damage can happen at any home, but the second home left
unoccupied for long spells is especially vulnerable. And because so many of

Putting a nosy neighbor to good use
A friend of mine has a second home in a Florida
community where “snowbirds” make their
annual pilgrimage south, and then make the
return trip home in the spring. But not everyone
leaves. One woman lives there year-round and
watches about 20 different homes for a small
fee (about $200 for the season — everyone
chips in). She keeps the owners informed of any
problems.
If you’re buying in a community that’s saturated
with second-home owners, ask around to find
out which of the year-round residents has the
time and willingness to serve as a quasi prop-
erty manager while you’re away. If you can
make this happen, it’ll afford great peace of
mind for a much smaller fee than what a pro-
fessional would command.

these homes are in vacation spots (in Florida, for example, where hurricanes
are a problem for a good portion of the year), they need a bit more attention
when it comes to keeping them safe from theft and property damage.
No one likes to think about the frightening notion of someone breaking into
their second home. The reality, however, is that it can and does happen, so
take the following steps:
1. Work to prevent a break-in.
• Get a monitored security system for your second home. You can
get one for about $50 a month; it will be well worth the investment.
• Be sure to have good, solid locks on the doors, and most impor-
tant, make sure they’re locked when you leave. (Lots of times,
crooks do nothing but walk around trying doorknobs and then rob
whichever homes were left unlocked.)
• Install good lighting that features timers and motion detectors
to help ward off would-be burglars who don’t want to be in the
spotlight.
2. Be prepared to handle the situation if your home is broken into.
If your second home is broken into and you’re the first one to discover the
break-in, don’t enter the home. Call 911 from your cellphone or a neigh-
bor’s house and wait for the police to arrive before going inside. If, on the
other hand, you’re notified of a break-in and your trusted friend, neighbor,
or family member is at the home handling the police and securing the
place, then the first person you need to call is your insurance agent.
If your second home is damaged due to weather, vandalism, or theft, you
need to do the following:
1. Call your insurance agent immediately to report the claim.
2. Secure the premises and protect the items inside and outside of the
home.
For example, if a sliding glass door is broken, make sure the opening
gets covered with plywood.
3. Take any other measures necessary to safeguard your investment.
For example, you may need to use generators to provide electricity
and/or light, or you may need to put tarps on the roof and lock any gates
or doors that may become entrances for unwanted individuals.
Because you won’t be living in your second home full time — and if you don’t
have a property manager, friend, or neighbor checking up on your home —
you may not even know about the damage or theft for a while if you don’t
have an alarm system. For this reason, make arrangements with someone
254
Part III: Making Your Second Home a Smart Investment 

whom you trust to do regular drive-bys and internal inspections of the home
while you’re away. Also, notifying the local police that the house will be
vacant for a specific time period is a good idea.
Closing for the Season
If you use your second home for a certain period of the year and then close
it for the rest of the time, this section contains all you need to know about
what you should do inside and out before you (cue lump in throat) kiss your
getaway goodbye and fly (or drive) back to reality for a few months.
What needs to be done inside?
When leaving your home for an extended period of time, use the following
checklist to make sure your home will be a pleasant place to return to. Many
of these tips come from a friend of mine who lives in Michigan for part of the
year and in a 55-plus Florida community the rest of the year. When he departs
his second home, he spends at least a week preparing his home for vacancy.
(Feel free to photocopy this list for your own use.)
❑Call the cable company, telephone company, Internet service provider,
newspaper delivery, garbage pickup service, and other utility service
providers to let them know when to stop the service.
❑Leave the water and electricity on while you’re away.
❑Have your mail forwarded back to your primary address. Do this a
week early and have your primary home’s post office hold the for-
warded mail — doing so ensures a clean transition.
❑Remove all food from the refrigerator and freezer and turn down the
thermostat.
❑Clean out the cabinets of noncanned food items that would go bad over
the next few months.
❑Clean the kitchen and put out insect or ant traps (to avoid a nasty sur-
prise when you return).
❑Open all the kitchen cabinets to keep air flowing through them and to
avoid mold and odor problems.
❑Straighten all rooms, make the beds, and clean the bathrooms.
❑Turn the thermostat to a level that saves energy but also ensures that
the home doesn’t get too hot and/or damp from the humidity during the
summer.
255
Chapter 13: Handling the Maintenance and Upkeep on Your Second Home

❑Turn off the hot water heater.
❑Talk to your neighbors about your departure and leave contact info for
reporting any unusual activity.
❑Lock all the doors and windows, and close the drapes or pull the blinds.
❑If possible, use a lighting timing device that leaves on a light to let possi-
bly troublesome passersby know that someone is home. Invest in those
ultra-low-wattage spring bulbs to minimize energy consumption.
❑Unplug expensive electronics like TVs, microwaves, computers, and other
appliances to eliminate the possibility of damage from lightning strikes.
Your place doesn’t have to be sparkling, but it should at least be neat and
tidy for you when you return.
What needs to be done outside?
You have fewer chores to attend to outside when you’re closing your house
for the season, but you still want to take a few minutes to walk around the
property. Here’s what you should do:
❑Bring all lawn and patio furniture into the home for storage in the garage
or living room.
❑Secure or bring inside all objects that may go flying in a strong wind or
that people can walk off with. That includes flowerpots, garden hose
reels, pool toys, barbecue grills, trash containers, and anything else that
can turn into a projectile during high winds.
❑If you use them, make sure any sprinkler systems are set to run automat-
ically on their specified days.
❑Make sure all doors and gates are locked.
❑Take any other necessary steps that may be unique to your home to
ensure that it will stay safe while you’re away.

 Making your second home your primary home: The tax implications
P
urchasing a second home and using it for vacation or rental purposes
(not as your primary home) can affect your tax return in the long
term. You’ll have additional income to report from renting it and additional
expenses to deduct from the costs of maintaining it as an investment property.
When you become a second-home owner, you essentially become a business
owner — but only if you’re going to rent your home to others. If you don’t
rent your second home, then the effect on your taxes is relatively limited.
Mainly, it gives you additional mortgage interest and property tax deduc-
tions, assuming you took a mortgage out on the place.
In this chapter, I walk you through the most important changes in your tax
situation after you purchase your second home, and I offer some simple
strategies you can implement to lower your final tax bill.
For more-detailed info that applies to your individual situation, always talk to
a reputable accountant before making any assumptions or important deci-
sions about your taxes or filing any tax returns. They know what they’re talk-
ing about and have seen situations like yours countless times before. You can
also pick up the latest edition of Taxes For Dummies by Eric Tyson, Margaret
Atkins Munro, and David J. Silverman (Wiley) for help in understanding the
latest tax-code changes and figuring out what forms you need to file.

Taxes 101: How Owning a Second
Home Impacts Your Bottom Line
Uncle Sam defines a second home as any home other than your main home.
So if you own more than one house, you have to select one as your main
home and the rest become second homes. Second homes can be
 Single-family homes
 Condominiums or townhouses
 Cooperatives
 Mobile homes, trailers, or RVs
 Boats that include cooking, sleeping, and toilet facilities
The downside of owning a second home is that you have to pay property
taxes on the home, no matter what, and you may have an increased income
tax bill if you rent it. The upside is that no matter how you use your home,
you gain some tax deductions.
If you’re using your property solely as a second home (meaning that you’re
using it for your own personal vacations and visits), you can
 Deduct mortgage interest. But you can’t deduct maintenance or other
expenses associated with the property.
 Collect 14 days of rental income without having to pay taxes on that
revenue.
If you use the home yourself for 14 days or fewer, and if you rent it out at fair
market value (the price that an interested — but not desperate — renter is
willing to pay on the open market to rent the home) at other times during the
year, then you, my friend, have an investment property on your hands. That
means that
 All the income the home generates is taxable.
 Most of the expenses associated with the home — including deprecia-
tion — are tax deductible.

Strategies to Lower Your Tax Bill if
You’re Renting Out Your Second Home
As a second-home owner, you can effectively lower your overall tax bills by
claiming certain deductions associated with homeownership and rental prop-
erty. And it’s all perfectly legal, as long as you play by the IRS’s rules.
In this section, I go over those deductions one by one, and help you under-
stand exactly what you can — and can’t — deduct on your tax return when
you’re a second-home owner and you’re renting out your home.
I’m not a tax attorney or accountant, so if you have any questions after you
read this chapter, I suggest you talk to a professional. For the most updated
info on how to claim rental property income and expenses, get a copy of IRS
Publication 527, “Residential Rental Property (Including Rental of Vacation
Homes).” Call 800-829-3676 to get a hard copy of the publication, or scoot on
over to www.irs.gov/formspubs and download a copy. The rules change
all the time, and you’ll want to have the most current information possible
when you sit down to file your current year’s return.

Chapter 14: What Uncle Sam Wants to Know: Important Tax Implications
Renting a second home: My own story
While living in Florida, I owned a second home
in Pennsylvania. I rented my three-bedroom,
two-bathroom, two-story home to a couple who
lived there from 1997 to 2004 (when I eventually
sold it to them). It was a year-round rental based
on the going rate in the area, which was about
$700 per month.
During the seven-year period that I rented out
the home, I claimed the rental income on the
appropriate IRS form, and I deducted the fol-
lowing expenses associated with the rental:
 The mortgage interest payments
 The property taxes
 The homeowners’ insurance
 The cost of repairing and maintaining the
property
 The depreciation associated with the aging
property
Every year, the home resulted in a slight loss,
mainly because its historic age and upkeep
requirements cost quite a bit each year. This
loss was reflected on the front page of my 1040
tax return.
When it came time to sell the place, I had to pay
back the following in capital gains:
 25 percent of the total depreciation I had
claimed over the seven years
 15 percent of the remainder of the gain
But in the end, the taxes I had to pay were min-
imal compared to my tax savings over the
seven-year period.

Figuring out whether your property
qualifies as a rental for tax purposes
When you rent your second home, figuring out what you can and can’t
deduct on your tax return isn’t always crystal clear. What you can deduct
depends on how many days a year you rent the property. The friendly folks at
the IRS consider a home to be a business entity under the following criteria:
 If you or another family member use the property for 14 days or fewer
a year.
 If you or another family member use it for less than 10 percent of the
number of days that the home was rented at fair market value.
So if you rented the home out for 50 weeks, that’s 350 days. If you and
your family spent the remaining two weeks — 14 days — there, that’s
fewer than 35 days (10 percent of 350), so that year, the IRS would con-
sider the home a business, with all the deductions that come with that
designation.
On the other hand, say you and your loved ones spent three months at
your second home and rented it out the remaining nine months. The 10
percent rule wouldn’t apply here because you spent 90 days at your
place and rented it out for 270 days. In this situation, your 90 days in resi-
dence is well over the 27 days allowed to qualify the house as a business
entity. You can’t deduct expenses associated with renting the home.
Determining whether your second home qualifies as a business under IRS
guidelines can get a little complicated, so it’s always a good idea to have a tax
accountant on your team who knows this stuff off the top of her head and can
answer questions and steer you in the right direction.
Taking deductions on a rental property
So you have some income and expenses related to your second home, and
you’re ready to do your taxes. Table 14-1 summarizes whether you have to
report rental income to the IRS and what deductions are allowed based on
whether Uncle Sam and his team regard your second home as a business or a
residence.
Depending on your individual situation, you’ll likely fall into one of these cat-
egories and be able to figure out just what you can and can’t deduct on your
tax return. If your situation doesn’t easily fit into one of these scenarios, be
sure to talk to your accountant or other tax pro to find out exactly how to
handle any rental income and expenses associated with your second home.

The following sections look at the main categories of deductions that you
may be able to claim on your second home. Be sure to keep the rules — 14
days or fewer, or 10 percent of the time the place is rented out — in mind
when reviewing your options.
Property taxes
You can deduct property taxes on your tax return. If your home qualifies as a
rental property (see “Figuring out whether your property qualifies as a rental
for tax purposes” earlier in this chapter), you deduct the property taxes paid
on Schedule E, Supplemental Income and Loss. This process is straightfor-
ward based on the exact amount of property taxes you paid on the home
during the tax year.
So, if you have two mortgages, one for your primary home and one for your
second home, and you rent out the second home, you file a Schedule A to
deduct the property taxes paid on your first home, and a Schedule E to
deduct the taxes paid on your second home. Capiche?
The moment you become a second-home owner, the amount of house-related
paperwork that comes flying at you every month doubles. (Isn’t that a pleas-
ant thought? Not!) To deal with it, set up a separate file for each of your prop-
erties so you don’t confuse your primary home’s papers with your second
home’s papers. Start your second home file with a copy of your settlement
statement that you receive at closing. Doing so makes it easy when it comes
time to deduct the points (if you paid them) on the current year’s return. Add
261
Chapter 14: What Uncle Sam Wants to Know: Important Tax Implications

to this file all 1098 mortgage interest statements, tax receipts, and proof of
other expenses associated with your second home. And do the same for
your primary residence. I suggest setting up and maintaining accurate, up-
to-date, hard-copy files even if you use a software program to track house-
hold income and expenses. This way, when tax time rolls around, you have
quick access to all the paper records associated with your expenses for each
dwelling. Just throwing everything into a cardboard storage box isn’t that
great an idea. (And I know people who do precisely that. Tax time isn’t a
pretty picture.)
Mortgage interest
If you’re using your second home as a rental property, then you can deduct
your monthly mortgage interest on Schedule E, Supplemental Income and
Loss, which has a space allocated to “mortgage interest paid to banks.”
(Check with IRS Publication 936, “Home Mortgage Interest Deduction,” for
details on how to deal with your specific home mortgage situation.)
Here’s how mortgage interest works for second-home owners:
 If your home is considered an investment property, then you’ll deduct
your mortgage interest on Schedule E.
 If your home is considered a residence (you use it more than 14 days a
year or for more than 10 percent of the total time it’s rented out), then
you’ll claim the mortgage interest only (as reported to you on a form 1098
at the end of the year) on a Schedule A, Itemized Deductions, tax form.
The only difference between how you report a primary versus a second
home is in the form that you file with the IRS.
There are always exceptions to these rules, particularly when it comes to
intricacies of the tax code, but most cases fall into one of these two cate-
gories. Remember rule number one: If you have any doubts or questions,
consult your accountant or attorney!
Your mortgage interest may be limited if the total amount of mortgages taken
out on the second home exceeds either of the following:
 The fair market value of the property
 $1 million (or $500,000 if you’re married and filing separately from
your spouse)
The mortgage interest deduction may also be limited if you have more than
$100,000 ($50,000 for married filing separately) in home equity loans.
262
Part III: Making Your Second Home a Smart Investment 

Don’t forget to deduct the points paid on your second-home mortgage for the
year that you paid them. A point is 1 percent of the mortgage amount, usually
paid in cash at the time of the closing. Points are paid to score a lower inter-
est rate on your mortgage. Points are essentially interest you’re paying early
to reduce the amount of total interest paid. If you buy a home in 2007, for
example — and if you itemize deductions — when you file your tax return in
2008 for the prior year, you can deduct those points paid at closing.
Homeowners’ insurance
If your second home is rented out for more than 14 days a year, you can
deduct the cost of homeowners’ insurance paid out to repair damage and
replace the property. Stake your claim on line 9 of Schedule E.
If your second home is considered a residence — and not a rental property as
defined by the criteria discussed in the “Figuring out whether your property
qualifies as a rental for tax purposes” section — then you will not be able to
deduct your homeowners’ insurance costs.
Miscellaneous deductions
For your rental property, the IRS allows you to deduct certain expenses asso-
ciated with running your business. You can claim the following expenses on
Schedule E:
 Advertising
 Auto and travel
 Cleaning and maintenance
 Commissions (such as those paid to a real estate agent or property
manager)
 Interest other than mortgage interest
 Legal and other professional fees
 Repairs
 Supplies
 Utilities
 Other
As you can see, the IRS provides a wide range of options for the rental prop-
erty owner who incurs expenses throughout the year as a result of homeown-
ership. Just keep in mind that this latitude has in the past caused many a
homeowner to “take advantage,” so to speak, of this ability to deduct various
expenses, and, as such, makes the rental-property arena a red-flag area for
263
Chapter 14: What Uncle Sam Wants to Know: Important Tax Implications

the IRS. Avoid any potential issues by retaining receipts, avoiding over-
deductions, and thinking twice before making any other moves that could
send your tax return to an auditor’s desk.
You can carry over any nondeducted rental expenses to later years (when,
for example, expenses weren’t as high). In other words, if you break even for
two years in a row (your income equals your expenses and you show no tax-
able profit), you may end up with extra deductions (such as that $250 clean-
ing bill) that you can use for later years, when your second home produces
a profit.
What you can’t deduct now, but can later
You should be aware that some of the costs associated with buying a home
are not tax deductible. Closing costs, for example, can’t be immediately
deducted from your tax return. However, you can recoup closing costs when
it’s time to sell your second home, so hang onto those settlement statements.
You can figure such expenses into the adjusted cost basis (the cost of the
home plus any major improvements that added value to a property minus
losses) of the second home. And what, specifically, are closing costs? These
expenses include
 Appraisal fees
 Credit report fees
 Document preparation fees
 Other costs associated with the closing process
You can also deduct costly home improvements (new roofs and kitchens, for
example) when selling your second home. Be sure to retain records of your
improvements, and then talk to your tax preparer when you sell to ensure
that all these issues are properly accounted for and squared away.
Taking advantage of depreciation
The IRS recognizes the fact that homes age and that keeping their value
intact requires money and elbow grease. Because of this, second-home
owners who rent out their properties for more than 14 days per year can
deduct what is known as depreciation on their properties. Depreciation is a
decrease or reduction in value that comes as a result of wear and tear or
market conditions.
264
Part III: Making Your Second Home a Smart Investment 

According to the IRS, only property used in a trade or business or for an
income-producing activity can be depreciated. To qualify, the property must
be something that “wears out” or becomes obsolete over time, and must
have a useful life that extends significantly beyond the tax year. You recover
the cost of income-producing property through yearly tax deductions and the
depreciation (or deducting some of the cost) on your annual tax return.
Depreciation is a complex topic. For more information, refer to the IRS’s Web
site at www.irs.gov and read through Tax Topic 704, Depreciation. At the
Web site, you can also access Publication 946, “How to Depreciate Property.”
Claiming depreciation
Rental property (defined as property where a tenant stays for 30 days or more
and where no medical or health care is provided) is depreciated over a 27.5-
year schedule. To figure out the deductible depreciation on your second home,
you use what is known as the MACRS (Modified Accelerated Cost Recovery
System) method, which is used for properties placed in service after 1986.
To claim the depreciation deduction, you need the following info about your
property:
 Its recovery period: For residential real estate, it’s 27.5 years.
 Its placed-in-service date: Property is considered placed in service when
it is ready and available for a specific use in that activity. That means if
you buy your home in January 2008, and if you don’t start renting it out
until January 2009, then January 2009 is the place-in-service date.
 Its depreciable basis: As determined by an IRS table provided by the IRS
in Publication 946, “How To Depreciate Property.” Call 800-TAX-FORM
(800-829-3676) or visit www.irs.gov for more info on how to obtain one.
Calculating depreciation
Are you scratching your head and wondering how in the heck depreciation
really works? You’re probably not the only one. Depreciation is no stroll in
the park. It’s difficult to understand, and I strongly suggest you talk with a tax
pro for specific advice. The following simple example, however, can help you
understand how depreciation works:
You purchase a home for $195,000 in January 2005 and immediately rent it
out on a yearly basis for $1,000 per month. When you file your 2005 taxes,
you fill out an IRS Form 4562, Depreciation and Amortization, on which you
list the property type and location. For argument’s sake, say the adjusted
basis is $200,000. From Publication 946, you know that the percentage is 3.485
percent. You multiply that by the adjusted basis to come up with $6,970 as
the depreciable amount that you can claim on your tax return.
265
Chapter 14: What Uncle Sam Wants to Know: Important Tax Implications

If, at the time of the sale, your second home was rented out, then any mone-
tary gain due to appreciation will be taxed at a maximum rate of 25 percent.
To find out what’s due, you’ll have to take the yearly depreciation deduction
and multiply it by a maximum rate of 25 percent. Any remaining gain will be
taxed at 5 to 15 percent. The sale itself and these gains or losses are reported
on IRS Form 4797, Sales of Business Property.
Pinning Down Property Taxes
and Assessments
When you buy a second home in any state, you’ll be required to pay property
taxes — and the amount will be based on the government’s determination of
the property’s assessed value. These taxes are used to support the infra-
structure (schools, roads, bridges, public transportation, and so forth) in an
area, and are paid by all property owners. Property taxes are deductible and
in some cases (like when they are insanely high), they can impact the resale
appeal of a property.
Because your second home may be in another state, and the odds are you’ll
probably retire there, knowing what taxes you’ll pay — both before and after
retirement — is important. An excellent source for this info is the Web site
RetirementLiving.com (www.retirementliving.com/RLtaxes.html).
There you’ll find a complete overview of the tax situation in every state, from
sales and fuel taxes, to property and retirement income taxes. (And even if
your second home is in your home state, it’s still a good idea to have a com-
plete awareness of how your state taxes its residents.)
This section explains how your second home is assessed, thus determining
your property taxes, how you can appeal an assessment if you think your
taxes are too high, and what you can do to lower your taxes.
How are properties assessed?
How the assessor’s offices come up with “assessed value” numbers for prop-
erties is a big mystery for most people. But it doesn’t have to be. Most
assessments use factors such as the home’s size, square footage, location,
and amenities to come up with the number. Sometimes they rely on building
permits, which show new additions and renovations that may also affect the
property’s value.
266
Part III: Making Your Second Home a Smart Investment 

Property assessors also factor in the following:
 What similar properties in the area are selling for
 What it would cost to replace the home
 How much it costs to operate and repair the home
 How much rent the property can generate
 Any other issues affecting its value
With this info in hand, the assessor will use one or more of the following
approaches to come up with a number:
 Sales comparison approach: This involves comparing property in the
same area to other like properties that have recently sold. The assessor
analyzes the prices to see whether the sales were in line with what the
market will bear. For example, if one 2,000-square-foot condo sold for $1
million, and another identical unit sold for $500,000 within a few months
of the first sale, the assessor will investigate to see why there was such a
large discrepancy.
After those evaluations are done, the assessor will come up with what
he believes is a fair valuation for your property.
 Cost approach: This is based on how much money it would take — fac-
toring in today’s land, material, and labor costs — to rebuild the prop-
erty from the ground up. This approach works well for new or unusual
homes for which there are no current comparables, or sales to compare
the home to.
 Income approach: Here the assessor evaluates how much income the
property would produce if it were rented as an apartment, retail store,
or other type of business entity. This approach looks at how much rent
the property would earn, the vacancy rates, the maintenance costs, and
the operating expenses, as well as the current interest rate charged for
borrowing money. All these factors are used to come up with an
assessed value.
For a second home, you’ll likely be dealing with the sales comparison
approach most of the time, unless your tax assessor indicates otherwise. You
can challenge the assessor’s approach if you believe it will result in a higher
assessed value than you believe is feasible.
Appealing an assessment
Tax assessors are usually required by the state they operate in to reassess
property values every few years. If you receive one of their assessment
267
Chapter 14: What Uncle Sam Wants to Know: Important Tax Implications

notices — commonly called a TRIM or truth rate in millage statement, a notice
which precedes an actual tax bill — and it’s for a new value that doesn’t
sound right to you, you have the right to appeal the amount.
For example, say your neighbor’s home is 1,000 square feet larger than yours,
yet his tax bill is lower than yours. Aside from this fact driving you crazy
(and, yes, it will, in fact, drive you crazy until it’s resolved), you should use
this disparity as an argument to have your tax bill lowered. You have every
right to request that the county tax assessor reassess your home. (See the
“How are properties assessed?” section for more basic info about the assess-
ment procedure.)
There’s no hard and fast rule for how to go about appealing your assessment.
In many municipalities you file a written appeal within 90 days of receiving
the assessment notice. You typically send the appeal to the county assessor’s
office or property appraiser’s office, depending on what they call themselves
in your community.
If you believe that you have a legitimate gripe with the tax assessor’s office,
don’t wait until your final tax bill arrives. This is very important. By then it
may be too late to do anything about the current tax year. Instead, file the
appeal as soon as you receive the disputable assessment.
As you wind your way through the appeal process, remember that an
appraisal is an opinion of value — an opinion that is handed down by a real
estate professional. If your appraisal of your property’s value doesn’t match
what the assessor says is its value, then you may have a case.
So, how do you win an appeal? That’s the million-dollar question for any legal
battle, but when it comes to an assessment appeal, there are a few ways to
get the assessor to see your side of the story, which is, of course, “my house
is not worth what you say it is. Sir. Or Ma’am.” (And yes, politeness counts
when dealing with any bureaucratic agency.)
If you decide to challenge the assessment, you’ll have to attend a hearing
where the issue will be reviewed. To strengthen your argument, bring as
much evidence as possible to the hearing and be ready to clearly support
your position. The following documents are all very effective in proving that
your house has been assessed at a higher value than you’re willing to accept
as accurate:
 Information about any and all recent sales of the property in question
 A recent independent property appraisal by a qualified fee appraiser
 A sales comparison to properties that have sold recently and that are
similar to yours in square footage and amenities
268
Part III: Making Your Second Home a Smart Investment 

 A detailed outline of your original property cost (this is particularly
applicable for new homes, which aren’t always easy to assess because,
in most instances, the cost of the land is only on the public record)
If you decide to appeal your assessment, talk to your real estate agent and/or
appraiser. They can help you put together the necessary documentation and
proof required to make your case at a hearing, and hopefully be granted a
reduction in your assessment.
Lowering your property tax bill
Most states that tax residential land and buildings offer homeowners ways
to reduce their tax bill to encourage homeownership and residency. Check
with your local tax office for details on any and all tax relief benefits available
to you.
In Florida, for example, full-time residents of the state can file for a homestead
exemption that exempts the first $25,000 in assessed property value from
taxes. Also, all 50 states offer some form of property tax relief based on age
and, sometimes age and income combined. And some cities and municipali-
ties offer property tax breaks for veterans.
Making the Transition: Your Second
Home Becomes Your Primary Residence
You may not be looking to move into your second home permanently for sev-
eral years, but that doesn’t mean you shouldn’t at least consider how it will
affect your bottom line when the time comes to make that transition. Time
passes quickly and, as the years go by, you get into a routine of spending a
few weeks a year at your vacation place and collecting rent on the home the
remaining time. You may think you have plenty of time to think about what
you’ll do with your primary home, but time flies, so give the following some
thought. (Check out Chapter 16 for other issues you have to consider when
your second home becomes your primary residence.)
The Taxpayer Relief Act of 1997 gave homeowners selling their primary resi-
dence a tremendous tax break: If you make less than $250,000 profit (up to
$500,000 depending on your filing status — talk to your accountant) on the
sale of your home, you don’t have to pay tax on the profit, and you don’t
have to use the money to buy another home (like you did before the 1997
act). Profits above $250,000 are still subject to the standard capital gains tax.
269
Chapter 14: What Uncle Sam Wants to Know: Important Tax Implications

And after you move full time into your second home, you have other tax
implications to consider. For starters, you’ll no longer be running your
second home as a business and will no longer have to fill out Schedule E.
Also, if you’ve been making improvements to your second home all along and
deducting them, you’ll no longer be able to do so, because your investment
property is now your primary home.
You will, however, be able to continue to deduct any mortgage interest and
property taxes paid as itemized deductions on your Schedule A. Your tax prep
will be a little easier because you won’t have to show that additional rental
income and whatever expenses you had previously incurred with the home.
270
Part III: Making Your Second Home a Smart Investment 
If you sell your second home:
A note on capital gains
Selling a second home can trigger a capital
gains bill on your next tax return, so it’s impor-
tant to factor in this issue when you’re thinking
about selling. This is the difference in value
between what you originally paid for a piece of
real estate and the price at which it was sold
(assuming the investment itself gained in value
since it was purchased). This number is impor-
tant because it can trigger what is known as a
capital gains tax upon sale of the property. Talk
to your financial advisor if you’re unclear as to
how the sale will impact your tax return.
If you own and use your second home as your
primary residence for at least two of the five
years immediately prior to the date of sale, you
can exclude up to $250,000 of the capital gains
earned from the sale of the home. You can
exclude up to $500,000 if you’re married and
filing jointly, and if both spouses used the home
as a primary residence for at least two of the
last five years.
So if you purchased your home for $250,000 and
sold it for a $100,000 profit, and if you lived in the
home for two years before converting it into a
rental property three years ago, then all the
capital gains from the sale would be excluded.
If you don’t meet those IRS requirements for
excluding capital gains, the gains will be taxed
at a rate of 5 to 15 percent, depending on your
tax bracket. Such gains are reported on a
Schedule D, Capital Gains and Losses, tax form.

R
etirement may be a few years away, but there’s no
time like the present to start planning what role your
second home will play during that stage of your life. This
part helps you figure out how and when to sell your primary
home and move into your second home. This part also
includes a chapter that covers what you need to know when
you do sell the place you now call home and a chapter
that helps you plan for the future.

 Transforming your second home into your full-time residence
 Dealing with the tax implications of your move
W
hen you make the switch from landlord to resident, you have a lot to
do. And packing is the least of it. When it comes time to move into
your second home, you face a number of key decisions — decisions that can
affect you both personally and financially.
For some people, the transition is easy. They pack up and sell the primary
home, move into the second home, and voilá! Home, sweet home! But the
transition isn’t always this easy. Many people encounter problems, such as
adapting to a smaller home, moving to a new state, climate, or country, or
trying to sell an existing home in a saturated market.
This chapter helps you determine the right time to move and looks at the key
factors to consider after you know when you’ll be out of your primary home.
This chapter wraps up with the best ways to tackle the financial and tax
implications that arise when you shift from landlord to occupant.
Think of this chapter and Chapter 16 (which deals with selling your existing
home) as ports in a storm during this important transition. Leaving the place
where you’ve lived for so many years is a big deal. This house has been your
home and it has tons of memories, but you can make this transition smoothly.

Deciding When to Move
to Your Second Home
One day you’ll wake up in the same house you’ve slept in for years and ask
yourself: Shall I sell this place and move into my second home permanently?
Is it time? Some of you may have been thinking for quite some time about
when to make this move. But for others, a combination of factors will hasten
your decision.
Before you figure out whether now is the right time to move to your second
home, you need to take a close look at your current position. Think about
when you plan to retire, your family and their lifestyle, the renters who are
living in your second home, and the income the place is generating. You may
have to factor in many different life scenarios before you make your decision.
Sit down and ask yourself if now is the right time to make the move. Analyze
your family status, finances, work situation, and other factors that could affect
your decision. Consider where you are in your life. Are you ready to stop work-
ing and live in the country? Are you leaning toward a second career and really
looking to live near the city? Think about where you see yourself, your spouse,
and your children being most comfortable for the next five to ten years.
This section explores some possible scenarios you may find yourself facing
and helps you make the best decision.
Considering the impact of selling 
your primary home
Before you sell your home, you need to understand how your home’s value
and what you owe on it can affect your decision to move into your second
home. (Chapter 16 specifically addresses what you need to know to help you
sell your primary home.)
One way to figure out the financial side of the equation is by answering a few
questions that will clearly show you exactly where you stand and help you
decide on your next move (in both senses of the word!). As you decide whether
you want to move into your second home, ask yourself the following questions:
 How much did I originally pay for my home? Cost is crucial, of course.
Combined with your answer to the next question, what you paid will
help you figure out you how much your primary home has appreciated
since you purchased it.
274
Part IV: Home, Sweet Home: Retiring to Your Second Home 

 How much the home is worth now? A real estate agent can do a com-
parative market analysis (CMA) for you, or you can use an online
resource like HouseValues.com (www.housevalues.com) or Zillow.com
(www.zillow.com) to come up with your own numbers. If property
prices in your area have skyrocketed in recent years, and you know you
can make a killing if you sell your home right now, then now may be a
good time to sell.
Don’t base your own home’s value on how much your new neighbor
down the street paid for his place a year ago. The real estate market is in
a constant state of flux, and the price someone in your neighborhood
paid for a house 6 to 12 months ago may not be relevant today for your
home. Avoid these “mis-estimates” by working with a real estate agent
or other professional who, when it comes to your abode, can come up
with an accurate portrayal of what the market will bear right now
(because that’s all that matters when it comes to selling and buying real
estate — right now).
 How much do I owe on my home? You can check your most recent
monthly mortgage statement for this information, or simply call your
bank or mortgage company and ask for a payoff balance.
 How much equity do I currently have in my home? Equity is the value
of the home less the total mortgage amount that you owe on the home.
Calculate this figure by using the following simple formula:
1. Take the current, realistic sale price of your home.
For example, you have determined that your primary house can
realistically sell for $450,000.
2. Subtract the total amount you owe from the price you expect
your home to sell for.
Say you still owe $200,000 on your mortgage. Subtract that
$200,000 from the expected sale price of $450,000 to come up with
a figure of $250,000. That’s your equity.
3. Ask your real estate agent what your approximate closing costs
and legal fees are likely to be, and subtract that number from
the equity.
If your agent estimates the costs at $27,000, subtract that from the
$250,000 equity figure. This number reflects an estimate of the
greenbacks you’ll pocket from the sale of your primary home.
Before selling your primary home and moving into your second
home, keep this final number in mind. Write it down somewhere so
you don’t forget it, but, frankly, I don’t think you will forget it. If
there’s one thing most people never seem to forget, it’s how much
their home has appreciated over the years.
275
Chapter 15: From Landlord to Resident 

If you like what you see when you answer these questions — your home has
appreciated well, your mortgage balance is low or nonexistent, your equity is
high — then you’re in a good position to sell your primary home and move to
your second home. If the answers aren’t quite as positive as you’d hoped for,
now may not be the right time to sell your home. Be patient, keep paying that
mortgage, and watch for home values to rise in your area. Look at these ques-
tions again in a couple of months, and you may be surprised at how your
answers have changed for the better!
Moving before you retire
You may be wondering if you want or need to move into your second home
before you retire. In some situations, like those in the following list, moving
before retirement is a viable option
 If your second home is near your place of work, and/or near your pri-
mary home. This means accessibility to your existing workplace will be
convenient, and you also won’t have to deal with any type of “new area”
culture shock.
 If you’re self-employed and your job isn’t tied to any one place.
Writers, photographers, Web designers and merchants, consultants, and
others who operate a home-based business, for example, can usually
work from anywhere and aren’t required to stay in one geographical
location to earn an income.
 If you’re a few years away from retirement, but the value of your pri-
mary home is sky high and you’d like to cash in rather than take a
chance on a drop in the market. Timing is everything. The real estate
market is a roller coaster of highs and lows, and sometimes the highs
are breathtaking. We’ve been through periods when prices were incred-
ibly high and, if you see that with your primary home and would like to
cash in, then think about selling and moving to your second home
before you’re officially retired. (This assumes, of course, that you can
still work your existing job from your second home.)
By making the move before you retire, you’ll still have regular income coming
in to cover expenses. That means when that $2,000 moving bill comes in, you
won’t have to dip into your nest egg to pay for it.
You may discover other reasons to continue working after you move to your
second home. Carefully review your personal situation before making the
move. Look at your family, finances, and living arrangement (still got a couple
of kids at home? And so on). Also, be sure to think about your desire, or lack
thereof, to continue working. Many baby boomers swear that they’ll never
succumb to the lure of retirement. Also, give some thought to what you’ll do
with yourself after you decide to jump off of the 9-to-5 train.
276
Part IV: Home, Sweet Home: Retiring to Your Second Home 

Moving after you retire
Are you tired of working and ready to slow down a bit? Are you ready to truly
enjoy your second home? If so, you may be thinking about retiring and moving
into your second home. Doing so offers several advantages:
 You will be free to enjoy life, every day, without the worries and
headaches of having to go to a job.
 You can take full advantage of your surroundings and never again have
to say, “Someday we’ll go there when we have time.”
 You can join the ranks of retired individuals who can avoid peak times at
the grocery store and mall.
If you want to enjoy your retirement years in your second home, you need to
make sure you’re ready financially. First, you want to make sure that your pen-
sion, 401(k), and other sources of guaranteed income are adequate to cover all
the housing expenses associated with your second home. To do this, list the
income you expect to receive after you retire, using the following checklist:
 Pension
 Social Security
 IRA and/or 401(k) payouts
 Dividends and interest
 Life insurance annuity payments
 Income from a full- or part-time job
 Regular dips into savings
Make sure you factor in the profit that you’ll earn when you sell your primary
home. If you’ve been paying a mortgage on it for 20, 25, or more years, you
may receive a nice chunk of cash from the sale because the long-term appre-
ciation of homes is around 6 percent a year. (Check out Chapter 16 for more
info on selling your primary home.) You can use this money for the move into
your second home, as well as to create a decent nest egg for the future, no
matter what your age is.
Compare the amount you’ll bring in with the expense you’re likely to have:
 The mortgage payment
 The property taxes
 The homeowners’ insurance
 The homeowners’ association fees
 The amount of money it takes to maintain and repair the home on an
annual basis
277
Chapter 15: From Landlord to Resident 

Don’t overlook the lifestyle changes that will come about as a result of your
move. If, for example, you’re an avid golfer who has lived in Michigan your
entire life, then you can expect to be playing (and paying for) a lot of golf
games at your North Carolina home that’s situated two blocks away from a
great city golf course. (Admit it: That golf course was one of the primary
motivations you bought where you bought, right? Well, good for you.) If wait-
ing a little bit for retirement ultimately means you’ll be able to do more of
the things you love (because it’ll be easier to afford them), then it may well
be worth the wait.
If, after doing these calculations, you discover that you don’t have the
finances you need to retire and move to your second home, don’t despair.
You may just have to stick around in the workforce a bit longer than you were
expecting. And if you’re already retired and think you may want to go back to
work, Working After Retirement For Dummies by Lita Epstein (Wiley) can help
you make that decision and find a job that’s just right for you.
Are the kids out of the house?
If you and the Mister or Missus are empty nesters banging around a big ol’
six-bedroom, five-bath house — of which you’re only using one bedroom and
one bath — then moving to your second home (particularly if it’s smaller and
easier to maintain) is probably a good idea.
If you find yourself facing one of the following reasons, then you may want
to move:
 You just don’t need all that space anymore — and it’s a royal pain in the
patootie to clean all those rooms and bathrooms.
278
Part IV: Home, Sweet Home: Retiring to Your Second Home 
Why you need to appreciate appreciation
Sometimes the appreciation in your primary
home is stunning. (Appreciation is the increase
in your home’s value year after year.) I know a
man who bought a lovely, two-family raised
ranch in the mid-1960s for around $25,000. He
sold it in 2005 for close to $400,000. Any way you
look at it, that’s some serious appreciation.
Because of the huge differences between
houses bought 40 or so years ago and their
worth today, I hear the same exclamation all the
time; whenever someone younger buys a car
these days and pays, say, $27,000 for it, the
person’s parent, uncle, or older friend will
inevitably comment, “That’s more than I paid for
my first house!”

 Paying for all that space and keeping up with the maintenance has been
annoying your checkbook — and you’re afraid she may blow.
 You’d like to be able to do your own lawn maintenance, cleaning, and
repairs but you just don’t have the time anymore.
Lots of moms and dads begin to consider downsizing when their kids go
off to college, launch their careers, and/or start their own families. If this
describes your situation, take a good look at your surroundings and lifestyle,
and decide if now is the time to sell off the Ponderosa and move to Mayberry.
Are you renting your second home long term?
So you’re seriously considering moving into your second home, but your
renters still have six months left on their lease. You shouldn’t just kick them
out, but you can’t let them live there forever. It’s your house, after all.
The best approach is to talk to your renters early: as soon as you’ve decided
to move into your second home full time. Let them know what your plans
are They have rights as stated in their lease, and you have to follow them.
Many leases state that as long as one party gives the other 30 days notice,
and that both parties agree, then the lease can be terminated for any reason.
But that’s kind of harsh, if your tenants have been living in the home for
years.
To avoid this kind of trauma, be completely upfront with your tenants before
they sign a lease for the home and move in. So if you plan to retire to “their”
home in five to seven years, tell your tenants. Plainly. And repeatedly, so
there are no misunderstandings.
Besides preparing to break the bad news to your longtime renters that the
dreaded move-out day is looming, you have to consider what impact losing
that rental income will have on your finances. You’ll also have to complete
some paperwork to finalize the end of the relationship with your tenants. To
make sure this process goes as smoothly as possible, check out “Giving your
renters notice” later in this chapter for specific info.
Are you excited about moving to the area of your second home?
When you chose your second home, ideally you picked a location where you
knew you would eventually want to live all the time (check out Chapter 4 for
more info about your second home’s location). Was it somewhere where the
sand tickles your toes, where the golf course beckons every morning, or
where the mountains and ski slopes seem to have been tailor-made just for
you? Wherever it is, you knew it was a place you could call “home.”
279
Chapter 15: From Landlord to Resident 

As a second-home owner you have the luxury of testing the waters, both liter-
ally (if it’s a beachy area) and figuratively, before moving. As long as you
don’t have a full-time tenant in your place, you can use your vacation time
there to really dig deep and check out the surroundings. Your goal: to be
absolutely certain the home is in an area where you would eventually like to
live on a year-round basis.
If this isn’t the case, then you may want to rethink your move. After all, the
last thing you want to do is sell your primary home, pack up your stuff, move
across the country, and find out that one or more of you really don’t like
where you’ve landed.
280
Part IV: Home, Sweet Home: Retiring to Your Second Home 
Moving to another country
Leaving the shores of the good ol’ USA and
planting roots in another country could be a
book in itself, so this short sidebar just hits on
some of the basic considerations that come into
play when you become an expatriate and join
those who have pulled up anchor and moved to
another country (to gleefully mix metaphors!).
(Flip to Chapter 9 for more specific considera-
tions when buying a second home in another
country.)
For starters, you want to be absolutely certain
that your country of choice is indeed some-
where that you’d like to live full time. When you
visit your second home monthly, quarterly, or
annually, you should pay close attention to what
life is like in the country.
Instead of being a tourist, be a resident. Take a
good long look at the region and the country
through the eyes of someone who lives there,
and size up its strengths and weaknesses from
that point of view.
Also, you must be aware of any and all paper-
work associated with the move, including
 Rules for citizenship
 Visa requirements
 Passports
 Other documents that you’ll need
If you’ve decided to live full time outside of the
United States, you should talk to your financial
advisor, as well as a lawyer who is experienced
in naturalization and residency law. Do you
want to remain a “visitor” to the foreign country
and abide by periodic residency requirements?
When will you be considered a naturalized citi-
zen in the foreign country? Does naturalization
have financial requirements, like establishing a
bank account? Does it come with a passport or
visa? Should you apply for citizenship in the for-
eign country? What are the tax consequences
of carrying dual citizenship? Carefully consider
your advisors’ answers to these questions
before deciding on what your official status will
be in your foreign retirement country of choice.
It’s also a good idea to pack light. Moving cargo
overseas can be costly. And I mean costly with
a capital C (even though it’s got a lowercase
“c,” I’m making the point that . . . oh, you get it.
Never mind). Check into this well ahead of time,
and factor in the costs of moving items (such as
automobiles, furniture, a piano, and other big
things) to the new country.

Think about all this carefully, and decide on a good time to move — or not to
move — into your second home. If things don’t feel right — and you will know
that feeling, trust me — then you need to think about a different location or
surroundings that are more conducive to your life and your lifestyle.
Turning an Investment into a Residence
If you’ve decided to move into your second home and you’re currently rent-
ing it out, then it’s time to turn your rental property into your home.
Although it sounds simple enough in theory — sell, pack, move, done,
right? — you have to take a few key steps before you transform an invest-
ment into a home.
In this section, I help prepare you for the day when you have to wave bye-bye
to your renters, give the place a good once-over, and prepare it for the day
you move in.
Giving your renters notice
Longtime tenants hate to be booted out of the homes that they’ve funneled
rent into for a year or longer. However, one day you’ll want to make your
second home your primary residence. When you do, remember that it’s your
home, and you can make any decisions about it you want to. You should not
feel guilty about asking the renters to move. Do not fall into the trap of allow-
ing your tenants to develop a sense of entitlement about your place. (It hap-
pens. I’ve seen it firsthand.)
When you make the decision to move to your second home (say, a year or so
before you actually plan to move in), you need to gently remind your renters
of the reality of their upcoming situation. This way, it won’t be such a shock,
and both parties will be able to handle it better. If you’re friends with your
tenants, or simply have a good rapport with them, then a phone call to talk
things over is a nice first step and will allow you to make sure that they under-
stand how the situation will unfold. Then follow up the call with a letter to
protect yourself, in case you have to prove that you gave them ample notice.
Use the lease as a guide in giving renters notice, and remember that “too
much” notice could result in an empty house that’s producing no income, and
“too little” could anger your tenants.
281
Chapter 15: From Landlord to Resident 

If you can’t give fair warning
Unfortunately, life isn’t predictable. You may face a situation where you
need to move into your second home rather quickly and can’t give the ten-
ants as much notice that they have to leave as you might otherwise. For
example, perhaps your primary home sold a lot faster than you thought it
would, and your spouse will soon start a new job just down the street from
your second home.
If you can’t give fair warning, at least deal with the situation in a professional
manner by trying a triple play of consideration:
 Give your tenants ample time to find alternate living space. I’d recom-
mend at least 90 days, or whatever is specified in the lease. And even 90
days is, let’s face it, not a whole lot of time to find a suitable place and
move — especially if a family has become entrenched in a place for sev-
eral years. For example, if you know that your tenants have talked about
buying their own place, a little longer “notice” time would be a thought-
ful consideration. Three months can fly by before you know it. Think
about a six-month notice and put it in the lease. (See the next section for
more details on this process.)
 Tell your tenants that you appreciate their efforts in keeping your
home neat, clean, and maintained during their time living there. The
tenants can then use this information (if you give it to them in writing)
as a reference when getting a new place.
 Offer to provide excellent references for them for their next landlord.
They’ll need a few references, so offer up this goodwill gesture to ensure
that they leave on a good note. There’s nothing as convincing to a poten-
tial landlord than a rave review for the tenants from a former landlord.
In the meantime, you can rent a condo or apartment short term for your 90-
day stint while you wait for your renters to vacate. Staying with family is
another option, as are the new crop of “suite” hotels that offer hotel ameni-
ties with apartment-style living quarters.
Don’t break the law — adhere to the lease
Just because you’re the homeowner doesn’t give you a right to kick out any
renters on a whim. You probably signed a lease, right? (I hope you did to pro-
tect yourself and your property.) If you’re ready to give your renters notice,
make sure you refer to your lease.
Sixty to 90 days’ notice is common, but for long-term, reliable tenants who
are “settled in” this could be a tad brief. Use your best judgment for your and
your tenants’ situation. If you know they’d have no problem quickly moving
into an apartment or another rented house, then the 60 or 90 days may work.
282
Part IV: Home, Sweet Home: Retiring to Your Second Home 

Talk to your real estate agent or attorney about landlord/tenant laws in your
specific state. Find out what guidelines you have to follow when evicting ten-
ants, and then follow them to avoid lawsuits during this process. Of course,
you hope it doesn’t come to actually needing to evict, but it’s wise to know
the specifics in case it comes to that.
As long as you don’t violate the terms of the lease — or break any laws
regarding landlord/tenant agreements — then you’re free to move into your
place whenever you want to. Sure, you can be nice and accommodating and
considerate, but your and your family’s needs and wants come first. It is,
after all, your name on the mortgage, right?
Conducting post-rental inspections
After your renters have packed up and left for their new home, you need to
see what condition they left your second home in by conducting a post-rental
inspection. These inspections are important because you never really know
how someone treats your home until you visit the place after they’ve vacated.
When you rented your second home, you should have had your renters give
you a security deposit. A security deposit is a sum of money that you collect
upon renting the home to pay for any extra cleaning or repairs required after
the home is vacated. Now that you’re ready to permanently move into the
home and before you return the security deposit, you want to conduct a thor-
ough inspection of your home — from the kitchen to the bathrooms to the
patio — to make sure that there’s no damage anywhere on the premises.
You should have your tenant(s) attend this inspection, which should take
place within a few days of your tenants moving out — definitely no longer
than a week. With them in attendance
 You can ask them questions on the spot about certain issues and prob-
lems you find.
 They can’t say you broke the stuff after they were gone.
 They won’t be shocked when you decide that you need to retain some of
their security deposit.
The walk-through: Making the inspection
As you make your way through the home, ask yourself (and answer hon-
estly): Is this damage normal wear and tear? If, for example, your tenants
have been in the place for five or more years, a few smudges on the wall, a
chip in the tile, an inoperable oven light, and a small stain on the carpet are
just normal wear and tear and should be your responsibility to fix.
283
Chapter 15: From Landlord to Resident 

It’s not fair to expect your tenants to pay to have the living room carpet
cleaned with their security deposit because of a quarter-sized stain that will
probably come out with spot cleaning. Be reasonable and put yourself in
your tenant’s position. It was their home, after all, not a museum.
As you make your way through the home, carefully check out the following
areas:
 The front entryway, door locks, and windows
 The carpeting and flooring (and anything that may be “hiding” a prob-
lem on the floor)
 The paint (which you’ll probably cover over anyway) and wall coverings
 The walls (look for excessive holes from pictures or other items) and
anything that may be “hiding” a problem with the walls
 The kitchen and appliances
 All bathroom fixtures and toilets
 The home’s exterior
 Any damage inflicted by pets or small children
 Anything else that catches your eye as being “just not right”
When you find damage
Create a document during the inspection process, and have the tenant sign
and date it to acknowledge whatever damage you find. Make a note on this
form as to who will fix the problem and where the money will come from. You
have four choices:
 The tenant’s pocket: The tenant may choose to pay for something small
so she can receive the full amount of her security deposit.
Before you hold some or all of that security deposit because of a broken
dishwasher or a missing piece of tile in the bathroom, offer the tenant
the opportunity to fix the problem herself. She may not want to, but you
should at least extend that courtesy so she can’t come back later and
say you arbitrarily withheld her security deposit without giving her a
chance to rectify the problem.
 Your pocket: You recognize the damage as coming from routine wear
and tear and agree to take care of it.
 The security deposit: You and the tenant agree that you’ll deduct an
agreed-upon amount from the deposit to pay for any repairs.
 Live with it: Scuffed tiles, faded wallpaper, a nick in an appliance — you
decide to blow off a few small things as no big deal.

Part IV: Home, Sweet Home: Retiring to Your Second Home 

Protecting an empty house
Depending on your circumstances, your second home may actually sit vacant
before you move in. For example, your renters’ lease expired and they moved
out two months ago, but you don’t retire for another two months and can’t
actually move in for three months. All in all, your second home will sit empty
for quite some time. You’d like to avoid letting it sit empty for too long. A
place empty for any length of time becomes more vulnerable to break-ins.
If your second home is going to stand empty for a while before you actually
move in, make sure you do the following to protect your investment:
 Tell your neighbors. The more trusted souls aware that your home is
vacant, the better.
 Advise your real estate agent and/or property manager about the
situation. Both of these support people should be aware that the home
will be vacant so they can help keep an eye on it for you. Even if you
haven’t spoken to your agent for a few years, you may want to keep him
in the loop.
 Give serious consideration to a monitored alarm system (if you don’t
already have one). This is a good investment. For a few hundred dollars
for equipment and installation charges, plus around $50 to $60 a month,
you can have great peace of mind while living off-site.
 Make it look like someone lives there. Leave a low-wattage light on, and
close any windows or blinds that, if left open, would clearly tell someone
with nefarious ideas that this is a vacant home.
During this “empty” time, check on the home regularly — at least once or
twice a month. If you can’t do that, have a trusted neighbor or a real estate
agent do it for you. This will help you nip any problems in the bud, instead of
having to deal with a pile of problems when you’re ready to move in.
I personally know of a condo owner who left his place vacant during
December and January — and forgot to leave the heat on (and no one checked
on the place). A pipe beneath the sink in the upstairs bathroom burst and
flooded the entire unit. By the time one of his neighbors noticed water run-
ning down the outside of the unit and from under the front door, extensive
damage had been done, ultimately requiring more than $100,000 in repairs.

Chapter 15: From Landlord to Resident 

Thinking about Remodeling
and Settling In
What once looked like the perfect place for you to live during your retirement
years may not be so perfect after you move in. That beach house may not
really have enough storage space after all your stuff is moved in. And those
“charming” old-fashioned faucets may quickly lose their charm when you
begin using them all the time.
Luckily, an entire industry has sprung up to serve people like you: people
who don’t want to build a new house from scratch to get a home that satisfies
their wants and needs.
You have several options when it comes to remodeling. These are the criteria
as to how things will get done:
 How much work can you do yourself?
 How much money can you budget for the work?
 How many “handy” friends and relatives do you have? And how easily
they can be coaxed (coerced? bullied? bribed?) into helping?
If you’re seriously considering upgrading or remodeling your second home
before you move in, this section can help by showing you how to take a
second home that may not be all that conducive to full-time living and trans-
forming it into a comfortable place to live.
Figuring out what you don’t like
about your second home
So you say your second home looked and felt perfect when you bought it,
and it worked out well for vacations, but now that you have to live there full
time, something (or, um, some things) just doesn’t seem right?
Does the following ring a bell?
 The bathrooms feel small and cramped.
 The kitchen appliances are outdated compared to the ones you had
“back home.”
 The deck is showing its age.
286
Part IV: Home, Sweet Home: Retiring to Your Second Home 

 You hate the doorbell.
 The old-fashioned windows are no longer quaint, and, instead, have
graduated to “very annoying” when you have to use them on a daily
basis.
 The closets aren’t big enough for all your stuff.
 You never noticed just how atrocious the carpet in the living room was.
 The paper towel holder in your old place was to the right of the kitchen
sink, and the action of reaching to the right for all those years is now
permanently imprinted on your brain — and it’s driving you crazy
because the paper towel holder in your new place is to the left of the
kitchen sink. (Of such trivialities are breakdowns born!)
If the preceding items really get under your skin and drive you bonkers, you
may need to consider upgrading, remodeling, or giving your second home a
series of adjustments. Your second home is now your primary home. This is
it. It’s no longer “out of sight, out of mind,” and so you need to do whatever is
necessary to make the place as comfortable and livable as possible.
The first step is to flip to Chapter 12 for more about how to go about under-
taking these types of projects no matter what your budget is. The same rules
there apply when you’re moving into your second home on a full-time basis,
so check out that basic info.
Understand that by making these modifications now, rather than later, you’ll
get years of enjoyment out of your new home right away. Instead of complain-
ing for years about the vinyl tile in the kitchen or lamenting about how you
wish the home’s deck were larger and better suited for entertaining, do some-
thing about it. You’ll be glad you did.
Living a happy life in your 
second home: A checklist
Need help turning that second home into a comfortable and inviting primary
home? This handy checklist of improvements and actions can help you
create the perfect “home zone” for you and your family:
 Clean the place up. If you were dealing with renters, you must take the
time to clean up after them. Renters are notorious for leaving places in
somewhat of a shambles on their way out the door. Renters will mar the
walls, mess up the carpeting, and put dings in your appliances. Paint the
place, replace the carpeting, and fix any damage before you move in, if at
all possible.
287
Chapter 15: From Landlord to Resident 

 Put a little money into it. There’s no need to break the bank, but a few
personal touches can make a rental property much more inviting and an
all-around homier place. Invest in a few new pieces of furniture (both
indoor and outdoor), replace those fake plants with real ones (because
you’ll now be on hand to water them), and take some other steps to
make the home your own. Now’s the time to bring out into the light of
day all that stuff you’ve kept hidden for years in the owner’s closet (that
locked closet where you stored private belongings that you didn’t want
your renters to use or have access to).
 Prepare yourself for the downsize. If you’re moving into a smaller
home, prepare yourself by bringing only those items that you truly can’t
live without. Put the rest in storage or sell the stuff on eBay or at a
garage sale (see Chapter 16). Otherwise, you’ll find yourself crowded by
piles of books, knick-knacks, accent tables, pillows, and antiques that
simply don’t fit in your new surroundings.
 Create a lifestyle around it. If the home you’re retiring to is more than a
few hours’ drive time from your previous home, you may find yourself
wanting for friends and family not long after moving away. To avoid this
woefulness, schedule time for your friends and family to visit you, and
also set up return visits “back home.” Also, don’t forget to get out and
make new friends in your new neighborhood (see Chapter 16).
 Tap your new area’s amenities. It’s easy to get caught up in remodeling
projects that take up 12 hours a day, but don’t forget to take some time
out to familiarize yourself with your surroundings, enjoy the sights,
decide on a favorite grocery store, and locate the closest movie theater,
museum, library, bookstore, and performing arts center. The sooner you
find a few favorite haunts, the quicker you’ll become acclimated and can
enjoy your new primary home.
Considering Important Income and Tax
Issues with Only One Residence
After you sell your primary home and move into your second home, you’ll be
free from having to pay two mortgages, two property tax bills, and two home-
owners’ insurance tabs every year. However, you’ll also be losing any rental
income that you’ve gotten used to over the years, as well as the tax deduc-
tions that were tied to the maintenance, upkeep, and insurance on your
second home.
So the bottom line is that your financial situation will almost certainly change
as a result of this move, so be sure to plan ahead. In this section, I advise you
on what key financial factors to consider before making your move.
288
Part IV: Home, Sweet Home: Retiring to Your Second Home 

Losing the rental income
One of the first things you’ll lose when you take your second home off the
rental market is those lovely rent checks you’ve become accustomed to find-
ing in your mailbox every month in exchange for letting others use your home.
As a second-home owner, you probably received a monthly rent check from a
full-time, year-round tenant; a stack of weekly and monthly rental checks
during the high season (and fewer checks during the low season); or a steady
stream of checks throughout the year from tenants who rented from you
during both the low and high seasons.
To offset your loss, keep the following pointers in mind:
 Make the time between the last rental and your moving date as short
as possible. That way you won’t have to cover two mortgages out of
your own bank account for any longer than necessary.
 Put your primary home on the market well in advance of the move.
Doing so assures that you’re not suddenly paying out-of-pocket for two
mortgages at once. (Yikes!)
 Prepare adequately for the day the final rent check arrives. Resolve
yourself to the fact that you knew the day would come when that flow of
checks would stop. Now it’s time to pay for the mortgage on your
second home (soon to be your first) on your own, without the help of a
rent check. Before you make the break, go over your financial situation
(income versus expenses) and be sure that you can cover the additional
expenses every month.
To counter the expected loss of rental income, consider the two possible
scenarios:
 The right way to do it: Give renters (or the real estate agent who is han-
dling the short-term rental schedule) 90 days’ notice to vacate your
property (or however long you’ve decided to give your renters, based
on the circumstances). Put your primary home on the market at the
same time. This way, you’ll have three (or more) months to sell your pri-
mary home, get your renters moved out, and get yourself moved in. (See
the “Giving your renters notice” section earlier in this chapter for more
details about this.)
If this sounds too rushed, depending on your individual circumstances
and your feelings toward your renters, add another month or two to the
schedule. If you’re in a hot real estate market and your house is guaran-
teed to sell within a week, then shorten the amount of time your house
is on the market.
289
Chapter 15: From Landlord to Resident 

 The painful way to do it: Decide overnight that it’s time to move, put
your primary home on the market the following day, and ask renters to
vacate within 30 days.
I have nothing against spontaneity, but this approach can backfire on
you pretty quickly and leave you stuck with an empty home in one hand
and a home — possibly still carrying a mortgage — that’s not selling in
the other. In that case, you’ll be standing there like blindfolded Lady
Justice herself, a mortgaged house on each side of the scale, and no way
to make things balance out.
Before you sell your primary home and move into your second home, give
your finances an honest look. Consider what you’re gaining and what you’re
losing, and make sure that things even out — or, ideally, work in your favor —
before you make your move. That will help you avoid nasty surprises down
the road.
Shifting your mortgage interest deduction
from your first home to your second home
One of the income tax perks American homeowners enjoy is the mortgage
interest deduction. (This deduction allows you to deduct the amount of mort-
gage interest paid to a lender in any given year. Check out Chapter 14 for
more info.) It’s so beneficial, in fact, that I know people who could easily pay
off their mortgages in one fell swoop but opt not to because then they would
miss out on the deduction.
But you’re different. As a second-home owner who was renting out your
home, you deducted the mortgage interest on your primary home on your
Schedule A, Itemized Deductions form, and the mortgage interest you paid on
your second home on your Schedule E, Supplemental Income and Loss form.
After you sell your primary home and move into your second home, this sce-
nario changes. Now the mortgage interest you pay on your former invest-
ment property becomes a Schedule A deduction and you no longer file
Schedule E — because you no longer have an income-producing property.
If you’re unsure of how to make the switch on your returns, check with your
accountant or tax attorney for details and the most current information
available.

Second Home
In This Chapter
 Selling your first home
 Using a reliable real estate agent
 Coordinating the sale with your second home move-in date
 Using home staging to your advantage
 Packing, moving, and figuring out what goes where
You’ve circled the date in red marker on your calendar, you think about it
every day, and you’re doing everything you can to prepare for that time
when your second home becomes your only home. But before you can make
that clean break, you need to sell your existing home.
Depending on the state of the current real estate market, the condition of
your home, and prevailing interest rates, selling your place could take as
little as a week or as long as a year or more. I know the idea of a year’s worth
of showings is not a pleasant thought, but it’s the reality of the cyclical real
estate market, so it’s important you know all the facts — and be prepared for
whatever comes your way.
In this chapter, I discuss the process of selling your first home and coordinat-
ing the selling/moving so you don’t have to rent an apartment for a month
while waiting for the tenants in your second home to move out. I also explain
home staging and how to use it to your best advantage so you’ll be ready for
the day the truck backs into your driveway to load up your stuff.

Putting Your Primary Home
on the Market
Exactly when you put your home on the market, and how you do it, can influ-
ence how quickly it sells and at what price. If, for example, you wait until the
last possible minute to sell — and if you opt to stick a FSBO (for sale by
owner) sign in the yard — you may wind up negotiating hard with a buyer
who knows that you’re in a rush and that you don’t have professional repre-
sentation who can provide the solid reasons to stay as close to your asking
price as possible. If, on the other hand, you plan your move carefully, work
with an agent, and give yourself plenty of time to mull offers and make a deci-
sion, then not only will the process be less stressful, but you can stick to
your asking price and not feel pressured to lower it because you’re in a hurry.
In this section, I discuss some of the basics that you need to know when sell-
ing your primary home. For a more detailed discussion of all these points,
pick up a copy of House Selling For Dummies, 2nd Edition, by Eric Tyson and
Ray Brown (Wiley).
Using a real estate agent
If you’ve lived in your neighborhood or city for any length of time, you prob-
ably know at least one real estate agent who would be happy to list your home
for sale. A real estate agent will hold open houses, advertise your home in the
paper, submit the listing to the local Multiple Listing Service, snap photos,
create virtual tours, and take other steps to get the home sold. Plus, she is
always there on the other end of the phone when you have questions.
Uncovering the right agent to sell your house
Finding the right real estate agent who can help you sell your primary home
is essential because they’re not all alike. Some have more experience than
others, some specialize in specific types of homes, some only sell commercial
properties, and some are in the real estate business as a part-time job (rather
than a full-time career). All this matters when it comes to deciding on who
will represent your home.
If you don’t know a real estate agent, ask friends and family for referrals, and
take a walk or drive around your neighborhood and check out the “For Sale”
yard signs. Make a note of which agents seem to be offering lots of homes in
the area. This is usually a good indication of which agents are best to work
with in a certain community or neighborhood. These folks know the area and
292
Part IV: Home, Sweet Home: Retiring to Your Second Home 

will likely be a big help to you. (Chapter 6 provides more info about how
agents work, how they’re paid, and what to expect from this temporary,
albeit very important relationship.)
After you have the names of a few real estate agents to contact, use this
handy list of questions to interview at least three agents to determine what
marketing efforts they use, their track record, and how you feel about work-
ing with them.
 Are you a full-time real estate agent? You don’t want to work with
someone who does real estate on the side. Why? Because it’s common
knowledge in the industry that the agent who isn’t at her clients’ beck
and call 24/7 doesn’t do the same volume of business as a full-timer, nor
does she have the extensive expertise and scope of experience that a
full-time agent does. Of course, there are part-time agents who are com-
petent, reliable, and professional, and I’m not knocking them. I’m simply
talking about opting for the most experienced agent, and they are almost
always the full-timers.
 How long have you been a licensed real estate agent? Try to get some-
one who has been in the business for five years or more. The longer,
the better.
 Are you an MLS (Multiple Listing Service) member? Today, most
agents are, but ask anyway. (The MLS is the database in which all the
agent-represented listings from a specific region are compiled.) Without
a listing on the MLS, your home won’t get the exposure you’ll want and
need to sell at the right price and within a desirable period of time.
 How familiar are you with my community and neighborhood?
Someone who doesn’t know the lay of the land probably isn’t a good
candidate because she won’t know what types of homes have sold there
recently, the differences between them, and the socioeconomic makeup
of the area (all families, lots of kids; all retired, no kids; lots of singles;
and so forth). If yours is the first home in the area she would be listing,
keep looking.
 How many homes did you sell in this area in the past year? The aver-
age is 12 homes per year, although most top-selling agents far exceed
that volume. Even during the slow times, a top-notch agent will move
properties, so don’t get hung up on the number of homes the agent has
sold, but rather that she has been selling, period.
 How frequently will you advertise and market my home? What Internet
sites will you list my home on? Will my home be highlighted with pictures,
a banner ad, and standout headers? Will you have a virtual tour of my
home on the Web site? Will it be listed on the MLS? Will you advertise it
in the newspaper? Will it be listed in local homes magazines? Will you
host an open house? How will you market my house to local agents? The
more exposure, the better. Skip an agent who skimps on advertising.
293
Chapter 16: Selling Your Primary Residence and Settling into Your Second Home

 How will you keep me apprised of my home’s selling progress? If you
like regular phone calls, ask for them. If you prefer e-mail, ask for those.
If the agent’s answer boils down to, “I’ll let you know when I have some-
thing to tell you, otherwise you’ll never hear from me,” move on.
 Can you give me the names of three of your recent clients to call for
references? If the agent hesitates, say “Next!”
If you find an agent who fills the bill and whom you feel comfortable with, the
next step is to sign a listing agreement with her. Most agents will ask for a six-
month listing period, although you may be able to get a three-month stint. It
doesn’t hurt to ask. The benefit of a shorter contract is that the agent will
know she may lose the listing at the end of the period if she’s not performing.
It’s a motivational tool. The downside is that moving from agent to agent
every three months until the house is sold doesn’t give you a chance to
develop a stable working relationship with any one agent. Twelve weeks go
by in a flash.
Negotiating your agent’s commission
Real estate commissions are negotiable and average about 5 percent nation-
wide. In some areas, they can go as high as 7 percent, and in others, they will
be as low as 3 percent. Talk to your agent about the “going rate” first, and
then negotiate down from there. Understand that agents usually have a “typi-
cal” commission rate in mind before they even start talking to you, and that
full-service agents (those who handle the entire deal — from listing the home
in the MLS to sitting next to you at the closing table) will probably insist on
their full rate (and justify it accordingly, sometimes with a list of 100 or more
tasks that they handle during the deal).
That said, however, you should definitely negotiate your agent’s real estate
commission, because the standard 6 or 7 percent rates don’t apply in all
areas anymore. Because of the Internet, there are no secrets about real estate
commissions these days, which in this case can work to your advantage. A
massive amount of industry information is available on the Web, and this has
led to the growth of discount brokers who will list homes at a very low rate.
Traditional agents are recognizing this competition, and yours may be willing
to lower her commission as a result.
The practice of discounting agent commissions has become so prevalent that
some agents are now putting the phrase “Full Service 3%” (or whatever rate
they charge) on their signs. I have seen these signs, and their presence truly
speaks to a sea change in the industry. Ten or 15 years ago, you would have
never seen a commission rate advertised on a “For Sale” sign.
If you decide to use a discount broker, be sure to check what services the
agent is offering you. Some states have recently adopted new disclosure laws
mandating a written disclosure of the services a discount broker is waiving
and the signed acknowledgement of these waivers by the seller.
294
Part IV: Home, Sweet Home: Retiring to Your Second Home 

Negotiating an agent’s commission is both a science and an art. You want to
shoot for an agreement that entices your agent to agree to the lower commis-
sion and yet still work just as hard for you. Both sides want the best possible
deal, so compromises are the tool when it comes to agreeing on a commis-
sion. Perhaps you find an agent you like, but you think her asking rate of 7
percent is too high. You base this opinion on what other agents are offering,
or on the fact that Internet and discount brokers charge considerably less
than their full-service counterparts. Talk to your agent about her commis-
sion. Maybe you offer her 3 percent. That’s too low for her liking, so you split
the difference and settle on 5 percent. Everybody’s happy.
If, however, you’re adamant about a 3 percent commission, and the agent
simply refuses to work for that low a rate, then shake hands and say, “Thanks
for your time” and find a discount broker. Bear in mind, though, that a stub-
born attitude about fee ignores lots of other variables that are important,
including the skills and experience of the agent. It’s a cliché, but in many
cases, you do get what you pay for.
295
Chapter 16: Selling Your Primary Residence and Settling into Your Second Home
Advice from every direction on setting
your asking price
Where does the asking price on a home come
from? How do you figure out what to ask? Prices
come from many different sources — and some
of these sources are not quite as knowledge-
able and informed as others. For example:
 Your real estate agent: You should give her
suggestion for a selling price great weight.
Why? Because a savvy agent will generally
not take on an over-priced homestead if she
can help it. Her suggested price is usually
based on actual sales of comparable homes
in the area within the past year.
 The guy next door: He swears his home
(which is almost identical to the one you’re
selling) is worth $750,000, so your home
must be worth at least that.
 A professional appraiser: This person
comes in and does a thorough, presale
evaluation of the home’s condition and size
and then compares it to recent sales. His
price is probably the most accurate number
possible.
 A well-meaning parent: Your mom and dad
think your home is worth much, much more
than the market will bear because, after all,
you are incredibly special and that unques-
tionably applies to everything in your life —
including the value of your home.
 A free Web site: Sites such as www.
zillow.com provide home values for
properties nationwide by street address.
With a few clicks, you can find out what the
house next door, across town, or across the
country is worth based on prior sales. It’s a
valuable tool but not always spot-on
regarding realistic values in terms of selling
prices.

FSBO: Selling your home on your own
If you’ve already bought or sold a home without the help of an agent, then
you may want to stick a FSBO sign in the front yard and wait for potential
buyers to come to your door. This is the for-sale-by-owner approach, and it’s
a strategy that many homeowners have opted for with good results.
It’s not for everyone, but if you’re game, just realize that when you go FSBO,
you’re your own agent, so to speak. With that comes all the work an agent
would do for you, from showings and advertising to dealing with a potential
buyer’s real estate agent. However, if you’ve got the time, energy, and motiva-
tion, you can try it alone for a while and then call an agent if it doesn’t work
out for you.
It’s a simple enough process to get started: Put the sign on your lawn. Then
you can craft an advertising plan and prepare for potential buyers to get in
touch. Make sure you’ve got plenty of time carved out for a few months when
you go the FSBO route.
Considering important issues when selling
Whether you use a real estate agent or you sell your primary home on your
own, you want to make sure you maximize your profit. You obviously don’t
want to lose money when you sell your place. At the same time, you also
want to give yourself enough time to list your house, sell it, and move to your
second home. As a result, you need to consider the following questions that
can help you determine when you should put your home on the market.
When should you list your home?
Figuring out when exactly to list your home is a fine line to walk. If you list it
too quickly and it sells while you still have tenants renting your second
home, you may have to rent some temporary living space for yourself until
your renters move out. If you wait to list your home until your tenants have
moved out, and then it takes a long time to sell, you can put yourself in a
financial pinch by having to pay two mortgages without any rental income
coming in. No matter what, make sure you give yourself at least a 90-day
window to sell your home.
So how do you walk this fine line? First, take a careful look at your local real
estate market. Ask your agent for the latest news on the following points
before you put your place on the market:
296
Part IV: Home, Sweet Home: Retiring to Your Second Home 

 How quickly are homes selling right now? Your agent can answer this
question by checking the “days on market” numbers provided by the
local MLS. FSBO sellers can get the most recent quarter or year’s infor-
mation from their local Board of Realtors. Find a listing of them at the
National Association of Realtors Web site (www.realtors.org).
 How close to asking price are these homes selling for? This is an
important point for anyone looking to score the maximum price within a
specific or limited time frame.
After you have the answers to these questions, look at Table 16-1 to figure out
which of the four categories your home falls into.

if you can
Based on market conditions, the advice of your agent, and your sense of how
“in demand” your home will be when it hits the market (and you will develop
this sense, trust me), you’ll then need to decide on a time frame that meets
your needs, but still works within the inevitable market forces that affect
selling time, price, and your peace of mind.
If, for example, the market right now is favorable for sellers, and if you don’t
want to move out for another six months, then you’ll want to put your house
on the market in about two months. This gives your agent about 16 weeks to
find a suitable buyer and close the deal, which should be plenty of time.

Chapter 16: Selling Your Primary Residence and Settling into Your Second Home

What if you sell your primary home before your 
second home is available?
Face it: Moving twice is a pain. So it’s to your best advantage to try to time it
so you sell your primary home and immediately move into your second
home. But sometimes the right offer comes at the wrong time. What happens
if your home sells more quickly than you anticipated, and your second home
isn’t ready for you? You can’t exactly tell the prospective buyer, “no thanks,”
shrug off the situation, and wait for a similar offer to come along later when
you are ready to move.
When you put your house on the market, you take the risk of having it sold
before you’re actually ready to move out. Sometimes this may be out of your
control (the buyer’s timetable figures into this, too, remember), but in many
cases you can avoid this situation through good planning to figure out the
best time to list your house. If you score a buyer and you’re not ready to
move, you can always consider short-term rental options or even bunking
with family temporarily until your second home is available to you. (For infor-
mation on how to prepare your second home and its tenants for your move-in
date, flip to Chapter 15.)
If you do find yourself in this circumstance, you have to make a quick deci-
sion. You have to figure out what to do with your personal belongings and
furniture — as well as yourself — while you wait for your second home to be
ready for occupancy. You can
 Put your stuff in mini-storage for $60 to $80 a month and stay with a
friend or relative. This solution is only short term. This plan works best
for second-home owners whose place will be ready in under a month.
 Rent an apartment short term. If you have to wait longer than a month
or two, you can move into an apartment and take your essential stuff
with you. You can put the rest of your belongings in a mini-storage facil-
ity. Short-term storage is great, and you can use it as a staging area for
when you finally do move.
Ideally, the length of time you have to wait to move into your second home
won’t exceed a month or two. Longer that that can make everyone testy.
How to determine whether to hold off on selling?
Although you’re eager to move into your second home, sometimes you may
want to wait to sell your primary home. For many, this option may be finan-
cially unrealistic, but for others, carrying two mortgages while the situation
settles won’t be a problem. Another option is to rent out your primary home
and move to your second home, thus ensuring that you continue to generate
rental income to cover at least one of your mortgages.

Part IV: Home, Sweet Home: Retiring to Your Second Home 

Everyone’s situation is different, so here are a few scenarios that may war-
rant putting your home-selling plans in a holding pattern:
 The real estate market is on the upswing: If your agent tells you that
home prices have increased 10 percent in the last three months, and
that there’s no end in sight, you should seriously consider selling at a
later date. Set a target “For Sale” date based on your own timetable and
finances. Keep your eyes open, though, and monitor the real estate
market to avoid waiting too long and coming in at the tail end of the
boom.
 The real estate market is tanking: If you know you’ll take a loss on your
home because the market has tanked, then hold off on selling during this
period if at all possible. The market is cyclical, and it will bounce back at
some point. It always does. How long you wait depends on what stage
the market is at, so ask your real estate agent for some “from the front
lines” advice on this one.
 You’re unsure about the move into your second home: If you feel that
you need a “trial run” at your second home, and if you can afford both
mortgages and the associated expenses for a while, then by all means,
wait to put out that “For Sale” sign. Be sure, though, to give yourself three
to six months to get acclimated to your new place before you go running
back home! If, after that period, you’re still not happy there, then you’ll
know you made the right decision not to sell your primary home.

Chapter 16: Selling Your Primary Residence and Settling into Your Second Home
Be careful about rushing into selling your home
Before you rush into selling your home, you may
want to take a deep breath and think twice. I
learned a valuable lesson a few years ago.
After I saw a large home for sale at the right
price in a prestigious neighborhood, I made an
offer and it was accepted. The sellers were in a
rush, so the home closed within ten business
days. On the other side of the move, my husband
stuck a “For Sale” sign in the front yard of our
existing home and sold it to a neighbor within an
hour. Yes, I said within an hour: By the time I got
back from the gym on a Sunday morning, the
house was sold. To make things even more
complicated, we were leaving for a one-month
vacation in Hawaii in two weeks, so both trans-
actions had to be wrapped up — at the seller
and buyer’s requests, not mine — quickly. It all
worked out, though, and 14 days later my family
and I were on a big bird flying to Honolulu.
The moral of the story is this: When you find the
right home — or, if you’re selling, the right
buyer — go for it. Four years later I have no
regrets. Sure, it was an insane two-week period
of closing table visits and moving vans, but in
the end, it was all worth it.

Your real estate agent is in business to sell homes, so don’t rely solely on him
to answer the question “Should I sell now?” with your best interest in mind.
The odds are you’ll hear, “Sure! Let’s talk turkey!” Be sure to talk to other reli-
able sources, and look at the market and your situation carefully before sign-
ing that listing agreement.
Getting the Best Possible Price
Every seller wants the highest possible price for his home, and every buyer
wants to pay the lowest possible price for the house she’s buying. And as
with all things, compromise is the name of the game. Working on opposite
sides of the table, eager buyers and motivated sellers will slowly come to
terms, hopefully creating a win-win situation for both parties.
In this section, I provide you with a few strategies to boost your home’s value
in the eyes of potential buyers. I also offer some tips on how to handle price
reductions.
Determining a competitive price
When selling your primary home, do everything you can to score the best pos-
sible price for your place. Develop a close relationship with your real estate
agent, communicate your needs, and take a proactive role. Do the following
to ensure that you get top dollar for your home:
 Conduct the necessary research (or have your real estate agent do it
for you). You want to determine what homes of the same size, age, and
in the same general location are selling for. This will give you a good idea
of exactly what is selling and for what price.
 Verify that your house is “up to par” with those other homes before
you decide on an asking price and post it on the MLS. This will help
you see exactly where your home will stand on the market.
As always, market conditions come into play. In a hot market, you may get
away with selling a home at top dollar as is, even if it’s in sore need of a paint
job and new carpeting. In a flat market, however, that won’t be as easy, and in
a declining market, it’ll be even more difficult. Keep all of this in mind as you
put your home up for sale. (See the “When should you list your home?”
section, earlier in this chapter, for more about the types of markets.)

Part IV: Home, Sweet Home: Retiring to Your Second Home 

Sprucing up your home
Real estate agents have been sprucing up homes and making helpful sugges-
tions since the industry was born, but over the last few years, home staging
has really caught on. Home staging is the deliberate sprucing up of a home to
make it visually appealing to potential buyers. This includes steps like plant-
ing flowers in the front yard; removing clutter in each room; replacing drab
bed coverings with new, attractive ones; replacing clunky old furniture with
better-looking pieces; opening blinds, curtains, and shades during a showing;
and adding stylish planters to the bathrooms and foyer. The focus is on
space, light, color, and comfort.
Don’t think you have to stage your home all at once. Make a few key changes,
and then wait for agents to provide feedback from buyers after showings. For
example, if more than one looker comments on the two small holes in the
screen door, it’s time to get it fixed.
Keep the following basics of home staging in mind as you prepare your home
for sale. Just call them the three Cs:
 Cleanliness: Your home needs to be clean before you show it. To clean it
properly, either hire a cleaning service or spend the weekend going from
room to room cleaning any and all surfaces, floors, fixtures, bathtubs,
ceiling fans . . . the list goes on.
If your home needs a thorough top-to-bottom, every-nook-and-cranny
cleaning, hire a cleaning service. The money will be well spent.
 Clutter-free: Pack up as much of your stuff as you can and put it in stor-
age. One person’s treasure is another person’s clutter. You want to high-
light your home and its architectural features, not your junk.
301
Chapter 16: Selling Your Primary Residence and Settling into Your Second Home
The mother of home staging
Barb Schwarz, president of StagedHomes.com
of San Francisco, came up with the idea of stag-
ing homes. Schwarz says she invented staging
back in 1972 before anyone had assigned a
label to the “home prep” process.
Today, Schwarz holds the registered trademark
on the word “stage” as it pertains to preparing
homes for sale. She speaks often on the subject
and, in 1998, developed an Accredited Staging
Professional (ASP) course. The two-day course
costs $295 and provides classroom-based
instruction on anything and everything having
to do with home staging.
For more info, check out www.staged
homes.com.

 Color: A few $5 cans of paint can make a significant difference in a
home’s appearance. You’d be amazed at the results you can get from a
few coats of color. It’s one of the cheapest DIY investments on today’s
real estate market!
By taking these relatively simple preemptive measures, you can effectively
boost your home’s value and make it stand out in a way that makes buyers sit
up and take notice. Some of these projects can be completed for free, and in
just a few hours, while others will take more time and effort. In the end,
though, the time and energy you spend will be worth the effort when the
offers start coming in — and they’re as close to your asking price as the
market will bear!
Compromising on the price
Your primary house is on the market, and you’ve done everything you can to
ensure that you maximize your profit. However, sometimes you may need to
compromise on your asking price if you really want to sell.
Ideally, you don’t have to consider lowering the price until the negotiation
stage. That’s when you and the buyer negotiate, either one on one or through
your respective agents, to come to an agreement on both selling price and
terms.
Depending on the market, though, this compromise may come before you
even receive an offer. For example, say that ten couples have walked through
your place during the course of a month and you haven’t received a single
offer. Barring any other unforeseen factors, you may need to lower your price
to a level that the market will bear.
Before you decide to compromise on the price, consider exactly why lower
(or no) offers are coming in and what you can do about it. Listen to feedback
from those who have walked through the house, pick your agent’s brain (if
you’re using one), and use all this info to make smart decisions about how to
improve the look and feel of your abode. This may help you get closer to
your asking price. Of course, market forces will play a huge role, but you
should work to make your house worth what you’re asking. Then it’ll simply
be a decision as to how much less you’re willing to accept, knowing that
you’ve done all you can to maximize its perceived value.
Your real estate agent will probably ask you to review your asking price every
four to six weeks and will likely ask you to reduce the price by 5 to 10 percent
each time, again, depending on market conditions. If the house is in beautiful
shape and in a hot market, you may not have to come down in price. But if
the house isn’t showing well, as we say in the biz, plus you’re trying to sell in
a faltering market, then you may need to reduce your price.

Looking good = $$$
One real estate agent I know shares the follow-
ing tips with his home sellers whenever they ask
him, “What can I do to get the best price for my
property?” (Thanks, pal!)
Outside
 Put a new doormat at the home’s entry.
 Put up a new mailbox and post, especially if
yours is ratty or aged.
 Add mulch to your flower beds and around
shrubs.
 Paint, stain, or varnish the front door, polish
the brass, and install a new brass kick plate.
Foyer
 Make sure it’s clean and not cluttered with
furniture.
 Clean the light fixtures.
 Clean and polish the hardwood or tile floor
until it shines.
 Add a small entrance table and a vase filled
with fresh flowers.
Family/living/great room
 Put away all your collections, especially the
fragile items such as pewter, crystal, or
ceramic figurines.
 Store all political and religious mementos,
as well as any business, sports, and per-
sonal awards. Remember: You want
prospective buyers to easily imagine them-
selves, not you, living in the home.
 Remove as much “crowding” furniture as
possible; open the room up and show lots of
space.
Use the “rule of three:” Place no more than
three items on any flat surface. This rule
applies to every room in the house.
Dining room
 Take the extra leaf out of the table and put
on a nice white tablecloth.
 Place a pretty fruit or flower arrangement in
the center of the table.
Kitchen
 Remove all refrigerator magnets and “bul-
letin board” items.
 Take down your grandchildren’s artwork.
(Yes, I know you have some up there!)
 Stow in the cabinets all the smaller appli-
ances that you normally leave out to free up
counter space. Remember: space, space,
space.
Bathrooms
 Downplay that dated ceramic tile with white
towels, pretty window treatments, and col-
orful scatter rugs.
 Replace a rusted sink or, if that’s not poss-
ible, touch up the rust spots.
 Repair or replace that defective exhaust fan
or any cracked mirrors.
Bedrooms
 Remove as much bulky furniture as poss-
ible. Voilà! The room looks bigger!
 Clean out the closets so it appears as if
there’s lots of room to spare.
Garage/basement
 Remove as many stains as possible from
the garage floor.
 Clean all the windows.
 Remove the cobwebs from the corners.
(Yes, you have some. Trust me.)
Screened porch
 Repair all the holes in the screens, or
replace the screens completely.
 Make sure that your outdoor furniture is
clean and orderly and that the porch isn’t
overcrowded with tables and chairs.

Discuss all of your options and alternatives before reducing your price.
Lowering your asking price indicates to potential buyers that you’re more
motivated to sell and that you may settle for an even lower price — even
though you’ve already decided you’re as low as you’re going to go. Depend
on the guidance of your real estate agent or another professional to deter-
mine which strategy will work best in your particular situation.
Moving Your Stuff
Moving an entire home from one place to another is disruptive, stressful, con-
fusing, tedious, but it can also be worth all the hassle. When planning to
move to your second home, you have plenty of decisions to make and factors
to consider. For example, what are you going to do with your furniture and
clothing, as well as household items and all that stuff that has piled up in the
garage, and in the basement, and in the attic, and in the closets over the last
few years? (And believe me when I tell you that you will ask yourself — more
than once — “Where did all this stuff come from?!”)
In this section, I give you some handy tips for packing up your primary home
and moving everything to your second abode. I show you why list making is a
good thing, tell you what to move yourself, and advise you on when you need
to hire a mover. Also, I walk you through a handy moving-day checklist that
will be a big help when you make your own move.
Purge what you don’t need
Are you ready to jump into packing everything? Do you have tons of boxes
and bubble wrap to protect your items? Before you do anything about your
upcoming move, start with a big inhale, hold it, and then slowly exhale. Now
it’s time to start cracking. I want to reiterate the most important packing
lesson I can offer you: Purge before you pack. That means throwing out, sell-
ing, or giving away everything that you no longer need or want.
Purging is particularly important if you already have a fully furnished second
home to move into, because you simply won’t need to duplicate all those end
tables and dining room chairs that are already in place at your new home.
Determining what to purge
You know you have a lot of extra junk and stuff that you don’t want to move,
but how can you determine what to purge and what to keep? Work your way
through your house, room by room, and consider the following:
304
Part IV: Home, Sweet Home: Retiring to Your Second Home 

 Will this actually fit in my second home? If you’re downsizing, it may
not, so now may be a good time to get rid of it.
 Will it match the décor in my second home? This may not be that big a
deal, but you should think about it. A heavy, ornate, dark wood
Elizabethan armoire may not look very good in the sunroom of a beach
house, for example.
 Is this something that I really want to keep? Items with sentimental
value will ultimately be given a pass regarding their likely “fit” — regard-
less of whether they match the rest of the décor. Grandma’s mahogany
accent table may be jarringly out of place in your new contemporary
condo, but so what?
 Is this something that I can sell at a garage sale or easily dispose of in
another way? If you know a particular piece would be snapped up if
offered for sale, you may want to consider saying bye-bye to it.
 Is this an old item that should have been replaced years ago? If your
answer is “It sure is!”, then bite the bullet and put it out on the curb or
schlep it to the dump.
 Is this something that I haven’t touched in years, and that I probably
won’t touch or use for at least another five years? If your answer is, “I
forgot I even had this thing!”, then chuck it.
As you evaluate your belongings, put each item on a “yes,” “no,” or “maybe”
list. Items on the “yes” list will get a new home; stuff on the “no” list is outta
here (see the “What to do with your purged items” section for suggestions);
and things on the “maybe” list just may get a second chance.
When you create your “yes” list, organize items by room. Have one page for
the kitchen, another for the family room, and so forth. Then whoever is pack-
ing up each room can use the appropriate list as a reference.
Taking the plunge and purging your stuff
In the previous section, I suggested making lists of what to keep, what to toss,
and what you weren’t sure what to do with. Your lists will help you speed
through the purging process:
1. Grab some boxes, decide where each one will go (see the next sec-
tion), and mark it accordingly.
You don’t want any of the stuff you’ve already said adios to making an
appearance at your second home, so it’s especially important to label
each box’s end destination.
2. Take your “no-go” list and go through the attic, garage, every closet
and cabinet, the kitchen, bedrooms, bathrooms, and outdoor spaces
gathering up what didn’t make the cut.
305
Chapter 16: Selling Your Primary Residence and Settling into Your Second Home

3. Put items in their appropriate boxes.
You don’t have to pack things by room when you purge. You can put all
of your too-big clothes, the kids’ old but useable toys, and that old iron
in one box for Goodwill; put all of your unwanted books, video games,
and DVDs in a box for your brother; and so on.
You can approach the purge process with enthusiasm — “Yay! Look at all the
stuff I’m getting rid of (and maybe I can buy new, better stuff).” — or you can
tackle it with sadness — “I’m gonna miss you, little Valentine’s Day card from
1983.” Either way, when you start moving boxes, ultimately you’ll be glad that
you decided not to save everything.
The kitchen is always the hardest room to pack, because you have to individu-
ally wrap all the breakable items (and there are, my friends, lots of breakable
items in every kitchen!). By purging what you don’t want, you’ll have a much
easier time packing up whatever remains when the time comes to do so.
What to do with your purged items
When you purge, you may be wondering what to do with all this extra stuff
that you don’t need or want. Well, you can
 Donate it. Groups like the Vietnam Veterans of America (online at
www.vva.org) have a presence in most cities nationwide. These groups
pick up household items, clothing, toys, games, and other items that you
may not need or want but are still in good condition. They’ll usually
come right to your doorstep to pick up the goods. These types of groups
typically work on a schedule — they pick up in certain neighborhoods
on specific days — so contact your local chapter for more information.
Be sure to ask for a receipt. Your donations are tax deductible!
 Give it to friends and family. If you’re moving from Massachusetts
to Florida, you can probably get rid of much of your winter clothing,
although you’ll want to keep a few important garments for visits up
north.
 Sell it. If you wind up with enough good stuff to sell, you can put it in the
local classifieds, list it on eBay, or have a garage sale. Don’t ignore this
way to raise a few bucks (it’s even possible to generate enough cashola
to fund your entire move) and unload some still-useable merchandise at
the same time.
 Store it. You may have some items that you absolutely want to keep, but
that you don’t need right away and that won’t fit into your new home,
such as that extra set of golf clubs, your luggage set(s), and that extra-
long surfboard. Mini-storage at $60 to $80 a month is a good option.
 Throw it away. That exercise bike with the broken chain that you’ve
sworn you’ll get fixed must go. You know you’ll never fix it, and even
when it was working, you know you never rode it.
306
Part IV: Home, Sweet Home: Retiring to Your Second Home 

Don’t try to pack absolutely everything and then try to figure out what to
keep, what to give away, what to toss, and so on when you get to your new
home. This strategy will drive you crazy and add to the stress and confusion
that comes with a major move. Instead, take the time to figure out early pre-
cisely what you want to do with your stuff.
Packing what you plan to keep
After you’ve decided the fate of most, if not all, of your belongings (see the
“Purge what you don’t need” section), use your “yes” list to start packing the
furniture, household goods, clothing, personal goods, and decorations that
you want to take with you.
Furniture is usually transported as is, or it can be wrapped in plastic for pro-
tection. How far it’s traveling, in what type of vehicle, and just how valuable
the item is will determine how you pack and ship it.
If you want to save your sanity, take a pencil and paper and make a scale
drawing of each of the important rooms in your second home. Then measure
the furniture you want to take with you and draw it in place on the appropri-
ate room’s page. Doing so not only assures you that the furniture will fit, but
it will be a helpful guide when marking each piece and identifying it for the
movers so they’ll know which room to place it in at the new location.
You can pack the rest of your stuff in cardboard boxes (mini-storage facilities
sell them for $3 to $6 a box, depending on size), or place items in large plastic
totes (which come in all sizes but are a bit more expensive than boxes, rang-
ing from $8 to $15 each).
As you pack your boxes, write on them what they contain and the room
they’ll go in at your new home. This way, when you and/or your movers get
there, the boxes and items can be immediately placed right where they
belong. Use a marker and masking tape (for totes and other items) or write
directly on the cardboard boxes that you’re transporting.
When you come to an item that’s on your “maybe” list, put it aside until you
figure out whether you’ll have room for it. Take a second look at all the items
at that point, and choose those that you truly want before putting them in the
back of the van. Be hardhearted.
Moving yourself or hiring movers?
Whether you move all your belongings yourself or hire someone to help you
depends on the following factors:
307
Chapter 16: Selling Your Primary Residence and Settling into Your Second Home

 How far away you’re moving
 How much stuff needs to be moved
 How many friends and family you have (on both sides of the family
and both ends of the trip) who are willing to help you load and unload
the items
 Whether there are impediments (such as flights of stairs or elevators)
on either end of the move
 Your own personal preference about hiring someone to do a job versus
doing it yourself (Control freaks, you know who you are!)
If you’re a do-it-yourselfer by nature, then by all means, rent the appropriate-
size moving truck and start loading it up. (The number of rooms that you’re
moving determines truck size.)
If you’re moving a relatively short distance, or in some cases, even to another
state, doing it yourself is probably the most economical (but not necessarily
the fastest) way to get the job done. If you’re transporting heavy, bulky furni-
ture, though, you’re better off with a pro.
If you’re moving a far distance and taking everything, hiring a professional
mover can make moving easier. Movers fall into two categories:
 Short-haul or “small” movers: These folks usually work locally, moving
people within a 10-mile radius (give or take a few miles) of their home
base. These are the outfits that are usually local, and the company name
is often a first or family name, like “Mike’s Moving,” or “Smith Brothers
Moving.”
To find these types of movers, check your local Yellow Pages, or use a
Web site like www.emove.com, which will provide you with a list of
short-haul movers in your area.
 Long-haul movers: These companies do exactly what it sounds like they
do — they move residences and companies over long distances. Rates
vary for their services, and you should get a quote from at least three
companies before deciding on one to hire for your move.
These types of companies are also listed in the Yellow Pages, or you can
check out a Web site like www.moving.com for more information on
how to find a mover, get a rate quote, and hire a company to help you.
Moving companies offer a variety of services that go beyond just picking up
and dropping off goods. For example, most also offer the following services
for an additional fee:
 Packing up your primary home
 Unpacking at your second home
308
Part IV: Home, Sweet Home: Retiring to Your Second Home 

 Disassembling and assembling furniture and other items
 Storage facilities
 Cleaning services
 Rearranging homes and apartments
 Other services related to the home and moving
Check with the moving company you hire about these extra services and take
advantage of them if you have the budget for it and if doing so will remove
some of the pressure and make for a smoother transition to your new home.
If you do use a moving company, also look into insuring your goods.
If you’re moving into a second home in a foreign country, you should inter-
view several moving companies and discuss the move in detail with them. A
good place to start is the Web site 123Movers.com (www.123movers.com).
There, you can plug in your zip code and the country you’re moving to and
get quotes from ten different companies. They also offer tips on international
moving, one of which is “Let the pros pack your stuff.” The distance and time
makes it wise to not do it yourself.
309
Chapter 16: Selling Your Primary Residence and Settling into Your Second Home
Get covered when you move
If you’ve decided to hire a moving company to
move your household, be sure to buy an ade-
quate amount of short-term insurance protec-
tion for your goods. Your options include:
 Basic liability: This coverage insures your
household contents at 60 cents per pound,
per item, no matter what its actual value. (In
other words, don’t expect your gold and dia-
monds to be fully covered under this pro-
tection.) This type of coverage is usually
free and is provided by the mover as part of
his fee.
 Declared value protection: This covers the
replacement value of any lost or damaged
items, minus the depreciation of those
items. Your cost will be based on either the
declared weight, per-pound value of the
goods or their lump-sum value.
 Replacement coverage: This covers the
cost of replacing an item at today’s price.
This insurance is more expensive and
should be used only for expensive items
that would be costly to replace. A Gibson
classical acoustic guitar that’s appreciated
in value ten times since you purchased it
would be an example of something you
might want to protect with replacement
coverage.
Be sure to talk to your mover about the cover-
age he provides, and then your insurance agent
about taking out any additional coverage that
you need to protect your home’s contents
during the move.

Moving day: A checklist
Your moving day doesn’t have to be the worst experience in your life. If you
go into moving day with a plan (and another list), you can make the experi-
ence a lot less stressful and not quite as painful. To make your moving day
just a tad smoother, keep this handy checklist close by.
 Carve out the time. Set aside one or more days to complete the entire
move.
 Buy some refreshments. Keep an ample supply of beverages and snacks
on hand for yourself plus anyone else who is helping you move.
Chocolate is also a good idea for that midday slump.
 Be considerate. Don’t block your neighbor’s mailbox with the moving
truck. Try not to leave furniture out on the driveway too long. Pick up
any trash resulting from the move. Basically, put yourself in your next-
door neighbor’s position and act accordingly.
 Have the directions ready. If you’ve only flown to your second home
and never driven to it, when moving day arrives, be sure to bring along a
map or a printout from a site like MapQuest (www.mapquest.com)
showing door-to-door directions to your new home.
 Pack your plants carefully. Find a place for these valued family mem-
bers before you pull out of the driveway. Pots can be inserted in card-
board boxes and wedged into the car or truck in a way that prevents
them from moving during transit.
 Make appropriate arrangements for pets and children. Kids and ani-
mals can be thrown off kilter by major life changes like moving. Make it
easier for them by having some of their favorite things in the car they’ll
be traveling in, as well as ample snacks, drinks, and toys to keep them
occupied during the trip.
 Clean out your primary home completely. Try to avoid leaving the
place in disarray. You can hire someone to do this if you don’t want to
clean up after you’re all packed.
 Offer to reciprocate. If friends and family are helping you with the
move, be sure to offer your services for a future move. (And a little gift
later would be a nice touch, too.)
 Tip the mover. If you use a mover, make sure you tip him. (Check out
the preceding section, “Moving yourself or hiring movers?”.) The
amount is up to you, but when you get to your second home you should
tip the individual movers a certain amount to show your appreciation
(that is, of course, if you feel they deserve it!).
310
Part IV: Home, Sweet Home: Retiring to Your Second Home 

 Embrace the experience. The move itself will be over within a day or
two, and within a few weeks, your life will be back to normal. Keep this
in mind as you huff and puff your way up those stairs with a heavy tele-
vision in your arms — and when you’re tempted to snap at someone out
of stress. As the Tao tells us, “Go with the flow!”
Making Your Second Home
Feel like Home
You have been to your second home numerous times, and you’re familiar
with the surroundings. But living there is something entirely different. Your
second home is now your primary home. To help make that transition as
seamless as possible, keep the following in mind:
 Make your arrival stress free by planning ahead. Planning ahead
includes packing one or two “must have” boxes and making sure you
know where they are on the moving truck. In them, pack the essentials,
such as bedding, utensils, toilet paper, towels, and such. (Check out the
earlier section, “Moving Your Stuff” for more packing info.)
 Get a good night’s sleep the first night. For many of you, your second
home won’t really be a new place, because you’ve likely spent many
nights there already. But no matter whether it’s your first night in your
new primary home, or your 100th, it will be different. To get your mind
off the moving and upcoming unpacking (even for a few hours; remem-
ber those boxes will be there in the morning), try to get some rest.
Pack some backup bedding so you know that you’ll have at least a mod-
icum of sleeping comfort in case your beds go AWOL. Don’t forget the
sheets, blankets, and pillows; pack the following and make sure you
have easy access to them:
• Inexpensive exercise mats: These roll up, are padded, and are
more than adequate for a few nights’ sleep. Find them in any major
department store that has a sporting goods department.
• Air beds: These are more expensive but are also much more com-
fortable and are as close to a real mattress as you’re going to get.
They’re used in camping (the ones that can inflate off a battery-
powered pump) and, after use, can be deflated and stored away
until needed again.
• Quilts: A super-thick winter quilt can make a comfy sleeping sur-
face in a pinch.
311
Chapter 16: Selling Your Primary Residence and Settling into Your Second Home

 Put creature comforts first. Having a few of your favorite things in your
new home can make the transition go much more smoothly. Before you
dive into unpacking that box of silverware that was last used when Aunt
Bernice was over for dinner — three years ago — consider what you
really need to be comfortable in your new surroundings.
 Unpack all those boxes. Wading through a sea of boxes is no fun and
can easily make you feel overwhelmed. The following can help you make
the unpacking process just a tad bit easier and a little less harried:
1. Put your furniture in place first before unpacking any boxes.
Doing so gets the big stuff into the home first. It also helps you
avoid having to navigate piles of smaller boxes and items the way
you’d have to if you left the furniture for later.
2. Organize as much as possible during the move.
Instruct your moving folks (whether they’re hired pros or four of
your wonderfully burly and charitable cousins) to put the labeled
boxes where they belong in your new home.
3. Unpack by priority.
Start with the bathroom, the bedrooms, the kitchen, the living
room, and then the rest of the house. In the bathroom, make sure
you unpack toilet paper, soap, and a towel first.
 Meet or get reacquainted with the neighbors. Try to take some time to
meet your neighbors, especially if you haven’t been vacationing regu-
larly there over the last few years and you’re essentially new to the area.
If you’ve met the neighbors before, go over and get reacquainted if you
haven’t recently used your second home. Knowing the folks around you
can provide a sense of security. Neighbors typically watch out for one
another. This is a great comfort when you go away and your place is
empty for a week or two at a time.

for the Future
In This Chapter
 Using reverse mortgages
 Changing your ownership arrangement
 Passing on your property . . . when the time comes
I
f you sold your first home, then your second home is now your primary
home. As you look toward a long and happy retirement, you want to make
sure you protect your investment while you’re still alive, as well as after you
pass on.
This chapter looks at specific situations that you may encounter after you’ve
retired to your second home. I explain how you can revitalize your future and
tap into your home’s equity with a reverse mortgage. I also discuss ways you
can protect your second home, including changing the ownership structure
and passing it along to your heirs.
Considering Reverse Mortgages
as a Source of Income
During your retirement years, you may find yourself living on somewhat of a
stretched income. You aren’t working 40-plus hours a week and bringing in a
regular salary. You may have limited retirement money and find that living on
Social Security checks and your small pension isn’t enough.
If you find yourself in this situation, you may want to consider a reverse
mortgage as another financing tool for your retirement years. With a reverse
mortgage, if you’re 62 or older and your home is fully or almost fully paid for,

314
Part IV: Home, Sweet Home: Retiring to Your Second Home 
you can get cash — a monthly payment or a lump sum — in return for a mort-
gage for part of the equity in the home. The property is used as security for
the loan, and the reverse mortgage is paid off when the home is sold or when
the owner passes away.
In this section, I talk about how this tool works. Reverse mortgages are some-
what complicated financial products. If, after reading this section, you want
more details, pick up Reverse Mortgages For Dummies by Sarah Glendon
Lyons and John E. Lucas (Wiley).
Tapping into equity to live
In order to tap equity in your home, you have to have equity in the home —
preferably plenty of it. So if your (second) home is mostly paid for, you, Ms.
Homeowner, may decide to go for a reverse mortgage. If so, you’ll pay no
monthly mortgage payments, but you’ll still be responsible for property
taxes, homeowners’ insurance, and maintenance expenses. As long as you
fulfill those obligations and reside in the home permanently, your reverse
mortgage lender can’t force you to leave or sell the place.
The amount of money available from a reverse mortgage is based on the
following:
 The age of the youngest borrower (who must be 62 or older)
 The current interest rate (the total costs of the loan)
 The home’s value (its current selling price)
 The specific type of reverse mortgage selected
These four factors are used to determine the maximum amount a homeowner
can take in a reverse mortgage. Plus, federal guidelines protect the senior cit-
izen by not allowing him to remove equity that would reduce the value of the
home below a certain percentage. This amount is commonly capped at 40
percent of the equity. Thus, the reverse mortgage holder can be certain of
never using up every cent of the house’s worth. For example, a paid-off home
worth $500,000 can carry a reverse mortgage of up to $200,000.
The current mortgage or mortgages on the property, any tax liens, and any
major repair issues also affect how much you can get from the reverse mort-
gage. Any existing mortgages must be paid off with the proceeds from the
reverse mortgage. A reverse mortgage must be the only mortgage on the
property.

After an amount is determined, you can receive the cash in
 A monthly payment
 A lump sum
 A line of credit (you’ll get a checkbook)
 A term payment (semiannually, annually, biannually, and so forth)
 A combination of these plans
If you decide to take the monthly payment, the amount computed on the day
of closing is guaranteed as long as you permanently live in your home.
Benefits for you, drawbacks for your heirs
Reverse mortgages aren’t for everyone. Before you consider a reverse mort-
gage, you need to understand the basic advantage and disadvantage of
having one.

Chapter 17: Protecting Your Home for the Future
Property rich, cash poor
Real estate agents are fully aware of how bur-
densome basic necessities like food, medicine,
heat, and utilities can be on a person living on a
fixed income. I know an agent who is particu-
larly attuned to this situation and routinely
makes his clients aware of reverse mortgages
as a way to provide relief. He works with
seniors who already have substantial equity in
their dwellings.
When volunteering his time with a Brooklyn
home buyer-counseling nonprofit organization
recently, he worked with an elderly homeowner
who was running a monthly deficit. She was
paying bills 60 to 90 days late and huddling in
layers of blankets during winter months to save
on heating costs — all in a property that was
fully paid for.
The agent suggested a reverse mortgage. 
He explained to her that these are great for
senior citizens who are “property rich and cash
poor” — like her. His elderly client decided on a
combination of payouts: She received a lump
sum, a line of credit, and monthly payments.
She paid off all her bills that were past due, she
reinstated her homeowners’ insurance, and she
was able to make repairs and keep up with the
maintenance on her house. The monthly
reverse mortgage check nicely supplemented
her Social Security check and small pension.
This agent made this woman’s golden years
shine again!

Reverse mortgages make the most sense for homeowners who have lived in
and paid for their dwelling for a long period of time, and who are living on a
fixed income and in need of extra cash to cover bills, medical costs, and
living expenses. When people say that owning a home is an investment, this
is what they mean. A reverse mortgage gives you the option of using all that
money you’ve put into your investment while still keeping your home. For
example, the 70-year-old homeowner whose home is paid off but needs more
monthly cash to pay bills and live would probably benefit from the option. A
reverse mortgage, however, would not be possible for a homeowner who
owes more than 25 percent of his home’s value.
However, reverse mortgages do have a significant disadvantage. The mort-
gages can become a problem when heirs don’t like the idea of having to pay
back the mortgage out of their inheritance. (The mortgage is passed on to
whoever inherits the home.) Say you’re a widow, your home is worth
$400,000, it’s paid for, and you decide to take out a $150,000 reverse mortgage
with a monthly payment on a 10-year amortization schedule. (You’re happy
with a payment around $1,200 a month.) You end up living nine more years
and, after you pass away, your son wants to sell the house he inherited,
which is now worth $450,000. He will have to pay off the reverse mortgage
(which will probably be close to $150,000 by then) at the closing, meaning
he’ll net around $300,000.
Changing the Ownership
Structure of Your Home
Now that you’re settled into your new home, you can relax a bit. However,
you don’t want to get too comfortable. Sometime soon you need to start
thinking about your own demise, or at least your decline. That’s right, now is
a good time to figure out the best way to pass your property on to your bene-
ficiaries, those near and dears — whomever they may be.
You need to think about the ownership structure of your home (and assets).
The ownership structure is precisely what it sounds like: how your home is
owned — whether it’s in your and your spouse’s names alone, or you and
your kids, or you and other owners in a partnership. And there are different
legalities involved with each one.
By changing the ownership structure of your second home, you can protect it
in case something happens to you. For example, if you’ve changed the owner-
ship status and four years later you have to enter a nursing home, you can
protect the home from being seized as an asset by the nursing home to pay
for its services.
316
Part IV: Home, Sweet Home: Retiring to Your Second Home 

In this section, I discuss the different types of ownership and give you a
grounding in what’s what. Deeds can be modified to add or remove owners,
and you can even quitclaim (essentially, give) your home to your children
or someone else if you choose to, and if it’s in your long-term best interest.
Ownership structure is a complex issue and differs from state to state,
so consult an attorney for more info and if you have any questions not
answered here.
Considering different structures
There are several types of ownership structures for real estate. Some are
automatic. For example, in some states all married couples hold (or own) the
property in the same way. And some ownership arrangements are deliber-
ately set up a particular way for personal or financial reasons. Make sure you
consult an attorney about these different structures.
Ownership structures include the following types. Talk to your attorney to
find out how your property is held.
 Sole ownership: You own the asset by yourself, and you can sell it or
give it away without having to ask anyone else for permission. A will is
critically necessary here, or else the courts will decide who gets the
house. (Check out “Making a will” later in this chapter.) If you solely own
your second home and you don’t have a will, the property could go into
dreaded probate and get hit with high estate taxes.
 Tenants in the entirety: Reserved for married couples, this ownership
structure requires approval from both parties before the property can
be sold or given away. When one spouse dies, the other spouse automat-
ically receives full title. (This type of ownership isn’t available in all
states.)
 Joint tenancy with rights of survivorship (JTWROS): You own an equal
share of the property with one or more individuals. When an owner
passes away, the property is automatically transferred to the surviving
owners (even if your will states otherwise). That’s right: A person’s joint
ownership can’t be “willed” away, unlike when ownership is tenants in
common.
 Tenants in common (T/C): You own shares in property with one or more
persons. The shares of ownership don’t have to be equal, and there is no
right of survivorship. This means that when one owner passes away,
that person’s interest is passed along to his heirs, as named in a will. It
doesn’t go to the other owner(s).
317
Chapter 17: Protecting Your Home for the Future

 Community property: You and your spouse each have one-half interest
in jointly owned property. If you get divorced, everything is split down
the middle. If one spouse dies, the surviving spouse acquires the
deceased spouse’s half-interest in their community property. Remember,
though, that community property is only recognized in nine states:
Arizona, California, Idaho, Louisiana, Nebraska, New Mexico, Texas,
Washington, and Wisconsin. Check with your respective state office
for details.
The good news is that for married couples whose property is owned in joint
tenancy, you can almost always avoid probate, court proceedings, and estate
taxes when bequeathing a home, because full ownership of the home auto-
matically reverts to the living spouse.
Adding your children to the deed
While you’re reviewing your home’s ownership structure, you may want to
think about adding your children(s) name to the deed, thus assuring them
control of (and responsibility for) the property at all times.
You’ll have to work with an attorney or a title company to add children to
your deed. Doing so may help stave off estate taxes that your heirs would
incur upon your passing. It can also give you peace of mind about your prop-
erty’s ownership when it’s time to pass it on to your children or even if the
day comes when you’re incapacitated and want to be sure your home is in
good hands.
Once added, your children become joint tenants. That means that both you
and they will share ownership rights to the property and also be liable for
one another’s debts, not just the mortgage. It also means that if one of the
joint tenants (you or one of your kids) wants to sell the home, the other
owner(s) have to agree to do so.
Any joint tenant who racks up debt risks having a lien put on the home to
cover those obligations. So, if you and your daughter become joint tenants,
and she gets buried in credit card debt that she can’t (or doesn’t) pay, the
lender will pursue collection from your daughter’s assets, which could
include putting a lien on your house and even foreclosing. Remember that a
lender can only foreclose if there’s still a mortgage on the home.
So be sure to discuss this move with an experienced attorney (a chat with
your accountant wouldn’t hurt, too) before making any major decisions
affecting the ownership structure and financial aspects of your home — and
you. The legal and financial implications of adding your children to a home’s
deed are pretty sticky.
318
Part IV: Home, Sweet Home: Retiring to Your Second Home 

Should you quitclaim the house?
A quitclaim deed releases interest in a property to a specified person or per-
sons without being compensated for the asset transfer. A legal document,
the deed transfers rights to a property by a grantor — that’s you — to a
grantee — that’s your child, your nephew, or your best friend.
That means you can quitclaim your home to anyone, anywhere, including
your children. The drawback to this is that you’re essentially giving away part
or all of the home, and the recipients may be subject to a gift tax later on. Plus
the grantees are then responsible for all financial costs associated with
owning the house — property taxes, maintenance, insurance costs, and so on.
Using a quitclaim deed may be warranted in some situations, but for the best
advice on this subject, talk to your attorney, accountant, and/or financial
advisor, all of whom should be able to help you make the best decision
regarding this legal move.
Leaving the Property to Your Heirs
Ultimately, the best way to bequeath a home is to plan well in advance for a
time when the property transfers to one or more heirs, whether through a
joint tenancy agreement, will, or other vehicle. Though the process can be
fraught with both legal and financial implications, you should keep in mind
the best interest of your heirs as you handle your estate planning.
Also, if you eschew planning ahead, then there’s a very good chance that
Uncle Sam will swoop in upon your death and snag a large chunk of what
you’ve worked so hard to accumulate during your lifetime.
That means the planning should be less about how to draft the legal docu-
ment, and more about how your children and/or heirs are going to enjoy the
home when it’s passed on to them. In this section, I explain how to make a
simple will, how to divvy up your estate in a way that benefits everyone, and
how to handle any disputes. (For more in-depth info on making out wills and
passing on property, check out Estate Planning For Dummies by N. Brian
Caverly and Jordan S. Simon [Wiley]).
Where there’s a will, there’s peace of mind
Making a will is one of those touchy subjects that many people don’t want to
deal with. But making a will is important and, when handled properly, can make
an enormous difference in your loved ones’ lives when you ultimately pass on.
319
Chapter 17: Protecting Your Home for the Future

A will is important for two main reasons. With a will
 Your estate can avoid lengthy probate periods and having to pay high
estate taxes, or at least minimize them.
 You can ensure that your assets go to whom you want them to go to and
with as small a cost attached as possible.
If you don’t make a will, your worldly possessions and property may end up
in probate, or in the government’s hands, out of reach of the people whom
you planned to leave them to, until a ruling is issued divvying up your estate.
Drawing up your will
Drawing up a will is a fairly straightforward process that you can do on your
own, at a lawyer’s office, or on your computer with one of the many software
programs available today for about $30 or less. Try one of these will-making
sites as a starting point: LegacyWriter (www.legacywriter.com) or
LegalZoom (www.legalzoom.com). Both sites offer online downloads for
their programs.
If you’re confident you know what you want to bequeath, and to whom, and
you don’t have any complicated financial situations (like owning property
with partners, for one), then you may not need a lawyer. Or you may want
one to weigh in when you’re done writing your will for reassurance that it’s
okay. If you’re not sure whether your own situation is simple enough to do
the will on your own, you can always take a swing at it yourself and then ask
your attorney to review it, a service that would cost less than him doing the
whole will from scratch.
If you decide to write your own will, stick to the following steps when doing so:
1. List all your assets.
Assets are items or money owned by an individual. These typically
include savings and checking accounts, investment accounts, property,
life insurance policies, and personal property.
2. Decide on who you want to inherit what and when.
You name heirs to inherit certain pieces of property. Your beneficiaries
are the people designated to receive the proceeds (death benefits) of
insurance policies or savings accounts when you die.
For example, you may want to leave your son a gold ring that your father
gave you when you were 16 years old. Or you want your brother to have
your CD collection, library, or coin collection. Or you want to leave a
certain amount of cash to your favorite niece. All of this is spelled out in
your will and adhered to by its executor.
320
Part IV: Home, Sweet Home: Retiring to Your Second Home 

3. Choose a guardian for your children (if any of them are under 18 at
the time you’re drafting your will).
A guardian is the person chosen to care for and raise your children in
the event of your death. You also need to select an alternate guardian in
case the first choice can’t — or won’t — take on the responsibility. When
deciding who to name as guardian, consider each prospective person’s
suitability for raising children, their living and financial situation, and
their moral and ethical makeup, and whether it agrees with yours. If you
have an intuitive, heartfelt feeling that a specific person would raise and
love your kids the way you do, that’s your guardian.
4. Select someone who can handle the assets that you leave to your
children (if you think this will be necessary).
This person should be trusted and honorable, who you are reasonably
sure will be able to accommodate your requests and take care of the
details properly. A parent, brother, or sister may be your best bet,
although an attorney may be better suited to handle the task. This does-
n’t necessarily have to be the same person you select as guardian,
although it can be.
5. Choose an executor.
The executor carries out your wishes, and handles all the paperwork (and
there will be a lot of it!) and other administrative tasks upon your pass-
ing. Choose someone you know is smart, attentive to detail, trustworthy,
and patient. All these traits will be necessary when executing a will.
6. Print out the will and sign and date it in the presence of at least two
witnesses, who must also sign.
An unsigned will, or an unwitnessed will, is, in most cases, an invalid will.
You don’t want to go through the effort of making a will and have it
rejected when being filed because it wasn’t legally signed, dated, and
witnessed.
Wills do not need to be notarized, but they do need to be witnessed. It’s
a good idea to check with your state laws to make sure you have enough
witnesses sign it (some states require two, others require three). You
can choose your own witnesses or have your attorney (if you’re using
one) provide them. Witnesses don’t have the obligation (nor the right)
to read the will. They are simply witnessing the will’s signing by the
will’s maker. Also, the witnesses shouldn’t have a stake in the will.
Storing (and reviewing) your will
Put your will in a safe place (such as safety deposit box at the bank, or in a
fireproof high-security safe in your home), and make sure that the family
member, trusted professional, or executor whom you designate to take care
of things upon your death knows where it is and how to access it. (They don’t
need a copy in their possession while you’re alive.) The will needn’t be
recorded with any government agency to be legal.
321
Chapter 17: Protecting Your Home for the Future

Because your financial situation will likely change from year to year, review
your will annually. Make any necessary changes to your assets, beneficiaries,
and other key elements. Sometimes you can make changes by simply adding
a codicil (a document that details your revisions); other times you may need
to draft a whole new will. This way, when the time comes that the will must
be executed, the document will be up-to-date and accurate.
Considering estate taxes
When transferring real estate, in particular, you need to keep in mind the fol-
lowing points to protect your estate and your heirs. Estate taxes and those
taxes incurred during real estate transfers (if and when your beneficiaries
decide to sell the family home, for example) can be steep. Some can be
avoided through careful planning, so be sure to discuss in advance any
“divvying up” of your estate with an accountant or financial planner. That
way, John won’t get socked with a $100,000 IRS bill when he goes to sell your
$650,000 home a year after your passing.
 Look at your overall financial picture. You can’t just consider the home
as a stand-alone entity — and then determine where the property fits
into your complete estate plan. Is it the bulk of the estate? Or just a
small part? Factor your home into your whole financial picture, which
includes your savings, investments, IRAs, 401(k)s, and other assets. Talk
to a financial planner for advice on how to ensure that the real estate
transfer is being done in a way that doesn’t adversely affect the entities
that make up your complete financial portfolio.
 Review your ownership structure. Most couples own their homes in
joint tenancy. If you don’t own the home in joint tenancy — but you want
to — talk to a title company or attorney as soon as possible about
changing the ownership structure. See the section, “Changing the
Ownership Structure of Your Home” earlier in this chapter.
 Consider taking advantage of the $1 million that each individual is
allowed to give away, tax-free, during his lifetime. Those who use it
are taking advantage of what is called the Gift Tax Credit, which allows
an individual to claim a $1 million exclusion during his lifetime and used
to, say, gift money to a child (to the tune of $12,000 or less per year).
 Make sure that the title to the property is free and clear of any liens
or defects before attempting to bequeath it to your heirs. Think about
any mortgages or debts on the home, and decide how those will be paid
off. A title search (conducted by a title agent) can show whether a lien
has been attached to the home. If any are found, they should be cleared
up immediately by contacting the entity that attached the lien and
resolving it (either having it corrected, or paying the debt, for example).
 Avoid waiting until the last minute to get started on your estate plan-
ning. Start the process now, and your heirs will be grateful for your efforts
when their time comes to take over management of your financial assets.

Ten Popular Second-Home
Locations
In This Chapter
 Choosing a location that suits your needs
 Looking outside the United States for a second home
H
ow do you decide where to purchase your second home? For many
people, this decision is a no-brainer. They buy where they have vaca-
tioned as renters for years. They buy in an area they know they love. For
others, though, where they vacation isn’t necessarily where they want to
spend their retirement years, and this needs to be taken into consideration,
because second homes also commonly end up being retirement homes.
Maybe those ski vacations were great fun all those years, but someplace
warmer may be a more appealing notion for retirement.
Certain areas of the country (and the world, for that matter) attract second-
home buyers like bees to honey. For example, Florida is especially popular, in
particular among those folks who live in the northern (colder) climes of the
Northeast and Midwest. The Carolinas are also a popular choice for those
northerners, and, ironically, for Floridians looking to escape their state’s
summer humidity and heat. Texas and other states in the Southwest also
rank high on the list, as do cities like Las Vegas; Aspen, Colorado; and Cape
Cod, Massachusetts, each of which offers its own appeal and its own unique
activities and attractions.
If you don’t yet have your heart set on an exact location and are thinking a bit
further outside the box (and the States), or you’re just aching to make a change
from your usual vacation destination, then you’ve come to the right place.
This chapter tells you about ten popular geographic areas for second-home
buyers — including the pros and the cons of each — that you should defi-
nitely consider before making your final selection.

Florida
Ah, the Sunshine State. It’s where scads of people in the United States want to
be between November and March each year. Few other states can offer the
combination of heat, sunshine, and beaches that Floridians bask in just about
year-round.
But wait, Florida isn’t quite so perfect. Throw in the risk of possibly devastat-
ing hurricanes, some major homeowners’ insurance issues — regarding both
cost (high) and availability of coverage (a challenge) — and the fact that many
of the most popular areas for vacationers and second-home buyers are getting
overcrowded quickly, and you may want to read the nine other suggestions in
this chapter before settling on this one.
Even so, the state offers a wide range of options for the second-home buyer,
from the laid-back style of Key West to the Disney-laden Orlando area to the
sugary sand beaches of the Panhandle.
The Carolinas
North and South Carolina offer diverse vacation experiences that include
beaches and mountains, rivers and lakes, and small towns and big cities.
Because of these diverse features, both states are popular among second-
home buyers.
Although the Carolinas get cold during the winter, they boast a number of
great hideaways where you can find second homes for sale in areas that allow
you to fully enjoy both states’ many delights. The downside is that you’re not
going to enjoy bargain basement prices anymore: Both states have experi-
enced high home appreciation over the last few years.
A few places to consider include South Carolina’s Myrtle Beach, where the
“Grand Strand” annually draws millions of visitors to its white sand beaches;
Beaufort, also in South Carolina, whose seaside villages often find their way
into best-selling novels; and North Carolina’s gorgeous Outer Banks, where
barrier islands span 130 miles.
Galveston, Texas
Situated in the Gulf of Mexico and connected to the Texas mainland by the 
2-mile-long Galveston Causeway, the island of Galveston has become a popu-
lar spot for second-home buyers who want to own a piece of the 32-mile-long,
21⁄2-mile-wide island.
326
Part V: The Part of Tens 

Galveston exudes small, southern-town charm, yet is located only 40 miles
away from Houston, making air travel to and from a second home on the
island that much more feasible. The island’s historic neighborhoods boast
structures that are on the National Register of Historic Places, and the area is
rich with late 19th- and early 20th-century architecture. Popular activities
include windsurfing, boating, and fishing.
Keep in mind, though, that Galveston’s seaside location means that it’s vul-
nerable to hurricanes and inclement weather, and similar to what Floridians
go through, obtaining homeowners’ insurance for a property there may be
challenging.
The American Southwest
The American Southwest — areas of Arizona, California, Colorado, Nevada,
New Mexico, Utah, and Texas — boasts deserts, canyons, caves, and yes,
even beaches, and the landscape is both beautiful and mysterious. The
American Southwest offers perfect spots if you’re looking for serenity in an
environment very different from what most states offer. The Mojave Desert,
for example, encompasses areas of Arizona, Nevada, and Southern California,
all of which are popular among the vacation home-buying set. For individuals
who live full time in the northern climates, the thought of owning a home in
the Southwest and then retiring to it can be very enticing.
This region boasts lakes, scenic drives, volcanic craters, and of course, lots
of deserts. If you like it very hot and sunny, and are enamored of history and
ancient ruins (of which there are many in the American Southwest), then this
region may be for you. If you find extreme heat to be unbearable, then you
may want to steer clear of this area of the country and instead navigate
toward a region where rain falls more readily and it isn’t always summer!
The American Southwest is vast. To find the right place, you may first try
renting one or more vacation homes (find them on a site like www.vrbo.
com), before you buy. Also, if this region intrigues you, be sure to visit
www.americansouthwest.net for info about everything the American
Southwest has to offer.
Las Vegas
If glitz, glamour, and night life are on your second-home priority list, Vegas
could be the place for your second home. The fact is, this city literally never
sleeps. If you keep in mind that the odds at some of the nicest casinos leave 
a lot to be desired (you don’t want to blow your retirement nest egg at the
327
Chapter 18: Ten Popular Second-Home Locations

craps table), and you can handle living in Vegas as a temporary resident who
only occasionally gambles, then you quite possibly can find a gem among the
area’s housing stock, especially if you’re looking for a condo.
Over the last few years, developers have launched a large number of condo
projects. This has created an ample inventory of new homes for second-
home buyers who are looking for an urban getaway with undeniably adult
attractions close by.
If you’re looking for a family atmosphere, you may want to steer clear of Vegas
for your second home. Even though Sin City has tried to clean itself up lately,
I was there recently and saw very few children and families on the Strip.
Aspen, Colorado
Is swooshing down ski slopes right up your alley? If you have the money and
are looking for that kind of outdoor activity right in your backyard, then
Aspen, Colorado, is the place for your second home.
A chalet nestled on the snowy slopes with your name on it is waiting, but you’ll
probably pay a hefty price for it. Demand is high, and the location is desirable,
so it’s not unusual for $1 million to be the “low end” of the market here.
Keep in mind, too, that maintenance on a home in Aspen may be slightly to
considerably more expensive than that of a beach location: Snow removal
alone can set you back a few hundred bucks a month. After you and your
family hit the slopes from your own villa, though, you’ll almost certainly feel
that it’s all worth it.
Cape Cod, Massachusetts
Owning a waterfront home in Martha’s Vineyard is something to brag about.
And you should expect to pay the price for those bragging rights if you have
your mind set on a place on this 413-square-mile peninsula of fields, forests,
dunes, marshland, and beaches located off the Massachusetts coast.
From clam chowder festivals to cultural events to a thriving business econ-
omy, the Cape Cod area is a favorite for second-home buyers looking for an
escape from the rat race. The area offers a beautiful traditional atmosphere,
and during nonvacation periods, the area is typically only natives.
328

Specific areas to check out include Falmouth (for boating and fishing),
Sandwich (for its famous glass products), Nantucket Island (for its art gal-
leries and museums), and Hyannis (for its historic homes and sandy
beaches).
Europe
You vacationed in Italy last year, and now you and your loved ones have
decided that you want to visit Europe more often, but you don’t want to stay in
hotels. You would prefer to live in your own home, right? Well, you’re in luck.
As a second-home buyer who is on the prowl for a new place, many options
await you on the other side of that pond called the Atlantic Ocean. Whether
you want to bask in the sun on the shores of the French Riviera, enjoy wine
in the Tuscan countryside, or stand in the streets of Spain watching the bulls
run, Europe may be just the ticket.
And speaking of tickets, be prepared to buy plenty of them if you’re spread-
ing yourself between a primary home in the United States and a second home
based overseas. Also, expect to deal with nuances in the overseas real estate
market and currency conversion issues, as well as adapting to life as a (tem-
porary) local. (See Chapter 9 for more info on buying overseas.)
The Caribbean
The Cayman Islands, the Virgin Islands, and the Bahamas all present great
second home-buying opportunities for Americans who want their own piece
of paradise. Living on or near the beach is a draw in and of itself, and one that
brings many new second-home buyers to these Caribbean islands every year.
I’ve visited all three countries over the last few years, and I can tell you that
I’ve thought about taking the plunge and owning my own slice of each one.
The islands are beautiful and enticing, but they also come with their own set
of challenges.
All three locales have had run-ins with major hurricanes over the last decade,
with Grand Cayman getting hit especially hard in 2004. All have since recov-
ered, but the thought of future storms should cross your mind if you’re going to
buy in the Caribbean. As you may expect, insuring your new place may require
extra effort to find adequate coverage at a price you’re comfortable with.
329
Chapter 18: Ten Popular Second-Home Locations

On a positive note, the “for sale” signs are plentiful on homes throughout the
islands, with single-family homes and condos making up the majority of the
housing stock. If you plan to own a home here, check out Chapter 9 for help
in buying beyond U.S. borders.
South America
Years ago, the average American second-home shopper probably wouldn’t
have even considered buying a home in a South American country, such as
Argentina or Peru. But today, with the increasing interest in finding new, undis-
covered places — and the fact that so many South Americans now reside in
the United States — this thought is no longer so farfetched. In fact, places like
Buenos Aires, Argentina; Lima, Peru; and Montevideo, Uruguay are among
the hottest vacation spots for Americans these days. These areas are rich in
culture, offer ample real estate opportunities, and provide a lifestyle that no
U.S. city can mimic.
Remember that South America is not North America (with everything that
goes along with that reality). Although prices can be good, politics and infla-
tion can both affect your lifestyle.
When buying overseas, be sure to find a real estate agent who has worked
with American second-home buyers in the past and who can guide you
through the process. A good place to start is at domestic brokerages like
Coldwell Banker or RE/MAX, both of which have international branches in
South America. (Head to Chapter 9 for more advice on buying overseas.)

Ten Ways to Make Your Second
Home First-Rate
In This Chapter
 Keeping your second home shipshape
 Enlisting help with your second home
You can easily lose sight of the fact that your second home needs the
same attention as your primary home. After all, you probably don’t have
to look at it every day, right? That means you also don’t have to contend with
disapproving looks from neighbors when your grass grows too high, your
stove’s right rear burner that doesn’t heat up, or the tub that drains too slowly,
which would drive you nuts if you had to live with it on a daily basis.
But does that mean you can ignore those problems? No. You should do what
you can — either on your own or with the help of others — to create a first-
rate second home that you, your renters, your family, and others can enjoy
for years to come. In this chapter, I show you ten ways to do that.
Look for Ways to Make Improvements
Tile floors chip. Old refrigerators don’t refrigerate. Garage door openers stop
opening. Doors squeak. Floors creak. Faucets drip. Paint fades. Drains don’t.
These are just some of the basic issues that homeowners deal with all the time,
and you should address them as quickly as possible when they occur at your
second residence, even though they’re not in your face every day.
Not everything on your to-do list has to be expensive or take a great deal of
time. If, for example, the faucet in the guest bathroom leaks and the fixture is
from the Pleistocene Age, consider replacing it with a new $35 faucet that not
only works correctly, but also looks much nicer. (And be sure to keep track of
all repairs — even the little ones — by saving the receipts.)

Funnel the Profits Back into the Home
Successful business owners are always funneling money back into their busi-
nesses. Doing so is important, helpful, and smart. Because your second home
is, in essence, a business until you move into it full time, you should consider
putting at least some of your rental profits back into the place.
For example: Instead of pocketing that $2,000 monthly profit that you’re
making on your second home, allocate 25 percent of it ($500 a month) to home
improvements. That doesn’t mean you have to work on the house every
month, spending exactly $500, but you will have $6,000 a year to reinvest.
Hire a Property Manager
A property manager can be your friend, especially if your primary home is
more than a three-hour drive away from your second home. For a fee, these
companies market the home to renters, inspect and report back to you, deal
with tenants, and tackle the tasks associated with second-home ownership. If
you go this route, the property manager can essentially serve as a second set
of eyes watching your property and taking care of it. (Check out Chapter 11 for
more on how a property manager can help you rent your home and Chapter
13 for more on how these folks can help you maintain the home.)
Use a Cleaning Service
Keeping your second home clean inside and outside is critical to attracting
renters and keeping neighbors happy. No one wants to visit a dirty home or
look out their window and see a ramshackle house in need of painting or
power washing. Plus, making sure everything is neat and tidy shows respect
for both your guests and your neighbors.
Unless you really enjoy cleaning toilets and showers, you should consider
hiring someone to help you keep your second home sparkling clean and shiny.
Expect to pay anywhere from $60 to $120 a month for the service, depending
on the size of your home and how often you use or need the service. (Check
out Chapter 13 for more helpful info on maintaining your home.)
332
Part V: The Part of Tens 

Use a Lawn Service
Many neighborhoods these days have strict rules concerning overgrown yards.
Because of this, you need to cut the grass yourself on a weekly basis or hire
someone to do it for you. Much like a cleaning service, a lawn service can take
a big load off your mind for only a small investment of $60 to $120 per month,
depending on where your home is located and how large your yard is. Remem-
ber that a well-kept lawn and yard are the first things visitors and potential
renters see. If your grounds are unkempt, you can be sure your place has
dropped a notch or two in other people’s perceptions. (Refer to Chapter 13
for more on the importance of the upkeep of your second home.)
Decorate like It’s Your Primary Home
The best way to decorate a second home — particularly if you’re going to be
renting it out for part of the year — lies somewhere between Spartan and
French castle. In other words, you don’t want the place to look empty and
sterile, but you also don’t want to put so much of your personal stuff into it
that it becomes uninviting for tenants.
Take the middle road when decorating your house. Dress the space and make
it comfortable but not cluttered; contemporary, but not too modern; func-
tional, but not crammed. Outfit it in a way that’s comfortable and useful for
you, your family, and your guests.
Make the Home Fully Functional
The last things a vacation renter wants to hear is that the hot tub is broken,
the shower in the master bathroom doesn’t work, the oven light is on the
blink, and the downstairs toilet doesn’t flush. Although you may not mind
working around these things, your tenants are going to expect (and demand)
the “best of the best” from their experience. That’s what they’re paying for.
You can’t stay on top of every insect and missing tile, but do your best to
keep your second home as functional as possible at all times. When in doubt,
call a handyman to come in and knock off a list of items to fix or upgrade on a
day when the place isn’t rented out. It’ll be well worth the effort.
333
Chapter 19: Ten Ways to Make Your Second Home First-Rate

Keep Tabs on Renters
“Treat our home like it was your own” is a common request by second-home
owners who are renting their digs on a short- or long-term basis. Sounds
good in theory, right? The reality is sometimes markedly different. Most ten-
ants will happily shove an extra-large load of laundry into the washing
machine to save time, because the average tenant probably doesn’t care
what happens to said washing machine, as long as her clothes get clean.
Not all renters are irresponsible. Either you or your property manager need
to conduct regular inspections both before and after renters use the place.
Ask for security deposits upfront, and don’t return them until you know the
place is in the same shape it was before the renters got there. Your renter’s
security deposit can fix any damaged items.
Personally Use It As Often As Possible
When you’re in the middle of figuring out a year’s worth of rental income and
trying to schedule everyone for the weeks that they want, losing sight of the
fact that you bought this home for your enjoyment is easy.
You and your family come first. Every September take a look at the year
ahead. Use a calendar and a thick, red pen to mark off any days that you want
to use the home. Then refer to that calendar when you’re signing up renters.
Unless something prohibits you from visiting your second home, don’t give
up any of the weeks you’ve called dibs for. By sticking to this strategy, you
always get your first picks for vacation.
Invite Select Loved Ones to Your Home
Family and friends enrich your life. Thus, being able to spend time with them
is a wonderful additional benefit of having a second home. You’ll find that the
atmosphere will be a lot more fun when you have cousins come to your beach
house rather than to your primary home. So consider entertaining as a great
way to enjoy the people closest to you.
Also, as word gets around that you’ve purchased a second home that sits
unoccupied for part of the year, expect to get requests from friends and rela-
tives who want to use it for their own vacations. As long as these individuals
are trustworthy and responsible, and as long as they leave the place as they
found it, allowing them to spend some time at your place shouldn’t create
many problems. See Chapter 20 for more details on how to set ground rules
for friends and family who want to use your home.

Chapter 20
Ten Rules Your Friends and 
Family Must Follow When 
Using Your Home
In This Chapter
 Establishing who can visit when
 Making sure guests keep your home in good shape
A
fter you become a second-home owner, the inevitable is bound to
happen: Aunt Martha and Uncle George will be in dire need of a vaca-
tion, and it won’t be long before you hear, “May we please stay at your place
with George Jr. and our new beagles, Keanu and Cher?”
For many of you, the answer will be “Sure, Aunt Martha!” — and that’s fine, as
long as it doesn’t conflict with your own plans to use your second home. But
there are some things visitors need to know, and in this chapter, I discuss ten
rules that you should lay down for friends and family who want to use your
place. Feel free to post these rules in your house so your guests don’t forget
them. And if you don’t think it would ruffle anyone’s feathers, consider having
your guests sign a copy of the rules, indicating that they’ve read them and
that they’ll adhere to them. (Although in the case of immediate family, asking
may be a bit much.)
Tell your guests that they not only are expected to abide by your rules, but
also by the rules of the condo development, neighborhood association, or co-
op board when they’re staying in your home. Condos, for example, often have
rules about parking, speed limits, noise, and so forth, and when someone is
in your unit, you’re responsible for their behavior. Make sure your guests
know this from the outset.

Visit on Our Schedule
As the homeowner, you determine who uses your second home and when.
Set up a schedule of your own first, and then accommodate your guests. So if
you and your family of four were set to use your two-bedroom, two-bath
condo at the lake for Labor Day weekend, your aunt and uncle can’t possibly
be there at the same time — no matter how much they had hoped you’d
allow it. If they insist, or even go so far as to get mad about it, politely explain
that you booked yourself a year in advance (see Chapter 19 for details on
making your own owner’s calendar) and that changing it would be too much
of an inconvenience for you and your family. Period. Case closed.
Offer guests a different weekend — or even the next free holiday if you’re not
planning on using your home then — instead, but don’t ever feel guilty about
not being able to accommodate “free” guests who can’t work around your
schedule.
Children, Pets, and Smokers Have 
Their Own Sets of Rules to Follow
In some families, a family vacation just isn’t a family vacation unless the three
kids, chain-smoking Uncle Ralph, Rover, and Miss Kitty all pile into the van
for the getaway. But before you start opening the doors of your second home
to friends and family, you should establish some basic rules regarding chil-
dren, pets, and smokers. The big concern about these folks is that they’ll
potentially damage your precious second home. That’s why you need to
make rules and establish boundaries. After all, it is your house.
Consider posting and handing out a copy of the following rules to your
guests. Feel free to modify these rules, based on your circumstances.
 No smoking in the home, on the lanai, or on the deck.
 No smoking in the home, but feel free to smoke out on the lanai or deck —
but with the sliding glass door to the home closed.
 No children allowed on the deck alone. (Some lanais and decks are
above the first level, and some owners forbid kids out there at all.)
 Please don’t allow your children to eat in the living room. All eating must
be done in the kitchen.
 Men must wear shirts while sitting on the furniture. (I saw this one
posted in Hawaii; sweat and tanning oil can destroy fabric.)
336
Part V: The Part of Tens 

 No pets allowed.
 Small pets (under 15 pounds) are allowed with notice and an additional
add-on to the security deposit.
 Clean up after your pets.
 Clean up after your children.
Make up your own rules, and don’t hesitate to add new ones when a new situ-
ation arises that you need to address.
Report Any Damage or Problems
Ask your guests to keep you informed of any problems or concerns that they
see or experience while staying at your second home. Doing so is particularly
important if you don’t live near your second home because you can quickly
find yourself up to your eyeballs in repairs and maintenance when problems
aren’t tended to.
If the snow is piled up past the windows, the cellar has a foot of water in it, or
the oak tree on the front lawn is teetering at a weird angle, make sure your
guests know that you want to know about it. Make this very clear to your
friends and family both before and after their stay.
Treat the Home like It’s Your Own
You would expect that someone would treat your second home as if it were
their own, but it doesn’t always work out that way. Although some guests are
conscientious and rule abiding, others may feel as if the home is their play-
ground. They may leave things in disarray or even broken.
You must lay down the ground rules early by telling guests exactly what your
expectations are regarding how they treat your place. (Check out Chapter 1
for a list you can post on the fridge.)
Don’t Cost Us Money
Owning a second home can be an expensive proposition if things like long-
distance phone calls and $10 pay-per-view movies aren’t treated with respect
337
Chapter 20: Ten Rules Your Friends and Family Must Follow

and used with discretion. Make your guests aware of “added expense” items,
and indicate any areas where they may actually wind up costing you money.
All it will take is a few visits from friends or relatives to find out what areas
are prone to these problems. One all-night, pay-per-view movie party and
you’ll have a good idea of exactly what to be on the alert for. (Of course, if
one of your guests wants to order that new Al Pacino movie on pay-per-view
and reimburse you for the cost, then that’s fine.)
Clean Up After Yourself
Ideally, you want your second home to remain spic and span at all times.
Sometimes it will be, sometimes it won’t. Rather than let your guests have
free reign over the place, make them aware upfront that you expect them to
clean up after themselves.
Be specific in this request, and cover the following:
 Clean up the kitchen, clean out the fridge, and toss perishable foods
stored in cabinets.
 Wash and dry all linens that were used (this can include towels and 
bed linens).
 Make the beds.
 Throw out all garbage.
 And so forth and so on . . .
You should also considering charging a deposit (the standard is $200 to $300)
to cover accidents and any extra cleaning that needs to be done as a result of
the guest’s stay.
Don’t Have Parties or Overnight 
Guests without Permission
Decide whether you’ll allow your friends and family to have parties at your
second home, and also whether you’ll allow additional overnight guests.
Sometimes this decision will hinge on the house itself. It’s an important con-
sideration for all second-home owners who want their abodes kept in the
best shape possible and who don’t want the hassle of having to clean up after
an unapproved, 40-person New Year’s Eve party.
338
Part V: The Part of Tens 

If, for example, you have a five-bedroom abode in the middle of the Colorado
Rocky Mountains, then an extra guest or two probably won’t be that big a
deal. But if you have a two-bedroom condo on Pompano Beach in Florida,
then a raucous party or three extra people for a slumber party may be over-
doing it.
Think about it, use your best judgment, and lay down the rules for such
requests long before you allow anyone to use your home.
Expect Unexpected Visits from Us
If your second home is within driving distance of your primary dwelling, be
sure to let your friends and family know that you may, ahem, “drop in” at any
time to check up on the place. This probably won’t be much of an issue if
someone is staying for a few days over a long weekend, but if you’re loaning
your home out for a month or more, you’ll probably want to make at least
one or two trips there to make sure everything is shipshape.
If your guests know in advance that you may stop by, they’ll likely take more
care with the place and keep it neat, orderly, and maintained in case you pull
one of your surprise inspections.
Leave the House and Its Contents 
the Way You Found Them
Don’t let your guests get away with wrecking your home and leaving it for
you to clean up. Although standard cleaning (toilets, bathtubs, clean linens,
and so forth) is your responsibility, there’s no excuse for marred walls, disor-
ganized utility closets, and broken dishes. Accidents happen, but if they start
to happen a little too often, it may be time for a reminder. Something along
the lines of “We expect our house and its contents to be in the same shape
they were in when you arrived for your stay” ought to do it.
Ask your guests to
 Put stuff back where they found it
 Clean up so the place is like it was when they arrived
 Throw out any garbage that they’re responsible for
 Wipe down any smudged sliding glass doors
339
Chapter 20: Ten Rules Your Friends and Family Must Follow

 Wipe off all surfaces, especially countertops and tables (both indoors
and outdoors)
 Take whatever other steps are necessary to return the home to the con-
dition it was in when they arrived
Don’t expect a perfect job every time, but by giving clear instructions about
all this before handing over the keys, you’ll be doing what you can to make
sure your second home is well taken care of.
Follow the Rules, and Come Back Again
Let your guests know that if they don’t comply with your rules (no matter
how loose or strict they are), they won’t be using your place again.
Just as you would treat their second home with respect, you expect the same
in return. Make this very clear, and enforce it when necessary.

Glossary
adjustable-rate mortgage (ARM): This type of loan features an interest rate
and payment that can be adjusted upward or downward as frequently as
every month in relation to market conditions. The interest rate is linked to
the U.S. Treasury index or some other fluctuating financial index.
agent: A person licensed by the state to conduct real estate transactions. A
real estate agent, for example, negotiates the transaction between a home
buyer and a seller.
amenities: Parks, swimming pools, health-club facilities, recreational rooms,
bike paths, community centers, and other outside features within close prox-
imity to a specific home, group of homes, condominium development, or
apartment complex.
amortization: The process of paying the principal and interest on a loan
through regularly scheduled installments. Typically, the earliest payments
are weighted heavily toward paying interest, so the amount of interest paid
decreases and the amount paid toward the principal increases over the life 
of the loan.
annual percentage rate (APR): The cost of credit as a yearly rate or interest
rate reflecting the first-year rate including certain points and credit costs.
appraisal report: A detailed, written report on the value of a property based
on recent sales of comparable properties in the area and the replacement
cost of the existing improvements (with the land value computed separately).
appraiser: An individual who is trained and experienced in the methods of
determining a property’s value through analysis of various factors, such as
age, size, condition of the property, and current market conditions. In some

ration adopts to govern activities within the development of condos or homes.
closing: The final step in the home-buying process, wherein buyers, sellers,
agents, attorneys, and a closing agent meet to sign all documents related to
the home sale. In some states, an escrow agent, who manages the paperwork
and files the necessary documents without the buyer and seller being pre-
sent, handles this process. All signing is done before the date of title transfer.
closing costs: Expenses incidental to the sale of real estate, including loan,
title, appraisal fees, and all prepaid fees that may be required.
commission: This is a negotiable percentage of the sales price of a home or a
negotiated flat fee that is paid to the buyer and seller’s agents in a real estate

hold title to the interior space, while common areas, such as parking lots,
hallways, and recreational areas, are owned by all the residents.
cosigner: A second borrower who signs in conjunction with the first borrower
for the mortgage loan and who is equally liable for the debt.
credit scoring: A system of using recorded information about individuals
(which includes what they owe and how timely they are in repaying their
