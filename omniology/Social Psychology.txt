We have been writing this book for some three or four years. Along the way, we 
have had help from many people, just some of who are named in our acknowledge-
ments section. We think that we, and this small army of talented and dedicated 
people, have come up with the best social psychology textbook. Ever. But, then, we 
would think that, wouldn’t we? As you will read, people are wont to make unduly 
positive assessments of themselves and their creations (Chapter 2). They are also 
prone to cognitive dissonance: a mental state that can lead people to overvalue deci-
sions and achievements for which they have made insane sacrifices (Chapter 4). 
So, it’s not for us to assess whether ours really is the best social psychology 
textbook available. Besides, as teachers, we have found that the textbooks of our 
‘competitors’ often provide excellent introductions to the knowledge that social 
psychologists have garnered. Several make an effort to discuss how this knowledge 
can be applied to real-life concerns and, in various ways, try to encourage a critical 
evaluation of this knowledge.
Nonetheless, we do assert, with perfect seriousness, that our book is unique. 
We wrote it because we felt that the available textbooks, however excellent, 
shared one extremely important shortcoming. Namely, they assumed that 
students are consumers of knowledge. In this model, the students’ job is to read, 
absorb and sometimes critically evaluate the material delivered in the textbook. 
The problem is that you need to be so much more than this, whether you intend 
to go on to further academic or professional training in psychology, or embark 
on a career in another field. Success in so many endeavours depends on being 
open-minded, creative and persuasive; on being able to find and synthesize infor-
mation, identify and solve problems, and put solutions to the test. In short, all 
students should aspire to be producers, as well as consumers, of knowledge. This 
means they should not be content simply to be taught, but should strive to 
develop the skills and confidence to teach themselves, and then to communicate 
their insights to others. This is the philosophy that lies behind our book, and 
which makes it unique. 
Like other textbooks, it sets out to communicate science in a clear and inter-
esting way; something we, as teachers, researchers and consultants, have always 
loved doing. But it also provides you with many opportunities to find and synthe-
size information for yourself, to solve real-world problems, to experience and

design research, and to communicate your ideas. Textbooks in other disciplines 
(e.g., maths, statistics) are routinely interactive, in the sense that they provide 
exercises for students. However, this remains highly unusual in psychology, and 
no other social psychology textbook is as interactive as ours. This philosophy 
underpins several exercises and other features that are unusual in social psychology 
textbooks. The three types of features in this book are feature boxes, within-
chapter exercises, and end-of-chapter exercises. 
Tour of the book
We hope that by the time you have finished reading this book, you are familiar 
with the main methods by which findings and ideas are produced in social 
psychology, conscious of their applicability to real-world problems, able to criti-
cally evaluate them, and prepared not just to read but to do research. Our feature 
boxes address each of these learning objectives. Each one considers a topic in 
depth and concludes with questions to guide further learning. 
Ethics and research methods
The ethics and research features focus on an important ethical or methodological 
issue relevant to social psychological research. For example, in Chapter 9, we 
examine the ethical issues surrounding one of social psychology’s most famous 
experiments, where Stanley Milgram had participants believe they were delivering 
strong electrical shocks to another person. 
Social psychology in the real world
Social psychology is a far-reaching discipline and addresses social issues that are 
relevant to people’s everyday lives in the past, present and future. The social 
psychology in the real world features ask you to consider the social psychological 
dimension of real-world issues, such as anti-smoking campaigns (Chapter 6), road 
rage (Chapter 10), homophobia (Chapter 11), racism in politics (Chapter 12), 
alcohol-fuelled aggression (Chapter 13) and the global financial crisis (Chapter 14). 
Critical focus
The critical focus features encourage you to critically examine well-known and 
influential findings and concepts in social psychology. Some of the features 
re-examine a ‘classic’ social psychology study from the 1960s and 70s, the findings 
and conclusions of which have, until recently, been treated most of the time as 
accepted wisdom. Other critical focus theories examine some of the most high-
profile recent developments in social psychology, such as ‘ego depletion’ (Chapter 
2) and ‘embodied social cognition’ (Chapter 4), both of which cast doubt on the 
traditional idea that the mind can be considered separate from the body.

Preface
Student projects 
As students of psychology, you will probably be required to complete a research 
project in which you collect and analyse your own data. Chapters 1–14 feature an 
example from a student who has recently conducted their project on a social 
psychology topic. Each student explains their research question, why they were 
interested in answering that question, what methods they used, what their find-
ings were and what they mean. They also tell us what they are doing now and 
offer some advice based on their experiences. These features are designed to help 
you prepare for your project with confidence and inspiration. They also highlight 
how your degree prepares you for a range of career paths. 
Within-chapter exercises
Each chapter contains several smaller exercises designed to enable you to gain 
‘hands-on’ experience with social psychological research, and to think critically 
about the investigations we have highlighted. 
Note that your lecturer may give you guidance on how much you should 
engage with the within-chapter and end-of-chapter questions and exercises. you 
can read this textbook and learn much from it without completing them. If you do 
attempt these exercises, it is definitely best to try to work through them independ-
ently before seeking guidance. But some of them are more challenging or difficult 
than others. So don’t worry if you get stuck on some. 
Try it yourself
In the try it yourself exercises, you have an opportunity to gain practical experi-
ence of the studies you are learning about. For example, in Chapter 2, you will 
have direct experience of experimental procedures designed to make you intensely 
conscious of the inevitability of your own death. In the same chapter, you will be 
able to take the creativity test that is used in an experiment described in the text. 
Questions in the exercises will help you reflect critically and creatively on the 
research methods you have experienced. 
Time to reflect
Time to reflect exercises are designed to encourage active, critical or creative 
thinking about the material. This kind of thinking can be daunting, so the exercises 
are set up to guide you through the process. For example, in Chapter 2, you are 
asked to critically evaluate gallup’s ‘mirror test’, widely used as an indicator of 
self-awareness among young children and animals. you are asked to think of 
reasons why a child or animal might ‘fail’ the test even though they are self-aware 
(i.e., the test produces false negatives), and may ‘pass’ the test even though they 
are not self-aware in the full sense of the term.

Preface
Exploring further
Each chapter features approximately five brief exploring further exercises, 
designed to encourage you to find out further information about the material, 
typically using the internet. you may be asked to search the literature for further 
information about a topic, find online demonstrations, or find relevant material 
from news, history or popular culture. you are encouraged to develop the skills 
and mindset of a researcher, and also to enhance your knowledge and under-
standing of the material. For example, in Chapter 2, there is an exercise on the 
measurement of self-esteem. you are asked to search the literature to find articles 
that advocate different ways of measuring self-esteem, and also to find two of 
these measures and complete them yourselves. 
End-of-chapter exercises
At the end of each chapter, we include two exercises designed for you to think 
about ways of extending existing research. 
Applying social psychology
In the applying social psychology exercises, you will explore how the findings and 
ideas you have read about can be applied to real-life problems. The exercises vary 
in length and format so that you can practise a range of skills, including critical 
thinking, synthesis, problem-solving, and communicating your ideas clearly, 
concisely and persuasively. Often, they put you in the shoes of a professional who 
needs to solve a problem. For example, you may be asked to imagine you are 
working for a school that needs to encourage healthy eating by its pupils (Chapter 
2), a charity facing a public relations crisis (Chapter 3), or an educational profes-
sional who needs to defend social and club activities from budget cuts (Chapter 8). 
Blind spot in social psychology
In the blind spot in social psychology exercises, you will encounter untested ideas 
and neglected topics in the field. Social psychology is a young science in which 
much remains to be discovered. The joy of this is that it is possible for you to 
explore new ideas and consider theoretically and practically important studies that 
have never been done before. These exercises encourage you to consider how the 
research covered in this book can be extended and how to open up new avenues 
for research.
The structure of the book
The philosophy behind this book also led us to add a distinctive chapter at its 
conclusion. Chapter 15 takes an overview of social psychology, summarizing its 
key points of wisdom. The wisdom of social psychology will help not only in 
your studies but also in your life beyond university. It discusses some of the main 
problems and controversies in the discipline. It then covers the skills that you can

Preface
(and employers do) expect your studies to give you. Thus, you can see Chapter 15 
as your guide in reflecting on what you have learned and what you might do with 
your knowledge. 
Before you get to Chapter 15, you’ll have read the introductory chapter, which 
outlines the history, principles and methods of social psychology. The rest of the 
chapters are organized in four parts; as you move through them, the focus shifts 
from the individual to larger social groups. Part 1 (Thinking and feeling) explores 
how individuals understand, evaluate and navigate through their social world. 
Part 2 (Relating) considers how people influence and bond with each other. Part 3 
(Belonging) examines the formation of social groups and their central importance 
in our lives. Part 4 (Applying) explores how the concepts, findings and methods of 
social psychology can be applied to improve relations between groups, to reduce 
aggression and foster cooperation and kindness. 
That concludes our guided tour of this book. Now, you are ready to start 
reading the chapters and engaging with the ideas, findings and techniques of 
social psychology.

Questions to consider
1 In the midst of the riots in England during august 2011, 
British Prime Minister David Cameron argued that: ‘This 
is criminality pure and simple, and it must be confronted 
and defeated.’ Many other media reports labelled 
the incidents as ‘mindless violence’. Was this a fair 
assessment of the situation?
2 a social psychologist is interested in how media 
representations of gender roles have changed over the 
past 30 years. What research method(s) would enable 
the researcher to examine this question and what are 
the advantages and disadvantages of each?
3 at a party, a social psychologist tells a friend about 
their research, explaining that most of their findings 
come from studies where the participants were 
undergraduates. Their friend says that these findings 
cannot tell us anything about humans in general. Is the 
friend correct?

Social Psychology
In August 2011, London and other English cities were embroiled in riots and 
looting. Buildings were burning, cars were being overturned, police were being 
charged by groups of tens, sometimes hundreds of masked youths, and retail 
stores were being ransacked – ranging from major department stores and elec-
tronic retailers to family-run florists and party suppliers. The theft and disorder 
were shocking and unprecedented. As social psychologists, we have a professional 
interest, and arguably a duty, to explain why this happened. Naturally, social 
psychologists are not alone in wanting to know why these events took place. Resi-
dents of affected neighbourhoods saw their streets become a no-go zone and 
people in the rest of the country were wondering whether the rioting would 
spread like a contagion and bring chaos to their neighbourhoods. They also 
worried what the disorder said about the state of the society in which they live. As 
we shall see throughout this book, when powerful events affect people’s lives, they 
want to know what has caused them. 
The media were awash with debate and commentary about what caused the 
violence and disorder. According to some, the rioting was an inevitable response 
to disadvantage, despair, frustration and anger among young people, in principally 
poor and black areas of London. According to others, the rioting should be seen 
as sheer criminality; government cuts had barely taken effect and helping oneself 
to a TV from a department store can scarcely be seen as political action. For people 
advocating this perspective, the rioting reflected the actions of a small minority of 
people from deprived communities who have been raised with insufficient parental 
guidance and respect for authority or the rule of law (Reicher and Stott, 2011). 
Who is right? In the words of one commentator on a bulletin board: ‘Is this 
really the work of mindless yobs with no cause or the backlash from a frustrated 
and marginalized youth?’ We do not have an easy answer to give you here. 
However, it is worth pausing to reflect on what it means to think about, and 
investigate, the causes of events like the riots as a social psychologist. Certainly, 
one of our main aims in writing this book is that, by its end, you will feel comfort-
able in adopting a social psychological perspective when thinking about events in 
your life and in the wider world around you. 
A second major lesson we hope you take away from your study of social 
psychology is that, typically, no one cause, or no one explanation, has a monopoly 
on the truth. People think, act and feel as they do for many reasons. It is thus 
perfectly plausible that the riots might be a product of widespread frustration 
among disadvantaged groups in English cities and the actions of a criminal 
minority, brought up with scant parental discipline. Sometimes multiple causes of 
our behaviour affect us at the same time, but independently of each other, 
combining to be a powerful enough force to shape the way we act. Thus, neither 
disadvantage nor an ill-disciplined upbringing may be enough on their own to get 
people out on the streets, wreaking havoc. But together, they are enough. 
Causes can combine in different ways. Sometimes they interact. The effect of 
one cause, like poverty, on an outcome such as rioting may depend on the pres-
ence, absence or extent of another cause, such as a dysfunctional upbringing. Such

an interaction effect is shown in Figure 1.1a. Here, the relationship between an 
individual’s poverty and the likelihood that they would participate in rioting 
depends on – in other words, is moderated by – their family upbringing. People 
who have childhoods that have equipped them with self-discipline and concern 
for others may not respond in the same way to their poverty as children who have 
not been so fortunate to be born into more functional families. For example, they 
may engage in lawful political activism, social work, or intensified investment in 
their education and career. 
Sometimes, causes combine to form chains – A causes B and B causes C, like 
dominoes falling into each other. For example, long-term poverty and disadvan-
tage may mean that a disproportionate number of poorer parents are forced to 
work long hours, or are beset with social and psychological problems such as 
addiction and lack of wider family support. Thus, disadvantage and despair, far 
from being an alternative explanation for the rioting, may actually help explain 
why so many young people are ill-disciplined. This kind of effect is known as 
mediation. The effect of poverty is mediated by the increase in dysfunctional fami-
lies (Figure 1.1b). This recognition that normally not one but multiple causes 
shape our behaviour is one of the key characteristics that makes social psycholog-
ical explanations different from the ones that people typically come up with in 
everyday life. 
FigurE 1.1 Two ways variables can combine to produce effects
interaction effect Different 
causes may interact with each 
other to produce changes 
in a dependent variable (a 
and B interact to bring about 
changes in C).
Moderation This occurs when 
the relationship between 
two variables depends on a 
third variable (a causes C, but 
is also dependent on levels 
of B). 
Mediation This occurs when 
the relationship between two 
variables is explained by a 
third variable (a causes B and 
B causes C).
(a) Here, the effect of individuals’ poverty on their rioting 
behaviour is moderated by the type of family they grew up 
in. Poverty increases the chances of rioting, and being from 
a dysfunctional family also increases the chances of rioting. 
However, poverty increases the odds of rioting more strongly 
when a person is also from a dysfunctional family. Another way 
to look at the same interaction effect is that the effect of being 
from a dysfunctional family depends on whether one is poor 
or not. Family background has little or no effect at low levels 
of poverty, but has a substantial effect at higher levels. Both 
ways of looking at the interaction effect may be legitimate, but 
normally researchers prefer to be informed by theories that tell 
them which of two or more causes is playing an active role, and 
which cause operates principally by strengthening, weakening, 
or even reversing the effect of the other. Researchers normally 
conduct statistical analyses on their results to see whether the 
‘main effects’ of each variable and the ‘interaction effect’ of the 
two combined are greater than would be expected by chance 
alone. Factorial analysis of variance (ANOVA) is a statistical 
technique commonly used to do this.
(b) Here, as poverty increases, so does the extent of family 
dysfunction, which in turn causes rioting. Thus, we can say that 
poverty causes rioting because it increases family dysfunction. 
There may also be a ‘direct effect’ of poverty on rioting, but for 
the sake of simplicity, this is not shown in the diagram. Once 
again, researchers will run analyses to test whether ‘indirect 
effects’ as shown here are statistically significant, that is, greater 
than would normally occur by chance alone. It is important to 
note that mediation and moderation can happen at the same 
time, that is, both panels may capture an element of the truth 
about the causes of riots such as those occurring in England in 
August 2011.

Social Psychology
Another crucial point is that social psychological explanations are informed, 
and constrained, by research evidence. As social psychologists, we are not entirely 
free of bias. Nonetheless, we try to select explanations on the basis of whether 
they are supported by evidence. In other words, we try to select explanations that 
are most likely to be true, rather than the ones we like the most for other reasons. 
Although most commentators are united in condemning the looting and rioting of 
August 2011, their preference for the ‘despair’ versus ‘ill-discipline’ explanations 
seemed, quite clearly, to depend on their political leanings. Conservative or right-
wing commentators emphasized the lack of civil order, effective policing, depend-
ency on welfare benefits, and soft punishments in the criminal justice system. 
Liberal or left-wing commentators, in contrast, tended to point to youth unem-
ployment, government cutbacks, and an alleged increase in the frequency of riots 
under conservative governments (Reicher and Stott, 2011). 
Exploring further Use google or a similar internet search engine to find different explanations of the causes of 
the English riots. For example, try combining terms such as ‘2011’, ‘riots’, ‘England’ and ‘causes’. Find several 
attempts to explain the riots. What kinds of explanations do you uncover? Do different types of commentators 
express their explanations more forcefully, and with greater certainty?
As social psychologists, we must, however reluctantly, put our personal prefer-
ences aside. Instead, we look for theories and research evidence to guide us in 
evaluating whether either or both of these causes in tandem can bring about forms 
of aggressive and antisocial behaviour. We would naturally be sceptical about 
either explanation until we saw a good deal of corroborating evidence. Is there 
evidence that similar forms of behaviour are more common under harsh economic 
conditions, or among people who perceive that their prospects for legitimate 
advancement are poor? Is there evidence that links parenting style and liberal 
criminal justice policies to increases in disorder? Is there evidence that the two 
combine? How well designed was the research that produced this evidence? 
Thus, one of the other major lessons we hope you take away from this textbook 
is that, in social psychology, we seek and evaluate research evidence before making, 
or accepting, claims about the causes of social behaviour. If the evidence and logic 
are sufficiently compelling, this can lead us to rejecting beliefs about human nature 
that we may once have cherished. It can also lead us to accept conclusions that we 
would rather not believe. But always, this scientific standpoint means that we are 
aware of uncertainty. Findings are facts, so we can say with confidence that a 
certain study has produced certain results. As facts and theories accumulate, we 
can become gradually more certain. However, there is always significant uncer-
tainty when applying this knowledge to explain an event such as the August 2011 
English riots. It is difficult to rule out other causes, or to say definitively that ill 
discipline during childhood has played a significant causal role in this case. This 
distinguishes scientific and, therefore, social psychological explanations from 
many that are offered in day-to-day life. Many people will confidently assert that 
‘these riots have nothing to do with poverty’, or ‘these riots are the government’s 
chickens coming home to roost’. To put it politely, these assertions are seldom

The discipline of social psychology
informed by an exhaustive knowledge of fact and theory. In contrast, social 
psychologists will seldom rule out alternative explanations with such confidence. 
Therefore, a third lesson we hope you take away from this book is that the 
scientific approach taken by most social psychologists means that we recognize 
uncertainty. We build theories and do research to reduce this uncertainty, but 
scientific progress always means that we discover not only new facts, but new 
questions. Social psychology is a relatively young discipline, being barely a 
century old, and there is much to learn. This presents exciting opportunities for 
people to learn about the topic. Again and again in this book, we will highlight 
gaps and blind spots in social psychology, and invite you to think of research that 
might be done to cast light on unanswered questions. However, much has already 
been learned. Social psychologists have discovered much about the factors 
affecting mental health, the quality of relationships, aggression, generosity, love, 
conflict and peace, to name but a few topics. These insights have been translated 
into programmes that are bringing about clear improvements to people’s lives. 
Nonetheless, there is always the potential to doubt, to wonder why and what if, 
not only to satisfy our natural curiosity but also to make possible further improve-
ments and advances in the field. 
Now, let us get started. We will begin this chapter by defining social psychology 
and explaining how it is done, before guiding you through the many topics that 
have been studied by social psychologists in the following chapters. As we move 
through this chapter, we will discuss the origins and history of social psychology 
from the emergence of the discipline at the beginning of the 20th century, through 
the major influences on the discipline and to the current state of the art. The 
chapter then focuses on the ways in which social psychological research is done. 
What is social psychology? 
Scholars in many disciplines such as sociology, linguistics, social anthropology, 
philosophy and biology have long been interested in how people relate to one 
other and how they negotiate their way through a complex social world. The 
discipline of social psychology has drawn upon insights and knowledge from these 
academic subjects – and indeed other branches of psychology, such as cognitive, 
biological, developmental, organizational, clinical, health and personality 
psychology – to develop an understanding of how people navigate the complexi-
ties of their relationships with others and the social environment in which they 
live. Social psychology is broadly defined as the branch of psychology dedicated 
to the study of how people think about, influence and relate to each other. 
It is an extremely complex and intriguing discipline. No two individuals, social 
encounters or relationships are exactly the same. Any number of forces operate at 
once to shape social events, including moods, attitudes, values, stress, the weather, 
religion, culture and so on. To deal with this variety and complexity, a range of 
sub-topics are studied under the umbrella of social psychology. In this book, we

each other.

Social Psychology
approach the different sub-topics of social psychology as they have been grouped 
and studied by social psychologists over the history of the discipline. Of course, 
there is a significant amount of overlap in the way social psychologists study these 
particular topics. For example, a researcher interested in communication may also 
focus on relations between and within groups. A researcher interested in attitudes 
may also focus on social influence and persuasion. The topics are not therefore 
mutually exclusive but can nevertheless be organized into general areas that social 
psychologists have studied in an attempt to understand human social behaviour 
(see Figure 1.2).
Specifically, 
some 
social 
psychologists study processes 
occurring within the individual, 
that is, aspects of the self, beliefs 
and attitudes. The study of these 
topics is approached in this text 
as the study of thinking and 
feeling (Part 1), focusing on how 
people understand themselves 
and others, and how they judge 
the social world. Other social 
psychologists study relation-
ships 
between 
others, 
as 
presented in the part on relating 
(Part 2), focusing on the study 
of communication, persuasion 
and close relationships. Further, social psychologists also study people’s belonging 
to small and larger social groups, studying how groups influence who we are and 
how they influence our behaviour (Part 3). Others apply basic social psychological 
knowledge to social issues such as aggression, social harmony and justice, and 
address societal problems in areas such as business, education and health (Part 4). 
What ties these sub-disciplines together is the general aim to further knowledge 
about the relationships between people and the social world. The focus on how 
people are affected by the actual or implied presence of others (Allport, 1954) is 
what makes this branch of psychology social. 
Here, we first focus on social psychology as a scientific discipline that uses the 
scientific method of collecting data, or results, to devise and empirically test theo-
ries about human nature. Just like the so-called ‘hard sciences’ such as biology and 
physics, many social psychologists empirically put theories to the test to make 
discoveries, draw conclusions and refine theories for future investigations. They 
test what are thought to be more or less universal laws of human nature. Researchers 
are typically aware that people from different cultures or with different personali-
ties and experiences may behave differently. However, they normally assume that 
even these differences can be explained by more general principles. To go back to 
Scientific discipline a branch 
of study that involves the 
gathering of data to test 
hypotheses that are derived 
from theories.

that aim to explain a 
phenomenon.

The discipline of social psychology
our riots example, you can imagine that a researcher finds that growing up in a 
dysfunctional family is a major predictor of rioting behaviour, and publishes that 
finding. The same researcher, or perhaps a different researcher, might then reason 
that the effect of family dysfunction on rioting may depend on poverty. So they do 
a study that examines the effects of both variables  – family characteristics and 
economic circumstances. They find the predicted ‘interaction effect’ and publish 
those findings. The discipline therefore develops through the same processes as 
other sciences. Of course, we can use the word ‘discipline’ here with two different 
meanings. First, social psychology is a discipline, or subject area of study. Second, 
as a scientific discipline it also requires rigour that is necessary for scientific enquiry. 
We therefore spend some time towards the end of the chapter focusing on the 
methods with which the science of social psychology is done. 
However, not all social psychologists consider the discipline to be a science. 
Specifically, critical social psychologists argue that there are no universal laws when it 
comes to human nature (e.g., Harré, 1997). Critical social psychologists argue that 
when contexts change (e.g., time and place), so do social rules and conventions. 
According to this perspective, it is impossible to explain human behaviour using 
theories of universal principles because these principles constantly change depending 
on the context. The term ‘critical’ is not explicitly meant to imply that mainstream 
social psychologists are uncritical. Instead, the term is one that is used in sociology 
(critical theory) which concerns the examination and critique of society and culture. 
Towards the end of the chapter, we focus on some of the methods used by critical 
social psychologists to study key issues in social psychology. 
The two ‘camps’ of social psychology, although both address similar issues and 
are concerned with the same types of social problems, are often in a ‘battle’ with 
each other (e.g., Stainton Rogers, 2011). A minority of social psychologists adopt 
both approaches, but, typically, social psychologists identify themselves as either 
mainstream or critical social psychologists and, indeed, both feel strongly attached 
to the epistemological assumptions they make and the methods they use. However, 
although the two approaches may seem antagonistic and impossible to integrate, it 
is essential for students of social psychology to understand and appreciate the 
strengths (and limitations) of both approaches. We explore these throughout the 
chapter and the book. 
Where does social psychology come from?
Although social psychology has drawn on insights from other areas of psychology 
and other academic disciplines, it is itself a relatively recent discipline. To under-
stand social psychology, some knowledge of its historical context is necessary. 
This section provides an overview of where social psychology has come from and 
how it has evolved over the decades. We also present some of the challenges that 
have faced the discipline over the years.
Critical social psychology 
an alternative to mainstream 
(often termed experimental) 
social psychology arguing that 
mainstream social psychology 
is limited by its focus on 
‘universals’ of human nature, 
which do not exist.

Social Psychology
Early social psychology
The basic questions in social psychology have been the interest of scholars for many 
centuries. However, it is possible to trace some of the early influences for the disci-
pline of social psychology as we know it today. In the 18th century, British scholars 
such as David Hume ([1741]1985) and Adam Smith ([1759]2007) wrote about 
matters related to social psychology. For example, Hume wrote about how people 
learn to explain events in their lives, by observing what causes tend to correspond 
with what effects. Hume’s writings were, in many respects, the beginning of ‘attri-
bution theory’, the study of how people explain events, which we will encounter in 
Chapter 3. Smith wrote about emotions and morality, and their influence on how 
people trade and exchange goods with each other. His writings have been influential 
in the social psychological study of emotions (Chapter 4), and justice (Chapter 14). 
Eighteenth-century German scholars such as Immanuel Kant, Wilhelm von 
Humboldt and Johann Friedrich Herbart, and the French scholar Auguste Comte 
also wrote about issues that are of interest to modern-day social psychologists. Kant 
wrote about the self and the self image, Herbart argued that society was a vital aspect 
of human existence (Chapter 8), Humboldt stressed the relationship between 
language and thought (Chapter 5), and Comte argued that social processes could be 
examined using the same methods as those used in the natural sciences (Chapter 1, 
and throughout this book). Thus, social psychology has its origins in the British, 
German and French scholars of the 18th century. Indeed, Herbart and Comte are 
viewed by many as being the ‘fathers’ of social psychology.
In the late 19th century, a group of German scholars, largely inspired by the 
writing of Herbart, began to study the concept of the ‘collective mind’. In contrast 
to the ‘individual mind’, which was the focus of early forms of general psychology, 
the collective mind referred to the way in which people think about society, but 
also the way groups form a ‘mind’ of their own. Specifically, people who belong to 
the same social group or groups tend to think in the same way, have the same 
values and observe the same norms. This discipline was referred to as Völkerpsy-
chologie (folk psychology or ‘psychology of the people’) and is also associated 
with the work of Wilhelm Wundt, who argued that individual and social 
psychology were distinct phenomena, and that individual consciousness was 
influenced by social customs and morals. 
Völkerpsychologie also had a significant influence on how early theorists 
viewed the behaviour of groups. As you will see in Chapter 10 when group behav-
iour is discussed in detail, theorists such as Gustave Le Bon ([1896]1908) and 
William McDougall (1920) viewed the group as possessing a ‘group mind’, in 
which ideas and notions become ‘contagious’, much like a disease, and spread 
throughout the group. According to this view, people in large groups can lose a 
sense of their individuality and often behave in primitive antisocial ways that they 
would not even consider when acting alone. As we will see, this perspective led to 
a rather pessimistic outlook on groups and group behaviour. However, these early 
ideas helped us to appreciate that in order to understand human behaviour, we 
need to appreciate individuals as part of collectives and groups (Asch, 1951).

The discipline of social psychology
Social psychology began to assert its individuality as a discipline with a series of 
texts written by various authors (e.g., Baldwin, 1897; Bunge, 1903; McDougall, 
1919; Orano, 1901), each exploring a variety of social psychological topics such as 
emotions, morals and individual character. McDougall (1919) argued strongly for 
the separation of social psychology from sociology and anthropology, while also 
arguing that social processes should be studied experimentally. Arguably, however, 
social psychology was first established as a distinct discipline at the beginning of 
the 20th century with the publication of Floyd Allport’s (1924) book Social 
Psychology – an influential book that was subsequently adopted by teachers of 
psychology for many years. Inspired by the growth of experimental psychology 
in the USA, Allport argued that social psychology would develop as a discipline if 
it approached its questions as an experimental science. Others followed this 
perspective (e.g., Murphy and Murphy, 1931) and this North American approach 
to social psychology rapidly replaced the German tradition.
Early work in social psychology was also strongly influenced by behaviourism. 
In the early 20th century, there was a surge of research, especially animal research, 
focusing on the impact of positive and negative events on behaviour. Put quite 
simply, behaviourists argued that behaviour that was followed with a reward 
would continue, whereas behaviour that was followed by punishment would not. 
Animals (and people) could therefore be ‘trained’ to perform desired behaviours 
as long as they were rewarded for performing them (Figure 1.3). Much research 
supported this premise, showing that, for example, pigeons could be trained to 
move around in a circle, or nod if the behaviour was reinforced with a food reward 
(Skinner, 1938). 
The behaviourist approach has been very influential in social psychology. Many 
social psychologists argue that people form attitudes and perform behaviours 
because they either have their own attitudes and behaviours reinforced, or they 
observe the attitudes and behaviours of others being rewarded. For example, chil-
dren develop negative attitudes about social groups from observing their parents 
(Aboud and Doyle, 1996; Castelli, Zogmaister and Tomelleri, 2009; Hughes, 
Rodriguez, Smith et al., 2006). Children who watch TV programmes or play video 
games in which characters’ violence is rewarded become more violent than chil-
dren who do not (Anderson, 2002; Eron, 1963; Huesmann, Moise-Titus, Podolski 
and Eron, 2003). Although the behaviourist approach explains a great deal of 
social behaviour, it has also been criticized for being simplistic. It is difficult to 
reconcile some more complex social phenomena (e.g., thoughts, attitudes, 
emotions) with the simplicity of the social learning approach. For example, a 
reward may not necessarily lead to behavioural reinforcement for all the right 
reasons. A child who is rewarded with treats to practise piano may play the piano 
but rather unwillingly. They may be more motivated by the extrinsic reward (the 
treat) rather than the intended intrinsic reward of learning to play the piano well. 
If you are motivated only by extrinsic rewards, there’s a good chance you will not 
enjoy the task as much, or do it as well, as someone who is motivated by intrinsic 
rewards (Deci and Ryan, 2000).

Behaviour can be misleading 
and can be the result of other 
motivations. For example, 
promising a child treats in 
exchange for practising the 
piano might make them play 
more but not because of their 
love of music.

Social Psychology
Partly as a consequence of this limitation, gestalt psychology emerged, empha-
sizing the importance of looking at a whole object and how it appears to people, 
rather than focusing on specific aspects of the object. The word ‘Gestalt’ comes 
from German and means ‘shape’. It is a word used in English to refer to the 
concept of ‘wholeness’. Using the example in Figure 1.4, a Gestalt psychologist 
would argue that it is impossible to see the Dalmatian by focusing on any of the 
black or white spaces in the picture, nor can it be identified in parts (e.g., the tail, 
feet, head). When asked to focus on the picture as a whole, the image of the dog 
emerges to the perceiver and it appears all at once. It can only be perceived and 
appreciated as a whole object. 
How is this relevant to social psychology? Gestalt psychologists argued that 
perception was important in determining attitudes and behaviours. In particular, 
Kurt Lewin created a framework called force field analysis (Lewin, 1943) that 
expressed human dynamics in the form of a map (see Figure 1.5). The map consists 
of a person’s needs, desires and goals, and arrows indicate the directions and 
strengths of these forces. All these social forces operated as a Gestalt. Lewin’s 
theory inspired the work of many other social psychologists, such as Muzafer 
Sherif, Solomon Asch and Leon Festinger, whose work you will read about 
throughout this book. 
Historical context
It is also important to consider the historical context surrounding the development 
of social psychology. Earlier, we mentioned William McDougall (1919), whose 
arguments were largely influenced by Darwinian evolutionary theory – a perspec-
tive that was a dominant theme in anthropological and sociological research at the 
time. However, his arguments about human nature based on evolutionary theory 
were often ideologically driven and supremacist. Specifically, his social scientific 
gestalt psychology approach 
proposing that objects are 
viewed in a holistic sense.

The discipline of social psychology
explanations, and others at the time, were motivated by the desire to explain the 
differences between ‘civilized’ or evolved (that is, Western) people and ‘uncivilized’ 
or not yet evolved (that is, non-Western) people (Baumgardner, 1977). 
The social backgrounds of the scholars themselves have also strongly influenced 
the development of social psychology. For example, we spoke earlier about Kurt 
Lewin’s contributions to the influence of Gestalt principles on social psychology. 
Lewin was born into a Jewish family in Poland and served in the German army 
during the First World War. Forced to leave Germany in response to Hitler’s 
Nazism, his subsequent research focused on the social problems and other factors 
that contribute to stereotyping and prejudice. Similarly, the research of Muzafer 
Sherif into group processes and group conflict (see Chapter 9) was surely influ-
enced by his own experience of Nazi persecution.
The atrocities of Nazi Germany have had a significant influence on social 
psychology. Much of the theory and research in social psychology has been 
inspired by the Holocaust (see Figure 1.6). 
For example, the early work on social influ-
ence and conformity (see Chapter 9) was 
largely a result of researchers wanting to 
explain why people so readily complied with 
the requests of their superiors and what 
processes could possibly explain the atrocities 
that occurred. Also, the study and theories of 
social loafing and bystander intervention (see 
Chapters 10 and 14) have been informed by 
the events of the Holocaust. For example, 
how do we explain why people sometimes 
idly stand by and let bad things happen? This

and exercises), or you can 
decrease the restraining 
forces (e.g., by procrastinating 
less, or taking on less paid

impact can also be seen in the range of topics that social psychologists study – 
many of which involve the study of ‘evil’ or antisocial behaviours such as aggres-
sion and discrimination. More recently, however, social psychologists have started 
to focus on positive social behaviours such as charity work and volunteering. 
Indeed, a branch of psychology has developed in recent years – positive social 
psychology – which focuses on the positive aspects of human nature, such as what 
makes people happy, what factors contribute to life satisfaction, and the study of 
people qualities (e.g., Seligman, 2002; Seligman and Csikszentmihalyi, 2000; 
Seligman, Steen, Park and Peterson, 2005). 
Social psychologists continue to be influenced by real-world social problems 
and social events. For example, many social psychologists study the impact of new 
media and technology on social interaction (e.g., Bargh and McKenna, 2004; 
Joinson, McKenna, Postmes and Reips, 2007; McKenna and Bargh, 2000). Social 
interaction within the workplace is also an important area of research (e.g., 
Haslam, Postmes and Ellemers, 2003; Katz and Kahn, 1978), as are the social 
psychological factors that influence health behaviours such as the decision to quit 
smoking (e.g., Fishbein, 1982; Stroebe, 2000). Some social psychologists study the 
topical issues of rioting and hooliganism (e.g., Cronin and Reicher, 2009; Stott, 
Adang, Livingstone and Schreiber, 2007). In short, social psychologists ‘move 
with the times’ and study important social problems as they emerge. In Chapter 
15, we go into depth on some of the ways in which social psychologists address 
social problems. 
Time to reflect We have talked about how social psychology has been inspired by events such as the holocaust. 
From what you know about social psychology so far, can you think of two other examples of societal issues, events 
or problems that might be investigated by a social psychologist?
Doing social psychological research
The need for empirical investigation
Much of social psychology focuses on real-world questions and issues. For 
example, we want to understand the origins of prejudice and discrimination. We 
want to know why some people are shy at parties and others are more outgoing. 
We want to understand how to form better friendships and relationships. We want 
to know how to persuade someone to go out on a date. The list goes on. Because 
many social psychological questions lie at the heart of human nature, people have 
often already formulated some of the answers for themselves. However, with this 
‘lay understanding’ of social psychology comes a problem – many social psycho-
logical findings are seen as ‘common sense’.
Much of this perception stems from what is known as hindsight bias, or the ‘i 
knew it all along’ effect. This refers to the tendency for people to see a given outcome 
as inevitable once the actual outcome is known (Bernstein, Erdfelder, Meltzoff et 
al., 2011; Blank, Musch and Pohl, 2008; Bradfield and Wells, 2005; Fischhoff, 
Gonzalez, Lerner and Small, 2005). It is particularly relevant to social psychology

The discipline of social psychology
because much of the research in social psychology deals with everyday, ordinary 
aspects of human thinking and behaviour. Therefore, when a person reads about a 
social psychological finding in the newspaper, they are likely to see it as something 
that was obvious, or easy to predict. However, this is, quite simply, a bias. People 
who are naive to the outcome are significantly less likely to predict it. Some impor-
tant findings in social psychology may seem obvious in hindsight. We highlight a 
few examples in the practical activity below. 
Try it yourself here are some common findings in social psychology. are they obvious, or only in hindsight? you 
may like to cover the right-hand column and examine the accuracy of your predictions. 
Question
outcome
Is it true, as noted by a common English idiom, that familiarity 
breeds contempt? or, do birds of a feather flock together?
In general, we tend to like people with whom we are more 
familiar. Familiarity is associated with increased liking (Chapter 7)
Does thinking about death make a person feel more helpless, 
patriotic or selfish?
They are likely to feel more patriotic. Thinking about the 
inevitability of death makes people think more about the values 
that are important to them (Chapter 8)
If someone asked you to do a favour for them, would you like 
them more or less?
If we do a favour for someone, findings suggest that we like them 
more (Chapter 4)
If someone asked you to write an essay that went against your 
beliefs, would you feel better about it if you were paid nothing, a 
little, or a lot?
People tend to feel better about being untrue to their attitudes if 
they are paid nothing at all, or just a small amount (Chapter 4)
As we mentioned earlier, most people see themselves as lay social psychologists. 
Indeed, people do have a reasonable intuitive understanding of social behaviour 
even though they fall foul to the hindsight bias. However, a key difference between 
laypeople and social psychologists is that social psychologists – that is, mainstream 
social psychologists – devise theories to answer questions scientifically. They use a 
wide variety of research methods to test hypotheses, or testable predictions, about 
human social processes. 
Researchers begin by asking a research question. For example, social psycholo-
gists might ask if powerlessness makes people more likely to believe in conspiracy 
theories, or if money makes people happy. The research question guides the 
research that is done. However, a social psychologist typically has an idea what 
to expect. The use of the scientific method involves the formulation of testable 
hypotheses (that is, what the social psychologists expect) that are based on theo-
ries and previous research, and the testing of those hypotheses with the aim of 
answering the research question. A simple depiction of the scientific method is 
presented in Figure 1.7.
A great deal of social psychological work is theory driven, that is, the research 
question itself derives from a set of assumptions and propositions that organize 
the findings of previous research. For example, we will talk at length in later 
chapters about research that has been derived from theories such as social identity 
theory, system justification theory and social dominance theory. Theories are 
often modified as a result of the findings of empirical research. For example, if 
hypotheses are not supported, this means that the theory is also not supported. 
Either the theory is incorrect (and needs to be revised) or a new investigation

needs to be conducted that takes care of 
some potential flaws in the original 
investigation. Sometimes, when a study 
suffers some methodological flaws, these 
can influence the results and the study 
may not be a fair test of the hypotheses. 
Either way, research methods and theo-
ries are often modified as a result of 
empirical findings. 
It must be noted, however, that a 
theory can never be ‘proven’ to be true. If 
a theory is supported by empirical find-
ings, its predictive value is strengthened, 
but it can never completely be proven to 
be true, or be the one and only explana-
tion for the phenomenon of interest. 
Instead, it can be said not to be false. As 
Popper (1959) argued, scientific theories 
cannot be proven beyond doubt but they should nevertheless be falsifiable. It must 
therefore be possible to set up empirical investigations that disprove the theory. A 
theory can be seen as a plausible explanation of a phenomenon if researchers have 
failed to disprove it. As you read through this book, you will be able to identify 
many social psychological theories. As you encounter these theories, perhaps you 
can take some time to think about ways in which they might be falsified. 
On the other hand, some research is only loosely based on theory and is instead 
driven by a particular social phenomenon or social event. For example, we 
mentioned earlier a research question involving the connection between power-
lessness and beliefs in conspiracy theories. This type of research question is more 
driven by the motivation to explain a phenomenon (conspiracy beliefs) than 
applying a particular theoretical perspective. Or, a social psychologist may want 
to explain why the people of the USA almost universally rejoiced the death of 
Osama bin Laden in May 2011, but responses across the rest of the world were 
quite different. Why are people’s perceptions of terrorism often so dissimilar? 
Finally, following the example we used at the beginning of the chapter, a social 
psychologist may wish to explain why people rioted in England in August 2011. 
Research in social psychology is sometimes driven by a specific event rather than a 
theory. Of course, theories are crucial to the formulation of specific hypotheses, 
but the basic research question itself is sometimes driven by curiosity concerning 
a particular phenomenon. 
To illustrate, immediately after the death of Osama bin Laden, we, together 
with Karen Douglas’s PhD student Mike Wood, became curious about how 
several of the alternative ‘conspiracy theories’ about this event contradicted each 
other. On the one hand, doubters of the official story suggested he was still alive, 
while on the other, they suggested he had already been killed some years ago.

The discipline of social psychology
Similarly, contradictory conspiracy theories sprang up around the death of Prin-
cess Diana in the 1990s (she faked her own death, or was murdered by MI6). We 
ran a couple of studies showing that, strikingly, people who believed in one 
conspiracy theory were also more likely to believe in another conspiracy theory, 
even if the two theories were mutually contradictory (Osama is still alive, and is 
already dead). This was explained by the fact that people who did not believe the 
official account of events (that Osama was killed by US forces in Abbotobad) 
tended to believe in any alternative to it (Wood, Douglas and Sutton, 2012). 
According to some theories in social psychology, commitment to an overall or 
‘global’ belief (e.g., that authorities are deceitful and conspire against the popula-
tion) will drive people to adopt a range of specific or ‘local’ beliefs that support it, 
even though the specific beliefs may contradict each other (Adorno, Frenkel-
Brunswik, Levinson and Sanford, 1950). This research was not initially driven by 
theory, but in the end we were able to derive hypotheses from theory and put 
them to the test.  
Once the research question has been proposed and the hypothesis formulated, 
the social psychologist then needs to decide how to make the research happen. 
This leads into a discussion of some of the research ‘tools’ or methods at the 
disposal of social psychologists. However, before we move onto a discussion of 
specific research methods, we must mention one other aspect of the research 
process – that of critical thinking – and also discuss the critical social psychological 
approach to research. 
Critical thinking
Critical thinking is crucial to learning social psychology. In other words, a scholar 
of social psychology should appraise each piece of evidence they read and – based 
on what they know – see if they can develop alternative explanations. This is vital 
because sometimes a research finding is not everything it appears to be. For 
example, you might read a research paper arguing that religious people are 
happier and less stressed than non-religious people. What does this really mean? 
Are there other explanations? To understand this conclusion, it is necessary to 
critically examine the argument. To begin, a statement like this seems to imply 
that religion causes happiness and reduces stress (or the reverse for people with 
no religious beliefs). However, it is only the case that religious beliefs are associ-
ated with increased happiness and lower stress levels. It does not mean that one 
causes the other. Further, the statement may imply that the path leading from 
religion to happiness and low stress is a direct path, that is, no other factors are 
involved. However, what might really be occurring is an indirect relationship 
between the two factors through other variables. For instance, religious people 
may have more opportunity to get together in groups (e.g., at church). Their 
religious beliefs may also mean that they are more open-minded and creative. It 
may be these factors – social support and the psychological consequences of 
having religious beliefs – that lead to happiness and lower stress, rather than the 
religious beliefs themselves (e.g., Argyle, 1987, 2003). This is another example of

the causal mediation we discussed earlier. It demonstrates the importance of 
thinking critically about findings in social psychology, in other words, to not 
simply believe what you read. 
Question to consider In light of what you have read so far, reread question 1 at the start of the chapter. Critically 
evaluate the claims that the rioting was ‘criminality pure and simple’ and ‘mindless violence’. Critical thinking 
involves closely examining other potential explanations. What might some of these have been?
Critical social psychology
As mentioned earlier, not all social psychologists use the scientific method of 
hypothesis testing. In the 1960s and 70s, many social psychologists became 
concerned about the prominence of experimental social psychology focusing on 
social processes that occur at the level of the individual. European researchers 
such as Henri Tajfel (1972) and Serge Moscovici (1972) argued that because 
hypothesis testing tends to focus on rules that can predict individuals’ thinking 
and behaviour, social psychology was becoming less ‘social’ or, more specifically, 
less about social issues (see also Pepitone, 1981; Taylor and Brown, 1979). This 
was viewed as a ‘crisis’ for social psychology and researchers such as Tajfel and 
Moscovici conducted research endeavouring to put the ‘social’ back into ‘social 
psychology’. You will learn more about this crisis later in the Critical focus box. 
This perspective also led to the development of what we now know as critical 
social psychology, which focuses on the contexts of social behaviour and empha-
sizes the study of human behaviour with respect to people’s interactions with 
others. Critical social psychologists often see empirical work in social psychology 
as driven by a particular agenda, specifically an individualist agenda, and so argue 
that it is not ideologically neutral. Of course, these are debatable points. Most 
social psychologists would refuse to accept the criticism that social psychology as 
an empirical science is asocial. Throughout this textbook you will undoubtedly 
appreciate the breadth and depth of the investigations conducted by experimental 
social psychologists in particular. Also, it is a bold statement to criticize a scientist 
for having an explicit research agenda. Most would argue that empiricism is about 
discovery rather than simple confirmation of something we think we already 
know. However, the scientific method is not the only way of gaining knowledge 
about social psychology and how the social world is determined, in part, by the 
interactions of people within it (Stainton Rogers, 2011). 
A significant minority of social psychologists are critical social psychologists. 
Many can be further classified as working in the area of discursive psychology, 
which argues that discourse (e.g., talk, written language) is the primary means by 
which people construct, communicate and interpret social meaning (e.g., Edwards 
and Potter, 1992). Another type of social psychology relates to social construc-
tionism, which is informed by postmodernism (Nightingale and Crombie, 1999). 
Social constructionism emphasizes the way that social phenomena develop in 
social contexts. A social construct is a concept or activity that is a product 
(construct) of a particular group (Gergen, 1973, 1999; Jameson, 1991; Nicholson, 
1990). Critical social psychologists are informed by Marxist theory and feminist

theory (e.g., Bardwick., 1971; Burman, 2011), and by some of the influential work 
by Moscovici (1961) on social representations, or the study of shared beliefs and 
values that are held by a culture or group. This research challenges the assumption 
that people all share a common view, because they often come from radically 
different cultures with different shared assumptions. Thus, what we may call 
mainstream social psychologists and critical social psychologists have quite 
different origins. One thing they do agree on, however, is that the social world is 
both an antecedent and consequence of the individuals and groups within it. 
Time to reflect In the conflict between discursive or critical social psychology and its ‘mainstream’ counterpart, do 
you see echoes of the early division between german ‘folk psychology’ and american experimental social psychology?

The ‘crisis’ in social psychology
With the development of cognitive psychology in the 
1950s and the shift away from behaviourism, the so-
called ‘cognitive revolution’ took place. This brought a 
new set of research tools and empirical methods to the 
discipline of social psychology. Methods used by cognitive 
psychologists to study perception and memory became 
useful to social psychologists interested in many topics 
such as emotions, attitudes and stereotyping, allowing 
easy measurement of social psychological processes with 
individuals in the laboratory. 
This led to the development of the new sub-field of 
social cognition in the 1970s and 80s, which rapidly 
became prominent within the field (Taylor, 1998). This 
development switched the focus of social psychology 
away from ‘macro’-level investigations of social issues to 
‘micro’-level investigations of social phenomena as they 
occur at the level of the individual. For some social 
psychologists, this was seen as an important development 
that signalled the emergence of social psychology as a 
scientific discipline. some argued that the discipline 
flourished, moving towards an integrated theoretical 
understanding of cognitive and social processes, and 
advanced applications of social psychological theory to 
important societal problems. Reliable and replicable 
findings in social psychology were an indicator that the 
discipline had come of age (e.g., Devine, hamilton and 
ostrom, 1994; Fiske and Taylor, 2008). 
however, for some social psychologists, this emphasis 
on cognitive processes came at an unfortunate cost. 
specifically, it was argued that as a consequence of using 
cognitive methods and analysing individuals, social 
psychology had become less ‘social’ (Ross, lepper and 
Ward, 2010). In focusing on social processes as they occur 
within the individual, it was argued that the discipline had 
lost sight of the socially important issues that it was 
originally developed to address. It reduced complex social 
phenomena to something much less meaningful (e.g., 
what does a click of a button really tell us about prejudice?). 
Many prominent European and american social 
psychologists have criticized social psychology for 
addressing issues of social importance with investigations 
at the level of the individual. For example, Tajfel (1972) 
emphasized the importance of the social group in social 
psychology, arguing for a more collectivist approach to 
social psychology than the individualistic approach of 
contemporary north american social psychology. other 
theorists, such as Bruner (1990) and Moscovici (1972), 
emphasized the importance of culture, arguing that 
culture is both the ‘tool and constraint of action and 
thought, the meeting point of the social and the 
individual’ (liverta-sempio and Marchetti, 1997, p. 6). 
also, gergen (1989, p. 463) argued that reducing real-
world phenomena to cognitive representations of the 
world means that social events ‘cease to exist for the 
discipline as legitimate foci of concern’. Finally, in his 
history of social psychology, allport (1968) criticized 
experimental social psychology for its triviality and lack of 
generalizability. he argued that most studies in 
experimental social psychology are ‘snippets of 
empiricism, but nothing more’ (p. 68). Further, allport 
wondered if the objective scientific methods chosen by 
experimental social psychologists can tell us very much at

all about practical problems and social concerns. The new 
emphasis on the study of social phenomena at the level of 
the individual seemed to go against Kurt lewin’s attempt 
to make the discipline socially useful.
argument about the ‘crisis’ in social psychology 
continues to this day. In particular, many critical social 
psychologists argue that the crisis continues and that

1979) and humanistic psychology (e.g., shotter, 1984), 
attempt to understand people as constructions or products 
of their history, culture and environment. according to this 
standpoint, all behaviour should be understood within a 
social context, paying attention to historical, cultural, 
socioeconomic and political factors. It is argued that 
investigations at the level of the individual often fail to 
take such factors into account. 
Questions
1 Think critically about the ‘crisis’ in social psychology, 
perhaps drawing up a table of the pros and cons of 
experimentation. What can we learn from 
experimentation and what can we not learn? are there 
some issues in social psychology that are simply not 
suited to experimentation?
2 Think about the role of culture in social psychology. To 
what degree does culture hinder the arguably 
reductionist approach to social phenomena taken by 
experimental social psychologists?
3 some alternatives to experimentation argue for more 
‘deconstructionist’ approaches to the study of social 
psychology, analysing individuals’ complex 
psychological responses in the form of text. arguably, 
such analyses are subjective. What are the advantages 
and disadvantages of subjectivity in social 
psychological investigations?
The tools of social psychology
We will now focus on the methods of social psychology, beginning with quantita-
tive research methods and then discussing some of the qualitative research 
methods also used by social psychologists. Once a research question has been 
proposed and a hypothesis has been formulated, a social psychologist needs to 
work out the best way to make the research happen. For most social psycholo-
gists, this means designing a study to put the hypothesis to the test. This is no 
small feat. There are many decisions that need to be made, first of which is the 
type of methodology that will best enable the social psychologist to test their 
hypothesis. A research methodology refers to the general approach taken to 
provide evidence for a research question. These can generally be seen as either 
qualitative or quantitative methodologies. 
Qualitative research methods generally involve the collection of information in 
naturalistic settings. For example, a researcher may observe natural behaviour or 
language. They assign meaning to what they observe and interpret the behaviours 
and language in relation to their inherent meaning. On the other hand, quantita-
tive methods involve the collection of data – information, quantifiable observa-
tions, measurements or responses – for scientific analysis and interpretation. 
Typically, quantitative social psychologists attempt to control features of the 
empirical setting in order to directly test the factor of interest. 
The choice of whether to use quantitative or qualitative methodology depends 
largely on the research question being asked. For example, if a researcher wishes 
to conduct an in-depth examination of a particular social phenomenon, they may

on interpretations of data 
generally obtained by 
observation, use of archives, 
or interviews. Data are 
typically verbal (e.g., spoken 
or written words), but 
interpretations of pictures, 
movement and other 
behaviours may feature in 
qualitative research.

the systematic measurement 
of events or phenomena and

The discipline of social psychology
be more likely to opt for qualitative methods. If, on the other hand, they are inter-
ested in the effect of a discrete event on a particular phenomenon, they may want 
to measure the factor and therefore conduct a quantitative investigation. The 
choice of research methodology can also be driven by epistemological assump-
tions. As we discussed earlier, critical social psychologists do not necessarily 
believe that there are ‘universals’ of human nature, so quantitative investigations 
that attempt to generalize principles across humans are not seen as appropriate. 
Critical social psychologists, therefore, almost exclusively utilize qualitative 
methods. Other researchers, however, believe that qualitative methods do not 
allow researchers to draw conclusions about human nature. If this is viewed as a 
key goal of social psychology to a researcher, then they will not opt for qualitative 
methods. On the other hand, there are many social psychologists who use a 
mixture of both quantitative and qualitative methods. 
Quantitative methods
Surveys and questionnaires
Surveys and questionnaires are among the most common research methods used 
in social psychology. These tools involve simply asking people a series of ques-
tions that the researcher has carefully designed and put together to address a 
specific research question or questions. In surveys, participants are often asked a 
series of questions in the form of an interview in which the investigator records 
the participants’ answers. Alternatively, the survey can be conducted in the form 
of a questionnaire, where the participants record their own responses. A survey or 
questionnaire can ask for open-ended responses, that is, participants are asked to 
give their responses freely, in their own words. For example, one might ask 
participants to freely generate a list of traits that are common to people who seem 
to be easily persuaded (e.g., Douglas, Sutton and Stathi, 2010). In such a case, the 
responses may be analysed using qualitative analytical techniques (see later in this 
chapter), or the researcher may code for specific predetermined responses and 
analyse the data quantitatively. 
On the other hand, some questionnaires ask participants for numerical 
responses. To use an example from our own research, a questionnaire may be 
designed to examine the relationship between sexism and restrictive attitudes 
towards the behaviours of pregnant women, such as the view that they should not 
drink any alcohol or eat any cheese (e.g., Murphy, Sutton, Douglas and McClellan, 
2011; Sutton, Douglas and McClellan, 2011). The researcher carefully chooses the 
questions asked of the participants in order to test hypotheses. Participants are 
asked to record their responses to items on what is often referred to as a Likert-
type scale, where participants respond with a number indicating their level of 
agreement or disagreement with a statement. These survey responses are averaged 
to obtain numerical scores for each participant on the variables of interest, that is, 
restrictive attitudes and sexism. In survey and questionnaire terminology, the 
relationship between one ‘variable’ (the predictor variable) on another (the crite-
rion variable) is examined. 

22
Social Psychology
Surveys and questionnaires are a reasonably straightforward way to tap into 
people’s attitudes, values and beliefs and this is one reason for their popularity. 
Also, they allow researchers to collect a large amount of data, so for the social 
psychologist interested in making broad conclusions about human nature, they 
are able to generalize their findings to the broader population. However, surveys 
and questionnaires are not without their disadvantages. In particular, the investi-
gator chooses the questions to ask in the first place. Question choice may be 
subject to bias, in that the experimenter chooses a set of questions favouring a 
particular approach when others may have been fairer. When responses are not 
anonymous, participants may be reluctant to answer questions honestly and their 
responses may be subject to demand characteristics – they may respond in the way 
they think the investigator wants them to respond. Further, as we shall see in 
several chapters, people are not always conscious of all their attitudes (Nisbett and 
Wilson, 1977), and so are unable to report them in surveys and questionnaires. 
Also, questionnaires often fall prey to ‘response set’ – the tendency for people to 
always respond in the middle of a scale, or to agree to statements without thinking. 
Sometimes, this can lead to inflated responses (so-called ‘ceiling effects’) or 
responses that are too low (so-called ‘floor effects’). All these can influence how 
the results are analysed and interpreted. 
The use of surveys and questionnaires also raises the issue of correlation 
versus causality (see Ethics and research methods box), which is addressed by 
the use of experiments.

Correlation versus causation
The use of questionnaires raises an important issue in 
social psychological research – that of correlation versus 
causation. In many areas of research, social psychologists 
are interested in examining the relationships between 
variables. specifically, are increased values on one 
dimension (e.g., sexism) associated with increased values 
on another (e.g., prescriptive attitudes towards the 
behaviour of pregnant women, that is, the things that 
pregnant women should and should not do)? are religious 
beliefs associated with happiness? 
Correlational research examines the natural 
association between two or more variables, as in these 
examples. such associations differ in their strength, that is, 
some variables are strongly correlated with each other but 
others are only weakly associated. also, some variables 
are positively correlated, that is, as values on one variable 
increase, values on another variable also increase (see (a) 
below). however, some variables are negatively 
correlated, meaning that as values on one variable 
increase, values on the other decrease (see (b) below). 
Correlations range in size from –1 (perfect negative 
correlation) through 0 (no correlation) to 1 (perfect 
correlation). as a general rule of thumb, a correlation of 
0.2 (or –0.2) is a small relationship, a correlation of 0.4 (or 
–0.4) is a moderate relationship and a correlation of 0.6 
(or –0.6) is considered a strong relationship. The figures 
below show what correlational relationships might look 
like in a scatterplot – a graph of values of one variable on 
the x-axis, set against values of the other variable on the 
y-axis. Each dot on the graph represents one participant’s 
responses on both variables of interest. In short, 
correlational studies enable researchers to examine how 
strong the relationships between variables are. 
Correlational research does not, however, inform the 
researcher about causality. In other words, a researcher 
may hypothesize that sexism causes people to be more 
prescriptive about the behaviours of pregnant women, or 

23
The discipline of social psychology
that religion causes happiness, but cause cannot be 
established. It might be that attitudes towards the 
behaviour of pregnant women predict sexism, or there may 
be some third factor involved. It may be that religious 
beliefs increase people’s use of social support networks and 
it is this factor that makes people happier. To determine 
whether changes in one variable bring about changes in 
another, the researcher must conduct experimental 
research in which levels of one variable are manipulated. 
We will talk more about this under ‘Experiments’.

Experiments
Survey and questionnaire studies enable social psychologists to answer a wide 
range of research questions, but, crucially, they do not allow researchers to infer 
causality (see Ethics and research methods box). This is often an important ques-
tion in social psychology. To be sure about which variable ‘causes’ which, social 
psychologists conduct experiments in which they control factors in order to 
measure the direct effect of one variable on another. 
For example, consider a study where the researcher examines the effect of 
power on the pursuit of goals. In a correlational study, the researcher could 
measure people’s feelings of power and the number of goals they pursue over a 
certain period of time. This would enable the researcher to determine the level of 
association between the two variables, but it would not answer the question of 
how power affects goal pursuit. To do this, the researcher needs to manipulate the 
variable of power in some way. In an experiment, the variable that is manipulated 
is called the independent variable (iV). The IV is hypothesized to be the cause of 
changes in the dependent variable (DV), which the experimenter measures. The 
independent variable (iV) 
In an experiment, the IV is the 
variable that is manipulated 
and is hypothesized to cause 
a specific outcome in the 
dependent variable.
Dependent variable (DV) 
In an experiment, the DV is 
the variable that is measured 
and is hypothesized to be 
influenced by the IV. 

24
Social Psychology
experimenter chooses how to manipulate the IV and the number of IV levels there 
should be. For example, Guinote (2007) manipulated power by asking half of the 
participants to think of a time when they felt in a position of power over someone 
else (high power) and asking the other half of the participants to think of a time 
when someone else was in a position of power over them (low power). There 
were, therefore, two levels of the IV. Guinote (2007, Studies 1 and 2) measured the 
time that people felt they needed to think about pursuing a goal and to initiate that 
goal (DVs); results revealed that participants in the high power condition took less 
time to make decisions about their preferred course of action than those in the low 
power condition, and that they took less time to initiate the goal. DVs in experi-
ments can be measured in a variety of ways such as behaviours, physiological 
measures such as heart rate and brain activity, and self-reported attitudes. 
Perhaps the best way to conduct an experiment is in a laboratory, as Guinote 
(2007) did, which ensures as much experimental control as possible. This does not 
necessarily mean a laboratory as you may think of the word in terms of other 
sciences such as chemistry and physics. Sometimes, a social psychology laboratory 
is simply a room with desks, chairs and a computer. It does not have to be anything 
more than a quiet space for participants to complete an experimental task. 
However, although we have separated questionnaires and experiments in our 
discussion, many questionnaires are, in fact, experiments. It is possible to manipu-
late IVs through verbal instructions in a questionnaire, or by presenting partici-
pants with a verbal scenario or story. Not all experiments are conducted by stern 
scientists wearing white lab coats.
There are various pros and cons of taking an experiment into the laboratory. As 
we have already mentioned, laboratory experiments allow a researcher as much 
control over the experiment as possible, therefore allowing for a stringent test of a 
hypothesis. However, one of the drawbacks is that the experiment can become 
artificial, thereby compromising the similarity between the experiment and the 
corresponding natural circumstances of interest in everyday life. This is known as 
the external validity (or mundane realism) of an experiment. In other words, when an 
experiment is so tightly controlled in a laboratory, some would argue that it 
cannot tell us a great deal about human nature in general which is subject to many 
complexities that are eliminated in the laboratory. 
At the same time, this level of control can be looked at another way – in 
controlling as many factors as possible, an experimenter is able to focus on one or 
more specific variables of interest. While it may not be natural per se, the researcher 
is able to speak with some confidence about the influence of the variable(s) that 
has been manipulated. In particular, an experiment is said to be high in internal 
validity (or experimental realism) if the researcher can be confident that it is the 
manipulated variable that is having the effect (if any) on the dependent variable(s) 
in the experiment. Poor external validity is not, therefore, always problematic. 
Sometimes, creating a bare and artificial experimental setting allows researchers to 
make specific theoretical and practical points, which would be difficult to make 
with the presence of other ‘noise’ in the study. If the ‘noise’ is controlled and the

conditions for participants are different in no way apart from the way determined 
by the manipulation, then the researcher can be confident that they have fairly put 
their hypothesis to the test. However, the manipulation must be meaningful and 
realistic to the participants. For example, understanding the instructions in a 
manipulation is crucial, otherwise participants’ misunderstanding will probably 
influence the results. For this reason, experimenters often include manipulation 
checks in their studies. For example, in the studies outlined above, after manipu-
lating power, Guinote (2007) asked participants to rate the extent to which they 
felt in control of the situation they described. If participants in the ‘high power’ 
condition reported significantly higher levels of control than those in the ‘low 
power’ condition, then the researcher can be confident that participants have 
understood the manipulation and have responded appropriately. The internal 
validity of the study is therefore acceptable.
For some research questions, however, external validity is crucial. In many 
cases, field experiments are conducted which take place in the ‘real world’, but 
participants may not be aware that they are participating in a study. For example, 
an experimenter might go out to a shopping centre to examine people’s reactions 
to invasions of their personal space. They may manipulate the magnitude of the 
invasion but the experiment has a more ecologically valid feel to it because the 
participants do not know they are participating in a study. If the study was 
conducted in a laboratory, the participants may get wise to the experimenter’s 
motives and the study may not be a valid test of the hypothesis. Thus, field 
experiments are important and useful. 
Both within and outside the laboratory, experiments have advantages over 
other methods when social psychologists want to make conclusions about human 
nature. The main reason for this is that through the random assignment of partici-
pants to conditions (levels of the IV), the experimenter can be confident that 
participants in the different conditions are similar. So long as you have enough 
people, and you randomly assign them to one of two groups, you can be confident 
that the two groups of people will have much the same age, attitudes, gender and 
any other traits that might affect the results of your study. Thus, you can be confi-
dent that if the two groups of people act differently, it is because of the condition 
they are assigned to – not because of some other difference between the two 
groups of people. Except for the influence of the IV, there should be no other 
differences across experimental conditions. 
It is also important that experiments are designed in such a way that they avoid 
confounding, where variables are too closely related within the experiment and it 
is difficult to know which one is having an effect. For example, imagine an 
experiment with two different conditions, but everyone in the first condition was 
female and all participants in the second condition were male. The experimenter 
cannot be sure which variable is having an effect on the DV: the manipulation of 
the IV, or differences due to gender. Experimental conditions must therefore be 
identical in every way apart from the crucial differences that occur with the 
manipulation of the IV. 
Manipulation check In an 
experiment, the researcher 
takes an additional 
measure to ensure that the 
manipulation of an IV has had 
the desired effect.

Confounding When one 
(or more) IVs are related to

it is impossible to tell which 
variable is having an effect.

26
Social Psychology
Also, experimenters often include a control group or condition, which is equal 
to the experimental condition in every respect apart from the lack of one ‘ingre-
dient’ – the crucial feature of the IV that is predicted to directly affect the DV. For 
example, to determine the influence of positive feedback on a child’s motivation at 
school, a control condition where no feedback is given must be included. Any 
difference between the children’s motivation in the control condition and the 
feedback condition can be directly attributable to the feedback (e.g., Skipper and 
Douglas, 2011). Sometimes, however, complete experimental control is not 
possible or necessary. For example, social psychologists often want to investigate 
the effect of naturally occurring variables (e.g., age, gender, marital status) on 
various outcomes (e.g., life satisfaction). In such natural experiments, where the 
IVs of interest occur naturally, the researcher can take advantage of this and 
measure the DVs of interest. 
There are a number of downsides to conducting experiments. For example, 
experiments are often subject to demand characteristics, as can be the case for 
surveys and questionnaires. Participants’ behaviours and responses may be an 
artefact of the experimental situation itself rather than a response to the experi-
mental manipulation. For example, participants may infer that the experimenter 
sees a particular mode of responding as socially desirable, and respond accord-
ingly, which may bias the results (Rosenberg, 1969). Similarly, participants may 
become apprehensive about their responses, which may influence the findings. In 
both cases, the participants have some knowledge of the hypotheses. It may not 
be the most accurate knowledge, but it is sufficient enough to have a potential 
effect on the outcome of the experiment. Thus, it is important for the participants 
to be as blind to the hypotheses (and research conditions) as possible. Experi-
ments are also subject to experimenter effects – effects that occur because the 
experimenter may inadvertently give the participants ‘clues’ to the hypotheses. 
Of course, this is not generally intentional. The researcher simply has knowledge 
of the experimental conditions and may unintentionally communicate their 
expectations to participants, potentially biasing the experiment. Therefore, as far 
as possible, the experimenter should also be blind to experimental conditions. 
When both experimenter and participant are blind to conditions, this is known as 
the double-blind procedure.

The discipline of social psychology
Techniques that can be quantitative or qualitative
Observations
Some research questions can be answered by merely observing what people do. 
Many social psychologists’ research is informed by observations from which they 
learn about a particular phenomenon, make hypotheses and then conduct further 
research. However, observations are often used as a research tool without the use of 
other methods. For example, social psychologists sometimes use the technique of 
participant observation where they ‘get close’ to people and observe what they do. 
This type of research is similar to that conducted by anthropologists, who often 
study groups (e.g., religious, cultural and occupational groups) and societies by living 
and interacting with them for an extended period of time and directly observing their 
behaviour. For example, you may be familiar with the influential work of anthro-
pologist Margaret Mead, who spent a great deal of time in South Pacific and South-
east Asian cultures studying attitudes towards sex and coming of age. Using this 
technique, the researcher typically observes natural behaviour and does not inter-
vene, staying neutral and non-intrusive so as not to influence what is being observed. 
The technique of observation is sometimes called the field study method. 
This method can also include the researcher conducting interviews (see Figure 
1.8), discussions, reviewing life histories and reviewing personal documents. 
Sometimes, observations are purely qualitative, from which researchers draw out 
themes of observations and interactions, but sometimes observational studies can 
involve the collection of quantitative data. As mentioned earlier, in social 
psychology observations are typically used as a tool to generate and develop 
hypotheses. Unlike anthropologists for whom observations are a primary research 
method, social psychologists typically use observations more informally with the 
view to using the information gathered to develop other investigations to test 
hypotheses. There are good reasons for this. Although observations provide a rich 
set of information, what an investigator observes is, again, their choice and poten-
tially subject to bias due to a lack of objectivity. If a research-
er’s goal is to describe human social psychological processes 
in general, it is difficult to do so based on observations of a 
small group of people. The observer may also accidentally 
interact with the people who they are observing, which can 
also bias the findings. 
Case studies
Case studies allow a researcher to analyse a specific event, 
individual or group, in-depth. They involve a range of the 
tools we have discussed already, such as observations, 
surveys, interviews and questionnaires. As such, they have 
quantitative and qualitative aspects. The advantage to 
conducting case studies is that they allow for a detailed 
examination of the subject of interest. They are often used to

Social Psychology
examine phenomena that would be difficult to control in the laboratory, such as 
cults, criminal behaviour and people’s responses to tragedies. 
Archival studies 
Archival studies involve going back to the ‘archives’ (as the name suggests) and 
examining evidence for a hypothesis among existing data. Archives can be many 
things, such as newspaper reports, political speeches, statistical records and court 
proceedings, which already exist and can be gathered over a long period of time. 
Of course, the original information was collected without the hypothesis in mind, 
so it cannot be biased in terms of how the information was collected. Information 
can be gathered relatively easily too, but the investigator needs to know what they 
are looking for, and how to look for it, in order to conduct archival research. 
Archival research is a rather underutilized tool in social psychology but it can tell 
us many things. To give one example, Mullen (1986) conducted an archival investi-
gation of 60 newspaper reports of lynching events during the 1800s. Mullen coded 
the reports for information regarding group composition (number of victims and 
number of lynchers) and the atrocities performed (occurrence of hangings, shoot-
ings, burnings and other atrocities). Results suggested that as the size of the lynch 
mob, relative to the victims, increased, the mob became more aggressive and 
performed more atrocities. 
Archival research such as this has the advantage of being able to inform social 
psychologists of social psychological phenomena as they have occurred in the 
past, and as they occur or change over a period of time. However, archival methods 
often involve laborious data collection. The researcher is also limited by the 
amount, and nature, of the information collected originally and may require vital 
information that is missing. Archival investigations are, therefore, sometimes 
unreliable. They are also able to answer a smaller range of research questions and 
so are relatively unpopular among the tools of social psychology. 
Qualitative methods
Thematic analysis
As the name suggests, thematic analysis identifies themes in a set of data, usually 
derived from an interview. The analysis consists of two phases. First, the researcher 
identifies, analyses and describes patterns or themes within the data and, second, the 
researcher uses the themes to make further interpretations. This is a complex process 
of identifying initial themes and then revising and extending the list of themes several 
times before concluding the analysis and producing a report (Braun and Clarke, 
2006). This is one of the most common qualitative methods used in social psychology.
Conversational analysis
Conversational analysis focuses closely on conversational interactions, producing 
a detailed analysis, classification and notification of the talk. The aim is to examine 
what people are doing with the language they use, as well as what they are hoping 
to achieve. Conversational analysis not only analyses the content of what people 

29
The discipline of social psychology
are saying, it also analyses how people conduct the conversation, such as how they 
take turns and use pauses, interruptions and so on. It is designed to give a detailed 
analysis of how people use language and tailor their talk for specific situations. 
Typically, conversational analysis uses naturally occurring conversation such as 
interactions between doctors and patients (West, 1984) and in police interroga-
tions (e.g., Stokoe, 2010).
Narrative analysis
Narrative analysis focuses on how people understand the world through the 
stories they tell to others. It is based on the idea that telling stories helps people to 
make meaning out of complex and often chaotic situations (Gergen and Gergen, 
1984). Typically, a researcher conducting a narrative analysis will identify some 
research question or problem and identify the events or situations that will enable 
them to answer that question. The narratives then need to be collected. The 
researcher identifies who they want to hear stories from, designs an interview and 
then conducts the interview. Afterwards, the researcher transcribes the interview 
and interprets it (Parker, 2005). 
Studying text: discourse analysis 
Advocates of discourse analysis in social psychology argue that ‘text’ and ‘talk’ 
ought to be the principal focus of social psychology. For example, Potter (1996) 
has argued that language constructs social and psychological life, rather than being 
simply a way for researchers to study how people see the world. Language is the 
means by which people create their social world. Discourse analysis therefore 
studies language – language obtained from conversations, interviews and text (e.g., 
newspapers). The text is analysed and interpreted within the context in which it 
was produced. The researcher can then draw conclusions about what the person is 
communicating about their thoughts, feelings and experiences (e.g., Edwards and 
Potter, 1992; Potter, 1996; Potter and Wetherell, 1987). There are two main types 
of discourse analysis. The first, micro-discourse analysis, examines text and talk in 
fine detail with the aim of understanding what is occurring in particular interac-
tions (e.g., how women deal with sexism). This analysis focuses on the features of 
the language use, discourse, verbal interaction and communication, and considers 
the text’s syntax, structure and rhetorical devices. From this, researchers can 
generalize about the discursive practices that people use in specific situations. 
Macro-discourse analysis, on the other hand, aims to identify different discourses 
that occur surrounding a particular event or topic (e.g., a riot). It is concerned 
with understanding the broad, societal currents that influence the text being 
studied. At the middle level, meso-discourse analysis attempts to bridge the gap 
between the smaller details and the societal influences on the text.

inside the mind and the greater world outside. It considers how people’s conscious 
experience of existing within the world is made up of their feelings, relationships 
and experiences (e.g., Smith, 2011; Smith, Flowers and Larkin, 2009). This tech-
nique consists of extracting people’s descriptions of concrete experiences, or 
narratives about these experiences. IPA uses data obtained from methods such as 
interviews and sometimes from other forms of text such as letters. In analysing the 
data, the researcher attempts to identify themes within the text and specifically 
looks for recurring themes. These themes are then organized into a hierarchy to 
establish if participants’ responses suggest that some themes are more important 
than others. IPA enables researchers to compare the data from one participant 
with that of others to establish if there are themes and experiences that are 
common across people. For example, Rhodes and Smith (2010) gave an interpreta-
tive phenomenological analysis of the experience of depression using a case study 
of one man who had been diagnosed with depression. Interviews with the man 
were analysed using IPA, enabling the researchers to describe the origins of the 
illness and the complex effects that followed. 
Question to consider Based on what you now know about the various ‘tools’ of social psychological research, 
reread question 2 at the start of the chapter. Which research method is the most appropriate and why? What are the 
strengths and weaknesses of the approach you have chosen?
issues in conducting social psychological research
We have already discussed some of the issues that occur when conducting social 
psychological research. For example, experimental social psychologists are often 
confronted with the dilemma between making their research externally valid, that 
is, meaningful to something in the ‘outside world’, and controlling aspects of the 
context which are not of interest, thereby making the experiment more rigorous 
but less ecologically valid. We have also discussed the importance of both the 
participant and experimenter being blind to conditions, in case knowledge of the 
study objective can bias responses or the way in which the study is run. There are 
other issues of importance, which we will discuss briefly here. The first relates to 
how the participants for the studies are selected or sampled. 
Sampling
How participants are selected or sampled for social psychological research is 
important. To illustrate why this is the case, consider a hypothetical study where a 
researcher wants to examine the relationship between self-esteem and dieting 
behaviour among women. The researcher sends the survey to subscribers of a high 
circulation women’s fashion magazine. Why might this not be such a good choice? 
Well, potentially, this could be a biased sample. One could argue that women who 
subscribe to fashion magazines are already more focused on issues related to 
appearance and weight – more so than most women – so they may not be a repre-
sentative sample from which to test a general hypothesis about female respond-

ents. To take a representative sample, the researcher would be wise to cast the net 
more widely in order to test their hypothesis on a range of women with different 
interests and not such a narrow sample.
Samples should also, where possible, be random. Put differently, from a popula-
tion of interest, everyone should have an equal chance of being able to participate 
in the research (see Figure 1.9). For example, in a study of British attitudes towards 
the government, a researcher could not sample from only one region of Britain. A 
quick glance at the distribution of seats in the House of Commons across the UK 
(Conservative, Labour, Liberal Democrat, Plaid Cymru, Scottish National Party, 
Democratic Unionists and so on) suggests that the different regions vote quite 
differently. A sample of people from the southeast of England may have more 
positive attitudes towards a Conservative government (because they largely vote 
for this party), whereas the results may be entirely different in the northern 
regions of England, Scotland, Northern Ireland or Wales. So, in order to give a fair 
test of a hypothesis, it is important to sample randomly from the population of 
interest. Another way this can become a problem is through the issue of self-
selection. This problem arises when participants select themselves for participation 
in a study because they are particularly interested or have a vested interest in the 
topic. For example, if a researcher advertises to the general public a study on 
conspiracy theories, they may attract a larger number of people who have a 
personal interest in conspiracy theories, thus potentially not being a representative 
sample of the population as a whole. Self-selection can influence the result in 
unpredictable ways. Again, researchers must be careful in their recruitment strate-
gies to avoid potential biases creeping into the study. 
Of course, random sampling is not always possible. As you will notice 
throughout this book, social psychologists often make claims about human nature 
in general based on testing convenience samples of undergraduate participants. 
Indeed, critical social psychologists see this as a key weakness of quantitative 
social psychology and it is a valid point. Not all research questions can be 
answered by testing the responses of undergraduate psychology students. On the

Social Psychology
other hand, it is important to consider the research question. Much of social 
psychology is concerned with how people think, feel and behave with respect to 
social situations. Many of the processes of interest should be (and are) universal. 
In such cases, samples of undergraduate psychology students should respond no 
differently to samples of non-students. This is a point worth considering as you 
read this book. In general, convenience samples are used frequently in social 
psychological research because they are just that – convenient – and mean that the 
researcher does not have to go to great lengths to randomly sample from larger 
populations. In many cases, there are no disadvantages in testing these smaller 
subsets of the population. In Chapter 15, we consider the importance of sampling 
in more detail.
Another issue related to sampling is exactly how many participants are needed 
in a social psychological study. In general, this depends largely on the nature of 
the study. If it is a questionnaire or survey study, there are guidelines for the 
number of participants that are required based on the number of questions being 
asked and the level of statistical significance the researcher uses as their guideline. 
We will say more about this later. However, it is useful to note that it is not always 
necessary to sample a large number of people in order to draw conclusions about a 
population as a whole. More often than not, a smaller random sample or small 
convenience sample is enough to draw valid conclusions. For example, the UK 
population at the time of the 2010 general election was approximately 62 million, 
and yet exit polls consisted of a random sample of only a few thousand voters 
across the country. Apart from some notable examples, exit polls tend to provide 
accurate predictions of electoral outcomes. 
Thus far, we have discussed the issue of sampling in quantitative research. 
Sampling in qualitative studies is a different matter. In qualitative work, sampling 
is not random – it is purposive. As we have discussed earlier, qualitative social 
psychologists do not deal in universals of human nature and therefore do not have 
the goal of generalizing their findings. Instead, these researchers are more 
concerned with people’s experiences, so samples will be chosen specifically for 
people who have had the experiences of interest. The sample does not need to be 
representative of some larger population. Also, a study may only use one person 
as a participant (case study) who has been chosen for a particular reason. 
Question to consider Reread question 3 at the start of this chapter. Is it a problem that much of social 
psychological evidence comes from studies of undergraduate students? When might it be a problem and when 
might it not be an issue?
Reliability and validity
reliability is the extent to which the way a variable is measured, usually in a scale 
(e.g., extraversion), is likely to bring about consistent results. There are two types 
of reliability. The first, test-retest reliability is the similarity in measurements taken 
by a single person at different times. In other words, if a person responded to an 
extraversion scale twice, the scale would be deemed to be reliable if the responses

consistent results.

were consistent between time one and time two, assuming that the conditions for 
taking the test were the same. The second, internal consistency, refers to the 
consistency across items within the scale. In other words, do all the items in the 
scale measure the same thing? Typically, scales designed to measure social psycho-
logical and personality constructs have at least two items, so the internal consist-
ency of a scale can be determined by the correlation between the items within the 
scale. If the coefficient (Cronbach’s alpha statistic is most common here) is high, 
then the scale is said to be internally consistent. As a general rule of thumb, a 
Cronbach’s alpha score of 0.7 or above signifies a reliable scale (Nunnally, 1978). 
Reliability is different to validity. Specifically, while a scale may be reliable, this 
means that it is consistently measuring something, but we do not necessarily know 
what. A researcher cannot be sure that the scale is measuring what it is supposed 
to be measuring. Construct validity refers to the relationship between a measure and 
a particular outcome that the measure is designed to predict. For instance, scores 
on a scale of extraversion should be related to scores on outcomes such as the 
number of friends a person has, how often they go out, or other indices of ‘outgo-
ingness’. If the measure of interest does not correlate with the predicted outcomes, 
then it may not be a valid measure of that outcome. Measures of validity typically 
reveal lower correlations than those for reliability. A scale may satisfy Nunnally’s 
(1978) criterion of a correlation of 0.7, but the relationship between a scale of 
extraversion and a person’s number of friends may only be 0.4. That is, a scale can 
be deemed valid even though the correlation between the responses on the scale 
and responses on the phenomenon or phenomena of interest is fairly low. Social 
psychologists may also begin to examine the validity of their measures right from 
the beginning of scale development. Specifically, they will examine the items they 
have chosen for what is known as face validity – a qualitative appraisal of whether 
the scale measures the phenomenon or phenomena of interest. If the items have 
been developed from a particular theoretical perspective, then the researcher will 
qualitatively appraise the items for their content validity to determine whether all 
phenomena of importance to the theory have been covered.
Statistical significance
One of the most important aspects of quantitative social psychology is its test of 
statistical significance. When a researcher has a finding such as a predicted difference 
between two experimental conditions or a significant correlation between two 
variables, this is interesting, but is it meaningful? Is the finding of sufficient 
importance to be able to make conclusions about it? To answer these questions, 
quantitative social psychologists determine the statistical significance of their 
findings. This determines the probability that the finding of interest could have 
occurred by chance. The researcher sets the highest possible significance level – 
indicated by a probability out of 100 – they would be satisfied with. Convention 
in social psychology is that the probability (or p value) needs to be less than 0.05 
(a chance of 1 in 20) or 0.01 (a chance of 1 in 100) for the result to be of statistical 
significance and therefore of social psychological significance.

association between a 
measure and an outcome 
that the measure is 
designed to predict.
Statistical significance The 
measure of the probability 
that a given finding could 
have occurred by chance. 

34
Social Psychology
We will not talk about the specific tests that social psychologists use to deter-
mine statistical significance because this is the realm of statistical textbooks. Suffice 
it to say, quantitative social psychologists use a range of statistical tests to establish 
the reliability of their findings. A significant finding typically occurs because of 
the size of the difference between experimental conditions, or the size of a correla-
tion. However, the size of the sample also matters. For example, some very small 
correlations can be significant when the sample size is large. Statistical significance 
may not always be the best index of the actual importance of a research finding. 
Basic and applied research
Another key distinction in social psychological research is that of basic versus 
applied research. Basic research focuses on fundamental questions about people’s 
thoughts, feelings and behaviours. For example, a social psychologist may investi-
gate why people help others, what factors cause them to fall in and out of love, 
and what persuasive techniques are most effective. Such questions lie at the heart 
of human nature. Basic social psychology is typically oriented towards using the 
findings to develop further theoretical understanding on a topic. However, many 
social psychologists conduct applied research, which takes information that is 
learned from basic research and applies it to particular problems or issues, often 
with the aim of enhancing the quality of everyday life. Applied research typically 
focuses on areas such as health, business, law, the environment and politics. For 
example, applied social psychologists can help employers hire more suitable 
employees. They can also design interventions to address social problems, such as 
excess energy use, prejudice, smoking, criminal behaviour, or educational issues 
(see the Social psychology in the real world box). 
Basic and applied psychology are closely related and there is a two-way rela-
tionship between the two. Specifically, basic research may mean that researchers 
develop theories that result in the development of interventions – efforts to change 
people’s behaviour. One good example of this in social psychology is the work 
associated with the theory of planned behaviour, which is a theory about the link 
between attitudes and behaviour (Ajzen, 1985; see also Chapter 4). Much of the 
basic research associated with this theory identifies the various pathways in the 
theory, how attitudes become accessible and how (and when) attitudes predict 
what people do. However, the theory has been applied in many studies to the 
study of the relationships between beliefs, attitudes, behavioural intentions and 
behaviours in many applied fields, such as advertising and health (e.g., Albarracin, 
Johnson, Fishbein and Muellerleile, 2001; Ajzen, 1988; Armitage and Conner, 
2001; Conner, Kirk, Cade and Barrett, 2003; Sheeran and Taylor, 1999). Basic 
research can, therefore, inform applied research that attempts to improve some 
aspect of people’s lives. However, it is also the case that the results obtained from 
applied research can enable basic social psychologists to further develop theories. 
For example, practically testing the theory of planned behaviour in health settings

gives researchers an idea of what aspects of the theory work and what aspects need 
to be modified. So, it is perhaps unsurprising that many social psychologists have 
both basic and applied interests. 
SOCiAL PSYCHOLOgY in THE rEAL WOrLD
Social psychology at work in the classroom
The work of social psychologist Carol Dweck has been 
influential in the field of education, helping practitioners 
to understand what kind of praise and criticism ‘work’ best 
for children to keep them motivated and focused on their 
learning. In particular, Dweck (1999) and Kamins and 
Dweck (1999) have argued that praise can be 
distinguished between comments that are aimed at 
evaluating a person’s traits or the person as a whole (e.g., 
‘you are a clever girl’) and comments that focus on the 
person’s effort or strategies (e.g., ‘you found a good way 
to do it’). Kamins and Dweck (1999) showed that praising 
a child in person terms after they succeed leads to helpless 
responses to subsequent failures more than when the 
feedback relates to the concrete process through which 
the success was reached. Comparing the two groups’ 
responses on measures such as persistence on the task, 
self-esteem and motivation, the children who had been 
praised in process terms showed more positive outcomes 
than the children who had been praised in person terms. 
Dweck and colleagues argued that ‘person praise’ 
leads children to interpret their achievements in trait 
terms and encourages a fixed mindset of success more so 
than ‘process praise’, which focuses more on effort and 
behaviour. Following person praise, failures may signal 
that outcomes are due to poor ability or negative traits, 
thus undermining performance evaluations, affect, 
motivation and leading to a helpless response. These 
findings are striking because the differences in the 
wording of the feedback are generally so small (e.g., ‘you 
are a good drawer’ versus ‘you did a good job drawing’) 
that the person giving the feedback may not even notice 
the difference. Further, even if teachers do notice the 
difference, they may not be aware that the different forms 
of feedback have contrasting implications. Based on these 
findings, it is unsurprising that the education sector 
strongly promotes process-related praise (rather than 
person-related) in interventions to improve students’ 
performance (Rathvon, 2008). Many intervention 
programmes, such as the online interactive ‘Brainology’ 
program, apply the findings of Dweck’s work in order to 
help students to develop a growth mindset of intelligence 
and help them deal with academic challenges. 
Questions
1 We know the effects of ‘person praise’ and ‘process 
praise’. What do you think the impact of giving students 
‘no praise’ might be?
2 Can you think of other domains in which Dweck’s work 
may be applied?
3 Do you think that a child’s mindset can be changed?
4 shortly, we will talk about research ethics and this 
research is a good way to start you thinking about 
ethical issues in social psychological research. 
Conducting research with children can sometimes be 
an ethical minefield and conducting work on praise 
and criticism of children creates a variety of ethical 
issues. For example, how did the experimenter ensure 
that the children in the ‘person’ condition did not 
continue to feel helpless after the experiment finished? 
Read one of Dweck’s empirical articles and see how 
she dealt with such issues.

Social Psychology
Cultural issues
Another important issue to consider in social psychology is the influence of culture. 
We have spent some time thus far discussing how the majority of social psycholo-
gists are interested in the ‘universals’ of human nature, of which there appear to be 
many. However, there are some key social psychological phenomena and processes 
on which cultures differ. For example, all cultures have norms and standards of 
behaviour, but these are not necessarily the same across cultures or are expressed 
differently across cultures. Gender roles differ across cultures (e.g., Dasgupta, 1998; 
Fischer, Rodriguez Mosquera, van Vianen and Manstead, 2004), as do nonverbal 
behaviours (e.g., Matsumoto, 2006). In general, cultures can have a strong influence 
on how people think about themselves and the social environment (Matsumoto 
and Yoo, 2006). Try the practical activity below before you read further.
Try it yourself Take a piece of paper and write down 10 things that define who you are. Do this before you read on.
after you have made your list, tally up the number of ‘I’-related statements you used and how many of your self-
descriptions relate to personal traits (e.g., ‘I am friendly’, ‘I am a student’). Compare this with the number of times 
the self is defined in terms of collective aspects (e.g., ‘sister’, ‘grandchild’). how do you think your responses are 
influenced by your cultural origins? If you come from a different culture to some of your friends, compare your 
responses to theirs. Is there a difference in the number of ‘I’ self-descriptions you use compared to your friends? This 
exercise can reveal how culture influences the self-concept – a key area in social psychology. 
One of the most important features of culture that determines differences in 
social psychological phenomena is whether it is an individualist culture or a collec-
tivist culture (Fiske, Kitayama, Markus and Nisbett, 1998; Hofstede, 1980; Markus 
and Kitayama, 1991, 1994; Triandis, 1989, 1995). Individualist cultures are charac-
terized by their independence. People within individualist cultures see themselves 
as distinct social beings, separate from each other and having characteristics that 
make them distinct from others. Social relationships are important, but are seen as 
voluntary. Collectivist cultures, on the other hand, are characterized by their inter-
connectedness with others. People within collectivist cultures see themselves as 
social beings who are inextricably linked to others, and having characteristics that 
are responsive to the social situation. Social relationships are vital and involuntary – 
they are part of what makes a person who they are. You can probably guess which 
countries fit broadly into each category. Western cultures such as Britain, Australia, 
New Zealand and the USA are individualistic cultures, while Eastern cultures, such 
as China, Japan, Korea, and many Latin American cultures are more collectivist. 
The key differences between individualist and collec-
tivist cultures are given in Table 1.1.
Given these differences, it is probably not surprising 
to learn that social psychological phenomena depend 
heavily on the cultural orientation of the people 
involved (see Figure 1.10). We discuss these differences 
in more detail throughout the book. For example, in 
individualist cultures Cultures 
where people see themselves 
as independent entities with 
independent characteristics 
and voluntary social bonds.
Collectivist cultures Cultures 
where people see themselves 
as dependent on others with 
characteristics that respond 
to social situations, and 
important and involuntary 
social bonds.

The discipline of social psychology
Chapter 2, we discuss how people’s concept of self differs across the two broad 
types of culture. In response to the question ‘Who are you?’, people from indi-
vidualist cultures tend to respond with more ‘I’-related statements (e.g., ‘I am 
clever’, ‘I like reading books’), whereas participants from collectivist cultures tend 
to respond with statements related to group membership or relationships (e.g., ‘I 
am a Muslim’, ‘I am a mother’) (Dhawan, Roseman, Naidu and Rettek, 1995; 
Heine and Lehman, 1997; Kitayama, Markus, Matsumoto and Norasakkunkit, 
1997; Trafimow, Triandis and Goto, 1991; Yik, Bond and Paulhus, 1998). This 
distinction begins early in life, with children at age six years displaying this cultural 
difference (Wang, 2006). This is just one example of social psychological evidence 
from one culture that may not automatically apply to all cultures. 
Researchers need to examine theories and test hypotheses across different 
cultures and put away the assumption that people in different cultures all think 
and act the same way. A great deal of information can be missed if culture is not 
taken into account. As you read this book, you may justifiably criticize social 
psychology for being too ‘Western’. Most of the studies you will read about are 
based on data collected in white, English-speaking countries (in particular the 
USA), and therefore a lot of social psychological knowledge we have is drawn 
from a relatively homogeneous group of participants. So, when we learn about 
‘universals’ of human thought and behaviour, while many phenomena are prob-
ably universal, we can only ever really be sure that we know about ‘universals’ of 
white, American undergraduate students, unless hypotheses are tested more 
broadly. It is important to keep this issue at the back of your mind as you read 
about evidence drawn from social psychological studies. 
research ethics
Social psychologists carry out their research with human participants, or utilize data 
that have been provided by human participants. Thus, it is vital that research is 
carried out with the safety and privacy of participants firmly in mind. All social 
psychologists receive training in research ethics throughout the course of their 
studies, and so we begin with an overview of these important, basic ethical principles.
When conducting research with human participants, it is vital that they have 
given their informed consent to take part in the research. This principle ensures that 
participants know exactly what is going to happen in an experiment or study and 
then they give their consent. In other words, participants should only be asked to 
agree to take part after they have been fully informed about the purpose of the 
study and how it will be conducted. However, this principle is difficult to observe 
when research is conducted with children as participants, because it is not always 
possible to communicate the intentions and methods of research to children in a 
way they completely understand. In such cases, it is possible to gain the consent of 
parents and carers, who act in the children’s best interests and make the informed 
decision about consenting to participate in the research.

Social Psychology
The principle of informed consent is further complicated by the use of decep-
tion, a methodological technique frequently used in social psychological research. 
Deception occurs when a participant is misled about some aspect or aspects of the 
research – typically something about the purpose of a particular feature of the 
research method – or is not made fully aware of the specific purpose of the study. 
Deception is an important feature of social psychological research and does not 
make the research unethical. In some cases, it is difficult to test a hypothesis unless 
deception is used. For example, social psychological research often makes use of 
confederates – members of the research team who pose as participants and follow a 
predetermined procedure set up by the experimenter – to test how people interact 
in specific situations. The participant is misled to think they are interacting with a 
real person when, in fact, they are not. However, this type of method allows 
experimenters to control specific aspects of the experiment and test the effect of 
only those that are of interest. 
In such situations where the use of deception is crucial to test hypotheses, the 
deception can be deemed to be appropriate if the following conditions are met:
1 A non-deceptive method to study the same phenomenon does not exist.
2 The study has the possibility of making a significant contribution to scientific 
knowledge.
3 The deception is not expected to cause the participant any harm or significant 
emotional distress. 
These factors are typically judged by an ethics committee. You may also come 
across the term ‘institutional review board’, which is used in the USA and Canada 
to refer to ethics committees. Ethics committees closely examine research 
proposals and determine whether the proposed research is ethical. In a case where 
deception is proposed, the committee decides, according to the three criteria 
above, whether the deception is justified. If some aspect of the study is deemed to 
be overly detrimental to the participants, it will be refused ethical clearance. In 
such cases, the researcher needs to make changes to the procedure and then 
resubmit the proposal for further evaluation. 
Exploring further Take a look at the British Psychological society’s ethical code of conduct for carrying out 
research with human participants. you will find this via the homepage of the British Psychological society (http://
www.bps.org.uk). Before you conduct any research involving human participants, you need to be familiar with these 
guidelines. It is also likely that you will need to apply for ethical approval to conduct your research. 
Ethics committees do an important job. However, they did not always exist and 
many famous studies in social psychology were conducted without ethical clear-
ance. In Chapter 9, for example, you will read about Stanley Milgram’s obedience 
studies, where participants were told that their task was to deliver strong electrical 
shocks to another participant. The shocks were never given, but the participants 
were led to believe that the recipient (a confederate) was experiencing extreme pain. 
Many of the participants exhibited signs of emotional distress as a result of taking 
part in this procedure. One might speculate as to whether such an experiment would

be granted ethical clearance today. This would indeed pose some serious questions 
for an ethics committee. However, even in such an extreme case, the committee 
would carefully consider the pros and cons of the study – does the knowledge that 
could potentially be gained from the study outweigh the negative aspects? In the 
case of Milgram’s studies, one would have to say ‘yes’. Much of what social psychol-
ogists now know about obedience and compliance come from Milgram’s studies.
In any case, Milgram followed one other key principle of conducting ethical 
research – he fully debriefed his participants at the conclusion of the study. It is 
important to let research participants know the true nature of a study, its purpose 
and hypotheses so that they know exactly why they did what they did. Note that 
debriefing can also be important to ensure that participants have understood an 
experimental manipulation, so it serves the purpose of maintaining internal 
validity during the study as well as upholding ethical standards after the study. 
Participants are also free to withdraw their consent and have their personal 
responses removed from the study if they are unhappy with any aspect of the 
study. As mentioned earlier, these principles are in place to protect the participant 
from harm or emotional distress and protect their privacy. Following ethical 
guidelines also means that research participants are treated with respect.
Social psychology and links to other disciplines
Social psychology is closely related to other branches of psychology, such as 
personality, clinical, cognitive, forensic and the rapidly emerging area of cyberpsy-
chology. Social psychology is also closely related to academic disciplines outside 
psychology, such as biology, neuroscience, sociology, social anthropology and 
economics. In this section, we outline some of the ways in which social psychology 
has been influenced by these sub-disciplines and disciplines, as well as the impact 
that social psychology has had on them.
Personality psychology
Also referred to as the study of individual differences, personality psychology is a 
close relation of social psychology. Personality psychology is referred to as the 
study of how people come to be who they are (Murray and McAdams, 2007). The 
link between the two can be understood by the following quotation, taken from 
the website of the Society for Personality and Social Psychology (www.spsp.org):
By exploring forces within the person (such as traits, attitudes, and goals) as 
well as forces within the situation (such as social norms and incentives), person-
ality and social psychologists seek to unravel the mysteries of individual and 
social life in areas as wide-ranging as prejudice, romantic attraction, persuasion, 
friendship, helping, aggression, conformity, and group interaction. Although 
personality psychology has traditionally focused on aspects of the individual, 
and social psychology on aspects of the situation, the two perspectives are 
tightly interwoven in psychological explanations of human behaviour.

Social Psychology
Indeed, as you learn more about social psychological research, you will notice that 
many of the prominent journals in the field, such as the Journal of Personality and 
Social Psychology, Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin and Social Psycho-
logical and Personality Science, publish research on both topics. Social psycholo-
gists are often interested in individual differences and psychologists who study 
personality and individual differences often link their work to the study of social 
psychological processes. 
Clinical psychology
Clinical psychologists attempt to understand, prevent and relieve psychologically 
based problems and promote wellbeing. For example, clinical psychology focuses 
on understanding and helping people with psychological disorders, such as bipolar 
mood disorder, schizophrenia, depression and phobias. Social and clinical 
psychology are linked in many ways and the treatments used by clinical psycholo-
gists are often informed by social psychological findings. For example, social 
psychologists study the processes underlying addictive behaviours (e.g., Fishbein, 
1982; Stroebe, 2000), eating disorders (e.g., Harrison, 2001; Stice, 2002), relation-
ship satisfaction (e.g., Pearson, Watkins, Kuyken and Mullan, 2010; Vinokur, Price 
and Caplan, 1996) and the practice of safe sex (e.g., Armitage and Talibudeen, 
2010; Sheeran, 2002). Treatment of various clinical disorders and promoting 
physical health are therefore informed by social psychological research. 
Cognitive psychology
Cognitive psychology is concerned with the study of mental processes. More 
specifically, it is the study of how people perceive, remember, think, speak and 
how they solve problems. Cognitive psychology has close links to social 
psychology and, indeed, a sub-discipline called social cognition, which we discuss 
in some detail in Chapter 3 and throughout this book, is a combination of social 
and cognitive psychology. It is the study of how people think about themselves 
and the social world and, in particular, how they make decisions and judgements 
concerning the social world. One of the main elements of theories in social cogni-
tion is that social processes occur as a result of ‘cognitive elements’, such as stere-
otypes, that are represented in the brain. Social cognition applies many theories 
and paradigms from cognitive psychology, focusing on areas such as reasoning, 
attention and memory. 
Forensic psychology
Forensic psychology is a sub-discipline that deals with both psychology and the 
legal system. It is a popular topic among students, thanks, in part, to fashionable 
television and cinematic portrayals of forensic psychologists, such as in Cracker and 
Silence of the Lambs. Forensic psychology is a rapidly developing scientific branch 
of applied psychology, drawing on clinical, cognitive and social psychology to 
address legal and criminal issues. One topic in which social psychology is closely 
linked to forensic psychology is in the study of eyewitness memory and the accu-

41
The discipline of social psychology
racy of eyewitness testimony. Researchers have investigated the effects of a wide 
range of social psychological factors on eyewitness testimony, such as the status of 
the interrogator, the status of the witness, and the nature of the communicative 
context (e.g., Ross, Read and Toglia, 1994; Sporer, Malpass and Koehnken, 1996). 
Further, research on criminal confessions has drawn upon social psychological 
knowledge on compliance and coercion (e.g., Kassin, 1997; Vennard, 1984). Forensic 
psychologists also apply knowledge on deception (e.g., Vrij, 2000) to detect lying in 
courtroom situations, and research on how people process social information to 
understand aggressive and violent behaviour (Crick and Dodge, 1994). Social 
psychological knowledge on sexist ideology has informed the study of rape 
proclivity among males (Abrams, Viki, Masser and Bohner, 2003). In summary, 
social psychology plays an important role in theories of criminal behaviour and 
therefore closely informs a great deal of research conducted in forensic psychology. 
Cyberpsychology
Cyberpsychology is a rapidly developing sub-field of psychology, which deals 
with the psychological phenomena associated with emerging technology and 
human–technology interaction. Some key topics in cyberpsychology include the 
emergence and expression of identity online (Spears, Lea and Postmes, 2007), the 
development and maintenance of online relationships (Whitty, 2007, 2008), the 
use of support groups (Tanis, 2007), group dynamics in cyberspace (Brandon and 
Hollingshead, 2007; Postmes, 2007), discrimination and prejudice in online groups 
(Douglas, 2007), self and identity (Joinson and Paine, 2007; McKenna, 2007), and 
attitude change and social influence (Sassenberg and Jonas, 2007). The study of all 
such topics has been significantly influenced by social psychological theory and 
research. As a significant proportion of the world are now connected to the 
internet and communication technology is advancing so quickly, investigations of 
online social behaviour are becoming increasingly important and of interest to 
many social psychologists (e.g., Joinson et al., 2007; Konijn, Utz, Tanis and Barnes, 
2008; Suler, 1996). 
Biology and neuroscience
Biologists examine the nature, function and evolution of living things. They 
examine how genetic factors influence people and what they do. As such, there is a 
significant link between biology and social psychology. In particular, recent years 
have seen the rise in prominence of evolutionary psychology, which approaches 
the study of human behaviour based on the assumption that the things people do 
(and think about) are a result of human evolution and, therefore, are a result of 
human biology (e.g., Neuberg, Kenrick and Schaller, 2011). Put simply, social 
behaviour and social thinking have biological roots. Evolutionary psychologists 
attempt to describe which human psychological traits (e.g., aggression, altruism) 
and behaviours (e.g., sexual selection) are ‘evolved adaptations’, that is, if such 
traits and behaviours are the result of natural selection over generations, or a result 
of sexual selection. The general argument underlying evolutionary psychology is 

42
Social Psychology
that traits and behaviours have evolved to help humans solve recurrent problems 
in ancestral contexts. 
In recent years, social psychologists have also become interested in the parts of 
the brain that are associated with various social psychological phenomena such as 
emotions and problem solving (e.g., Damasio, Grabowski, Bechara et al., 2000; 
Heatherton, Macrae and Kelly, 2004; Panksepp, 1998). In part, this has been due to 
the rise of evolutionary psychology. Social psychologists use neuroimaging tech-
niques to examine where in the brain various social processes occur. Some of these 
techniques include positron emission tomography, event-related potentials (ERPs) 
using electroencephalography (EEG), and transcranial magnetic stimulation. 
Much used in recent research, functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMri) detects 
the changes in blood flow related to neural activity in the brain during specific 
tasks (see Figure 1.11). Blood flows to parts of the brain when they are active, so 
changes in blood flow following particular tasks can be inferred to be a result of 
those tasks. In a typical study that uses this type of neuroimaging, a participant is 
asked to lie still within a large, tubular scanner and perform a task. An example 
might be a task that involves a person solving problems, or experiencing different 
emotions. The fMRI takes pictures of the brain at different times and enables 
social psychologists to determine which parts of the brain are active as a result of 
social psychological tasks. The technique has the advantage of being accurate – 
sometimes as good as within 1 mm in pinpointing an area of the brain – and can 
measure activity within the brain, which provides an advantage over other tech-
niques such as EEG, which record activity at the cortical surface. 
Social cognitive neuroscience – the study of social processes in the brain that 
allows people to understand themselves and others, and to successfully navigate 
the social world (Ochsner and Lieberman, 2001) – is a fast-growing sub-discipline 
of social psychology. It is a relatively recent area of study, beginning in the 1990s 
when researchers such as John Kihlstrom, Stanley Klein and John Cacioppo 
began to use methods such as ERPs to examine normal social cognitive proc-
esses. Instead of using questionnaires and reaction time measures, these social 
psychologists used neural measures to examine the origins of social processes 
(Lieberman, 2007; Oschner and Lieberman, 2001). The use of fMRI in social 
psychological research has exploded since 2000, and social psychologists now 
have a great deal of knowledge about things such as how people react to social 
rejection (e.g., Eisenberger, Lieberman and Williams, 2003), how people under-
stand the self (e.g., Kelley, Macrae, Wyland et al., 2002), reactions to social 
interactions (e.g., Iacoboni, Lieberman, Knowlton et al., 2004), and social cogni-
tive processing (e.g., Amodio and Frith, 2006). We will discuss some of these 
findings in social cognitive neuroscience throughout this book. The important 
thing to note about this area of social psychology is that although it is in its 
infancy, it has provided valuable insights into social processes and goes beyond 
simply describing which parts of the brain ‘light up’ following different social 
tasks. It provides a useful (although sometimes expensive) complement to 
behavioural and self-report measures.

The discipline of social psychology
Sociology and social anthropology
Social psychologists address many of the same issues as sociologists and social 
anthropologists. For example, all three disciplines study the effects of culture, group 
membership, language and intergroup behaviour. However, these topics are 
approached in different ways. Specifically, while social psychologists typically focus 
on the effects of culture, groups and so on on individual members of a group (or 
indeed the individual’s effect on cultures and groups), sociologists and anthropolo-
gists typically focus on the group or culture as a whole – how they are organized and 
how they function and change. The insights gained from sociology and social anthro-
pology influence the theories and research of social psychology, and vice versa.
Economics
Social psychological principles are being used increasingly in the study of 
economics. Economics is often concerned with how people make trade-offs 
between various resources and options. For example, an economist may study 
how people choose to save versus spend their earnings or how they take risks in 
order to make monetary gains. Social psychological research on decision-making 
processes is applicable to these sorts of economic questions. Of particular interest 
to social psychology, economists study why people make choices that are not 
always best for them. For example, why do people donate to charity when it is not 
in their own financial interests? The field of behavioural economics uses insights 
gained from psychology (including social psychology) to understand how people 
make such economic decisions. In 2002, psychologist Professor Daniel Kahneman 
was awarded the Nobel Prize in economics, largely due to his focus on issues 
relevant to both psychology and economics, such as fairness in the marketplace. 
Together with Amos Tversky, Kahneman developed prospect theory, which 
describes decisions between alternatives when the choice involves risk or uncer-
tain outcomes. The theory describes how people evaluate potential gains and 
losses in making decisions such as financial decisions. 
Dissemination of social psychology
The primary means by which social psychologists communicate their findings to 
the scientific community is through publishing their work in scientific journals. 
As you progress through your studies, you will become familiar with all the major 
journals (and many others) – there has been a marked increase in the number of 
social psychological journals in recent years. 
As mentioned earlier, many of the major journals publish work on personality 
and social psychology alongside each other, again reflecting the closeness of these 
two disciplines. Examples of such journals are the Journal of Personality and Social 
Psychology, Social Psychology Quarterly, Personality and Social Psychology 
Bulletin and Social Psychological and Personality Science. Other journals focus 
specifically on social psychology, such as the Journal of Experimental Social 

44
Social Psychology
Psychology, the European Journal of Social Psychology and the British Journal of 
Social Psychology. Other journals and volumes publish reviews of social psycho-
logical research, where authors consider the state of the art on a particular topic of 
research. Examples of such outlets are Advances in Experimental Social Psychology 
and Personality and Social Psychology Review. Finally, some journals focus on 
specific aspects of social psychology such as Group Processes and Intergroup 
Relations, Social Influence, Law and Human Behaviour, Social Cognition and Sex 
Roles. Qualitative research is published in journals such as Discourse Studies, 
Feminism and Psychology and Qualitative Research in Psychology, and some of 
the more ‘mainstream’ journals such as the British Journal of Social Psychology 
frequently publish qualitative research. Social psychologists also publish their 
work in multidisciplinary, applied, clinical, educational, biological and experi-
mental journals, such as Psychological Review, Psychological Science and Journal 
of Experimental Psychology: General, reflecting the importance of social 
psychology across psychology as a whole. 
Exploring further as an exercise, log in to IsI Web of Knowledge and go to the social sciences Journal Citation 
Reports. select ‘Psychology – social’ from the list of areas and take a look at the range of social psychology journals 
in which social psychologists publish their research. If your learning institution does not subscribe to IsI Web of 
Knowledge, try an internet search of ‘journals in social psychology’.  
Social psychologists often disseminate their research within book chapters. 
Also, with the growing use of the internet and social networking, social psycholo-
gists are increasingly making use of tools such as Facebook, Twitter, Academia.
edu, LinkedIn, Google+, and other tools such as blogs, in order to share their 
research and insights. The British Psychological Society runs a brilliant research 
digest (BPS Research Digest), providing a monthly highlight of some of the most 
interesting papers in psychology, many of which are social psychology papers. In 
summary, social psychology has a significant presence within psychology, across 
other disciplines, and within the general public. 
Chapter summary
This chapter provided a broad introduction to the discipline of 
social psychology, outlining its history, topics and methods. you 
will have learned that:
• social psychology is the study of how people think about, 
influence and relate to each other. It aims to further 
knowledge about the relationships between people and the 
social world, focusing on how people are influenced by the 
actual or implied presence of others.
• The majority of social psychologists adopt the scientific 
method, empirically putting theories to the test to make 
discoveries and refine theories. Critical social psychologists 
challenge the scientific approach, arguing that there are no 
universals of human nature.
• social psychology is a relatively recent discipline, having 
emerged in its own right in the late 1800s and early 1900s. 
Early work was influenced by behaviourism, focusing on the 
impact of positive and negative events on behaviour. 
• social psychology has also been deeply influenced by social 
events such as the holocaust, and this continues to this day. 
also, the social backgrounds of the scholars themselves have 
strongly influenced the development of social psychology. 
• Much of social psychology focuses on real-world questions 
and issues. Because of this, many social psychological 
findings are seen as ‘common sense’ – a result of what is 
known as the hindsight bias or the ‘I knew it all along’ effect. 
Perhaps also because social psychological findings can be 

45
The discipline of social psychology
intuitive, people see themselves as ‘lay social psychologists’. 
The key difference between laypeople and social 
psychologists is that the latter devise theories to answer 
questions scientifically. Doing social psychology requires the 
generation of research questions and hypotheses that are 
tested using a variety of methods and critical thinking.
• although most social psychologists adopt the scientific 
method, others have argued that hypothesis testing leads 
researchers to think less about the social context and so 
social psychology becomes less about social issues. In the 
1970s, what was viewed as a ‘crisis’ in social psychology led 
some researchers to put the ‘social’ back into the discipline. 
This led to the development of critical social psychology, 
which gives more attention to social contexts and people’s 
interactions with others.
• social psychologists have a wide variety of research ‘tools’ or 
methods at their disposal. once they have formulated a 
research question, they need to choose whether to conduct a 
quantitative investigation, a qualitative study, or to use both 
methods. Quantitative methods include surveys and 
questionnaires, and experiments. Qualitative methods include 
thematic analysis, conversational analysis, narrative analysis, 
discourse analysis and interpretative phenomenological 
analysis. Methods common to both approaches include 
observations, case studies and archival studies.
• There are several issues to consider in social psychological 
research. For example, how participants are sampled is 
important and, ideally, samples should be random in 
experimental research. a measure should be reliable, such 
that it brings about consistent results. also, it should be 
valid, in that it measures what it is supposed to be 
measuring. When conducting a study, it is also important to 
consider if the findings are statistically significant, or 
determining the probability that the finding of interest could 
have occurred by chance. 
• another key distinction in social psychological research is 
that between basic research (focusing on fundamental 
questions at the heart of human nature), and applied 
research (applying social psychological findings to social 
problems or issues). 
• Cultural issues are important in social psychology and it 
cannot be assumed that all people think and act in the same 
way. ‘Western’ social psychology often ignores key cultural 
differences between people – such as individualism and 
collectivism – that determine social outcomes. 
• social psychologists must also conduct their work ethically, 
that is, they must carry out their research with the safety and 
privacy of participants in mind.
• social psychology has close links with many other sub-
disciplines of psychology, such as cognitive, clinical and 
personality psychology. It also has close relationships with 
disciplines outside psychology, such as biology, 
neuroscience, sociology, social anthropology and economics. 
• social psychologists disseminate their research primarily 
through publications in scientific journals. however, they also 
publish book chapters, present their work in talks, and are 
making increasing use of social networking opportunities.
In Chapter 2, we begin our journey into the specific topic areas 
of social psychology, starting with the social self – the study of 
how people understand who they are. 
Essay questions
at the beginning of the chapter, we asked you to consider these 
questions:
1 In the midst of the riots in England during august 2011, British 
Prime Minister David Cameron argued that: ‘This is criminality 
pure and simple, and it must be confronted and defeated.’ 
Many other media reports labelled the incidents as ‘mindless 
violence’. Was this a fair assessment of the situation?
2 a social psychologist is interested in how media 
representations of gender roles have changed over the past 
30 years. What research method(s) would enable the 
researcher to examine this question and what are the 
advantages and disadvantages of each?
3 at a party, a social psychologist tells a friend about their 
research, explaining that most of their findings come from 
studies where the participants were undergraduates. The 
friend says that the findings cannot tell us anything about 
humans in general. Is the friend correct?
having read this chapter, these questions could also be framed 
as the following essay questions, which you can attempt in 
preparation for your examinations:
1 Critical thinking and weighing up evidence is crucial to social 
psychology. Explain, with examples, why this is the case. 
2 Imagine that you are designing a study to examine media 
representations of gender roles over the past 30 years. 
Design a study that would enable you to do so and explain 
and justify your choice of research methods.
3 sampling is a crucial issue in social psychology. Explain, with 
examples, why in some situations it is acceptable to test 
hypotheses using white undergraduate participants, and 
why sometimes it is not.

Pets and psychological wellbeing: a critical 
thinking exercise
This exercise is based on the following article:
herzog, h. (2011) The impact of pets on human health and 
psychological wellbeing: Fact, fiction or hypothesis? Current 
Directions in Psychological Science, 20, 236–9.
herzog argues that extensive media coverage and books with 
titles such as The Healing Power of Pets have led to the 
widespread belief that pets are good for people’s health, 
psychological wellbeing and life expectancy. Together, these 
ideas are commonly known as the ‘pet effect’ (allen, 2003). 
Most pet owners agree that this effect exists. When asked why 
they own pets, people typically respond that their furry 
companions are good for 
them. however, as you 
know from reading this 
chapter, personal 
opinions and convictions 
do not constitute 
evidence. To draw the 
conclusion that pets are 
good for people, 
scientific research must 
be conducted in the same 
way as medical, psychiatric or pharmaceutical investigations 
are conducted to examine the effectiveness of medical 
treatments and interventions. 

47
The discipline of social psychology
a great deal of research has investigated the veracity of the 
claim that pets are good for people. as herzog argues, this 
research question has intrigued psychologists for over 30 
years. Interestingly, however, research investigating the pet 
effect is inconclusive. some researchers have shown that pet 
owners are indeed happier and healthier than non-pet owners. 
For example, Friedmann, Katcher, lynch et al. (1980) 
demonstrated that in a group of 92 heart attack victims, 28 per 
cent of pet owners survived for a year, while only 6 per cent of 
non-pet owners survived for the same period of time. allen, 
shykoff and Izzo (2001) showed that hypertensive 
stockbrokers who were assigned to a pet ownership condition 
showed lower levels of blood pressure six months later than a 
non-pet ownership group. also, studies have shown a link 
between pet ownership and self-esteem, positive mood, life 
satisfaction and physical fitness (El-alayli, lystad, Webb et al., 
2006; headey and grabka, 2011). 
however, others studies have shown that pet owners fare no 
better than non-pet owners, and sometimes they are even less 
healthy and less happy. For example, Parker, gayed, owen et al. 
(2010) demonstrated in a study of 425 heart attack victims that 
pet owners were more (not less) likely than non-pet owners to 
die in the year following their heart attack. other studies have 
shown that pet ownership has little effect in reducing 
hypertension (e.g., Wright, Kritz-silverstein, Morton et al., 
2007). other research suggests that pet owners are no happier 
(herzog, 2010) or less lonely than non-pet owners (gilbey, 
Mcnicholas and Collis, 2007) and in another study, older 
individuals who were attached to their pets displayed higher 
levels of depression than those who were less attached 
(Miltiades and shearer, 2011). 
Why is the research inconclusive? herzog offers some 
possible reasons. In particular, Ioannidis (2005) argued that 
conflicting results are prevalent in areas of science where 
samples are small and homogeneous, and research designs are 
varied. Further, ‘hot’ research topics that are associated with a 
great deal of pre-existing opinions and attitudes are often 
prone to problems concerning replication and inconclusive 
results. The study of the pet effect fulfils these criteria and this 
exercise will hopefully allow you to think of more issues 
concerning this area of research. herzog’s article is an excellent 
example of critical thinking and appraisal of available research 
evidence. Based on what you have read above, attempt to 
answer the following questions. Perhaps after you have done 
so, you can read the article for more information. 
1 one key difference between studies showing the positive 
effects of pet ownership and those that show no effect is 
that the former tend not to use true experiments where 
participants are randomly assigned to ‘pet’ and ‘non-pet’ 
groups. how might this be one reason for the existence of 
conflicting results?
2 Many studies of the effects of pet ownership are based on 
self-report data, that is, pet owners report their health and 
happiness and so on. how might this influence the results?
3 a common problem in scientific research is known as the ‘file 
drawer effect’, in which researchers tend not to publish 
negative findings – they end up in the ‘file drawer’ never to 
be seen. Do you think this could be a problem in this area of 
research? Why/why not?
4 To what extent do you think personal opinions and vested 
interest could influence research on the effects of pet 
ownership?
Student project
Socially desirable responding
harry Musson studied as an 
undergraduate student at the 
University of Kent and his 
dissertation supervisor was Dr 
Robbie sutton. his research 
examined socially desirable 
responding – the tendency not to 
be entirely truthful or accurate in 
surveys for fear of looking bad, or 
in an effort to look good, which we discussed in this chapter. In 
particular, he was interested in how socially desirable 
responding can affect men and women differently when they 
answer rather sensitive questions about their sexual 
preferences. In Chapter 7, we will consider the debate about 
whether genetic evolution has shaped men and women’s 
sexual desires in different directions. harry’s research is directly 
relevant to that debate. 
My topic and aims
My study examined the role of socially desirable responding in 
men and women’s reports of their sexual preferences. sexual 
preferences can refer to what people want from ‘short-term 
mating’, that is, relatively casual sexual activity without any 
long-term commitment. your short-term mating preferences 
can include how many partners you would ideally like to have, 

48
Social Psychology
and how long you would prefer to know them before being 
happy to have sex with them. you can also have long-term 
mating preferences, such as the physical characteristics, 
personality traits and social status you would prefer in a  
lifelong partner. Previous self-report studies had found that 
men desire more sexual variety than women in short-term 
mating. also, in long-term mating, men reported that they 
valued physical attractiveness in women, while women valued 
status in men. since more or less the same findings are 
observed worldwide, this has been interpreted as evidence that 
genetic evolution has shaped men and women’s sexual 
preferences differently. 
In my experiment, I wanted to explore the influence of social 
desirability bias on these findings, that is, that men and women 
were not being honest in their responses due to social pressure. 
going into it, I thought that perhaps women, more than men, 
experience social pressure to downplay their desire for sexual 
variety, such as the number of sexual partners they would ideally 
like to have. Further, men and women may experience some 
pressure to report ‘traditional’ long-term mating preferences – 
leading women to downplay the importance of a partner’s 
attractiveness to them, or men to downplay the importance of a 
partner’s social status. If men and women distort their responses 
in gendered ways in an effort to look good – or to avoid looking 
bad – then perhaps the gender differences that have been so 
often observed are not to be trusted. 
My methods
Two hundred male and female undergraduates completed a 
questionnaire, which asked about their short- and long-term 
mating preferences. Questions about short-term mating 
preferences measured the number of partners participants 
desired in various time frames, the time they would need to 
know a partner they found attractive before consenting to 
intercourse and the extent to which they were currently seeking 
short-term partners. Questions about long-term mating 
preferences measured the extent to which participants were 
currently seeking a long-term partner, and the characteristics 
they would value most in a long-term mate.
The key manipulation was that half the participants were 
asked to be honest in their responses, and half were instructed to 
‘fake good’, that is, to cast themselves in the best possible light. 
Participants were randomly assigned to one of these conditions. 
The other independent variable was participants’ gender. since 
participants’ gender cannot be experimentally manipulated, the 
design of my study was technically quasi-experimental.
My findings and their implications
Results indicated similar gender differences in mating 
preferences as has been demonstrated in previous research. For 
example, compared to women, men reported a higher desire 
for sexual variety, wanting significantly more partners, and 
being prepared to have sex with people after knowing them for 
significantly less time. 
going against predictions, these gender differences were 
not more marked when participants were faking good. so, 
socially desirable responding, at least in my study, does not 
appear to be responsible for the gender difference that has 
been observed in many studies. 
The ‘faking good’ manipulation did have one effect. It 
caused both men and women to report being less willing to 
have sex with people they knew for only a brief length of time 
(a few hours or days). 
Typical long-term trait preferences were observed 
(regardless of the manipulation) and it was also found that 
women desired a partner who wanted children more than men, 
which could suggest that female participants’ desire for 
reproduction was stronger than men’s.
My journey
since graduating, I have been working as an English teacher in 
oxford and Málaga, spain. I am now pursuing a career working 
in the travel industry. I have used experience from my 
psychology degree in my teaching, and I also hope to return to 
academia in the future.
I learned how to be disciplined and self-sufficient. I learned 
about the considerable amount of research, preparation and 
effort that goes into planning and completing a project. I 
learned that demand characteristics can affect any self-report 
measure, especially on a subject as loaded as the one I chose. I 
appreciated the value of completing an extended project under 
my own steam, with helpful advice and suggestions from my 
supervisor of course.
These skills have made me appreciate the value of 
determination, drive and hard work in life, and the satisfaction 
that can be gained from seeing a lengthy project to fruition.
My advice
Choose something that fires your imagination. you may face 
challenges and setbacks along the way and it is trickier to 
motivate yourself to overcome them if you are not very 
interested in your hypothesis. also, don’t be afraid to work 
alone, as it can be a rewarding experience to complete research 
under your own steam. having said this, pose questions to your 
supervisor, peers and postgraduates in order to make sure you 
are heading in the right direction. Pick a good supervisor.

Thinking and feeling
Who are you? If someone asks you this question, you will be able to generate a 
long list of traits and identities that define how you see yourself. For example, 
you may say that you are a female, university student, politically liberal, a 
daughter, or a Muslim, among many other characteristics that together make you 
who you are. You may think about where you live or where you are from and 
consider yourself to be British, Irish or Australian. You may think about your 
daily activities and define yourself as a musician, feminist, or someone who likes 
sport. The list is endless and yet each of these aspects of the self is crucial to our 
sense of who we are. Further, at some point, you will think about who you think 
you are. Most people ask themselves questions like: ‘I think I am a musician (or a 
feminist or someone who likes sport), but how confident am I about that?’ 
Humans have a capacity to reflect on their own thinking (Lea and Kiley-
Worthington, 1996), and this ability means that people are perpetually rethinking 
and redefining themselves. 
The self is a fundamental aspect of being human and it is not only personal, but 
also intrinsically and intensely social. This is why the self is such an important 
topic in social psychology and has been a key focus of research for many years. 
The concept of the self is social because understanding the self is crucial to social 
life. Knowing who we are allows us to know what we should think, how we 
should feel and how we should behave. It helps us to interact with others, organize 
our experiences, promote our interests and regulate our behaviour. Our sense of 
self therefore defines not only what we think of ourselves, but also much of our 
social behaviour. 
There is another sense in which the self is social: we have a social relationship 
with the self, that is, we have beliefs about our traits, relationships, strengths and 
weaknesses, much as we have beliefs about other people. We like or dislike aspects 
of ourselves, much as we like or dislike aspects of other people. Further, as we 
shall see, we can help or handicap ourselves by doing things that boost or sabotage 
our chances of success. We punish ourselves when we feel we have done some-
thing wrong (e.g., Bastian, Jetten and Fasoli, 2011; Nelissen, 2012) and we some-
times view ourselves as if from the outside – as if we were another person. 
The complex, social nature of the self was one of the earliest insights of social 
psychology. James (1890) wrote that selfhood is characterized by a fundamental 
duality such that a person experiences being both ‘I’ and ‘me’. In ‘I’ mode, they 
are an experiencing, acting subject, and as ‘me’, they are the object of their own 
perceptions. Cooley (1902) took this insight further by proposing the notion of 
the ‘looking-glass self’. For Cooley and other symbolic interactionists (e.g. Blumer, 
1969; Mead, 1934), a basic task of social life is to see ourselves from the outside, 
more or less as others see us, so that a person’s developing sense of ‘me’ is attuned 
to the beliefs, expectancies and needs of others. Mead (1934) argued that when we 
evaluate ourselves, we normally adopt the perspective of the ‘generalized other’ – 
a nonspecific person who embodies the norms of our society and of those who 
matter to us. This view of ourselves helps us to be guided by social norms, to help

The social self
us so we can influence others and avoid being punished or banished. For the 
symbolic interactionists, therefore, being aware of ourselves is a crucial part of 
being able to control ourselves. 
The symbolic interactionists did not typically frame their ideas in ways that 
were easily tested using scientific methods. However, their ideas have been hugely 
influential in the social psychological study of the self, including most of the 
research we explore in this chapter. They have been translated into testable ideas, 
and have largely held up in the century or so since they were first conceived. But 
how do people become self-aware? How does this awareness help people to eval-
uate the self in order to reflect on who they are and how to change? What are its 
emotional consequences? These are the more specific questions we will be setting 
out to answer in this chapter. We focus first on what is known as the ‘self-concept’. 
Here, we consider what the self is made up of, what it is for and how our concept 
of self influences what we do. Then, we consider core theories concerning how the 
self-concept is formed and how people become self-aware. Next, we consider the 
construct of ‘self-esteem’ and how our feelings about ourselves influence how we 
cope with life situations. Moving on, we then discuss the role of motivations in 
how we perceive ourselves, in particular focusing on the core motivation to 
enhance and feel good about the self. We also consider some of the cultural differ-
ences in the study of self. By the end of this chapter, you will have a clear under-
standing of what the self is and what it is for. 
Self-knowledge and the self-concept
The self-concept is defined as the complete set of beliefs that people have about 
themselves, which form their understanding of who they are (Markus, 1977; 
Markus, Hamill and Sentis, 1987). For example, one may see oneself as feminine, 
sensitive, introverted, hard-working, creative, talkative and so on. The self-concept 
has many distinct components for each individual and these components, which 
together form a person’s overall self-concept, are known as self-schemas or 
different dimensions of the self. Of course, people’s self-schemas are different and 
therefore people’s overall self-concepts are unique – not everyone thinks of them-
selves as feminine, sensitive or introverted, for example. People are different and 
perceive themselves as such. Also, some self-schemas are particularly important to 
people and others are not. Markus (1977) argued that if people feel that a particular 
dimension is important to them, think that they are higher or lower than most 
people on that dimension, and are certain that the opposite is not true of them, 
they can be described as self-schematic on that dimension. For example, if a person 
feels that they are extroverted, are positive that they are not introverted, and being 
extroverted is important to them, then they are self-schematic on the dimension of 
extroversion. If a dimension is unimportant to a person’s sense of self, the person 
is said to be self-aschematic on that dimension. Thus, people have a complex set of 
important schemas that form their overall self-concept.

Thinking and feeling
Self-schemas are important guiding factors that determine how people think 
they should think, feel and act in specific situations (Markus, 1977). Different 
contexts activate different aspects of the self. For example, for a person who is self-
schematic on extroversion, that schema is likely to determine how they believe 
they should think, feel or behave at a social gathering – and these perceptions will 
be different for people who have the self-schema that they are introverted. A 
person who is aschematic on this dimension may be different yet again. This func-
tion of self-schemas was illustrated in a study by Markus (1977), who asked 
participants first to rate themselves on the traits of dependence and independence. 
From these ratings, participants were identified as either self-schematic for depend-
ence or independence, or aschematic on both traits. Participants were then asked to 
complete a reaction time task where they read words on a screen. The words were 
either associated with independence (e.g., ‘assertive’, ‘self-confident’) or depend-
ence (e.g., ‘conforming’, ‘cautious’) and participants were asked to press a button 
for ‘me’ or ‘not me’, depending on whether or not they felt that the trait was char-
acteristic of them. Findings revealed that participants who were self-schematic on 
independence or dependence more quickly identified the words associated with 
their schemas, compared to those who were aschematic on both dimensions (Figure 
2.1). Those who were self-schematic on one of the dimensions were also more able 
to recall experiences that demonstrated their dependence or independence. Partici-
pants’ self-schemas were, therefore, useful in 
guiding their thoughts about themselves. 
Self-schemas can influence aspects of one’s 
daily life too. People who are weight conscious 
are a good example of this (Markus et al., 1987). 
Such people, for whom body weight is a signifi-
cant daily concern, may experience visits to the 
supermarket, reading fashion magazines and 
shopping for clothing differently than those who 
are aschematic on that dimension. Such activities 
may trigger thoughts about the self in schematic 
individuals but be of little consequence for those 
who are aschematic. Such a self-schema can lead 
to body image preoccupations, in which people 
excessively monitor their weight and appearance, 
and even evaluate their worth according to their body shape (Altabe and Thompson, 
1996: see also the concept of contingent self-esteem, below). This is a particular 
concern for women, who are more, although not uniquely, prone to body image 
concerns. Eating disorders are an extreme, but all too common manifestation of 
these concerns (Strelan and Hargreaves, 2005; Strelan and Mehaffy, 2003). This 
illustrates how self-schemas’ ability to organize thought and motivate action means 
that they can become all-consuming and lead to counterproductive behaviours. 
People even have schemas of their potential future self (Markus and Nurius, 
1986; Markus and Sentis, 1982). These reflect our desired selves (e.g., happy,

The social self
successful) and feared selves (e.g., unhappy, unsuccessful) and highlight the impor-
tance of self-schemas in determining how we feel about ourselves – if one self-
schema makes us feel unhappy, then we might focus more on self-schemas that 
make us feel good. For example, if we feel self-schematic for being disorganized 
and find this aspect of the self disappointing, then we may choose to focus instead 
on our conception of self as being creative, because this makes us feel better and 
compensates for aspects of the self we think are lacking (Linville, 1985, 1987). It is 
important, therefore, that people have multiple self-schemas so that there are 
always ‘spare’ schemas to focus on when they feel they fall short on other dimen-
sions. Indeed, Linville (1985) found that low self-complexity (not many roles, 
more overlap) predicts illness, whereas high self-complexity (lots of roles, little 
overlap) does not. High self-complexity can therefore act as a buffer for stress.

This claim is at the heart of multiple role theory (e.g., Powell and Greenhaus, 
2010; Thoits, 1983), according to which it is psychologically beneficial for people 
to have multiple identities (e.g., sibling, student, friend, sports team member). 
Each role opens up new experiences, opportunities for social interaction, pleasure 
and personal growth, but also the risk of failure and frustration (see Figure 2.2). 
When one identity is creating negative feelings, having other identities enables a 
person to continue to grow and enjoy life. At the same time, however, self-schemas 
that are too well partitioned or too extreme can be problematic. For example, if 
some self-schemas are very positive and others are very negative, priming the 
schemas can have extreme effects on mood. Sometimes, it may be best to have less 
compartmentalized or more moderate self-schemas, so that priming them will not 
lead to extreme mood swings. 
It is also important that people attach positive meaning to these schemas. Some 
research on multiple role theory suggests that the quality (in terms of happiness, 
satisfaction and optimism) rather than the quantity of roles is important for 
psychological wellbeing (Baruch and Barnett, 1986). When people experience 
conflict between roles or self-schemas, they tend to experience distress (Burke, 
1991; Meyer, 2003). It may be difficult, for example, for many women to see them-
selves both as a great mother and a dedicated worker. If people’s schemas can be 
aligned with each other, for example if working women think of themselves as a 
positive role model for their children, they are likely to prosper (Greenhaus and 
Powell, 2006; Powell and Greenhaus, 2010).

Thinking and feeling
The need for the various parts of the self-concept to ‘gel’ is at the heart of self-
concept clarity (Campbell, Trapnell, Heine et al., 1996). Self-concept clarity refers 
to the extent to which self-schemas are clearly and confidently defined, consistent 
with each other, and stable across time. It is important that one’s self-beliefs and 
identities are clearly defined in one’s own mind, that they cohere, rather than clash 
with each other, and that they do not change rapidly or unpredictably. Self-concept 
clarity enables people to see themselves as having many facets, but also as individ-
uals, with a strong, unified self. Many of the projects in our lives are long term – as 
in our closest friendships and romantic relationships, or our careers. To succeed in 
these projects, we need to act consistently. It is not helpful if people’s perceptions 
of their strengths, values, priorities and goals change from day to day, or are 
inconsistent with each other. 
One of the benefits of self-concept clarity is that it bolsters self-esteem (Camp-
bell, 1990; Campbell et al., 1996). It is also related to subjective wellbeing – a 
blanket term for the experience of psychological wellness, incorporating variables 
such as satisfaction with life, freedom from anxiety and sadness, and the experi-
ence of positive mood (Campbell et al., 1996). Correlational research suggests that 
self-concept clarity helps people deal with daily negative events (Lavallee and 
Campbell, 1995), being treated unjustly by others (de Cremer and Sedikides, 2005) 
and relationship breakups (Slotter, Gardner and Finkel, 2010). 
There is also experimental evidence that self-concept clarity not only correlates 
with psychological wellbeing, but also actively bolsters it. For example, Lewand-
owski, Nardone and Raines (2010) manipulated self-concept clarity. They had 
participants undergo a procedure that either strengthened or weakened self-
concept clarity. Participants assigned to the ‘self-concept clarity condition’ were 
asked to list the times they acted in ways that were consistent with three adjectives 
they had earlier indicated were descriptive of them. For example, if they had 
earlier said they were ‘introverted’, they were asked to describe times they had 
acted in an introverted way. In contrast, participants assigned to the ‘self-concept 
confusion’ condition were asked to list the times they had acted in ways that were 
consistent with adjectives they had already indicated were not descriptive of them. 
For example, if they said they were not open-minded, they were asked to recount 
the times they had acted in an open-minded way. Participants in the clarity condi-
tion, compared to the confusion condition, reported increased satisfaction with 
and commitment to their romantic relationships. Unfortunately, there was no 
baseline condition in which participants’ self-concepts were not manipulated; 
therefore we can’t say whether an increase in clarity, compared to baseline levels, 
was beneficial to relationship satisfaction and commitment, or whether an increase 
in confusion was harmful to it. Either way, research results like this highlight the 
social function of the self. Having a clear, coherent understanding of ourselves 
(versus a confused one) helps us cope more effectively with the stresses, injustices 
and rejections thrown up by our social lives. It also gives us the confidence and 
motivation to commit to, and enjoy, our relationships with others.

The social self
Where does self-concept clarity come from? The experiment by Lewandowski 
et al. (2010) shows that self-concept clarity is not only a personality variable. It is 
true that, averaged over time, you will generally have higher self-concept clarity 
than some people and lower self-concept clarity than others. Nonetheless, your 
self-concept clarity may also change somewhat from day to day, in response to 
situational factors. Research has cast a good deal of light on the sources of self-
concept clarity. In a diary study, Nezlek and Plesko (2001) had over 100 participants 
complete the self-concept clarity scale developed by Campbell et al. (1996), twice 
a week, for up to 10 weeks. They found that self-concept clarity fluctuated from 
day to day. On some days, participants had a clearer, more coherent understanding 
of who they were than on other days. In particular, they found that the self-
concept was notably less clear on days in which participants experienced bad 
events. This finding was mediated by negative mood and reduced self-esteem. 
Ritchie, Sedikides, Wildschut et al. (2011) also found that stressful events reduced 
self-concept clarity, which in turn was associated with negative changes to psycho-
logical wellbeing. Thus, self-concept clarity may help explain why stressful events 
can be so damaging to mental health: namely, by undermining the clarity with 
which you understand who you are. When we put all these studies on self-concept 
clarity together, the relationship between self-concept clarity and self-esteem 
appears to be bidirectional. It is easier to feel good about yourself when you are 
clear about who you are – it is also easier to feel that you know who you are when 
you feel good about yourself.

Self-awareness
The self is a fundamental aspect of people’s lives and, as we mentioned earlier, 
people constantly redefine themselves as they consider what they think, feel and 
do. However, this is not to say that people are constantly thinking about the self, 
that is, we are not always aware of ‘who we are’. Self-awareness is the psycholog-
ical state of being aware of one’s characteristics, feelings and behaviours, or the 
awareness of oneself as unique. In this section, we will discuss how an awareness 
of self develops, the different types of self-awareness, and the neurological basis 
of self-awareness. 
Development of self-awareness
Awareness of the self is not something people are born with. Instead, it develops 
throughout infancy and childhood, appearing to begin at around age 18 months. In 
one study demonstrating the development of self-awareness, Lewis and Brooks-
Gunn (1978) placed a spot of rouge (red makeup) on the noses of infants aged 
between 9–12 months and sat them in front of a mirror. These young babies looked 
at their mirror image with no recognition and no effort to touch the rouge on their 
own noses. The authors argued that this was because the babies were not aware that 
the image in the mirror was their own, and they had no concept of self-awareness. 
However, children around 18 months of age who performed the same task made a 
concerted effort to rub the rouge from their own noses. It was argued that they did 
so because they had developed the understanding that the image in the mirror was 
their own and they understood that the rouge was on their own faces. Thus, they 
were in the process of developing a sense of self-awareness.

The social self
Humans are not the only animals who can recognize themselves in the mirror. 
For example, Reiss and Marino (2001) demonstrated that dolphins stopped by a 
mirror for longer if they had a black spot on their noses. Further, Gallup (1977) 
showed that great apes (gorillas, orang-utans and chimpanzees) were capable of 
self-recognition, using mirrors to help groom themselves, make faces and pick 
food from their teeth. More recent research suggests that rhesus monkeys can also 
recognize themselves in a mirror, despite it being long thought they were unable 
to do this (Rajala, Reininger, Lancaster and Populin, 2010). Thus, while people are 
predisposed to develop self-recognition at an early age, many animals also seem to 
have a sense of self.

Public and private self-awareness
It is generally understood that there are two types of self-awareness, depending on 
whether the person is aware of aspects of the self that are public or more aware of 
aspects of the self that are private. First, public self-awareness occurs when a person 
becomes aware of the public aspects of the self and how they could be judged by 
other people (Buss, 1980; Carver and Scheier, 1981; Duval and Wicklund, 1972). 
For example, think of a time when you were concerned about what others thought 
of you – maybe giving a presentation at university, singing to an audience or 
playing sport in front of a crowd. In such situations, your public self-awareness 
was activated. In these contexts, people are sometimes concerned about what 
others think because they are apprehensive about being judged or evaluated 
(Prentice-Dunn and Rogers, 1982). Nobody wants to be evaluated negatively by 
other people because this can lead to lowered levels of self-esteem and increased 
nervousness in future social interactions (e.g., Brockner, 1979; Leary and Kowalski, 
1990). Therefore, public self-awareness can sometimes be debilitating and lead 
people to be too concerned with their outward behaviours. On the upside, 
however, it is public self-awareness that leads people to adhere to norms and soci-
etal standards of behaviour in specific situations. For example, if others are 
watching and a person needs to dispose of rubbish, they are more likely to do so 
in an appropriate way because their public self-awareness leads to concerns about 
being evaluated by onlookers who might not be so impressed by littering (e.g., 
Froming, Allen and Jensen, 1985; Prentice-Dunn and Rogers, 1982). 
This state of public self-awareness is usually temporary. That is, people become 
more publicly self-aware because of a specific situation they are in. However, it is 
also the case that some people are more publicly self-aware than others in a 
chronic or dispositional sense. Specifically, people who are high in what is known 
as public self-consciousness are more chronically concerned about how they look

and how they are evaluated by others (Fenigstein, Scheier and Buss, 1975). Such 
people are more generally inclined to follow rules and norms for fear of being 
negatively evaluated by others if they deviate from these standards of behaviour 
(Prentice-Dunn and Rogers, 1982). Also, publicly self-conscious individuals are 
more likely to be concerned with their physical appearance and are more likely to 
judge others on their looks (e.g., Fenigstein, 1979; Fenigstein et al., 1975; Miller, 
Murphy and Buss, 1981; Striegel-Moore, Silberstein and Rodin, 1993). 
These context-specific and more general concerns about public evaluation are 
echoed in the private sphere. Specifically, private self-awareness refers to the psycho-
logical state where an individual is aware of the private, personal aspects of the self 
(Buss, 1980; Carver and Scheier, 1981; Duval and Wicklund, 1972). For example, a 
person may think about a time when they helped a friend who was in trouble. 
Contemplating this situation may make them become privately self-aware of their 
kindness. Or, a person may think of a time when they stole something and felt 
shameful and aware of their deceit. Being privately self-aware can have positive and 
negative consequences for people’s feelings about themselves. Also, if a person feels 
good at the time, reflecting on the self may increase the extent to which they focus 
on positive aspects, thus further improving their feeling of positivity (Scheier and 
Carver, 1977). On the downside, however, if a person does not feel good to begin 
with, reflecting on the self may increase the extent to which they focus on the more 
negative or problematic aspects of the self. This potentially depresses mood further 
(Mor and Winquist, 2002; Scheier and Carver, 1977). 
In a classic study, Scheier and Carver (1977) 
uncovered evidence of this tendency. They 
asked research participants to read a series of 
positive statements (e.g., ‘I feel happy’) out 
loud, while in another condition, people read 
out negative statements (e.g., ‘I feel empty’). 
Reading positive statements about themselves 
led to feelings of happiness, whereas reading 
negative statements had the opposite effect, 
leading to feelings of sadness. Crucially, partici-
pants who looked at their image in a mirror 
while performing the task (a manipulation of 
private self-awareness) became more extreme in 
their emotional responses to the task than 
participants who were not asked to look at 
themselves in the mirror (see Figure 2.3).

The social self
Other studies have shown that private self-awareness can be activated in situa-
tions that are emotionally arousing. For example, Scheier and Carver (1980) asked 
participants to write an essay while either being placed in front of a mirror or not. 
The essay was to be written in such a way that was inconsistent with the partici-
pants’ pre-existing attitudes (a counterattitudinal essay). This is a manipulation 
that is commonly used to generate a state of negative arousal – the rationale being 
that writing an essay that goes against one’s attitudes means that one’s behaviours 
are inconsistent with these attitudes. This creates a state of cognitive dissonance 
(see Chapter 4) and people often try to resolve the inconsistency by changing their 
attitudes. However, findings from Scheier and Carver’s study revealed that the 
participants who were placed in front of a mirror – and were therefore more 
privately self-aware – exhibited less attitude change in their essays than the 
participants who were not placed in front of a mirror. Awareness of one’s attitudes 
made participants adhere to them more rather than changing their minds. In 
essence, they were ‘true’ to themselves. 
The ability of mirrors to arouse private self-awareness has another striking 
implication – being in front of a mirror can make us more moral. In one demon-
stration of this effect, Diener and Wallbom (1976) had participants take a test of 
cognitive ability in which they had to solve anagrams (e.g., ‘cop go shyly’ is an 
anagram of ‘psychology’). Each participant was left in a room to solve anagrams 
and was given strict instructions that, although they were unsupervised, they 
should stop after the allotted time and await the return of the experimenter. In the 
self-awareness condition, participants were facing a free-standing mirror and, to 
crank up private self-awareness, were also played a tape recording of their own 
voice. In the control condition, participants sat to the side of the mirror and 
listened to a tape of someone else’s voice. The dependent variable was whether 
participants elected to cheat, continuing to work after their allotted time was over. 
As predicted, participants in the self-aware condition were significantly less likely 
to cheat (see also Vallacher and Solodky, 1979). 
This finding is consistent with the idea that private self-awareness makes our 
personal values salient. Feeling that cheating is wrong, we are less likely to cheat 
when we can observe ourselves doing so. As we shall see in Chapter 10, a lack of 
self-awareness has been blamed for the mob mentality that contributes to rioting, 
looting and intergroup atrocities such as lynchings. As the crowd gets bigger, all else 
being equal, so the personal moral standards of each individual become less salient. 
As a result, so does the severity of the violence meted out to victims and the incidents 
of antisocial behaviour. Of course, many other factors contribute to behaviours such 
as riots and crowd behaviour, as we will learn in Chapter 10 when we discuss the 
concept of deindividuation, but the mirror study of Diener and Wallbom (1976), in 
its small way, creates a situation that is diametrically opposed to a lynch mob.
This basic finding has been replicated and extended in several subsequent 
studies. For example, Beaman, Klentz, Diener and Svanum (1979) found that 
unsupervised children were less likely to steal extra sweets when placed in front of 
a mirror (see Figure 2.4). More recently, an interesting boundary condition has been

observed by Heine, Takemoto, Moskalenko et al. (2008). They replicated the 
finding that North American participants were less likely to cheat in front of a 
mirror, but also found that putting a mirror in front of Japanese participants made 
no difference to their behaviour. Heine et al. reasoned that in an interdependent or 
‘collectivist’ culture like Japan (see later in this chapter for a discussion of culture 
and self), people are more accustomed to seeing themselves as others see them. 
Thus, people in such cultures, to a greater degree than people from independent or 
‘individualistic’ cultures, effectively carry a ‘mirror in their heads’ in which they 
can see how they appear to others.

Like public self-awareness, some people are more privately self-aware in a 
chronic sense. People who are high in private self-consciousness are more likely to be 
consistent in their attitudes, are likely to experience more intense emotions, and are 
more accurate in their self-perceptions (Fenigstein, Sheier and Buss, 1975). And, 
like public self-consciousness, private self-consciousness also has positive and 
negative consequences. For example, it has been found that because privately self-
conscious individuals are more aware of changes in their physiology, they are less 
likely to suffer stress-related illnesses because they notice health problems sooner 
(Mullen and Suls, 1982). However, because of this heightened self-awareness, 
people high in private self-consciousness are also more likely to suffer from depres-
sion than others because they are more likely to dwell on negative feelings (Mor 
and Winquist, 2002; Smith and Greenberg, 1981).

The biological basis of self-awareness
Evidence suggests that a specific part of the brain called the ‘anterior cingulate 
cortex’ (Figure 2.5) is responsible for controlling and monitoring intentional 
behaviour among other complex social cognitive processes such as processing 
information about the self (Kelley, Macrae, Wyland et al., 2002). This area, in the 
frontal lobe of the cerebral cortex, appears to be activated when people become 
self-aware (Kjaer, Nowak and Lou, 2002). Although this is probably not the only 
area associated with self-awareness, evidence that spindle cells in this part of the 
brain develop rapidly around 18 months of age also lends support to the impor-
tance of the anterior cingulate cortex in self-awareness. On the other hand, chronic

The social self
self-awareness, enduring through time rather than being produced by a situation, 
appears to be associated with a different region of the brain, the medial frontopari-
etal networks, which are normally activated when people are engaged in self-
focused, effortful processes (Eisenberger, Lieberman and Satpute, 2005). Thus, so 
far we lack a clear picture of whether different regions of the brain are specialized 
in self-awareness. To our knowledge, no study has yet been published attempting 
to distinguish brain regions associated with public versus private self-awareness.

Theories of self
Now that we know how people develop a sense of self-awareness, what types of 
self-awareness exist, and something about the ‘location’ of self-awareness within 
the brain, we move on to consider some of the core theories of self. These theories 
address why people perceive themselves the way they do. As you read, you will 
notice that all these theories argue that people define the self in comparison to some 
standard. For example, self-perception theory argues that people learn about them-
selves through examining their own thoughts, feelings and behaviours. Self-
discrepancy theory and the control theory of self-regulation argue that people can 
improve their self-concept by comparing it to their internal goals and standards. 
Regulatory focus theory proposes that people have distinct self-regulatory systems 
that are associated with their goals. Social comparison theory involves viewing the 
self compared to other people or the self at another time. Finally, the self-evaluation 
maintenance model explains how people are able to maintain positive self-esteem 
when they compare themselves to others. We now discuss these six theories.

Thinking and feeling
Self-perception theory
Self-perception theory argues that people may learn about themselves by examining 
their own thoughts, feelings and behaviours. Of these three, behaviours are most 
important, however, because they are more objective and observable. Bem (1967, 
1972) argued that people become aware of their own attitudes (and in a sense, who 
they are) by looking at what they do. In other words, people look at their own 
behaviours and infer aspects of the self from those behaviours; for example, a 
person may reflect on their behaviour of studying hard for an exam and, as a 
result, they may view themselves as hard-working and studious. Self-perception 
effects like this can also occur by just imagining behaving in a certain way. For 
example, van Gyn, Wenger and Gaul (1990) split a sample of runners into two 
groups. One group trained on exercise bikes, while the other did not. Further, half 
the participants in each group were asked to imagine themselves training and the 
other half were not asked to imagine themselves training. Results revealed, as 
predicted, that the subsequent performance of groups who had trained on the 
exercise bikes was superior. However, those who had simply imagined themselves 
training did better than those who did not. Van Gyn et al. argued that imagining 
themselves training had influenced participants’ self-concept, which then influ-
enced their behaviour to be more consistent with the self-concept. 
Self-discrepancy theory
Self-discrepancy theory focuses on people’s awareness of discrepancies between how 
they are, how they would like to be, and how they think they ought to be (Higgins, 
1987). It also focuses on how people react, emotionally, to these discrepancies. 
According to Higgins, there are three aspects of the self-concept:
1 the actual self: how a person sees the self at the present time 
2 the ideal self: how a person would like to see the self 
3 the ought self: how a person thinks they ought to be, based on ideals of duty and 
responsibility. 
According to the theory, people strive to make sure that their actual self is as close 
as possible to the ideal and ought selves, which both act as benchmarks to help 
guide behaviour (see Figure 2.6). If significant discrepancies exist between the 
actual, ideal and ought selves, this results in psychological discomfort. For 
example, if a person is studying dentistry at university but would really rather be a 
musician, and their parents would like them to join the family retail business, 
there are significant discrepancies between the actual, ideal and ought selves and 
the person will probably experience some psychological uneasiness. 
According to the theory, different discrepancies are associated with different 
responses. Specifically, if there is a discrepancy between the actual and ought 
selves, this is said to lead to emotional reactions such as frustration and annoyance 
(Higgins, Bond, Klein and Strauman, 1986). The dentistry student who visits their 
parents during the university vacation will be acutely aware of the fact that their 
parents would rather they joined the family business. The student is not therefore

fulfilling their parents’ expectations and will experience frustration and annoy-
ance. A discrepancy between the actual and ideal self, on the other hand, is said to 
lead to emotions such as sadness and disappointment. The person studying hard 
for their dentistry exam may feel dejected if they think about the music they could 
be playing instead. In one classic study, Higgins et al. (1986) demonstrated the 
emotional responses to actual/ideal and actual/ought self-discrepancies. In their 
study, they initially gathered data on participants’ level of self-discrepancies. In a 
separate testing session, participants were asked to focus on (and describe) the 
difference between their actual and their ideal or ought self. Results revealed that 
high discrepancy participants who thought about their actual/ideal discrepancies 
experienced more dejection-related emotions (e.g., disappointment and sadness). 
High discrepancy participants who were asked to think about their actual/ought 
discrepancies experienced negative emotions related to agitation (e.g., annoyance 
and frustration). Compared to the high discrepancy participants, the low discrep-
ancy participants experienced no significant changes in either type of emotion. 
So, it is reasonable to assume that people will be motivated to reduce their 
self-discrepancies in order to eliminate, or at least attenuate, the experience of 
negative emotions. They may change aspects of their behaviour in order for their 
actual self to become more in line with the ideal, therefore engaging in a process 
of self-regulation. However, people may not necessarily display this adaptive 
response. Instead, negative emotions can sometimes get in the way of self-regula-
tion and the ability to make changes. Feeling sad, frustrated or annoyed can lead 
people to look for ‘quick fix’ solutions that make them feel better in the short 
term rather than helping them reach a long-term solution. One common example 
often used to describe this type of outcome relates to how people manage their 
weight. A person on a diet might be able to manage what they eat, but being 
reminded that they are still not as thin as they would like may lead them to opt 
for a quick fix solution to their unhappiness. Thus, they may head to the nearest 
fridge for a chocolate bar. Similarly, you may know people who engage in ‘retail 
therapy’ to make themselves feel better. However, such behaviour does not assist 
the individual in reaching a long-term goal.

Regulatory focus theory
Higgins (1997, 1998) built on self-discrepancy theory to create regulatory focus 
theory, which proposes that people have two distinct self-regulatory systems –

achieve their ideal, but people focused on prevention tend to think more about 
what they ought to be and the obligations they have. There is some evidence to 
suggest that there are individual differences in this construct. In other words, 
some people are generally promotion focused and others are more generally 
prevention focused. Higgins and Silberman (1998) argued that this difference 
emerges during childhood. In particular, promotion-focused adults tend to have 
more childhood experiences based on the presence or absence of positive adult 
responses (e.g., praised for being good and criticized for being bad). In contrast, 
prevention-focused adults tend to have more childhood experiences based on the 
presence or absence of negative adult responses (e.g., criticized for being bad and 
praised for being good). 
The promotion system is related to people’s achievements towards their ideal 
self. For example, they may focus on achieving a high grade and study harder to 
do so. They may, in general, show a focus on challenges as things to move towards 
and to achieve. Research suggests that promotion-focused people tend to 
remember information related to the pursuit of success, whereas prevention-
focused people tend to focus on failures (Higgins and Tykocinski, 1992). Further, 
promotion-focused individuals tend to focus on tasks described as gains or non-
gains, whereas prevention-oriented individuals appear to focus more on tasks 
described as potential losses or non-losses (Shah, Higgins and Friedman, 1998). 
Although there are individual differences in regulatory focus, the same person 
can switch from promotion to prevention, and from prevention to promotion, 
depending on the situation. When people are presented with the possibility of 
losses, they become prevention focused, and when presented with the possibility 
of gains, they become promotion focused (e.g., Eiser, Eiser and Greco, 2004). 
Mood is another temporary factor that can influence regulatory focus, and was the 
topic of a meta-analysis by Baas, de Dreu and Nijstad (2008). Previous research 
had revealed mixed findings about the relationship between mood and creativity – 
some studies showed that positive mood states can enhance creativity, whereas 
others showed that people are more creative when in a negative mood. Analysing 
all these results together, Baas et al. found that regardless of their positivity or 
negativity, mood states associated with prevention focus (e.g., relaxed, anxious) 
were also associated with reduced creativity. Positive moods associated with 
promotion focus (e.g., happiness) were correlated with creativity, while negative 
moods were not related to decreases in creativity, so long as they were promotion 
oriented (e.g., sadness). A meta-analysis such as this is a good way of teasing apart 
discrepant findings but also relies on a good level of critical thinking. Baas et al.’s 
application of regulatory focus theory allowed them to solve the puzzle of the 
effects of mood on creativity. 
The benefits of promotion focus for creativity and the adverse effects of preven-
tion focus were also demonstrated in an experiment by Friedman and Förster 
(2001, Study 1). They elicited a temporary regulatory focus with a manipulation in 
which participants had to solve a maze. A mouse was depicted in the middle of the

was outside the maze, while in the prevention-focus condition, a nasty-looking 
hawk was hovering over the maze. In solving the maze, participants were either 
promoting the mouse’s pursuit of the cheese or preventing the mouse from being 
eaten. After completing the maze, participants were asked to complete a range of 
creativity tasks. Those who had completed the ‘cheesy’ maze were significantly 
more creative than those who had completed the ‘hawky’ maze.

Control theory of self-regulation
The control theory of self-regulation, devised by Carver and Scheier (1981, 1998), 
argues that people compare themselves with internal or private standards for the 
self. However, in contrast with other theories, it proposes that people engage in a 
cognitive feedback loop of self-regulation that involves four steps: test, operate, test 
and exit. It looks a bit like a flowchart (see Figure 2.7). In the initial test phase, the 
individual compares the self with one of two standards. As we saw earlier, self-
awareness involves both public and private awareness, so according to this theory, 
individuals may compare themselves to a public (e.g., group norm) or private 
standard (e.g., value) for the self. If this test reveals a discrepancy, that is, the self 
does not meet the ideal, then the individual addresses the problem by going into 
the operate phase of the loop. In this phase, the individual will endeavour to change 
some aspect of the self (usually a behaviour) to try to more closely match the 
standard they would like to meet. Naturally, at some later time, they will think

about this aspect of the self again and, in doing so, they 
re-enter the test phase and reassess the extent to which their 
behaviour meets the standard or ideal. If no discrepancy is 
detected, then the process ends and the individual exits the 
feedback loop. However, until this standard is met, the 
individual will remain in the loop, changing their behaviour 
and retesting until the discrepancy has been resolved. 
According to the control theory of self-regulation, 
people can make improvements to the self by self-appraisal 
and self-regulation. Indeed, there is some evidence to 
suggest that this may work in efforts to prevent relapse 
among sex offenders (e.g., Ward, 2000) and in people’s 
efforts to pursue their goals (e.g., Emmons, 1996). However, 
this is not always the case. For example, Baumeister, Brat-
slavsky, Muraven and Tice (1998) demonstrated that care-
fully regulating an aspect of the self can actually make it 
more difficult to regulate other aspects of the self. Partici-
pants volunteered for a study ostensibly about taste percep-
tion. They were asked not to eat for some time before they participated in the 
study. When they came to the laboratory, they found that it smelled of chocolate 
cookies that had just been freshly baked. Participants were then seated behind a 
desk with a bowl of chocolate cookies on one side of the desk and a bowl of 
radishes on the other. Participants were placed in one of two possible conditions – 
in one they were asked to eat two/three radishes and in the other, they were asked 
to eat two/three cookies. Baumeister et al. reasoned that participants in the 
radishes condition would have to self-regulate, in other words, they would have 
to stop themselves from eating the cookies. Essentially, participants were in either 
a self-regulation condition or a condition where they were free to pursue their 
desired behaviour. After completing the task, participants were asked to help the 
experimenter on a second task, where they were asked to complete a virtually 
impossible problem and to take their time doing so. Those who had participated 
in the self-regulation condition (the radishes group) persisted to solve the difficult 
puzzle, on average, for only 8 minutes compared to participants in the other 
condition (the cookies group) who persisted, on average, for 19 minutes. 
Baumeister et al. argued that the first group of participants struggled because they 
had to self-regulate on the earlier task. This creates a problem because people do 
not possess endless cognitive resources to cope when self-regulation is required. 
The cognitively depleted participants therefore struggled to self-regulate on a 
second task, even when it had nothing to do with the original task. 
Known as ego depletion, this effect has been widely demonstrated (for a meta-
analysis of 83 studies, see Hagger, Wood, Stiff and Chatzisarantis, 2010), and is 
expected by the strength model of self-control proposed by Baumeister et al. (1998). 
According to this model, self-control is akin to physical exercise. Just as we get 
tired after exercising for a certain period of time and can no longer continue effec-

tively, we are not able to exert effortful control for an unlimited period of time. 
After a rest, the ability to self-control returns (Tyler and Burns, 2009). People who 
regularly engage in self-control over a long period of time slowly become less 
susceptible to ego depletion, just as exercising regularly over a period of months 
makes people physically fitter (Gailliot, Plant, Butz and Baumeister, 2007).

Social comparison theory
In addition to observing their own behaviour and comparing their actual self with 
other internal standards of the self, people also look to others for important infor-
mation about the self. Specifically, they compare themselves with other people – 
both those who they see as ‘better’ and those they view as ‘worse’ on various 
dimensions – to learn important information about themselves. This is quite 
different to the process of comparing oneself with various internal standards of the 
self. After all, a person’s values, beliefs, attitudes and behaviours are subjective and 
cannot be validated against an objective source. When a person defines the self 
against their ideal self, for example, they are comparing themselves with an ideal 
that cannot be externally validated. Comparing oneself with others, on the other 
hand, allows the individual to compare the self with a source that can be externally 
validated. Comparing oneself with others provides an external and objective anchor 
against which one can compare one’s values, beliefs, attitudes and behaviours.

The social self
Social comparison theory (Festinger, 1954) is specific about how people make 
these comparisons and why they do so. According to this theory, people learn 
information about themselves and how to perceive themselves by comparing 
themselves with other people. It is important for people to feel confident in their 
perceptions of themselves and in the absence of objectively valid information 
about the self, people tend to base their evaluations of themselves on comparisons 
with others. In making these comparisons, people often compare themselves with 
others who are similar to the self. This makes sense because people want to vali-
date their sense of self and often look to the closest others to do so. However, it is 
often more useful (and sometimes even unavoidable) to compare the self with 
others who are ‘better’ than the self on whatever dimension. This upward social 
comparison – comparing oneself with someone who is perceived to be better than 
the self – can have a negative impact on self-esteem (Blanton, Crocker and Miller, 
1999; Collins, 1996; Wood, 1989). However, there are strategies to deal with this, 
as we will discuss in the next section. It does not feel nice when one falls short 
compared to another person. 
It is also possible to compare the self with others who are ‘worse’ than the self 
in a specific domain and this is known as downward social comparison. Of course, 
this type of comparison makes a person feel good. It is always nice to compare 
favourably to another person and, indeed, this has positive effects for the self-
concept (Wills, 1981). However, to be able to make accurate judgements about the 
self, a person needs to engage in both upward and downward social comparisons. 
Think of a particular sporting ability, for example. People learn how good they 
really are at a particular sport by comparing themselves with a broad range of 
others, both those who do better and those who perform worse than themselves.
Just as people compare themselves to others, they also compare themselves as 
they are now to themselves as they have been in the past. These are known as 
temporal comparisons (Albert, 1977). Like social comparisons, temporal comparisons 
can be upward (e.g., ‘I used to be more relaxed’) or downward (e.g., ‘I am wiser now 
than I was’). Albert (1977) argued that these temporal comparisons behave in much 
the same way as social comparisons – downward social comparisons make us feel 
better about ourselves as we are now, whereas upward social comparisons may help 
us determine how to improve (e.g., recover lost ground). Subsequent research shows 
that people engage in temporal comparison at least as often as they engage in social 
comparisons. However, people are especially likely to engage in temporal compari-
sons – typically downward temporal comparisons  – when they are interested in 
feeling good about themselves. When people want to improve, they are more likely 
to engage in social comparisons (Wilson and Ross, 2000). 
In a follow-up paper, Wilson and Ross (2001) reported that people boost their 
current self-esteem by denigrating their past selves, who then provide a convenient 
downward comparison. Wilson and Ross asked psychology students to rate them-
selves on a series of traits (e.g., narrow-minded, immature, naive, self-confident, 
self-motivated, socially skilled) about two weeks into their first year. Some two 
months later, the same students rated themselves a second time, and were also asked

to rate themselves as they were when they completed 
the questionnaire the first time. Results show that 
participants systematically denigrated their past 
selves, rating themselves more harshly in retrospect 
than they did at the time. This retrospective self-
denigration allowed participants to convince them-
selves that they were better now than they had been 
two months earlier (see Figure 2.8). However, they 
actually seemed to see themselves somewhat less 
favourably at time 2 than they had at time 1 (the 
reason for this is unknown, but perhaps the excite-
ment and anticipation of starting university provides 
a temporary boost to self-evaluation, which wears 
off within a couple of months). 
It seems paradoxical that, at one level, people 
would want to preserve their self-esteem, but denigrate their past selves to achieve 
it. It would appear that the value of the past self is expendable in the pursuit to 
esteem the present self. However, this result may be less paradoxical than it seems. 
Different brain regions – the medial prefrontal cortex and the right inferior pari-
etal cortex respectively – appear to be associated with thinking about the present 
self and the past (or future) selves (D’Argembeau, Stawarczyk, Majerus et al., 
2010). Versions of oneself that are distant in time may be perceived to be rather 
unlike the ‘me’ of the present day, and their full humanity, relative to one’s present 
self, may be less salient (Haslam and Bain, 2007).
Research has also shown that people maintain a similar ‘illusion of improve-
ment’ with regard to their relationships. For example, Sprecher (1999) found that 
when asked to indicate how satisfied they were with their long-term romantic 
relationship a year ago, people remembered being less satisfied than they were at 
the time. Their actual relationship satisfaction did not change, but the retrospec-
tive denigration of their relationship as it had been allowed them to perceive that 
they were growing more satisfied with their relationship.
Self-evaluation maintenance model
Imagine you are a footballer who is constantly outscored by a particular teammate, 
or a student whose brother or sister always performs better at university. You are 
unlikely to feel particularly good about these things. After all, you are constantly in 
a situation where you are compared with someone ‘better’, in other words, you are 
constantly faced with an upward social comparison. Sometimes, comparing the self 
with others can make people good, and sometimes it may not. Ultimately, however, 
people want to feel good about themselves and maintain positive self-esteem. The 
self-evaluation maintenance model (Tesser, 1988) explains how people are able to do 
this in the case of upward social comparisons. Specifically, when people compare 
themselves with individuals whose achievements outshine their own, this model 
explains how they are able to maintain their self-esteem.

The social self
As we learned earlier, people often engage in upward social comparisons. 
Knowing someone who is successful or a high achiever can naturally invoke an 
upward social comparison. This may be especially the case when the domain is 
important or relevant to the individual’s self-concept. For example, a footballer 
will see their teammate as a relevant anchor for comparing the self, and their 
success may therefore be threatening to the self-concept, undermining the view of 
the self as successful. Another factor that may lead to social comparison is uncer-
tainty about one’s own abilities in the specific domain. For example, a footballer 
who is uncertain of their ability as a striker may be more likely to engage in 
upward comparisons with other strikers and may especially feel challenged when 
confronted with a high achiever. This uncertainty can lead to a cycle where the 
individual becomes less certain of their abilities and feels more threatened. Both 
factors are likely to adversely influence feelings about the self. 
According to the self-evaluation maintenance model, people adopt specific 
strategies to deal with such situations so that they are able to maintain a positive 
sense of self (Table 2.1): 
1 Exaggerate the ability of the ‘better’ person: Your football teammate may just 
be a freak or some kind of genius whom any person would struggle to surpass. 
In doing so, it is still possible to think of the self as good because the comparison 
other is in an entirely different league and is an unrealistic target to aspire to 
(e.g., Alicke, LoSchiavo, Zerbst and Zhang, 1997). 
2 Engage in downward social comparison: While people are thinking of the 
person who is better, they can cope by also thinking of someone worse. You 
may think of your poor football friend on the bench who never gets the 
opportunity to play. Comparing the self with less favourable others is good for 
self-esteem. 
3 Avoid the comparison person: One might avoid speaking to the football team-
mate, which makes one feel better because the person is not constantly visible, 
making obvious the gap in ability. 
4 Devalue the dimension on which the other person is better: For example, you 
may say to yourself that football is not that important anyway – it is not the be 
all and end all – so it does not matter that your teammate is better.

Thinking and feeling
However, people do not always engage in upward social comparison in such 
situations and so do not always need to resort to one of the self-esteem main-
taining strategies. You can probably remember a time when a sibling, family 
member or close friend did well or achieved something good, but rather than 
feeling anxious and unhappy (and therefore needing to engage in self-repair), you 
felt proud and happy. How does this come about? Instead of engaging in a process 
of social comparison, people sometimes engage in social reflection, where they are 
able to derive their self-esteem from the success and achievements of close others, 
without thinking about their own achievement on a particular domain (e.g., Tesser, 
1991; Tesser and Collins, 1988). For example, if we like a person, we are more 
likely to feel positive about their achievements, and we are also likely to have a 
positive response if we see the person as particularly deserving (Ortony, Clore and 
Collins, 1988). We also do this on a group level. For example, we have a tendency 
to ‘bask’ in the reflected glory of the sports team we support (see Figure 2.9) – it 
makes us feel good to associate ourselves with success (e.g., Cialdini, Borden, 
Thorne et al., 1976). According to the model, people may do so, but only if one of 
two conditions are met: 
1 The domain on which the high-performing person is successful may be irrele-
vant. For example, one may not consider it an important part of the self-concept 
to be a good singer. So, if one’s close friend is a successful vocalist, this does not 
challenge our own self-concept. If this is the case, we can be happy for the 
person because it adds something to the self (e.g., we know someone successful) 
without feeling threatened. 
2 We may be less threatened by a high-performing individual if we are confident 
that we too are exceptional in this particular domain. For example, if a person is 
a successful vocalist whose best friend on their course is also enjoying some 
success, threat to the self-concept is less of a problem. Again, the other person’s 
success is likely to add something to our self-concept because it reminds us that 
we are surrounded by successful people, and that feels good. 
In a similar vein, Lockwood and Kunda (1997) found that thinking about 
‘superstars’ in self-relevant domains such as sport and the arts led to self-deflation 
when people felt their own abilities were fixed, or that similar achievements were 
unattainable for them. If people felt they were young and able enough to have a 
chance to emulate their superstars, then thinking about them actually produced 
inspiration. In later studies, Lockwood and Kunda (1999) found that superstars, 
while normally seen as inspiring role models, produced deflation if people had 
already been primed to think of the best aspects of themselves as they currently 
are. Apparently, superstars are inspiring in that they help us see how we might 
improve ourselves. If we don’t think there’s much scope for us to improve, then 
superstars are intimidating social comparators.

The social self
Self-esteem
From the theories covered in this chapter so far, you will now be in no doubt that 
people spend a lot of time thinking about themselves, comparing themselves with 
others and thinking about how they fare. We have also mentioned the term ‘self-
esteem’ a few times already. As laypeople, we all know more or less what this 
concept means, and we know that our self-esteem can have significant implica-
tions for how we function psychologically. In this section we focus on the scien-
tific study of self-esteem.
Self-esteem is defined in the literature as people’s subjective appraisal of them-
selves as intrinsically positive or negative (Rosenberg, 1968; Sedikides and Gregg, 
2003). A person’s self-esteem can vary quite a bit depending on the situation. For 
example, it can be particularly high when we achieve success or when something 
good happens to us, or it can be particularly low when we fail at something 
important or if something bad happens. However, thinking of your friends, family 
and acquaintances, you can probably call to mind examples of people who gener-
ally have high self-esteem and those who have lower self-esteem. While there are 
situational fluctuations in self-esteem, there is evidence to suggest that there are 
chronic individual differences in self-esteem. We discuss these individual differ-
ences here, but to understand these differences, we must first understand the 
origins of self-esteem.

Developing self-esteem
Theorists argue that the way children are raised is a strong determinant of their 
self-esteem (e.g., Baumeister, Campbell, Krueger and Vohs, 2003; Baumrind, 
1991). Specifically, it is argued that there are three parenting styles that differ in 
terms of how demanding (e.g., controlling, punishing) and responsive (e.g., warm, 
supporting) the parent is to the child. Findings suggest that the following parental 
styles can affect self-esteem:
1 Authoritarian: Children with parents who are authoritarian (more demanding 
and less responsive) tend to have lower self-esteem. Such parents are often 
too strict with their children, leading children to feel less confident in their 
own abilities. 
2 Permissive: Children whose parents are overly permissive (less demanding and 
more responsive) also have lower levels of self-esteem (e.g., DeHart, Pelham 
and Tennen, 2006).

3 Authoritative: Children with the highest self-esteem tend to have parents who 
are both demanding and responsive. Such parents seem to strike the right 
balance between strictness and punishment when children do things wrong, 
and being supporting and warm with their children. 
There is some evidence to suggest that children develop a stable sense of self-
esteem from their childhood experiences. However, it is also the case that self-
esteem changes over the course of the life span. For example, a meta-analysis on 
self-esteem by Robins, Trzesniewski, Tracy et al. (2002) found that self-esteem 
among children (aged 6–11) was fairly unstable, arguably because children’s self-
concepts are in a process of development. It was found that among adults in their 
twenties, self-esteem was more stable than in the young children and that this 
remained into later adulthood. The authors argued that this is because adults have 
a more defined self-concept that is more resistant to life events. The authors also 
found, however, that people’s self-esteem becomes less stable again around age 60. 
They argued that this might be because of the many life changes that occur during 
this period of life – people retire, their health may fail and they may experience the 
death of close others.

Sources of self-esteem
Some sources of self-esteem are internal to the person. For example, Pelham and 
Swann (1989) found that people who tend to experience mostly positive emotions 
and rarely experience negative emotions have high self-esteem. People who have 
specific, positive self-schemas (e.g., a good friend, a hard worker, devoted mother) 
also experience higher self-esteem, especially if they are relatively certain of their 
positive self-evaluation on these specific dimensions, and if they attach importance 
to them. People who are abstract and flexible in the way they evaluate themselves 
on these schemas also have more robust self-esteem (Updegraff, Emanuel, Suh 
and Gallagher, 2010). For example, if you evaluate how good a friend you are 
strictly on the basis of how quickly you return texts and emails, your self-esteem 
may take a downward turn at times where you are too busy or distracted to reply 
to your friends’ messages. In contrast, your self-esteem will be more resilient if 
you also bear in mind the other respects in which you are actually a good friend, 
such as the times you have helped your friend through a crisis. 

77
The social self
Some sources of self-esteem come from outside the person. Social acceptance 
by others helps to boost self-esteem (e.g., Leary, Cottrell and Phillips, 2001; Leary, 
Tambor, Terdal and Downs, 1995). This is consistent with the symbolic interac-
tionists’ idea that the self is a social construct that serves social purposes. Leary et 
al. (1995, 2001) argue that self-esteem is a kind of internal barometer of the extent 
to which the person is being included versus excluded by other people. The more 
you are socially excluded, the lower your self-esteem; the more you are included, 
the higher your self-esteem. Thus, Leary et al. refer to self-esteem as a sociometer. 
High self-esteem is a pleasant state, whereas low self-esteem is aversive, so people 
are generally motivated to maintain high levels of self-esteem. According to soci-
ometer theory, this motivation serves an important purpose. It drives us to behave 
in ways that increase self-esteem, which means that it motivates us to ensure that 
we are socially included by behaving in ways that are acceptable and rewarding 
for others. Conversely, it deters us from risking harm to our self-esteem by acting 
in ways that are likely to lead to rejection. Thus, self-esteem is part of a system in 
which we monitor our social environment for signs of inclusion or rejection, and 
modify our behaviour in order to ensure that we are socially included (see later in 
this chapter for the importance of inclusion, or ‘belonging’, in human life). 
Leary et al. (1995) uncovered early evidence for their theory in a set of five 
studies. They showed that self-esteem was highly correlated with people’s assump-
tions about whether they are likely to be accepted or rejected by other people. 
Denissen, Penke, Schmitt and van Aken (2008) compared the average self-esteem 
levels of citizens of a number of developed countries. These countries were 
members of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development 
(OECD), and hailed from all continents except Africa. They found that countries 
whose citizens regularly spend time with friends enjoyed higher levels of self-
esteem. This finding held, even controlling for the overall happiness, wealth and 
anxiety levels of each country. 
Other studies have dealt with the problems of interpreting correlational find-
ings in cross-sectional research designs such as those used by Leary et al. That is, 
does a cause b, or does b cause a? In a longitudinal study, Srivastava and Beer 
(2005) showed that being liked by others predicted subsequent increases in self-
esteem, precisely as sociometer theory suggests. Having high self-esteem did not 
predict being liked by others later. Similarly, in a study of German citizens, 
Denissen et al. (2008) found that the quality of interactions with friends and family 
members predicted self-esteem later in the same day. However, self-esteem did not 
predict interaction quality later in the day. Again, the direction of causality seems 
to point in the direction suggested by sociometer theory – from inclusive social 
interactions to self-esteem, and not vice versa (Figure 2.10).

78
Thinking and feeling
Sociometer theory is able to cast light on some of the specific sources of self-
esteem. Anthony, Holmes and Wood’s research (2007) found that self-esteem is 
most strongly connected to self-evaluations on traits that help gain social accept-
ance. For their participants (Canadian undergraduate students), this was typically 
appearance and popularity. Thus, self-esteem was most strongly correlated with 
these traits. However, when people are in roles where others depend on them, 
traits such as kindness and understanding may be more important in being 
accepted. For example, if you are in a close personal relationship, being kind and 
understanding is important in being accepted by the person whose acceptance of 
you presumably matters most – your partner. 
Like other widely discussed theories, sociometer theory has had its critics. 
Notably, Pyszczynski, Greenberg, Solomon et al. (2004) point out that socio-
meter theory is less convincing about how people react to signs of social exclu-
sion. Frequently, people react to rejections of romantic overtures, or social 
exclusion, by withdrawing further from social contact (Baumeister, Wotman and 
Stillwell, 1993), or even by being aggressive (Twenge, Baumeister, Tice and 
Stucke, 2001). If self-esteem really is part of a system designed to motivate 
people to seek social inclusion, they argue, people would respond to social rejec-
tion with lowered self-esteem, followed by efforts to be reincluded. It is difficult 
to explain why they would effectively exclude themselves further from social 
life following rejection. Interested readers might like to check out Leary’s (2004) 
reply to this and other criticisms by Pyszczynski et al. (2004). Also of interest, a 
recent meta-analysis of 192 studies suggests that the experience of being rejected 
by others may not lower self-esteem. Instead, it produces a kind of emotional 
numbness in which people experience neither positive nor negative mood 
(Blackhart, Nelson, Knowles and Baumeister, 2010), although this may depend 
on precisely in what form the rejection is experienced (see Chapter 9 for a 
discussion of ostracism and its effects).
Contingent self-esteem
Sources of self-esteem vary from person to person. Some people base their self-
esteem primarily on their appearance, others on social approval, others on how 
virtuous they are, and yet others on their successes. Crocker and Wolfe (2001) 
and Crocker and Park (2004) termed these the ‘contingencies’ of self-worth. 
They also developed a contingent self-esteem scale to measure differences 
between people in what is important to their sense of self-worth. They found 
that people who base their self-esteem on a narrow range of sources tend to expe-
rience lower levels of psychological wellbeing than those who stake their self-
esteem on a broad range of sources. This finding is consistent with multiple role 
theory. Many studies since have provided support for its predictions. For 
example, among a sample of over 5,000 young Swedish adults, a contingent self-
esteem in which self-worth is staked on work performance led both women and 
men to take risks with their health, by coming in to work even when they were 
sick (Löve, Grimby-Ekman, Eklöf et al., 2010). 

79
The social self
Consequences of self-esteem
Why does it matter to have a high self-esteem? What happens to people who have 
lower self-esteem? Many social psychologists have attempted to answer these 
questions, identifying the consequences of having relatively high and lower levels 
of self-esteem (e.g., Baumeister, Tice and Hutton, 1989; Bushman and Baumeister, 
1998). Here, we discuss some of the ways in which a person’s level of self-esteem 
influences how they deal with life events.
Mood regulation 
Some research has shown that people who have lower levels of self-esteem are less 
likely to make the effort to make themselves feel better (e.g., Heimpel, Wood, 
Marshall and Brown, 2002; Wood, Heimpel and Michela, 2003). For example, 
Wood et al. (2003) examined people’s recollections of positive life events. They 
found that people with lower levels of self-esteem (compared to people with 
higher levels) were more likely to downplay the positive feelings they experienced 
in the event. They also showed a tendency to make themselves feel less positive 
and distract themselves from the positive feelings. Other findings have shown that 
people with lower levels of self-esteem also deal differently with negative life 
events. For example Heimpel et al. (2002) asked people who had reported a nega-
tive event (a failure) to make a list of their immediate plans and the reasons behind 
them. Results revealed that participants with higher levels of self-esteem (compared 
to people with lower levels) were more likely to report goals to deal with the 
setback and improve their mood. These findings together suggest that people who 
have higher levels of self-esteem make better efforts to regulate their mood. They 
are more likely to focus on the positive aspects of positive life events and show a 
more adaptive response to life’s setbacks. In contrast, people with lower levels of 
self-esteem perhaps display a maladaptive response in dealing with life events.
Protection from the terror of death 
According to terror management theory (Pyszczynski, Greenberg and Solomon, 
1999; Solomon, Greenberg and Pyszczynski, 1991), the most profound anxiety we 
confront as human beings stems from the knowledge that one day, we must die. 
Much of our social cognition and behaviour is motivated by the desire to escape 
this anxiety. The effects of awareness of mortality are often tested by confronting 
participants with the inevitability of their death, for example by asking people to 
write about what will happen to their bodies when they die (versus, say, watching 
TV). Consistent with terror management theory, this so-called mortality salience 
induction has a range of effects on thoughts, feelings and actions that are consistent 
with the desire to escape or somehow transcend the inevitability of one’s demise. 
For example, young adults who have just gone through a mortality salience induc-
tion report that they want to have more children than control participants – chil-
dren being an obvious way to leave something of one’s self in the world after one’s 
demise (Fritsche, Jonas, Fischer et al., 2007; Wisman and Goldenberg, 2005).

Do you think there might be other ways of eliciting awareness of your own death? 
Self-esteem is an important buffer against the anxiety of death, according to this 
theory. The logic is as follows. To protect themselves against the anxiety of death, 
individuals collaborate to construct a cultural worldview – a shared set of assump-
tions about the world that impart meaning, permanence and stability to life. This 
cultural worldview entails agreed upon standards by which people may be evalu-
ated, and if they live up to these standards of value, they have some hope of liter-
ally transcending death (e.g., by entering an afterlife), or symbolically doing so 
(e.g., being commemorated by one’s community after one has died). In terror 
management theory, self-esteem is acquired by believing that one is living up to 
these standards of value (see also sociometer theory). Thus, self-esteem is a 
tremendous buffer against the anxiety elicited by awareness of mortality. If I am a 
good person according to my community’s cultural worldview, then I feel that in 
some sense I am able to transcend death. Indeed, there is good evidence for this 
prediction. Participants who have chronically high self-esteem or whose self-
esteem is temporarily boosted by an experimental procedure are less prone to the 
effects of mortality salience. Whereas low self-esteem participants respond quite 
strongly to mortality salience in various ways including defending their cultural 
worldview by derogating people with conflicting views, high self-esteem partici-
pants are less prone to doing this (Harmon-Jones, Simon, Greenberg et al., 1997). 
Recent research suggests that implicit self-esteem – the unconscious conviction that 
one is a person of worth – may be a more effective buffer than explicit self-esteem 
(Schmeichel, Gailliot, Filardo et al., 2009). 
Aggression 
Many researchers suggest that people with lower levels of self-esteem are more 
prone to antisocial acts such as murder (Kirschner, 1992), violent behaviour in 
gangs (Anderson, 1994), robbery (MacDonald, 1975) and domestic violence 
(Renzetti, 1992). However, the evidence to support these claims is mixed. Certainly,

The social self
low levels of serotonin may be associated with both low self-esteem and aggres-
sion, as we shall see in Chapter 13. Some studies have shown that low levels of 
self-esteem are related to high levels of aggression (e.g., Donnellan, Trzesniewski, 
Robins et al., 2005). However, it is not clear whether aggression is really caused by 
low self-esteem. Narcissism, a variable that is positively associated with normal 
self-esteem but is decidedly not the same thing, may be more important. 
Narcissism 
What about people who have extremely high levels of self-esteem? Much of the 
literature points to the negative influence of lower levels of self-esteem, but until 
fairly recently, researchers have been less concerned with the effects of extreme 
levels of high self-esteem and exaggerated feelings of importance and superiority. 
Such narcissistic individuals, lying at the upper extremity of self-esteem, do not 
enjoy a stable sense of their self-worth and instead need the validation of others to 
maintain their self-concept (Kernis and Paradise, 2002). Indeed, some research 
suggests that narcissists, while professing positive evaluations of themselves, have 
unconscious doubts about their worth, which are accessible using a procedure 
known as the Implicit Association Test (Jordan, Spencer, Zanna et al., 2003; but 
for a critique and alternative findings, see Campbell, Bosson, Goheen et al., 2007). 
Therefore, having an extremely high self-esteem is not as good as one might expect 
it to be. Research also shows that narcissists can become aggressive in the face of 
criticism or any other perceived threat to their insecure image (Baumeister, Smart 
and Boden, 1996; Bushman and Baumeister, 1998). 
However, putting aside their tendency to be more aggressive, narcissists tend to 
be psychologically healthy. Specifically, narcissism is negatively related to sadness, 
depression, anxiety and loneliness, and positively related to happiness and satisfac-
tion. The reason narcissism is positively associated with psychological wellbeing is 
not that it is good for you, but that it is associated with normal or high self-esteem, 
which, as we have seen, is good for you (Sedikides, Rudich, Gregg et al., 2004). The 
relationship between narcissism and psychological wellbeing is, therefore, a classic 
example of a spurious correlation produced by their mutual relation to self-esteem. 
However, although the relationship is spurious, it nonetheless tells you that the 
average narcissist is likely to enjoy better psychological health than the average 
person who is not a narcissist. There is no need to feel sorry for them.

Self-presentation
The self we know is not always the self we present to others. Because what others 
think of us depends on the self we project, we often try to manage the impression we 
present to others. Also, the way we see ourselves is often constructed and influenced

The social self
by interacting with other people. People constantly monitor their presentation of 
self in their interactions with others. This process is called impression management 
(Goffman, 1959). Specifically, people vary in the degree to which they engage in 
self-monitoring – how much they engage in self-presentation to others (Snyder, 1974). 
Research suggests that people who are high self-monitors tend to shape their behav-
iour to project the self they think is appropriate to their audience or situation.  
They are, therefore, strategic in their self-presentation. On the other hand, low self-
monitors are less sensitive to situational demands and do not shape their behaviour 
in this way. Instead, they tend to be more expressive and less concerned with the 
perceived expectations of the audience. More generally, people also vary their 
impression management strategies depending on the situation they are in. For 
example, evidence suggests that people use different strategies to present the self, 
depending on whether they are in a public or private situation (e.g., Leary, 1995). 
There are several motives that drive strategic self-presentation (e.g., Jones and 
Pittman, 1982):
1 to be seen as competent in the eyes of others (we talk more about enhancing 
self-image in the next section) 
2 in an attempt to be liked by others 
3 to make people believe we are dangerous, in order to keep them away 
4 to be seen as morally respectable 
5 to be seen as helpless and in need of sympathy, in order to gain others’ pity. 
Often, these strategies are effective (as we will see in Chapter 6 on persuasion) and 
other times they are not – specifically, ingratiation in the form of flattery can make 
people seem less trustworthy and sometimes insincere and ‘slimy’ (Vonk, 1998). 
However, much of strategic self-presentation is geared towards managing the 
impressions of others.
Expressive self-presentation, on the other hand, is more about managing our 
impressions of ourselves (Schlenker, 1980). People behave towards others in ways 
that help them validate their perceptions of self. This may be reflected in who we 
choose as friends. For example, if you think of yourself as outgoing and sociable, 
it helps to have friends who think the same of you. Expressive self-presentation is 
important because it provides external confirmation about how one sees oneself. 
Expressive self-presentation can also help people to change their behaviour. For 
example, Tice (1992) found that public behaviour is internalized more into the 
self-concept than behaviour performed privately. Tice asked participants to act as 
if they were emotionally stable or unstable. They were asked to do so in either a 
public or private context. It was found that people internalized the stable or 
unstable behaviour as part of the self more when the behaviour was performed 
publicly (Figure 2.11), indicating that the way we are seen by others is an impor-
tant determinant in how we see ourselves – and also influences how our self-
concept changes. Self-presenting as a good person makes us privately feel better 
about ourselves (Gergen, 1965), and pretending to be more sociable than we are 
makes us behave more sociably later (Schlenker et al., 1994).

Thinking and feeling
This process largely works through 
the processes specified by self-perception 
theory, which we came across earlier in 
this chapter. Just as we learn about others 
from observing behaviour, we learn 
about ourselves. It has an important 
application in counselling and clinical 
psychology, according to Kelly (2000). 
Kelly argues that a crucial goal in therapy 
is to construct a new, healthier self. In 
doing so, clients should engage in posi-
tive self-presentations, which can be 
reinforced by the therapist. Controver-
sially, Kelly (2000) argues that clients 
should therefore withhold information 
from their therapists if it too seriously undermines their effort to present them-
selves in a positive light. This might mean, for example, that they should conceal 
their dissatisfaction with the therapy, or even information about extremely 
unpleasant behaviours in which they have engaged that may have contributed to 
their current problems. Presenting a positive image to a therapist enables the 
therapist to reinforce a positive self-image. 
Kelly’s (2000) conclusions have been hotly disputed by other researchers in 
social and clinical psychology (e.g., Arkin and Hermann, 2000). One reason for 
this is not just that honesty and openness have historically been regarded as essen-
tial for clients of psychotherapy, counselling and clinical psychology, but that 
clients may be mistaken about what constitutes shameful and stigmatizing behav-
iour. One way in which therapists can help clients to develop a more positive 
understanding of themselves is to help them see that their own actions and circum-
stances need not be shameful or stigmatizing – and to help them act differently in 
the future (Hill, Gelso and Mohr, 2000). However, there is some evidence that at 
least circumstantially supports some of Kelly’s (2000) arguments. For example, 
Braginsky and Braginsky (1967) found that institutionalized schizophrenics 
presented themselves as mentally healthy in interviews with psychiatrists if they 
thought the interview was designed to determine their suitability for a less secure 
ward with more facilities and freedom. In contrast, they presented themselves as 
mentally unhealthy if they thought the interview was about whether they should 
continue to be hospitalized (generally, this client group preferred to stay in the 
institution rather than confront life outside). Furthermore, the psychiatrists 
‘bought’ these self-presentations, assessing clients’ mental health according to 
whether they presented themselves as well or unwell. There is also evidence that 
presenting one’s self as mentally healthy or unhealthy can be self-fulfilling, espe-
cially if one’s self-presentations are confirmed by experts (McKillop and Schlenker, 
1988). There are also studies showing that the number of self-disclosures a client 
makes during therapy is negatively associated with outcomes such as the smooth-

ness of the session and even recovery (Shapiro and Firth, 1987; Strassberg, Roback, 
Anchor and Abramowitz, 1975), whereas keeping secrets from therapists may be 
associated with quicker recovery (Kelly, 1998). Even if we do not accept Kelly’s 
(2000) conclusion that keeping secrets is a good idea for clients, at the very least 
her analysis points to the importance of self-presentational processes in the 
context of psychotherapy. 
How accurate is our self-knowledge?
Thus far, we have learned much about the self. One of the key lessons from social 
psychological research is that it is useful to endeavour to take others’ perspectives 
on ourselves. When we view ourselves as if from the outside, we are better able to 
regulate ourselves and meet the demands of social situations. Our self-esteem 
responds to being liked and included, or disliked and rejected, by others, acting 
much like an internal mirror of ourselves. But exactly how well do we really know 
ourselves? Of course, in many senses you know more about yourself than 
anybody else does. You will be able to recall many facts about yourself, many of 
the places you have been and experiences you enjoy, more than anybody else. But 
how well do you really understand yourself? Just how reliable are your insights 
into your personality traits, your fears and desires, the reasons you do things, and 
the things you will do in the future? Social psychologists have amassed a vast body 
of evidence suggesting that our self-knowledge is surprisingly weak and unreli-
able. There appear to be two major sources of error in our self-knowledge: we are 
unable and, for various reasons, unwilling to know ourselves completely. 
The limits of self-awareness
In an influential paper, Nisbett and Wilson (1977) argued that people have surpris-
ingly poor self-knowledge and, in particular, no direct introspective access to their 
mental processes. So, when asked: ‘Why do you like him?’, ‘How did you solve this 
problem’ and ‘Why did you take that job’, people will typically answer quite freely. 
However, for Nisbett and Wilson (1977), it is doubtful that their answers will be any 
more reliable than those of an informed third party, that is, a person who has access 
to the same biographical facts. They cite a number of striking demonstrations of this 
lack of introspective awareness of our own thought processes:
 o People appear not to notice when, or why, their attitudes change: Bem and 
McConnell (1970) showed that after writing an essay contrary to their own 
attitudes (that students should have no choice in their academic curriculum) 
their attitudes changed, as if they had persuaded themselves. But when asked 
what their attitudes had been before they wrote the essays, students incor-
rectly indicated that their previous attitudes had been the same as their new, 
more anti-choice ones. This basic finding has been replicated time and time 
again. For example, Douglas and Sutton (2004) gave anti-gun control and anti-
environmentalist messages to their participants. Participants were influenced 

86
Thinking and feeling
by these messages, but incorrectly guessed that their pre-message attitudes, 
which had been assessed two weeks before, were the same as their new ones. 
 o People appear not to understand how situational factors affect their behaviour: 
Latané and Darley (1970, p. 124) found that people were less likely to help a 
suffering stranger when they were in the company of other people. They 
reported that: ‘We asked this question every way we know how: subtly, 
directly, tactfully, bluntly. Always we got the same answer. Subjects persist-
ently claimed that their behaviour was not influenced by the other people 
present. This denial occurred in the face of results showing that the presence of 
others did inhibit helping.’
 o People appear not to understand why they like things: Nisbett and Wilson 
arranged nightgowns and stockings on a display within a retail store. Partici-
pants, who were told they were participating in a consumer survey, were asked 
to indicate which item was the best quality and why. Participants were heavily 
biased towards the items on the right, seeing them as the best quality, perhaps 
because attention is biased towards the right (Carruthers, 2010). However, 
when explaining why they picked out a given item of clothing as the highest 
quality, not one participant spontaneously mentioned its position within the 
display. When asked directly whether they may have preferred it because of its 
left/right position, all participants denied it. 
 o People believe their behaviour is influenced by factors that, in fact, do not influ-
ence it: Nisbett and Wilson found that an experimental group of participants 
wrongly thought that their enjoyment of a film was ruined by the noise of a 
power saw outside. In fact, their ratings of the film were the same as a control 
group who watched the film without the distracting noise in the background. A 
recent study makes much the same point. Have you ever been annoyed when 
someone lets slip what is going to happen at the end, and so ruins what would 
have been a suspenseful story? It seems that your annoyance may be misplaced. 
Leavitt and Christenfeld (2011) found that these ‘spoilers’ did not, in fact, 
reduce people’s enjoyment of stories. In fact, quite the opposite was true: 
people enjoyed the ‘spoiled’ version of unfamiliar stories where the ending was 
revealed early, rather than the ‘unspoiled’ version of stories in which the ending 
was not revealed until, well, the end. In other words, people appear to enjoy 
stories more when they know what is coming. Nonetheless, we tend to believe, 
erroneously, that we will enjoy stories less under such conditions. 
Subsequent research, much of which we will encounter later in this book, 
demonstrates the surprising inaccuracy of judgements about the self. We appear to 
be unable to make especially accurate predictions about ourselves. For example, we 
appear to be worse, not better, than others at judging how long our romantic rela-
tionships will last. In a bias known as the affective forecasting error, we appear to 
overestimate the emotional impact that positive and negative life events will have 
on us. This may be connected to our inability to understand our own personality 
traits accurately. According to results obtained by Spain, Eaton and Funder (2000), 
for example, your own ratings of how neurotic you are predict your emotional

reactions to future events less well than others’ ratings of your neuroticism. We also 
appear to be unable to explain or even accurately identify our previous behaviour. 
As you will see in Chapter 11, when asked to indicate how they had felt over the 
past few weeks, women indicated that they were particularly irritable before 
menstruation, in keeping with the notion of ‘premenstrual syndrome’. However, 
daily records of their mood showed no such thing – mood was not significantly 
affected by the menstrual cycle (McFarlane, Martin and Williams, 1988). 
Another interesting line of research suggests that we may be wrong about 
something very fundamental about ourselves – the extent to which we have free 
will. Wegner (2002) argues that our conscious thoughts do not drive our behav-
iour. Instead, our behaviour is shaped by unconscious or automatic responses to 
the environment. Wegner argues that the experience of free will arises because 
our conscious thoughts about our actions are typically consistent with our 
actions, occur shortly before our actions, and in the absence of evidence that 
something other than our free choice could have caused us to act. Thus, it natu-
rally feels to us that we are making conscious choices, even if we are actually 
deciding things unconsciously. 
Wegner and Wheatley (1999) conducted an ingenious study to test this notion 
that free will is an illusion. They set up an Ouija-type board (the flat lettered board 
often used as part of a game to ‘contact the spirit world’) on top of a computer 
mouse. The participant and a confederate put their hands on top of the board and 
were instructed to use it together to move the mouse around the screen, stopping 
every 30 seconds or so. The participant and the confederate wore headphones, 
through which participants heard the name of one of the objects on the screen 
(e.g., ‘swan’), either 30 seconds, 5 seconds or 1 second before, or 1 second after, 
the mouse had stopped. On some trials, the participants genuinely had control 
over where the mouse stopped. On other trials, unbeknown to participants, the 
confederate was instructed to stop on a certain object, meaning that, on these 
trials, the participant did not control where the mouse stopped (Figure 2.12). 
Of most interest is the extent to which participants thought they had intentionally 
stopped the mouse on the named object, even in the trials in which they exerted no 
influence on when the mouse stopped. Reasonably enough, they tended not to think 
they had intentionally stopped the mouse on the named object when it was primed 
30 seconds previously. But if it was named shortly before the mouse stopped – 5 or 1 
seconds previously – the majority of participants indicated they had intentionally

stopped the mouse. If they heard the object being named after the mouse stopped, 
they tended not to indicate they had consciously chosen to stop the mouse there. 
This experiment seems to suggest that people can be ‘tricked’ into believing they are 
exerting free will. Consistent with Wegner’s theory of illusory conscious will, 
participants did not believe they had consciously chosen to stop the mouse when it 
rested on an object whose name they had not heard. It happened when what they 
heard triggered conscious thoughts about the object of their apparent action (the 
swan), shortly before they observed the mouse stop on that object. 
This classic study has generated many experiments on the illusion of conscious 
choice, which have largely supported the claim that people can be ‘tricked’, or rather 
trick themselves, into believing their actions were the result of conscious choices. 
For Wegner, the upshot of this research is that our actions are largely decided uncon-
sciously – or automatically. Conscious thoughts accompany and precede our actions, 
to be sure, but these thoughts are not necessarily causally responsible for our actions. 
This is entirely consistent with the behaviourist tradition of psychology. For Watson, 
Skinner and other behaviourists, conscious thoughts were not responsible for our 
behaviour. Nonetheless, modern social psychologists, unlike the behaviourists, 
regard conscious thoughts as important and amenable to scientific study, and as we 
shall see in many of the chapters in this book, notably Chapters 3 and 4, our 
conscious thoughts and deliberations affect our emotional reactions to events. Over 
time, they can affect our automatic decision-making processes (in Chapter 12, we 
will see how, if people are consciously determined to be less racist, they can change 
even their unconscious or implicit racism). Consciously held, long-term plans and 
intentions also reliably (although not perfectly) predict our later behaviour. It is just 
that our conscious intentions do not always seem to drive our immediate behav-
ioural choices in day-to-day life. Instead, unconscious responses, beliefs and even 
goals appear to drive much of our behaviour (Custers and Aarts, 2010).

All this is not to say that people have no knowledge of themselves. There is a 
good chance that your ratings of your own personality (e.g., how extraverted you 
are) or behaviour (e.g., how often you tell jokes to lighten a tense moment) will 
correlate with the ratings of people who know you (Funder, 1995; Gosling, John, 
Craik and Robins, 1998). To some extent, we appear able, as symbolic interaction-
ists like Mead (1934) and Cooley (1902) suggested, to see ourselves as others see us. 
However, our agreement with others is not perfect. Some studies have found that 
our self-ratings correlate more highly with how we think others see us, rather than 
with how they actually see us (Kenny and DePaulo, 1993). The mirror or ‘looking 
glass’ that Cooley (1902) described is our own creation, reflecting our assumptions 
about how others see us. Effective social functioning depends on this bearing some 
relation to how others actually see us, but we do not do this perfectly.

The social self
The key issue is not whether our self-knowledge is perfect, but where it comes 
from. By and large, there is surprisingly little evidence that we have special insight 
into our traits or motivations. We learn and make inferences about ourselves much 
as we do about people. As self-perception theory points out, we rely on the same 
observations of behaviour (Carruthers, 2010). If we are more expert on our own 
behaviour, motivations and preferences than others, it is probably because we 
have access to more facts about, and observations of, ourselves.

Thinking and feeling
Motivated social cognition and the self
Thus far, we have seen how important the self is. It organizes our experience, 
allows us to interact meaningfully with others, and shapes our emotions and 
behaviour. We have seen that some types of self-concept are more useful than 
others. For example, by and large, we are able to feel and function better if our 
self-esteem is reasonably high rather than low. In short, people have a vested 
interest in their self-concepts. It is not surprising, therefore, that people are stra-
tegic in the way they seek out, pay attention to, process, and remember informa-
tion about themselves. In short, people engage in motivated social cognition about 
themselves. We return to motivated social cognition more generally in Chapter 3, 
but for now, it is useful to familiarize yourself with four of the motivations that 
influence social cognition (Baumeister, 1998; Kruglanski, 1990; Kunda, 1990):
1 To find out more about a topic, so as to increase our ability to understand, 
predict and control the world we live in. 
2 To protect or enhance our self-esteem. 
3 To ensure cognitive consistency – that our beliefs are consistent with each other 
and with facts about the world as we know them. 
4 To feel that we are in control of the world in which we live (Table 2.2).

Self-assessment
First, we are motivated to know objectively and accurately who we are. This is the 
motive of self-assessment (Trope, 1986). This motive is important because having 
an accurate understanding of the self can enable an individual to be certain of their 
abilities and how they might act or perform in specific situations. For example, 
you may like to complete online personality and intelligence tests. In doing so, 
you are fulfilling your motive of self-assessment, and as a result – depending on 
the quality of the test – you have a greater understanding of yourself. It does not 
matter if the information we learn about ourselves is favourable or unfavourable. 
The key is that we have accurate and valid information about the self. 
Self-verification
Another motive regarding the self is to confirm what we believe to be true about 
ourselves. This motivation is called self-verification (e.g., Kwang and Swann, 2010;

The social self
Swann, 1997) and people seek to do this, again, irrespective of whether the views 
about the self are positive or negative. We seek information that verifies our beliefs 
about ourselves. If we find it, we feel reassured that our perception of our self is 
consistent with our experience, in other words, that we have achieved cognitive 
consistency (e.g., Swann, Rentfrow and Guinn, 2003). This leads to some 
surprising and even disturbing outcomes for people who have low self-esteem (for 
a review, see Chang and Swann, 2012). For example, in their quest to verify their 
negative views of themselves, they will actually prefer the company of people who 
have a low (rather than high) opinion of them (Swann, Stein-Seroussi and Giesler, 
1992), will become less committed to their marriage if praised by their spouse 
(Swann, Hixon and De La Rhonde, 1992), will be upset by their successes (Wood, 
Heimpel, Newby-Clark and Ross, 2005), show signs of cardiovascular stress if 
praised (Ayduk, Mendes, Akinola and Gyurak, 2008), and will be more likely to 
be absent from work after being effusively praised by their boss (Wiesenfeld, 
Swann, Brockner and Bartel, 2007). Finally, Wood, Perunovic and Lee (2010) 
found that people will even be saddened by saying positive things about them-
selves, such as ‘I am a lovable person’, and thus they conclude that, tragically, the 
popular technique of affirmation – boosting self-esteem by saying positive things 
about oneself – is likely to backfire for the very people who need it most. 
Self-enhancement
Arguably the most important motive is to search for information that allows us 
to see the self positively. This motive is called self-enhancement (Kunda, 1990). 
People seek new, positive information about the self and they also seek ways to 
alter existing negative views of the self. There are various strategies that people 
use to enhance the self. An important means of enhancing is ‘behavioural self-
handicapping’ (Jones and Berglas, 1978). Failure at a task presents some evidence 
that you are not much not good at it. To protect themselves from this conclusion, 
people sometimes act in ways that sabotage their own chances of success. If you 
stayed up late partying before that test, and go on to fail the test, you can conclude 
that your bad preparation, rather than low ability, is to blame. If you manage to do 
well on the test, you can convince yourself that you are especially clever, because 
you did so despite the late night (Rhodewalt, Morf, Hazlett and Fairfield, 1991). 
Research shows that self-handicapping does protect self-views (McCrea and Hirt, 
2001), but comes at a price. Naturally enough, self-handicapping harms people’s 
actual performance (Zuckerman and Tsai, 2005). There are many other manifesta-
tions of self-enhancement. To give you just a sample, we have put together a list:
 o People evaluate feedback about the self less critically, and accept it more readily, 
when it is positive rather than negative. This applies to IQ tests (Wyer and Frey, 
1983) and medical diagnoses (e.g., Ditto, Munro, Apanovitch et al., 2003).
 o People take credit for their successes and deflect blame for their failures, in the self-
serving attribution bias (Arkin, Cooper and Kolditz, 1980; Zuckerman, 1979). For 
example, after car accidents, people frequently make absurdly self-serving attribu-
tions such as: ‘the tree came up and obstructed my view of the road’ (Stewart, 2005).

Thinking and feeling
 o People recognize themselves in photographs more readily if their image is 
morphed to make them more attractive, rather than less attractive (Epley and 
Whitchurch, 2008).
 o People in countries as diverse as Australia, Germany, Japan and Israel see them-
selves as not only better people, but more human, than the average person 
(Loughnan, Leidner, Doron et al., 2010).
 o People generally evaluate themselves more favourably than others evaluate 
them. This applies to anything from ratings of their personality traits (Alicke, 
1985), to the popularity and attractiveness of their profiles on online dating 
services (Preuss and Alicke, 2009). 
 o Logically, fewer than 50% of the population can be better than average at 
something. Yet, a study by Svenson (1981) showed that 69% of a sample of 
Swedish drivers and 93% of American drivers thought they were better drivers 
than usual. Similar results have been found with many other dimensions of 
value aside from driving behaviour. Williams and Gilovich (2008) found that 
this is not just a matter of bragging. Participants were willing to bet real money 
that they had scored better than average on a personality test. 
These motives are all important in guiding how people behave. But which is the 
most important? Of course, if self-esteem is high, and warranted, these motives are 
compatible with each other. But often, the truth hurts. And when self-esteem is low, 
self-verification is completely at odds with self-enhancement. Some studies suggest 
that self-enhancement is the most important motive, but that self-verification is also 
a genuine social motive (e.g., Sedikides, 1993). However, comprehensive recent 
reviews suggest that self-verification is as or more important than self-enhancement 
(Kwang and Swann, 2010; van Dellen, Campbell, Hoyle and Bradfield, 2011). There 
has been a productive debate about the primacy of the self-verification and self-
enhancement motives for some years, and the jury is still out. 
Illusion of control
Can you remember a situation in your life in which you felt you had no control 
over what was happening to you? Chances are, the feeling of a lack of control 
induced anxiety, even if the experience was essentially positive. Human beings 
appear to have a strong desire, and even a need, for control. People with an internal 
locus of control feel they are in charge of events in their lives, and experience higher 
levels of wellbeing than people with an external locus of control, who think events 
are not strongly controlled by them. Field experiments have shown that residents 
of care homes for the elderly are happier, more functional and may even live longer 
when given a higher degree of control over their schedules and the day-to-day 
events in their lives (Langer and Rodin, 1976). 
We appear to uphold our beliefs in our control over events by overestimating the 
extent to which we have control over events. Langer (1975), for example, showed 
that people prefer to roll a dice rather than have someone roll it for them, as if they 
could exercise control over the outcome. We have already encountered one social 
cognitive process that helps produce this illusion of control. Remember how Wegner

The social self
and Wheatley (1999) showed that people thought they were responsible for stop-
ping the mouse on an object like a swan in their ‘Ouija board’ experiment, because 
they were made to think about the swan shortly before the confederate stopped the 
mouse. As we will see in Chapter 3, this same bias can cause people to think they 
may have hurt someone via a voodoo hex, or influenced the outcome of a sports 
match they are watching on TV (Pronin, Wegner, McCarthy and Rodriguez, 2006). 
As we shall also see in Chapter 3, depriving people of control causes them to restore 
a sense of control in surprising ways. For example, they start to see patterns that are 
not there (Whitson and Galinsky, 2008), and become more convinced that God 
influences events in day-to-day lives, even if they are not religious (Kay, Gaucher, 
Napier et al., 2008). If you lack control, you are motivated to think you can gain a 
kind of second-hand control by discerning order, regularity and control in the envi-
ronment (Kay, Whitson, Gaucher and Galinsky, 2009).

Culture and the self
As we have seen in this chapter, the self is a unique aspect of every individual. 
However, it is also the case that there are cultural differences in people’s self-
concept. In particular, researchers have focused on differences in the self-concept 
depending on whether individuals come from individualist or collectivist cultures, 
and whether people belong to one or more cultures. 
Individualist and collectivist cultures
Individualist cultures, such as in Western and Northern Europe and some of the 
countries they colonized (e.g., Australia and the USA), emphasize personal achieve-
ment and uniqueness of the self. In such cultures, children from an early age are 
encouraged to think of themselves as distinct and unique individuals, focusing on 
the aspects of themselves such as their inner thoughts and feelings that make them 
different from other people. On the other hand, collectivist cultures, such as in many 
Eastern European and Asian countries, place more emphasis on groups and families. 
From a young age, children are encouraged to follow societal norms and be loyal 
and obedient to their parents. This more interdependent conception of the self is 
based on one’s relationships with others and one’s connection with families and 
social groups. The way people see the self is therefore different in these two different 
types of cultures. Specifically, individualist cultures have a more individual-oriented 
sense of self, whereas the self is defined in collectivist cultures more in line with 
group memberships (Gaertner, Sedikides and Graetz, 1999; Markus and Kitayama, 
1991; Vignoles, Chryssouchoou and Breakwell, 2000). 

94
Thinking and feeling
This can be seen in Figure 
2.13. A male student from an 
individualistic culture, such 
as Norway, the UK, France 
or Australia, will typically see 
himself as close to, but sepa-
rate from, significant others in 
his life (Figure 2.13a). On the 
other hand, his counterpart 
in a collectivist culture, such 
as southern Italy, Portugal 
and Greece, or an Indigenous 
Australian, will partly define himself in terms of his relationships with others 
(Figure 2.13b). In an important sense, these people are part of him. He will even 
attribute their personality traits to himself (Markus and Kitayama, 1991). It is 
important not to overemphasize this cultural difference; it is a reliable, but not 
necessarily a large difference (Nisbett et al., 2001). Individuals within cultures 
differ as much, if not more, as cultures differ from each other in the extent to 
which independent versus interdependent self-construals are adopted. Nonethe-
less, this is one important way to understand cultural differences (e.g., Vauclair 
and Fischer, 2011). 
The differences in the self-concept have been demonstrated widely by social 
psychologists and cross-cultural psychologists. For example, Trafimow, Triandis 
and Goto (1991) asked participants from the USA and China to write down 20 
descriptions of themselves. They found that US participants wrote down many 
more individual-related descriptions (e.g., ‘I am an intelligent person) than the 
participants from China, who tended to write about the self more in relation to 
group memberships (e.g., ‘I am a Christian’). Similar studies exist comparing Japa-
nese and Canadian participants (Heine and Lehman, 1997), Hong Kong Chinese 
and Americans (Yik, Bond and Paulhus, 1998) and others comparing Japanese and 
Americans (Regan, Snyder and Kassin, 1995).
In a way, people raised in individualist cultures learn that life involves many 
opportunities for self-enhancement, whereas for people raised in collectivist 
cultures, life provides opportunities for self-improvement (Kitayama, Markus, 
Matsumoto and Norasakkunkit, 1997). It is interesting to note, for example, that 
in Japanese, the word for ‘self’ (jibun) means ‘one’s portion of the shared space’ 
(Hamaguchi, 1985). 
Research has also demonstrated that people’s self-descriptions vary as a func-
tion of the culture, the situation and the interaction between the two (Kanagawa, 
Cross and Markus, 2001). As in other research, Kanagawa et al. demonstrated 
significant differences in the ways in which Japanese and US students described 
themselves. Japanese students were more likely to express a self-critical orienta-
tion and a motivation for self-improvement (e.g., ‘I get tense in public’, ‘I am not 
able to play a musical instrument’). The US students, on the other hand, were 
more likely to express unique and positive aspects of the self that are stable over

time and across situations (e.g., ‘I am good at maths’, ‘I am considered good at 
sports’). However, Japanese participants were more likely to describe themselves 
with specific reference to their appearance, activities, the immediate situation and 
their possessions, than their US counterparts. 
Insights on the different nature of self across cultures have also been gained from 
qualitative studies of individual experiences. For example, Kondo, an ethnically 
Japanese woman born and raised in the USA, reports an interaction with her land-
lady when she was later working in Japan (cited in Wetherell and Maybin, 1996). The 
landlady reflected on the Japanese treating themselves as individuals as less impor-
tant than the collective, doing things for the sake of social relationships. This struck 
Kondo as a ‘profoundly different way of thinking about relationships between selves 
and the social world’ (Kondo, cited in Wetherell and Maybin, 1996, p. 272). 
The cultural differences in how people perceive the self are also reflected in 
different cultural values between individualist and collectivist cultures. For example, 
Gardner, Gabriel and Lee (1999) investigated the link between how people see the 
self and their values. In one study, they asked participants from the USA to read a 
story which either primed individualist aspects of the self (by including words like ‘I’ 
and ‘me’) or more collectivist aspects (by including words like ‘us’ and ‘we’). After 
reading the story, participants were asked to write 20 self-descriptions and then 
rate the values that were important to them. Findings revealed that participants in 
the individualist prime condition wrote more individual-oriented self-descriptions 
and more strongly endorsed individualist values like personal freedom and inde-
pendence. On the other hand, the participants who were in the collectivist prime 
condition wrote more group-oriented self-descriptions and more strongly endorsed 
collectivist values like family and obedience. The significant differences in endorse-
ment of individual and collectivist values are presented in Figure 2.14. 
Bicultural individuals are an interesting case of cultural influences on the self-
concept. Such individuals are able to deal with two different cultures at once – the 
host culture where they live, and their original (immigrant or heritage) culture 
where they are from (Phinney, Lochner and Murphy, 1990). Often, the two 
cultures vary significantly in terms of values, 
attitudes and norms. For example, a person 
from China who now lives in the USA may 
be considered bicultural if they are able to 
integrate aspects of both cultures into their 
self-concept. Of course, not everyone can do 
this. Some individuals maintain a strong 
heritage culture despite living among a 
different culture for most of their lives. 
However, many people are able to integrate 
two cultures into their self-concept. Yamada 
and Singelis (1999) argue that people are able 
to do this when they alternate their cultural 
orientation depending on the situation. 
Specifically, an individual is able to deal with

two identifies at once when they understand the ways in which each culture guides 
behaviour and uses this knowledge to think and behave accordingly in different 
situations. In a demonstration of how this works, Hong, Morris, Chiu and Benet-
Martinez (2000) found that Chinese/American bicultural individuals changed 
their behaviour depending on whether they were primed with Western or Asian 
cues. Indeed, there are benefits to being able to integrate two cultures. For 
example, successful bicultural individuals are thought to have better mental health 
(Rogler, Cortes and Malgady, 1991) and higher self-esteem than monocultural 
individuals. They also less likely to report interethnic conflict or experience racial 
tension (Schwarzer, Bowler and Rauch, 1985).
Chapter summary
In this chapter, we have outlined how social psychologists have 
approached the study of the self. We have discussed what the 
self is, what the self is for, and how the self defines and 
influences what we think, feel and do. The key points to take 
away from this chapter are as follows:
•  The self-concept is the complete set of beliefs that people 
have about themselves. It comprises self-schemas, or 
different aspects of the self. 
•  schemas help determine how people think, feel and behave 
in specific situations. Different schemas are activated in 
different contexts, and people may be chronically schematic 
or aschematic on a particular dimension.
•  according to multiple role theory, it is beneficial for people 
to have multiple identities. But also, self-concept clarity, that 
is, a clear sense of a strongly defined self, bolsters self-
esteem and helps people deal with negative events.
•  self-awareness is the psychological state of being aware of 
one’s characteristics, feelings and behaviours, or the 
awareness of oneself as unique. Public-self-awareness occurs 
when people become aware of how they could be judged by 
others. Public self-consciousness is a more chronic state of 
being concerned about being evaluated by others. Private 
self-awareness refers to the state where an individual is 
aware of the private, personal aspects of the self. This too can 
be chronic in the case of private self-consciousness. 
•  There is a biological basis of self-awareness. regions of the 
frontal lobe are activated during tasks where participants 
process information about the self. 
•  several theories address the self and its functions, including 
self-perception theory, self-discrepancy theory, regulatory 
focus theory, the control theory of self-regulation, the 
strength model theory of self-control, and social 
comparison theory.
•  self-esteem is the subjective evaluation of the self as 
positive or negative, and develops in childhood. self-
esteem is affected by factors from within the self (e.g., 
positive self-schemas) or outside others (e.g., acceptance or 
inclusion by others). 
•  Having high self-esteem can have positive consequences. It 
helps people to regulate their mood. self-esteem buffers 
people against the anxiety of death. This is particularly 
strong if people are implicitly aware of their own self-worth. 
Higher levels of self-esteem also make people less 
aggressive. However, exceedingly high levels of self-esteem 
(narcissism) can entail insecurity about the self, but 
narcissists are generally psychologically healthier than 
people with lower levels of self-esteem. 
•  People often try to manage the impression they present to 
others, through a process known as impression management. 
•  self-knowledge is often inaccurate. For many reasons, 
people appear both unable and unwilling to know 
themselves completely. They also tend to overestimate the 
emotional impact that positive and negative life events will 
have, through the affective forecasting error. 
•  The self-concept is an important guiding principle in 
motivating what we do. We are motivated to accurately 
know ourselves (self-assessment), confirm what we believe 
to be true about ourselves (self-verification) and see 
ourselves positively (self-enhancement).
•  Important cultural differences exist with respect to the self. 
specifically, individualist cultures express the independent, 
unique aspects of the self, whereas collectivist cultures 
emphasize the self in terms of groups and belonging. 
Bicultural individuals successfully manage their membership 
of two different cultures at once. 
our focus in this chapter has been on people’s understanding 
of who they are. In Chapter 3, we focus on how people 
understand others.

In this chapter, we saw how narcissists are overrepresented in the

may not be a bad thing. Narcissists are often enthusiastic and

My topic and aims
The purpose of my study was to examine the effect of specific 
modes of feedback – positive, negative, mixed and no 
feedback – on learning in a higher education (He) setting.
I became interested in examining feedback within He when I 
read about the threefold rise in university fees in the Uk 
beginning in 2012. This rise in fees has positioned universities in 
the role of business/supplier and students in the role of

in the competition to gain and retain students. Further, over the 
past seven years, the National Union of students has reported 
that the feedback provided by university tutors ranks extremely 
2 some children report that they would really like to buy 
healthier foods, but by the time they go to buy their food, 
they are already feeling tired and find it difficult to stick to 
their resolve to make the right choices. What psychological 
processes in this chapter may help to explain their difficulty? 
and what solutions might you be able to propose, based on 
these principles? 
3 like most schools, yours has a variety of children, ranging

head teacher would like to highlight especially healthy 
children, recognizing their choices at assemblies, and so use 
them as ‘role models’ for the other children. Based on what 
you’ve read about processes such as social comparison, what 
are the merits and dangers of this approach? If your school 
were to go ahead with such a role model scheme, what

My methods
We recruited our participants on an opportunity sampling basis, 
from a population of undergraduate psychology students. The 
58 undergraduates were randomly assigned to one of the four 
feedback conditions – positive, negative, mixed and no 
feedback – and all participants attended three weekly testing 
sessions. The participants were required to observe a podcast 
during the initial session. The podcast explained aPa 
referencing and was used to ensure that all participants 
received the same instructions. assignments were supplied at 
all three sessions. The assignments directed each participant to 
create a reference list of five journal articles and two books that 
were supplied. In sessions 2 and 3, prior to the new 
assignments being distributed, participants received their work 
from the previous session and their feedback depending on 
condition. The feedback was supplied on a marking criteria and 
comment sheet (the no feedback group did not receive a sheet). 
The positive feedback group received ticks next to correct 
answers and blanks next to errors/omissions and a concluding 
standardized positive comment related to their grade. The 
negative feedback group received crosses next to errors/
omissions and blanks next to correct answers and a concluding 
standardized constructive criticism comment related to their 
grade. The mixed feedback group received both ticks and 
crosses and both forms of comment. measures of learning (e.g., 
the assignment mark) were taken and compared across the 
conditions to examine the impact of the different types of 
feedback on learning.
My findings and their implications
The results did not support my hypothesis that participants 
receiving feedback would, in general, demonstrate an increase 
in learning when compared to the no feedback condition. 
Further, although learning occurred, there were no significant 
differences in learning across conditions. Therefore, it appeared 
that the amount of learning was not dependent on the mode of 
feedback given (positive, negative, mixed or none).
The results imply that the mode of feedback may not 
significantly determine learning as is generally thought. The 
study also brings in to question a tutor’s presumed power to 
influence a student’s learning by the provision of feedback. The 
research also raises the question of whether receiving no 
feedback instils an emotional state of uncertainty, and whether 
this motivates an individual to devise strategies to reduce the 
uncertainty. Further research and a heightened understanding 
of feedback are required before He tutors can attempt to 
improve feedback.

with my studies and complete a masters degree in research, 
with the aspiration of progressing to a doctorate in education 
or research.
The knowledge and the confidence I have gained during my 
project has been and will be invaluable to me in the future. 
Being involved in the design, research and completion of my

writing skills. The project has enhanced my skills and provided 
me with the confidence I require to continue with my studies.
My advice
The most important piece of knowledge I have gained from 
completing my project was that research and planning are 
paramount. Before beginning the design of the project, a 
thorough examination of the topic area must be conducted and 
when this has been achieved to the supervisor’s satisfaction, 
the student must consider the simplest and most logical path to 
demonstrate and reveal the results. I believe that careful 
consideration is necessary to ensure issues are not too 
complicated, which can be an easy pitfall, and was one of mine. 
Designing a simple, clear project takes thought, planning and a 
full understanding of the research question, a skill that 
develops over the course of the project.

In this chapter, we consider two key social cognitive processes – how people explain events 
in their lives (causal attribution), and how they form impressions of other people (person 
perception). We discuss some common errors in social cognition and then consider the nature 
(and ‘social nature’) of social cognition. By the end of this chapter, you will have an under-
standing of people’s capacities and limitations in social cognition and social thinking.

Questions to consider
1 louisa really wants to be elected as the president  
of the psychology society at her university. she is 
required to give a speech to the group. Would she be 
best to present all her positive attributes or just a  
few of the most positive? What other factors might  
she take into account?
2 ray meets alan at a party and takes an instant dislike to 
him. he is unable put his finger on it exactly, but he does 
not like alan. What social psychological processes can 
account for this instant dislike?
3 Jamie tells his friends he is studying social psychology 
and shares with them the findings of his final-year 
dissertation. his friends laugh and say the results were 
predictable and obvious. What could you say about this?

Thinking and feeling
Computers are our creations, but they can already do many things we cannot. 
They can perform billions of calculations a second. The most powerful computers 
are capable of beating any human being at chess. They can simulate and predict 
the movements of the stars through the heavens, and the entire world’s climate. 
They can calculate pi (π) to hundreds of decimal places. Even the relatively 
humble, average desktop computer can easily store more facts and figures than are 
contained in the world’s most comprehensive sets of encyclopedias, and as long as 
it functions properly, it will never ‘forget’ them. In contrast, many, if not most of 
us struggle to multiply or divide numbers greater than a couple of digits long, or 
to remember nine- or ten-digit numbers. 
So, are we being overshadowed by our creations? Are we less capable than we 
think we are? In our defence, the human brain is the most complex structure in 
the known universe (Edelman, 1993). It is capable of things that psychologists, 
working as we do in a relatively young science, are only beginning to understand. 
Despite the dazzling power of computers, they are inadequate at performing some 
of the tasks most of us can do effortlessly, day after day. For example, it is only 
recently that computer-controlled robots have begun to be able to walk up and 
down stairs, or recognize faces and voices. It is going to be a long time before any 
computer system can do more than one of these things at the same time. 
One of the most vivid illustrations of our superiority to computers is their 
complete failure, thus far, to pass a deceptively simple test of artificial intelligence. 
This test was designed by Alan Turing, the brilliant mathematician, whose code-
breaking work at Bletchley Park was instrumental in the defeat of Nazi Germany 
in the Second World War. Turing (1950) argued that we could judge a computer to 
be truly intelligent if people, after conversing by text with a remote computer for a 
few minutes, could not tell whether it was a computer or a human being. In the 
intervening six decades, no computer has got anywhere near passing the Turing 
test. This is not for lack of trying. The Loebner Prize is an annual competition in 
which programs have been put through their paces (Saygin, Cicekli and Akman, 
2000). Although computers have been getting roughly twice as powerful 
every 18 months or so, it appears to be some way off before any will be 
‘clever’ enough to pass this test. 
The fact that holding a simple conversation is something that super-
computers find impossible, but we generally find easy, illustrates the 
enormous social cognitive complexity that underpins successful social 
interaction. Although most of us experience awkwardness in some social 
situations, we generally find tasks such as holding a basic conversation 
to be so effortless that we rarely, if ever, stop to think about how we are 
doing it. Crucially, even if we did, it is unlikely we would be able to 
work out exactly how we are achieving the marvellous trick of social 
interaction. This is because, as we shall see in this chapter, many of the 
psychological processes that make social interactions possible are 
performed outside conscious awareness.

Try it yourself go online and try a turing test – chat online with a computer. We recommend you chat to 
Jabberwock, winner of the 2003 loebner prize, which still seems to be the most sophisticated turing robot available.

Fortunately, we do not have to rely simply on introspection to understand how 
our social minds work. A variety of ingenious scientific methodologies have been 
developed to identify the enormous extent, and the limits, of our insights into 
other people’s minds and personalities, and our powers of interpretation, memory 
and predictors of their behaviour. Some of these studies have revealed ever more 
stunning powers of social cognition by ordinary people who, in other respects, are 
so inferior to computers. For example, later in this chapter we will learn how 
people of ordinary intelligence can judge significantly better than chance, just by 
looking at a complete stranger for a few seconds, or even milliseconds, whether 
they are likeable, attractive, trustworthy, extraverted, or whether they have a 
personality disorder. To a surprising degree, and with amazing, effortless speed, 
people appear to be able to judge a book by its cover. 
As interesting and inspiring as it is to discover the fabulous powers possessed 
by the average person, doing so does not necessarily tell us how they do it. 
Advances by social psychologists over the past few decades have begun to unravel 
the psychological mechanisms that make our social lives possible. Understanding 
these powers does not make them any less fabulous, but it does make them less 
mysterious. A critical part of this research process has been to show that as 
remarkable as people’s talents are, they are also fallible. Working out when and 
why people get things wrong provides vital clues to understand how it is they are 
able to get so many things right. 
The case of ‘Clever Hans’ illustrates particularly well how it is possible to work 
out how a person is making sophisticated judgements by determining the condi-
tions under which they fail to make those judgements. Clever Hans could do basic 
arithmetic problems, and toured Germany at the turn of the 20th century show-
casing this talent. The reason Clever Hans’s abilities caused a sensation was that he 
was not a human being, but a horse. His trainers would read him arithmetic prob-
lems, such as ‘fifteen divided by three’, and Clever Hans would tap the correct 
number of times (five in this case, although we hope you were not wondering). 
Clever Hans attracted the attention of many sceptics who wanted to work out how 
he was doing it. One of the first possibilities to be eliminated was that his handlers 
were somehow cheating by secretly communicating to Hans when he should stop. 
It was determined that Hans appeared to be able to do these sums even when his 

104
Thinking and feeling
handlers were not around. Various other possibilities were eliminated one by one 
until the answer was found. If everyone around Hans was hidden from his view 
behind a screen, Hans lost his apparent mathematical powers. It was clear that 
Clever Hans was sensitive to the subtle shifts in body language that people uncon-
sciously displayed as he approached the correct answer. When he was no longer 
able to read people’s body language as he hit the correct number, he was no longer 
able to identify that number as correct. What made Hans clever was not his ability 
to understand spoken German, or do arithmetic, but his acute sensitivity to body 
language. Only by creating a situation in which Hans failed could people find out 
why he was normally so successful (Pfungst, 1911). 
Social cognition – the study of the cognitive underpinnings of social thought and 
social behaviour – has, to a large extent, been about understanding how people’s 
social skills and everyday powers of reasoning normally work, by creating situa-
tions in which they do not work. It has been dominated, therefore, by demonstra-
tions of error. Borrowing techniques and experimental methods used in cognitive 
psychology, it has been possible to test the limits of human thought and by under-
standing when and why people make mistakes, social psychologists can under-
stand why they are so clever. However, in their endeavours, social psychologists 
have uncovered a range of illogical, erroneous and irrational habits of thought. 
This is the yin and yang of social cognition, and of social psychology more gener-
ally – people are capable of such brilliance, and yet such stupidity. Since our 
understanding of our social environment is such an important determinant of our 
wellbeing, productivity and relationships with people and groups, social cognition 
is a prominent topic in social psychology, dominant throughout the 1980s and still 
active and vibrant now (Devine and Sharp, 2009; Fiske and Taylor, 2008; Hamilton, 
Stroessner and Driscoll, 1994). 
In the first half of this chapter, we introduce you to people’s capacities and 
limitations, in the context of two of the classic questions about social cognition. 
We consider how people explain the events in their lives (causal attribution), and 
how they form impressions of other people (person perception). We look at some 
other errors and biases in social cognition. We then turn to research and theory on 
the fundamental nature of social cognition. How important are conscious and 
automatic processes? To what degree can we separate our minds from our bodies? 
How ‘social’ is social cognition?
Causal attributions
Whenever you confront a problem in your life such as your car breaking down, it 
is important that you understand the cause of the problem. For example, if your 
car’s battery is flat, it is not going to help you to invest in a new transmission 
because the car is still not going to start. Dealing successfully with the breakdown 
and getting your car on the road will depend on you making the correct causal 
attribution – assigning the correct cause to the event. In this case, to proceed

the cognitive underpinnings 
of social thought and social 
behaviour. 
Causal attribution the process 
of assigning a cause to an 
event or behaviour.

successfully, you must attribute the car’s breakdown to its flat battery. Likewise, it 
is important to understand the causes of our own and other people’s behaviours, 
so that we can repeat or emulate them (or not) in the future. Causal attributions 
have tremendous social importance. Whenever we assign blame or credit, and so 
determine who should be punished and who should be rewarded, we are engaging 
in causal attribution. Causal attributions also contribute to our feelings about 
ourselves and other people. For example, if we blame ourselves for disappointing 
outcomes and attribute our successes to luck, our self-esteem will probably be 
lower than if we take credit for successes and blame our failures on adverse 
circumstances (Weiner, 1985; see also Chapter 2 for a discussion of self-esteem). 
Causal attributions are also powerful bases for predicting and controlling events 
and behaviours (Försterling and Rudolph, 1988). If we know what causes some-
thing, we may be more likely to allow or prevent it happening in future. 
For these reasons, the study of causal attributions has been central to social 
psychology. Throughout this book, you will see how important attributions are to 
our lives. Some of the founders of social psychology, such as Lewin (1936) and 
Heider (1958a), wrote extensively about the perception of cause and effect. For 
these theorists and especially Heider (1958a), people engage in causal attribution 
not only to guide their behaviour (e.g., fixing the car), but also to make sense of 
the stream of events that make up their everyday lives. Heider (1958a) was influ-
enced by the German movement of Gestalt psychology, which suggests that people 
seek to tie together apparently diverse sensory data into meaningful wholes or 
‘Gestalts’ (see Chapter 1). To relate diverse events into a simpler, more holistic 
understanding, people seek to explain the events they can observe in terms of 
underlying causes they may not be able to see directly. For Heider (1958a), a 
person’s intentions are an example of such an underlying cause that can explain 
diverse behaviours. Imagine that someone gets their credit card out and spends 
some time on a computer; some weeks later they take their cat to a stranger’s 
house and leave it there, buy sun cream and insect repellent at a local shop, pack 
these with clothes and a tourist guide to Turkey into a case, and get on the tele-
phone to order a taxi to the airport. Although these behaviours have little or 
nothing in common from a purely physical point of view, we can effortlessly infer 
they intend to travel to Turkey. This inference allows us to explain all their behav-
iours and tie them into a single Gestalt. 
Such is the explanatory power of intentions that we are prone to overrelying 
on them as explanations. This tendency was powerfully demonstrated in classic 
experiments by Heider and Simmel (1944). They presented participants with a 
film animation in which simple geometric shapes moved around on the screen. 
When participants were asked to account for what they observed, they typically 
fabricated elaborate stories that granted intentionality to the shapes. For example, 
the circle and small triangle were supposed to be in love, and the large triangle 
was said to have been thwarted in an attempt to steal the circle from its lover. 
Similarly, Michotte (1962) found that participants would describe the behaviour 
of two balls on a screen in intentional terms, such as: ‘The big ball is chasing the

viewed in a holistic sense.

events or behaviours as a 
whole by understanding their 
underlying causes.

little ball, but the little ball wants to get away.’ Intentionality is a powerful 
explanatory principle that people prefer even when other types of explanations 
are more objectively appropriate. 
Try it yourself use an internet search engine to search for animated demonstrations of the stimuli used by heider 
and simmel’s (1944) experiment, and also those by michotte (1962). try, for example, the combination ‘heider 
simmel demonstration’ and ‘michotte demonstration’. You can see these animations for yourself and even try them 
on friends or relatives. how do they explain the behaviour of the objects on the screen?
The naive scientist approach
By arguing that people seek to explain apparently diverse behaviour in terms of 
simpler, underlying causes, Heider (1958a) suggested that they are much like 
scientists. They construct meaning by devising causal theories of events and 
human behaviour, and these theories resemble scientific theories. As such, people 
are naive (lay, or intuitive) scientists who seek parsimonious explanations for 
complex social puzzles. Achieving simplicity and unity of understanding is one of 
the most fundamental goals of science, and is for laypeople too. Indeed, all the 
theories you will discover in this book are scientific attempts to account for the 
complex phenomena of human beings’ social lives in terms of relatively simple, 
underlying causes. 
Heider argued that people often attribute causality to situations (e.g., social 
pressure, social context) and make external attributions for people’s behaviours. 
At other times, they construct explanations that attribute cause to personal factors 
(e.g., personality) and make internal attributions. But because people seek causal 
explanations in order to be able to predict and control their social world, they 
tend to look more towards stable properties of the social world, and therefore 
prefer internal attributions such as explanations related to personality and ability. 
For example, if a person is rude to you, you are more likely to attribute their 
behaviour to something about them (e.g., they are rude), rather than to something 
about the situation (e.g., they had a bad day).
Jones and Davis (1965) developed correspondent inference theory to explain why 
and how people make these attributions. This theory is based on the observation 
that people attempt to infer whether a person’s action is caused by internal dispo-
sitions and they do this by looking at factors related to the action, that is, they 
make correspondent inferences. This theory suggests that three factors influence 
the extent to which people make dispositional or situational inferences for a 
person’s behaviour: 
1 They think about the extent to which the person had the choice to engage in 
the action. 
2 They ask whether the behaviour is expected, based on the situation or social 
role of the actor. 
3 People consider the intended consequences of the actor’s behaviour. 
Naive scientist heider 
(1958a) argued that ordinary 
people are scientific, 
rational thinkers who 
make causal attributions 
using similar processes 
to those of scientists. 
Parsimony also known as 
simplicity, this is the extent 
to which an explanation is 
simple rather than complex. 
simpler explanations are 
preferred in science, because 
as explanations contain 
more parts, the chances that 
one part is false increase 
(see also the conjunction 
fallacy, which we discuss 
later in this chapter).

The social perceiver
FiGurE 3.1 Correspondent inference 
theory people are more likely to infer 
that a person has traits that correspond to 
their behaviour (e.g., they’re opinionated 
because they started an argument) when 
these three conditions are met. subsequent 
research on correspondence bias (covered 
later in this chapter) suggests that people 
often do not pay much attention to whether 
the actor had a choice, or whether the 
behaviour was normal in the situation. 
Did actor have 
free choice?
Was behaviour 
normal or 
expected in the 
situation?
Did the actor 
intend the 
action to achieve 
something?
Correspondent 
inference is 
made
According to this theory, people are most able to make 
dispositional attributions for a person’s behaviour when 
the behaviour has been freely chosen, is not a function of 
the situation or expected roles, and if intentionality can 
be clearly inferred (see Figure 3.1).
This point was picked up in the covariation model, the most influential and well-
known model of causal attribution, put forward by Kelley (1967). Kelley explicitly 
argued that ordinary people are naive scientists, who make causal attributions in 
much the same way as professional scientists do. For Kelley (1967), the covariation 
principle lies at the heart of the causal attribution process for both professional and 
naive scientists and forms the basis of the covariation model. The covariation 
principle states that we attribute events to conditions that tend to be present when 
the event happens, and absent when the event does not happen. For example, we 
might attribute a headache to stress because we know we are more likely to get 
headaches when we are stressed than when we are not stressed. Similarly, we are 
more likely to attribute an argument between two housemates to the first house-
mate, if we have noticed that there tend to be more arguments when they are 
around. In doing this, we are behaving much as professional scientists would do. 
As we saw in Chapter 1, we can infer that an independent variable (e.g., caffeine) 
causes irritability if those who we have given coffee are more likely to display 
irritable behaviour than those who have drunk a decaffeinated, ‘placebo’ coffee. 
Kelley (1967) turned the covariation principle into a model of causal attribution 
made in social situations. The typical social situation has three key components. It 
has a person who displays a particular behaviour, an object or stimulus towards 
which the behaviour is directed, and occurs at a particular time or occasion. For 
example, consider the situation: ‘Mike swore at a neighbourhood cat on Friday.’ 
Something about any of these three components, the person (Mike), the stimulus 
(the cat) and the occasion (that particular Friday) might explain the effect (swearing). 
Applying the covariation principle, an observer can infer the most appropriate causal 
explanation by drawing on three dimensions of information about covariation:
1 Consensus information: refers to whether Mike is more prone than other people 
to swearing at the cat. Consensus is low when he is, and high when other people 
swear at the cat just as much as he does. 
Covariation model kelley’s 
(1967) model of causal 
attribution, which argues that 
people typically attribute the 
cause of behaviour to a factor 
that covaries most clearly 
with the behaviour.
Covariation principle the 
attribution of events to 
conditions that tend to be 
present when the event 
happens, and absent when 
the event does not happen. 
Consensus Information about 
the extent to which other 
people react in the same way 
to a particular stimulus.

108
Thinking and feeling
2 Distinctiveness information: refers to whether Mike swears at this cat more often 
than he swears at other cats. Distinctiveness is high when he does, and low 
when he does not. 
3 Consistency: refers to whether Mike swore at his cat only on this Friday, or 
whether he has done so on other occasions. Consistency is low if Friday was 
the first time, and high if it happens every day. If consistency is low, people 
tend to discount the potential cause and look for an alternative. For example, if 
Mike hardly ever swears at this cat, then the cause of the swearing is probably 
not due to Mike’s temperament, or the cat, but some other covarying factor 
such as whether Mike tripped over just before he saw the cat (see McClure, 
1998). We will return to the issue of discounting when we discuss person 
perception later in this chapter. 
Armed with this information, people can make appropriate causal attributions. 
If consensus is low, but distinctiveness is low and consistency is high, then Mike is 
only one of three possible causes that covaries with swearing. There does not seem 
to be anything about the cat, nor the Friday in question that promotes swearing. 
Thus, it is appropriate to attribute the swearing to Mike. Conversely, if distinc-
tiveness is high, consensus high and consistency also high, then the cat is the factor 
that tends to be around when swearing happens, and absent when it does not. It 
would appear that we are dealing with a bad cat that deserves to be the focus of 
causal attribution. Finally, if consistency is low, consensus high and distinctiveness 
low, then it would seem that there was something about that Friday that caused 
Mike to swear at the cat, because everyone appeared to swear more, regardless of 
who they were talking to. Perhaps it was a hot and difficult day. Kelley’s model is 
often known as the ANOVA model because the procedure is similar to the statis-
tical technique of analysis of variance. People make attributions for events (and 
predictions of future events) based on a careful weighing up of the information 
they have and how it all pieces together. The terminology may seem complex, but 
the ideas are elegant and simple. We use the example of Mike and the cat to illus-
trate Kelley’s model further in Figure 3.2.
Extending Kelley’s naive scientist approach
Many studies have essentially supported Kelley’s (1967) model of causal attribu-
tion (e.g., Försterling, 1989; McArthur, 1972; Orvis, Cunningham and Kelley, 
1975; Pruitt and Insko, 1980; Sutton and McClure, 2001). People generally make 
the causal attributions that Kelley predicted when presented with combinations of 
consensus, distinctiveness and consistency information. More generally, studies 
have shown that, everything being equal, people generally adhere to the covaria-
tion principle, attributing events to covarying causes – those that are present when 
similar events happen and absent when they do not happen. Where modifications 
and complementary models have been put forward, they have been largely in 
keeping with the idea that people approach causal attribution in ways that mirror 
scientific theories and explanations. Three key extensions of the naive scientist 
model are worth exploring here.

a specific behaviour, the  
cause is discounted in favour 
of another. 

109
The social perceiver
Improved analysis of covariation between events, persons, stimuli and 
occasions 
Early tests of Kelley’s (1967) model of causal attribution generally supported it, 
but appeared to reveal a systematic mistake in the way that people used covaria-
tion information. People appeared to overattribute events to the person 
(McArthur, 1972). Thus, even when consensus information was high, suggesting 
(in our example) that everyone swears at the neighbourhood cat, people would 
often indicate that something about Mike was the cause of his swearing. This 
finding appeared to be consistent with the correspondence bias (also known as the 
fundamental attribution error), which we will review shortly, wherein people 
appear to infer from a person’s behaviour that they must have a corresponding 
disposition, such as a short temper. However, it turns out that Kelley (1967; also 
McArthur, 1972) had made a subtle but important mistake in how he operational-
ized the covariation principle (e.g., Cheng and Novick, 1990; Försterling, 1989). If 
you want to know whether Mike covaries with swearing, you need to know 
whether he swears more than other people in general – not just whether he swears 
at the cat more. But this information is missing (Figure 3.2). Similarly, distinctive-
ness information, as Kelley formulated it, doesn’t tell you whether other people 
swear at this particular cat more than other cats. Consistency information doesn’t 
tell you about how other people behaved on the occasion, nor how Mike behaved 
in relation to other cats. More recent studies have shown that when participants 
are provided with complete information, they follow the covariation principle 
without systematic errors (e.g., Cheng and Novick, 1990; Försterling, 1989). 
Beyond the covariation principle 
In Chapter 1, we discussed an important truism – that correlation, by itself, does 
not entail causation. Just because two factors, A and B, are correlated, in other

words, they covary, does not mean that one causes the other. A problem for Kelley’s 
(1967) covariation principle is that it assumes that people will be content with 
covariation information alone. In order to be convinced that there is a causal rela-
tionship between A and B, scientists, at a minimum, want to understand that other 
possible causes have been controlled for. More recent research has shown that the 
same is true of ordinary, non-scientific folk. They are more likely to make a causal 
attribution to a factor such as Mike when they know there are no ‘third causes’ that 
might be responsible for his covariation with swearing (e.g., there is no one in the 
neighbourhood waging a vendetta against Mike by throwing the cat at him). Only 
under these circumstances will they grant ‘causal power’ to Mike (Cheng, 1997). 
In order to be convinced that A is causing B, at least in the absence of a lot of 
robust evidence from controlled experiments, scientists also want to know that 
there is some plausible explanation of how A causes B. This is known as a causal 
mechanism. Ahn, Kalish, Medin and Gelman (1995) showed that causal mecha-
nisms are important for laypeople too. In their studies, they asked participants to 
explain events such as a car accident. Even when they knew that the driver had a 
previously impeccable driving record – the driver did not covary with accidents – 
they attributed the accident to them if they knew they had been drinking, or were 
short-sighted and were not wearing their glasses at the time of the accident. 
Participants did this even when they knew that the other driver involved in the 
accident had been involved in several crashes before (see Figure 3.3). In these 
cases, armed with causal mechanism information about how the driver in question 
might have caused the accident, participants attached less weight to covariation 
information (see also White, 1995). 
Causal mechanism the 
mechanism, or explanation 
for one variable causing 
another.
FiGurE 3.3 Covariation and mechanism information compared ratings of 
the extent to which a given possible cause (e.g., the driver) was blamed 
for an event (e.g., a car crash), when covariation (C) and mechanism 
information (m) suggest different explanations. m+ means that causal 
mechanism information points to the driver (e.g., they were drunk). m– 
means that it points away from the driver (e.g., they are a careful person). 
C+ and C– means that covariation information points to and away from the 
driver, respectively (e.g., they have had many/few accidents). the pattern 
of results shows that participants gave greater weight to mechanism than 
to covariation information when they were rating explanations of the 
event. the cause is rated as more important when mechanism information, 
as opposed to covariation information, points to it (m+ compared to 
C+). the cause is rated as less important when mechanism information, 
as opposed to covariation information, suggests that it may not be 
responsible for the event (m– compared to C–).

Beyond persons, stimuli and occasions
Another problem for Kelley’s (1967) original model is that it is not very specific 
about the causal attributions that people make. Although assigning blame and 
credit are important, we are not usually satisfied with causal attributions such as: 
‘Something about Mike caused him to swear.’ They seem more like preliminary 

111
The social perceiver
attributions made early in a process of enquiry, and leave open the obvious ques-
tion: ‘Well, what about Mike caused him to swear?’ In everyday life, we are more 
likely to blame Mike’s behaviour on something specific about him: ‘That Mike, he 
is always in a terrible mood’, ‘He must hate cats’, ‘A cat killed his pet hamster last 
year’ and so on. This problem is compounded by the fact that it is sometimes 
difficult to pin down whether a given attribution is really about the person. If we 
are to say, ‘Mike swore at the cat because he had a bad upbringing’, is this really 
something about Mike? Or is it about something external to Mike – the way he 
was treated as a child? It is difficult to pin down some specific causal attributions 
and categorize them according to Kelley’s (1967) scheme of person, stimulus and 
occasion (White, 1991). 
In light of these problems, researchers have examined what kinds of more 
specific attributions people make, and how they make them. In doing so, they 
have returned to Heider’s (1958a) insight that perceived intentions are central to 
explanations of people’s behaviour. Malle, Knobe and Nelson (2007) have shown 
that people have a sophisticated theoretical understanding of intentional behav-
iour that, once again, resembles some of the concepts scientific psychologists 
would use. They explain behaviours in terms of concepts such as people’s inten-
tions, beliefs and desires, and causal history factors that explain how people came 
to have them. 
This is not to say that the covariation principle is not important. Imagine that 
you are one of the few people to visit a particular lake. When the lake is fouled by 
pollution and surrounded by ugly factories, what makes you unusual is your 
desire to visit the lake for a holiday. Thus, people will explain your behaviour in 
terms of your unusual desire, and the personality quirks or your childhood history 
that made you like stinky, polluted lakes. However, if the lake is gorgeous but 
completely inaccessible unless you charter a plane at great cost, people are more 
likely to explain your visit in terms of your unusual ability to get to the lake – you 
are rich enough to visit it (McClure and Hilton, 1997; Sutton and McClure, 2001). 
It is this factor that makes you stand out, and explains why you went to the lake 
when so many others have not. 
Two famous ‘errors’ in attribution 
Thus far we have examined the cleverness, accuracy and sophistication of the 
causal attributions that ordinary people can make, even though they typically lack 
formal training in logic or statistics. It is for good reason that social psychologists 
have bestowed such people with the tag ‘naive scientist’, even if the naive part 
seems to be patronizing. Indeed, recent research suggests that, in some respects, 
the social cognition done by ordinary people has been more accurate and sophisti-
cated than social psychologists have given it credit for. Nevertheless, many 
researchers and textbook writers have alleged that laypeople are prone to two key 
mistakes when they make causal attributions. These are the fundamental attribu-

112
Thinking and feeling
tion error, and the actor-observer bias. These so-called ‘errors’ are related, and we 
will review each one in turn.
As we briefly mentioned earlier, the fundamental attribution error is the tendency 
to attribute behaviour – stable, underlying personality traits or dispositions – to 
the person when there is insufficient evidence to support such an attribution, and 
even when there is evidence that something about the situation is likely to have 
caused the behaviour (Gilbert and Malone, 1995; Jones, 1979). It was demon-
strated in a classic study by Jones and Harris (1967). In the Cold War environment 
of the 1960s, they presented university students with essays, apparently written 
by other students at their own university, which expressed either positive or nega-
tive views towards Fidel Castro, the Communist leader of Cuba and bête noir of 
American politics. They were later asked to indicate the extent to which the 
writers were pro- or anti-Castro. Crucially, before they made this judgement, 
participants were told that either their fellow essay-writing students had expressed 
these opinions freely, or they had been told what to 
write (and so, presumably, were merely expressing 
the opinions they had been told to express). Of 
course, and quite appropriately, participants inferred 
that authors who had freely chosen to write pro-
Castro essays must really be more pro-Castro than 
authors who had chosen to write an anti-Castro 
essay. However, quite remarkably, participants also 
made similar inferences even when they were told 
that writers were instructed to write a pro- or anti- 
Castro essay. Thus, even when they knew the essay 
writers were influenced by a strong situational 
factor  – being told what kind of essay to write – 
observers still inferred that the essays reflected the 
writers’ underlying beliefs (see Figure 3.4). 
Later findings suggested that this attribution bias is perhaps dependent on too 
many factors to be truly described as ‘fundamental’. For example, it is stronger in 
Western cultures, where the individual is seen as paramount and people tend not 
to think holistically about all the elements in a situation that might have caused 
the behaviour (Nisbett, Peng, Choi and Norenzayan, 2001). Further, the funda-
mental attribution error depends on age. In the West, young children explain 
behaviour in terms of specific factors within the situation (e.g., ‘he cried because it 
was hot’) and only later begin to show a tendency to favour personality attribu-
tions (e.g., ‘he cried because he is a crybaby’) (see White, 1988). In other cultures, 
children do not necessarily move towards the fundamental attribution error as 
they develop (e.g., Miller, 1984). These findings suggest that Western children are 
learning to conform to a culture-specific style of attributions. Also, for reasons we 
shall explore in more depth later in this chapter, the fundamental attribution error 
occurs principally when people are distracted or otherwise lack the cognitive 
resources to properly think through their attributions (Gilbert, 2002).

The social perceiver
If we can say that the so-called ‘fundamental attribution error’ is not ‘funda-
mental’, what can we say about whether it is an ‘error’? As we saw in our coverage 
of Kelley’s (1967) model of attribution, sometimes the mistakes that participants 
seem to be making are really quite rational responses to mistakes and oversights 
made by social psychologists. Were Jones and Harris’s (1967) participants really 
wrong to say that people who wrote pro-Castro essays were somewhat pro-
Castro? Here’s a thought experiment that might help. Imagine that Jones and Harris 
(1967) had told participants to shoot their fellow students. If you were asked to 
explain the behaviour of a participant who complied with this instruction, would 
you be happy merely to say that ‘someone told them to do it’, or would you think 
that their compliance with this instruction says something about the kind of 
person they are? Obedience to such instructions is surely unthinkable for most 
people, violating as it does some of our most deeply felt moral convictions (but see 
Chapter 9, where we outline Milgram’s obedience studies).
Returning to the Jones and Harris (1967) study, participants may have believed 
that truly anti-Castro students would refuse to go along with the instruction to 
write an essay in praise of him. The fact that essay writers obeyed the instruction 
suggests that they cannot have been very anti-Castro. Indeed, when Morris and 
Larrick (1995) took these kinds of beliefs into account, the fundamental attribu-
tion error disappeared. Participants who thought the instruction would be enough 
to make anybody write such an essay, regardless of the writer’s opinions, did not 
attribute the essay to the writer’s attitudes. As brilliant and elegant as their study 
was, Jones and Harris had simply not counted on the fact that their participants 
may not see the instruction as enough to produce the behaviour. More recent 
research suggests that when people have sufficient time, concentration, informa-
tion and motivation, they do not irrationally overlook situational causes of behav-
iour and zero in on personality characteristics (Gilbert and Malone, 1995; 
McClure, 1998). For this reason, the tendency to infer that people have traits that 
correspond to their behaviour is now called the correspondence bias rather than 
the fundamental attribution error. We shall return to this bias later in this chapter.
The second so-called ‘bias’ that warrants closer investigation is the actor-
observer bias, which has been found in several studies and widely claimed to be a 
robust and established finding (Malle, 2006). The actor-observer bias can be 
described as follows. As actors explaining our own behaviour, we tend to cite the 
situational factors that led us to act. As observers, we tend to explain the behav-
iour of other people in terms of personality factors. There have been two main 
theoretical explanations for the effect. One is perceptual – as an actor, you gener-
ally gaze from your perspective at the stimuli affecting your behaviour and you do 
not look at yourself. As an observer, on the other hand, you generally watch the 
person at least as much, and usually more, than the other factors in the situation 
(Malle and Pearce, 2001). Thus, as an actor, the attributions that come most easily 
to mind are the features of the situation you are looking at, whereas as an observer, 
the attributions that spring to mind are those concerned with the person who is 
the focus of your attention (Jones and Nisbett, 1971; Malle and Knobe, 1997).

the tendency for actors 
to attribute their own 
behaviours to the situation 
and for observers to explain 
behaviours in terms of 
personality traits. 

114
Thinking and feeling
Storms (1973) found support for this explanation in a series of studies in which 
participants were asked to have a conversation with another person while the 
conversation was being videoed. Some students watched the conversation from 
their own perspective (that is, they watched the other person and their behaviour), 
and some watched the conversation from the other student’s perspective (that is, 
they watched their own behaviour). Participants were then asked how much they 
attributed their own behaviour and the other student’s behaviour to situational 
(versus dispositional) factors. Of course, seeing yourself on video reverses your 
perspective, so that suddenly you look at yourself as an observer would do. Thus, 
we would expect the actor-observer effect to be reversed in conditions where their 
perspective was switched by the use of video technology. 
Indeed, this is what happened. Observers watching the scene 
unfold from the actor’s perspective were less likely to make 
personality attributions than actors watching the scene from 
the observer’s perspective (see Figure 3.5). A later study by 
Arkin and Duval (1975) suggested that actors do not neces-
sarily have to watch the video in order to change the way they 
explain their own behaviour. The mere presence of video 
cameras caused them to explain their own behaviour in person-
ality terms, apparently because they elicited the state of private 
self-awareness (see Chapter 2). 
Although the actor-observer effect was observed in several 
early studies, contradictory findings soon emerged. In a meta-
analysis of the results of 173 studies, Malle (2006) found that, 
on average, there was little or no actor-observer effect. Under 
some conditions, however, the actor-observer effect is signifi-
cant. For example, when explaining negative behaviour such as 
cheating or mistakes, people invoke the situation for them-
selves and personality characteristics for others. But when 
explaining their own positive behaviour, people refer to internal causes, and when 
explaining others’ positive behaviour, people refer to external causes. Clearly, 
people are motivated to take credit and deflect blame. It is this, rather than some 
fundamental shift in perspective, that leads people to explain their own and others’ 
behaviour differently. Even when Malle (2006) considered all six studies that had 
examined the effect of perspective taking (through video cameras), he found that 
although reversing participants’ perspective produced a pattern opposite to the 
actor-observer bias, the bias itself was not significant, on average, across the 
control conditions in which actors and observers viewed the scene from their 
normal perspectives. 
This is not to say that actors and observers make exactly the same attributions 
for behaviour. Recent research shows, for example, that guided by their under-
standing of intentional behaviour, actors are more likely than observers to describe 
their behaviour in terms of reasons – the desires and beliefs that motivated them. 
This is partly because actors have some degree of inside knowledge – more than

participants watch themselves 
from another person’s

actor-observer effect.

Other biases and errors
Attention to the motives underlying attributions and the errors that people some-
times make has shifted researchers’ perspective away from the naive scientist model 
advocated by Heider and Kelley, and more towards a conceptualization of people 
as motivated tacticians, where attributions and judgements are said to be determined 
by personal motives. In particular, people are motivated to take the least cognitively 
demanding approach to the attributions they make, so that they tend to use cogni-
tive shortcuts (or heuristics) to make attributions (Taylor, 1981, 1998), and can there-
fore be characterized as cognitive misers (Nisbett and Ross, 1980; Taylor, 1981). 
Sometimes, the choice of shortcut is influenced by personal motivations, and as we 
saw in Chapter 2, one of the primary motivations we have as human beings is to 
view the self positively – the so-called ‘self-enhancement motive’. 
As a consequence of this self-enhancement motive, people are prone to errors 
when they judge themselves and others. In particular, people seek new, positive 
information about the self and they also seek ways to alter existing negative views 
of the self. In Chapter 2, we discussed the phenomenon of behavioural self-
handicapping, where people compensate for their failure at a task by sometimes 
acting in ways that sabotage their own chance of success (Berglas and Jones, 1978; 
Rhodewalt, Morf, Hazlett and Fairfield, 1991). Another example of attribution 
bias related to the motive of self-enhancement is the self-serving attribution bias 
(Arkin, Cooper and Kolditz, 1980; Zuckerman, 1979). People attribute the causes 
of negative events to aspects that deflect blame from the self (e.g., having a car 
accident that came about because a tree ‘came out of nowhere’), or positive events 
that attribute success to the self (Stewart, 2005).
Yet another example are more general self-serving beliefs that lead to self-serving 
biases. As we saw in Chapter 2, people generally see themselves as ‘better than 
average’ in a wide variety of different ways, and less likely to experience negative 
outcomes. For example, people view themselves as less likely (10 per cent) than 
others (50 per cent) to be hurt in a terrorist attack (Lerner, Gonzalez, Small and 
Fischhoff, 2003). This unrealistic optimism can also cloud people’s attributions for 
their own and others’ behaviours. In particular, people tend to take credit for their 
successes (internal attribution) and deflect their failures (external attribution) in 
order to enhance and protect the self respectively. These dispositional and situa-
tional attributions tend to become more pronounced as children develop (Berger 
and Calabrese, 1975). Also, the tendency to commit these attributional biases 
seems to be consistent across many different cultures (Fletcher and Ward, 1988). 
In addition to motivational factors, there may also be cognitive factors associated 
with this type of bias. Specifically, Miller and Ross (1975) argued that people 
generally accept responsibility for their success because they expect to succeed. If 
they work hard to succeed, they may overinflate the correlation between their 
effort and their success, so they feel that they controlled their success more than

they actually did. These types of biases may generally result from the illusion of 
control – the belief that we have more control over the world and the things that 
happen to us than we actually do (Langer, 1975). 
Yet another bias related to self-enhancement is the false consensus effect. This is 
the tendency for people to view their own behaviours, attitudes and opinions as 
more typical (that is, shared by others) than they really are (Ross, Greene and 
House, 1977). For example, Ross et al. (1977) asked students on an American 
university campus to wear a sandwich board saying ‘Eat at Joe’s’ for half an hour. 
Exactly half the participants agreed to do this. They were then asked what 
percentage of students had agreed to wear the sign. Those who had agreed to wear 
the sign estimated that the majority of students (68 per cent) would also agree and 
those who had refused to wear the sign also believed that the majority would have 
done as they did (77 per cent). This is a robust effect, and is self-enhancing because 
it allows people to justify negative events in their lives. If they feel that others 
would have behaved the same (e.g., performed poorly on a test of ‘social sensi-
tivity’, as in Alicke and Largo, 1995), this illusion of consensus allows people to 
feel that their skills and abilities are normal. However, the false uniqueness effect 
refers to the tendency for people to see themselves as more likely to perform posi-
tive behaviours than others and to see themselves as less biased than others 
(Ehrlinger, Gilovich and Ross, 2005). This is said to occur in part because people 
underestimate the number of people who do positive things (e.g., giving to charity) 
and overestimate the number of people who do bad things such as stealing (Monin 
and Norton, 2003). 
Applications of attribution theory
Although people are normally capable of making appropriate causal attributions 
so long as they have enough information, motivation and cognitive resources, the 
attribution process can go wrong. As Heider (1958a) observed, making incorrect 
attributions can lead to unhelpful decisions, with disastrous consequences for 
behaviour. It can also have profoundly negative consequences for mood. Research 
has shown that attributions can have these consequences in many aspects of 
people’s lives. Below we illustrate some studies on some other topics that attribu-
tion theory has been applied to: 
 o Mental health: People with depression tend to have an ‘attributional style’ 
(Abramson, Metalsky and Alloy, 1989), in which they attribute negative events 
in their lives to internal, global and stable causes. For example, an attribution 
such as ‘I failed the test because I’m stupid’ is internal because the cause resides 
within you, global because being stupid is going to affect many areas of your 
life, and stable because if you are stupid now, there is a good chance you are 
always going to be stupid (whereas, say, being tired is a temporary condition 
that a good night’s sleep will rectify). The dimensions of internality, globality 
and stability are consistent with Kelley’s (1967) theory that attributions are 
illusion of control the belief 
that we have more control 
over the social world than we 
actually do.

attitudes and opinions as

themselves as more likely to

than others. 

117
The social perceiver
made to the person (high internality), to the stimulus (low globality) or to the 
occasion (low stability). Controllability is another important dimension of 
attributions – people with depression and anxiety tend to attribute outcomes to 
events outside their control (e.g., physical attractiveness) rather than within 
their control (e.g., the way they dress). One of the cornerstones of modern 
approaches to psychotherapy, such as cognitive-behavioural therapy, is training 
people to stop explaining events in their lives in an overly pessimistic, self-
defeating way (Beck, Rush, Shaw and Emery, 1979).
 o Aggression: Aggressive people are prone to the hostile attribution bias, seeing 
innocent or ambiguous behaviours by other people (e.g., bumping into them) 
as deliberate acts of provocation (Orobio de Castro, Veerman, Koops et al., 
2002; Pornari and Wood, 2010). Longitudinal studies have shown that if chil-
dren at age five are predisposed to interpreting ambiguous behaviours in this 
way, they are more likely to be aggressive 12 years later (Lansford, Malone, 
Dodge et al., 2006).
 o Emotions: Valins and Nisbett (1971) designed an intervention to be used in 
therapeutic situations that would transform negative emotions into positive 
emotions. For example, encouraging anxious people to attribute their anxiety 
to external factors rather than internal factors should reduce the extent to 
which people feel anxious about the self. This has met with some success, but 
tends to be restricted to laboratory settings and also tends to be short-lived 
(Parkinson, 1985). 
 o Close relationships: People who attribute their spouse’s negative behaviour to 
internal, stable and global factors (e.g., ‘they are demanding’) are subsequently 
less forgiving and less satisfied with their marriage (Fincham, Paleari and 
Regalia, 2002).
 o Intergroup relations: Becker, Wagner and Christ (2011) asked a representative 
sample of German participants to explain the global financial crisis of 2008. 
Those who blamed the crisis on the actions of bankers and speculators subse-
quently showed increases in anti-Semitism, since Jewish people are stereotypi-
cally associated with global finance. Those who blamed the crisis on immigrants 
showed increases in ethnic prejudice. Those who were encouraged to blame the 
crisis on the global financial system did not show any increases in prejudice 
towards outgroups. Intergroup attributions tend to be characterized by ethno-
centrism, that is, the expectation that our own groups tend to do positive things 
and other groups tend to do negative things, and therefore resemble the self-
serving biases discussed earlier (Hewstone and Jaspers, 1982). This type of bias 
is known as the ultimate attribution error. 
 o Educational achievement: A study of over 5,000 high school students in New 
Zealand showed that students achieve higher marks when they take credit for 
their best marks and deflect blame for their worst marks (McClure, Meyer, 
Garisch et al., 2011). Training people to avoid explaining their educational 
performance in terms of their ability, but in terms of changeable factors such as 
their effort, can reap results. Haynes, Daniels, Stupnisky et al. (2008) did this 
ultimate attribution error

ingroup and negative 
outgroup behaviours

with first-year university students and found their grades improved over the 
following year. Their attributional retraining intervention helped by making 
students more motivated to learn (mastery motivation), rather than by making 
them more motivated to achieve high grades (performance motivation). 
Culture and attribution
Although there appear to be some universals when it comes to attributions, 
research suggests that people of different cultures often make different types of 
attributions for the same behaviours. As we saw earlier, the correspondence bias is 
more pronounced in Western cultures. More generally, studies have shown that 
members of individualistic cultures are more prone to make dispositional attribu-
tions for their own and others’ behaviours, whereas people in collectivistic cultures 
are more likely to make situational attributions. For example, Morris and Peng 
(1994) asked Chinese and American students to read brief summary accounts of 
two murder cases. In general, the Chinese students tended to place more blame on 
situational factors (e.g., media glorification of violence, economic recession), 
whereas the American students blamed the perpetrator (e.g., mental imbalance 
and personality problems). Findings such as these can 
be explained by the view of personality as changeable, 
which is more common in collectivistic than individual-
istic cultures (Choi, Nisbett and Norenzayan, 1999). In 
particular, people from collectivistic cultures are less 
likely to agree that ‘someone’s personality is something 
that cannot be changed’. 
Another explanation is the effect of distraction 
on attributions. Knowles, Morris, Chiu and Hong 
(2001) asked student participants from the USA and 
Hong Kong to read a speech by another student who 
had supposedly been asked to advocate a particular 
position. Participants were asked to rate how much 
they thought the speech reflected the student’s actual 
attitude. Crucially, some of the participants were 
distracted – they were asked to perform another task 
on the computer while listening to the speech. Findings 
revealed that the US students made more dispositional attributions when they 
were distracted than when they were not. However, the participants from Hong 
Kong did not respond to distraction in the same way, making few dispositional 
inferences in both conditions (see Figure 3.6). 
Another explanation for cultural differences in attribution is that people in 
individualistic cultures tend to pay less attention to the impact of the situation on 
behaviour than people from collectivistic cultures, who show a greater tendency 
to explain events with reference to the context (see Figure 3.7). Individualistic 
cultures are therefore less likely than collectivistic cultures to see connections

between objects and events (Nisbett et al., 2001; Norenzayan and Nisbett, 2000). 
In one study demonstrating this effect, Masuda and Nisbett (2001) asked Japanese 
and US students to observe aquarium scenes that included various items such as 
fish, rocks and plants. They were asked to describe what they saw. In a later recog-
nition test, they were shown some of the previously seen aquarium objects along 
with some new objects. Both the original and new objects were shown either in 
their original context or in a different context. Participants were asked to judge 
whether they had seen the objects. In a second study, participants performed the 
same task with photographs of wildlife. Masuda and Nisbett found that the Japa-
nese participants made more statements about contextual information (e.g., the 
fish were near the seaweed, near the shells) than the US students, and also made 
more mention of relationships between the objects. Further, the Japanese partici-
pants recognized previously seen objects with more accuracy when they saw them 
in their original settings, whereas this had little effect on the US participants. 
These findings demonstrated that the Japanese participants were more likely to see 
things in relation to context than their US counterparts, and are consistent with 
other findings (e.g., Ji, Peng and Nisbett, 2000) demonstrating that US participants 
made fewer mistakes on a different task that required decoupling objects from a 
background. Thus, it appears that people from Eastern cultures may be more 
‘holistic’ thinkers than those from Western cultures. When it comes to making 
attributions for events, they attend more to the ‘bigger picture’ and the whole 
situation rather than the agency of a particular target. 
Time to reflect Findings such as those of masuda and nisbett (2001, p. 933) suggest that the ‘Japanese may simply 
see more of the world than do americans’. however, they may also suggest that east asians find it difficult to 
separate objects from their contexts. What might be some of the implications of these findings? Could they be an 
important factor in determining other cultural differences in social psychology?
Person perception
Your safety, success and enjoyment in life depend not only on the attributions you 
make for your own and others’ behaviours, but more generally on your ability to 
make accurate judgements about people. Who can you trust? Who is fun to be 
around? Who is needy or manipulative? Who will be able to help you with a task? 
People who struggle to make these judgements are more prone to a range of 
psychological disorders, including depression (Coyne, 1976; Lane and DePaulo, 
1999; Russell, Stokes, Jones et al., 1993). How do we make these important judge-
ments? This is the question at the heart of the study of person perception (also 
known as impression formation). 
Configural model of person perception

Gestalt psychology and the notion that laypeople think like scientists. Asch’s

Thinking and feeling
(1946) configural model of person perception suggested that we form a holistic 
impression of people that integrates a small number of important cues (Figure 
3.8). Some cues, known as central traits, have a lot of influence over the impressions 
we form of people, whereas others, known as peripheral traits, have less influence. 
To test this model, Asch (1946) asked participants to read a list of attributes 
about a fictitious person (e.g., energetic, assured, talkative, cold, ironical, inquisi-
tive, persuasive). There were two lists that different only slightly – specifically, the 
list given to one set of participants contained the word ‘warm’ and the list given to 
the remaining participants contained the word ‘cold’. Participants were asked to 
rate the fictitious person on a list of bipolar dimensions such as happy/unhappy 
and reliable/unreliable. It was found that participants who were given the list 
containing the word ‘warm’ rated the person 
much more favourably than the participants who 
had the list containing the word ‘cold’. From 
these results, Asch argued that being warm or 
cold is a central trait that has a strong influence on 
overall impression formation. He found that 
when the words ‘warm’ and ‘cold’ were replaced 
by ‘polite’ and ‘blunt’, the differences in the 
impressions formed was less striking.
Kelley (1950) tested the configural theory in a 
naturalistic setting. He introduced a visiting 
lecturer to several class groups – for half of the 
groups, the introduction included the trait ‘cold’ and for the other half, the intro-
duction described the lecturer as ‘warm’. The students were then later asked to 
evaluate the lecturer and, as predicted, student evaluations were more positive 
when the lecturer had been described as ‘warm’ rather than ‘cold’. Interestingly, 
Kelley also observed that students were more likely to ask questions and interact 
with the lecturer who had been described as ‘warm’. More recent research points 
to the centrality of warmth as a trait – so much so that the experience of warmth 
influences our social judgements. As we shall see in Chapter 4, Williams and Bargh 
(2008) found that participants who held a cup of hot (versus cold) coffee judged a 
target person as having a ‘warm’ personality, such as being generous or caring. 
Apparently, ‘warmth’ as a trait really is a deep-seated metaphor based on the 
physical sensation of warmth. 
Time to reflect Why do you think warmth is such a central trait? aside from warmth, what other traits would you 
say are central? how central would you say these traits are, compared to warmth? 
Algebraic model
Another model proposes that observers assign ‘scores’ to people on their traits 
and characteristics. When a person forms an impression of another person, they 
average out the scores to form an overall evaluation (Anderson, 1965, 1996). This 
Configural model of person

you have information about

The social perceiver
process is known as cognitive algebra – people assign positive and negative valence 
to various person attributes and combine them to be able to form a general evalu-
ation of a person. For example, consider the two people in Table 3.1 who have 
been evaluated along various dimensions on a scale from –3 to +3 from least posi-
tive to most positive (e.g., Anderson, 1974). Each person has a ‘score’ on the first 
six traits (intelligent, hard-working, interesting, honest, friendly and funny). 
Based on the sums of their scores on these six traits, Kat comes out ahead, with a 
total of two, compared to 1.83 for James. Impressions of Kat should therefore be 
slightly more favourable.

the figures on the left reveal what happens if you were to gain 
enough information about kat to form impressions of these 
traits. according to the most basic version of the algebraic 
model, your overall impression of kat becomes more positive, 
because the new trait information is positive. But according to 
the averaging model, your overall impression becomes less 
positive, because the 6 new traits score less high, on average, 
than the first 6. In this example, your impression of kat based on 
12 traits is now less positive than your impression of James, 
based on 6.

However, not all traits are equal all of the time. The example above describes 
the principal model of cognitive algebra that is based on summation. Here, the 
overall impression is simply the total valence (that is, the net positive or negative 
nature) of all the pieces of information. Using this principle, a person wanting to 
make a positive first impression might want to conceal their lack of honesty and 
interestingness in favour of the traits where they score well. In this model of 
cognitive algebra, every small piece of positive information adds to the overall 
positive evaluation that can be formed. 
The model of averaging assumes that people’s overall impression is formed by 
calculating the arithmetic mean of all the traits on display. Using the averaging 
principle rather than summation can make a real difference, as Table 3.1 shows. 
For example, if you already have a positive impression of someone, and learn new 
information that is still positive, then according to the summing principle, your 
impression becomes even more positive. In our example, the total ‘score’ for Kat, 
taking into account the six additional traits we have learned about, goes up from 
Cognitive algebra approach to 
the study of person perception 
proposing that people assign 
positive and negative valence 
to various person attributes 
and combine them to form a 
general evaluation of a person.

12 to 16. However, according to the averaging principle, our impression of Kat 
becomes less positive. This is because the new trait information, while positive, is 
less positive than the first six traits. We divide the new total of 16 by twelve traits, 
whereas we had divided the old total of 12 by just six traits. In fact, knowing all 
twelve of these traits about Kat will lead to a less positive impression of her than 
that of James, based on the first six traits. Thus, one implication of the averaging 
model is that the positive impression a person projects may be diluted if more 
information is presented. It may therefore be wise to present only a small number 
of the most positive attributes one possesses so that the perceiver receives the best 
possible overall impression.
This simple model of averaging is not without limitations either. It does not 
take into account the importance of different traits in different circumstances. For 
example, in judging a person’s worthiness as a comedian, it would be typical to 
assign more importance to the trait of humour than honesty. Or, honesty and 
intelligence might be the most important traits in judging a politician. The model 
of weighted averaging takes into account the relative importance of traits in 
different circumstances. Using the example in Table 3.1, let us say you are evalu-
ating the two people for a job as an analyst in an insurance company versus a 
holiday rep. Traits like intelligence and industriousness are important for the first 
job, while traits like being funny and friendly are important for the other. Taking 
into account how we might therefore weight the different traits, Kat comes out 
ahead as the insurance analyst, but James comes out ahead as the holiday rep. 
However, it is a common finding that negative information is generally 
weighted more heavily than positive information. This is called the negativity bias 
(e.g., Kanouse and Hanson, 1972; Skowronski and Carlston, 1989; Smith and 
Collins, 2009), so even using the weighted averaging model, a person wishing to 
create a positive impression of themselves would be wise to conceal their most 
negative traits from the perceiver. Interestingly, for reasons that are not under-
stood, the negativity bias changes over the life span. Older adults appear to be 
biased towards positive trait information. For whatever reason, our neural activity 
seems to be less responsive to negative information as we age, but does not become 
less responsive to positive information (Kisley, Wood and Burrows, 2007). 
Time to reflect think of some of the people you know and your impressions of them. how are they influenced 
by the context in which you interact with them? Come up with your own table of traits and work out how people 
might be perceived differently depending on the summation, averaging and weighted averaging processes of 
cognitive algebra.
The weighted average model of person perception has gained a good deal of 
support from research evidence, and is still influential today (Singh and Simons, 
2010). While it is a good model of how an overall impression of a person is built 
up from impressions of their personality traits, it does not attempt to explain how 
we form impressions of their specific traits in the first place. It also does not take 
into account the order in which we learn about their positive and negative traits. 
Trait impressions are formed quickly, and they have to be. If it takes you too long

the next few pages, we review the human ability to form first impressions quickly, 
with little apparent effort, and the ongoing importance of those first impressions. 
Question to consider now that you know more about person perception, reread question 1 at the start of the 
chapter. What would be your advice to louisa?
The power of first impressions
The study of person perception has produced two striking and consistent find-
ings. First, impressions are formed extremely quickly, with a surprising degree of 
accuracy. Second, these first impressions, even when they are wrong, carry a lot of 
weight. Having made a good first impression, you are more likely to be able to 
‘get away’ with doing bad or stupid things without too much damage to your 
reputation. And if you make a bad first impression, it is difficult to overcome it. 
Just how quickly do we form impressions, and how do we do it? One way we do 
it is to judge a book by its cover, relying on visible and superficial cues that are 
presented by people’s appearance and demeanour. For example, consider the three 
pictures in Figure 3.9. Which of these men do you think would be most likely to 
go to a Star Trek convention? Which one might be a banker? Which one might 
like gangster rap? We think you could make these decisions very quickly. 
Research has explored two ways in which people judge a book by its cover. 
First, they extract a lot of information about people by observing brief, ‘thin slices’ 
of their behaviour. Some traits, such as extraversion, intelligence and conscientious-
ness, can be determined after five seconds of watching a video of another person. It

on this type of task, people 
generally agree on the likely 
activities (sci-fi conventions, 
banking, gangster rap) of 
these three individuals. this 
demonstrates that we form 
impressions of people quickly 
even though we know very 
little about them.

Thinking and feeling
can take longer to determine how neurotic, open to experience, and agreeable a 
person is, but in general the optimal trade-off between accuracy and speed is 
reached at about 60 seconds (Carney, Colvin and Hall, 2007). It appears to take 30 
seconds for ordinary people to be able to spot whether others have a personality 
disorder (Friedman, Oltmanns and Turkheimer, 2007), and to tell how effective 
they would be as salespeople (Ambady, Krabbenhoft and Hogan, 2006). In general, 
for reasons that are not entirely clear, women appear to be somewhat better at 
judging a book by its cover than men (Ambady, Hallahan and Rosenthal, 1995).
It is by no means clear exactly how people – and especially women – manage to 
do this. However, it appears to be important to ‘go with your instincts’ – thinking 
in a deliberate way seems to actually impair performance on the ability to make 
quick but accurate judgements about others. As a result, sad and depressed people 
tend to be worse at this task, precisely because they try to think about it rather 
than doing it instinctively (Ambady and Gray, 2002; Ambady and Rosenthal, 
1992). People who are impaired in other ways (e.g., alcoholic and psychiatric 
patients) also tend to have poorer ‘thin slice vision’ compared to normal samples 
(Rosenthal, Hall, DiMatteo et al., 1979). Also, there is little to no relationship 
between people’s confidence in their judgements and their accuracy (Ames, 
Kammrath, Suppes and Bolger, 2010). This suggests that whatever techniques 
people are using, they do not have conscious access to them. Putting this all 
together suggests that we can thank automatic processes, occurring outside our 
awareness, for our extraordinary skills in person perception. We return to these 
unconscious processes later in the chapter. 
Exploring further use the internet to find other traits that ordinary, untrained people can judge by using ‘thin 
slices’ of behaviour or, even more minimally, photographs. try searching terms like ‘thin slice judgement’ (you can 
try both British and american spellings), ‘impressions’ and ‘traits’. much of the research on judgements of personality 
from photographs uses the key phrase ‘zero acquaintance’. Can you find any clues as to how people might be  
pulling off this trick? 
Question to consider now, reread question 2 at the start of the chapter. Why do you think ray’s first impression 
of alan was so powerful? 
Another way that people judge a book by its cover is to use an even more 
minimal source of information – people’s physical appearance, as revealed, for 
example, by photographs. Traits that people appear to be able to determine, better 
than chance, merely by looking at head and shoulder photographs stripped of all 
other cues include intelligence (Zebrowitz, Hall, Murphy and Rhodes, 2002), 
extraversion (how outgoing someone is), neuroticism (how anxious they tend to 
be) and psychoticism (how loose and dissociated their thinking is) (e.g., Shevlin, 
Walker, Davies et al., 2003). Viewing a still photograph of a stranger for as little as 
50 milliseconds – one-twentieth of a second – can be enough to allow people to 
judge whether they are extraverted (Borkenau, Brecke, Möttig and Paelecke, 

125
The social perceiver
2009). A person’s conscientiousness (Albright et al., 1988), honesty (Bond, Berry 
and Omar, 1994) and aggression (Berry and Brownlow, 1989) can also be deter-
mined, to some extent, by strangers merely on the basis of photographs. 
SOCiAl PSYCHOlOGY iN THE rEAl WOrlD
‘Gaydar’, politics and the importance of 
judging a book by its cover
You may have heard of 
the popular notion of 
‘gaydar’ – the ability of 
people, especially gay 
people, to judge at a 
glance whether a stranger 
is gay. there is controlled 
experimental evidence 
that heterosexuals are 
able to make this 
judgement fairly 
accurately based solely 
on a set of eight 
photographs, and that gay men and women are still more 
accurate (ambady, hallahan and Conner, 1999). using 
photographs of straight and gay men taken from personal 
advertisements, recent research suggests that a 50 ms 
glance at a head and shoulders photograph of a man is 
enough for people to guess, at above-chance levels, 
whether he is gay (rule and ambady, 2008). the existence 
of a ‘gaydar’ makes eminent evolutionary sense, as rule 
and ambady point out. successful mating has always 
depended on being able to size up opportunities, quickly. 
there is no point pursuing people who are not available to 
you. however, although it is easy to tell a story about why 
people are so good at it, research is yet to determine 
exactly how people do it.
moving from ‘gaydar’ to politics, todorov, mandisodza, 
goren and hall (2005) demonstrated how quickly people 
can form consensual impressions of others and how much 
these impressions can matter. they asked participants to 
look at pairs of unfamiliar faces for only one second. the 
faces were those of politicians contesting the us elections 
in 2004. participants were given one second only to rate 
the competency, intelligence, leadership, honesty, 
trustworthiness, charisma and likeability. they found that 
ratings of the individuals were highly differentiated into 
three clusters (competence, trust and likeability) – 
participants were rating the faces according to meaningful 
patterns. Interestingly too, judgements of competence 
predicted actual electoral success. Candidates who were 
rated as more competent were elected approximately 68 
per cent of the time. seemingly, election results were 
influenced by people’s automatic judgements of a 
candidate’s competence.

Given that we are not entirely sure how people can judge each others’ character-
istics from observing thin slices of their behaviour, it may not surprise you to learn 
that we do not understand how they do it from photographs, either. But this new 
line of research is already producing some intriguing clues. Engell, Haxby and 
Todorov (2007) presented a set of faces to Princeton University undergraduates, 
and asked them to rate them for trustworthiness. While they were doing this, they 
were inside a functional magnetic resonance imager (fMRI) – a machine that can

Thinking and feeling
track changes in blood flow within the brain as it engages in different tasks, 
commonly used in social neuroscience studies (see Chapter 15). Of particular 
interest was increases in blood flow to the amygdala (see Figure 3.10), a structure at 
the rear of the brain that is associated with judgements of trustworthiness (Adolphs, 
Tranel and Damasio, 1998; Winston, Strange, O’Doherty and Dolan, 2002), among 
other functions associated with the processing of emotional information. They 
predicted, and found, that as a participant found a face less trustworthy, activity in 
their amygdala would increase. However, something startling happened when the 
researchers controlled statistically for how trustworthy all the participants had 
found each face, on average. Each participant’s amygdala response was better 
predicted by this consensual rating of the faces than by their own rating. Appar-
ently, the human amygdala is capable of putting faces into boxes – faces that are 
generally agreed to be trustworthy or untrustworthy – independently of the 
conscious decision of its ‘owner’. In other words, the amygdala ‘lights up’ in 
response to trustworthy and untrustworthy features of stimulus faces that are there 
for everybody to see, and not as a result of the individual decision of the perceiver. 
Here, then, is evidence that strongly suggests that our brains have learned, or are 
hard-wired, to detect personality traits based on features of people’s faces.
But what features are important in judgements of trustworthiness and untrust-
worthiness? In a sophisticated set of studies blending experimentation with 
computer modelling, Oosterhof and Todorov (2008) found that high perceived 
trustworthiness is associated with happy expressions, and low perceived trustwor-
thiness is associated with angry expressions. Look a little happy, and you will be 
more likely to appear trustworthy; look a little angry, and you will not. Although 
stimulus faces are generally pretested to ensure they are emotionally neutral, some 
people just have faces that look a little bit angry or a little bit happy most of the 
time. Engell, Todorov and Haxby (2010) suggest that to judge a trait like trust-
worthiness from these kinds of subtle emotional expression cues may not be 
accurate. Rather, angry people (like untrustworthy people) are to be avoided, and 
happy people (like trustworthy people) may be approached. Common brain 
systems may be involved in the evaluation of emotions and personality character-
istics that suggest people should also be approached or avoided.

The social perceiver
Using some facial cues is likely to lead to accurate judgements. The wider your 
face (width-to-height ratio), the higher your exposure to testosterone as you were 
developing, and the more likely you are to be aggressive in laboratory experiments 
or during professional sports (Carré and McCormick, 2008). Even more fascinat-
ingly, others can tell – people with wider faces are seen as more aggressive (Carré, 
Morrissey, Mondloch and McCormick, 2010). It is worth pausing to consider the 
use of one facial cue that does not lead to accurate judgements – attractiveness. A 
person’s physical appearance (and most notably their attractiveness) can influence 
the impression they make, but this may not reflect who they actually are. 
In one study demonstrating the influence of appearance, Dion, Berscheid and 
Walster (1972) told participants they were participating in a study of the accu-
racy of social perception. They were to look at photos of actual people whose 
characteristics were purportedly being measured in another longitudinal study. 
Thus, participants thought that their responses would be compared to ‘expert’ 
ratings of the targets. The targets were preselected for different levels of physical 
attractiveness as judged by a set of independent raters. Thus, participants were 
presented with one attractive face, one face of average attractiveness and one 
unattractive face. Some striking results were found (see Figure 3.11). Specifically, 
attractive people were perceived to have the most socially desirable personality, 
higher marital competence and a more 
desirable occupational status. Thus, being 
attractive is seen to be associated with 
more desirable personality characteristics 
and life outcomes. Research suggests that 
this belief is wrong – although attractive 
people are seen as nicer, they are not actu-
ally nicer. However, it might be that nicer 
(more agreeable and extroverted) people 
take care more over their appearance in 
day-to-day life (Meier, Robinson, Carter 
and Hinsz, 2010). 
There are many other effects associated 
with physical attractiveness. For example, 
teachers excuse the misbehaviours of 
attractive children but blame children 
who are unattractive (Dion, 1972). Attrac-
tive men receive higher starting salaries 
than unattractive men and this continues over the course of their career (Frieze, 
Olsen and Russell, 1991). Also, physically attractive defendants in court tend to be 
set lower bails (Downs and Lyons, 1991). It seems that people associate better 
success and better outcomes with being attractive, so that attractive people tend to 
be perceived positively across a variety of domains.
However, as Heilman and Stopeck (1985) found, this is further influenced by 
gender. In their study, they asked male and female MBA students to participate in

a study of ‘personnel decision making’. Participants looked at pictures of various 
male and female targets and read their employee profiles. The first independent 
variable was the type of job (managerial or clerical), the second was the gender of 
the employee (male or female) and, finally, the experimenters manipulated the 
targets’ attractiveness (more or less attractive). The dependent variables were 
performance evaluation and advancement potential. Heilman and Stopeck found 
that, for male employees, being attractive or unattractive did not matter, whether 
in a clerical or managerial position. However, for female employees, attractiveness 
was seen as an asset in a clerical position but not in a managerial position. The 
researchers argued that this occurred because of a lack of fit between the catego-
ries. Specifically, being attractive and female does not fit with the characteristics of 
being a good manager. 
Recent research is also revealing how being good-looking can be a double-
edged sword. In particular, although it normally encourages members of the 
‘other’ sex to assign positive personality characteristics to you, it can have quite 
the opposite effect on members of the same sex. For example, Agthe, Sporrle and 
Maner (2011) had undergraduate students rate rival candidates for a job, whose 
applications included a photograph. Both male and female participants rated more 
attractive ‘other-sex’ candidates as more qualified for 
the job (even though, photos aside, the CVs and 
applications were identical). However, they also rated 
more attractive ‘same-sex’ candidates as less qualified 
for the job (see Figure 3.12). This suggests, of course, 
that attractive, same-sex people may be derogated 
because they are seen as a threat. The results of a 
second study by Agthe et al. supported this idea. 
High self-esteem participants, who were presumably 
secure in themselves and less prone to feeling threat-
ened, were biased towards, rather than against, attrac-
tive same-sex candidates. In another study, Phillips 
and Hranek (2011) showed male and female univer-
sity students a photograph of an attractive or unat-
tractive woman student, and were asked to imagine 
the student letting them down on a group presentation assignment. Would they 
forgive her, if she apologized? ‘Yes’, said the male students, if she was attractive 
rather than unattractive. ‘No’, said the female students, under the same conditions. 
It is clear that judging a book by its cover leads to mixed results in impression 
formation. But this is not the only way we form impressions of people quickly. 
Another much studied process that underpins the rapid formation of first impres-
sions is correspondent inference, which we have already discussed with respect to 
attribution. When we see someone act in a greedy, hostile, kind or intelligent way, 
we automatically, and rapidly, infer that they must be greedy, hostile, kind or 
intelligent, accordingly. If you are cut up by a motorist driving aggressively, you 
are less likely to think, ‘They must be in a hurry’, than ‘They are a bad driver’ (or

worse). Many studies show that we do this, even when we are not asked to make 
such inferences (e.g., Carlston and Skowronski, 1994).
Todorov and Uleman (2003) used a clever methodology to uncover these 
‘spontaneous trait inferences’. They showed participants 60 pairs of photos of 
strangers with sentences describing the people doing things, such as ‘Alice solved 
the mystery halfway through the book’. Later, they showed photos of the same 
people, with captions of the trait that was implied by their behaviour (in this case, 
‘clever’). They were asked to indicate whether this word appeared in the sentence 
they had read earlier. Of course, it had not; nonetheless, participants tended to 
falsely recognize the word, especially when they saw the initial sentences for a 
short period of time, when they were not thinking about the sentence deeply (e.g., 
when they were counting nouns), and when their minds were on another task they 
had been asked to do by the experimenter. 
These findings reinforce a point made some years before in a study by Gilbert 
and Osborne (1989). They showed participants a video of a young female confed-
erate, minus sound, who appeared to be acting very nervously (e.g., fidgeting with 
her hair, biting her nails, moving around in her seat). One group of participants 
was told that she was being asked to talk about positive or neutral topics (such as 
travel or books). In this experimental condition, participants have no good reason 
to suspect that despite her behaviour, the confederate is not a nervous person. In 
contrast, another group of participants was told that she was discussing nerve-
wracking topics (imagine being asked to discuss your fears and phobias, or painful 
childhood memories on video). In this condition, according to classic models of 
person perception and causal attribution, we should engage in the process of 
discounting that we touched on earlier. Her nervous behaviour should be 
discounted in light of the information about the situation – any normal person 
would be nervous talking about their painful childhood experiences on video. 
Thus, the normal correspondent inference – she is acting nervously, therefore she 
is a nervous person – should be tempered. 
This happened, so long as participants had sufficient thinking powers, or cogni-
tive resources, free. When Gilbert and Osborne (1989) gave some of the partici-
pants something else to do – a task in which they had to memorize a list of words 
being read out to them while watching the video – the topic the woman was osten-
sibly discussing made no difference. Under this cognitive load manipulation, 
participants found it impossible to disregard the visible behaviour of the woman 
and so correspondent inferences dominated. For Gilbert and Osborne, this was 
evidence that people automatically make correspondent inferences. They will fall 
prey to the correspondence bias we discussed earlier – the tendency to ascribe 
correspondent traits to people even though the situation is more likely to have 
caused their behaviour – except when they are sufficiently motivated and able to

More recently, a team of researchers (van Duynslaeger, Sterken, van Overwalle 
and Verstraeten, 2008) used electroencephalograms (EEGs) to measure brain 
activity. The EEGs showed that a unique brain response is associated with the 
reading of trait words that are consistent, rather than inconsistent, with the trait 
implied by earlier sentences describing behaviours. To go back to our earlier 
example, ‘clever’ is consistent and ‘stupid’ inconsistent with solving a mystery. 
This same brain response (a P300 in the parietal area of the brain) is also associated 
with the ability to remember the original behavioural sentence (about solving the 
mystery) when prompted on the screen with the correspondent trait (clever). 
As we mentioned, first impressions are not only made quickly, but they are hard 
to shake. People tend to assign greater importance to the traits they observe first. It 
is common wisdom that first impressions are important, and indeed this is often 
true. For example, Asch (1946) asked participants to form an impression of a person 
after reading a list of adjectives. Crucially, for half the participants, the positive traits 
appeared first (e.g., intelligent) and for the other half, the negative traits appeared 
first (e.g., impulsive). Participants’ impressions were influenced by the information 
that appeared first, such that the first group of participants formed more positive 
impressions of the target person than the second group. The traits presented first 
had a greater influence on the overall impression that was formed. This primacy effect 
implies that people may be wise to ‘put their best foot forward’ because social 
perceivers tend to pay more attention to information that is observed first.
Time to reflect Why do you think first impressions count? read the rest of this chapter and see if you can find at 
least two social cognitive principles that help to explain why the first information we receive about a person is so 
important. 
People sometimes pay more attention to information that is observed most 
recently. This is called the recency effect (Anderson, 1971; Dreben, Fiske and 
Hastie, 1979; Mayo and Crockett, 1964). Although primacy effects are most 
commonly observed, it is important to consider that people may be more likely, at 
least in demanding situations, to attend to information that is most recently 
presented. An underlying explanation for both primacy and recency effects is 
motivational, and found support in an experiment by Richter and Kruglanski 
(1998). People, especially when they are high in the desire to form a definite, clear, 
unambiguous impression of others, tend to ‘seize’ on the most easily accessible 
information they have. If you have the goal to form an impression of a person 
when you first meet them, which, as we have seen, seems to be the case normally, 
then you are likely to ‘seize’ on the first piece of information you receive about 
them. If, on the other hand, you have a goal of forming an impression of a person 
after you have known them for a while, the last piece of information you learned 
about them may be the most accessible. 
Person memory
How much do we remember about people? How do we organize the information 
we learn about people? To answer these questions, social psychologists have 
Primacy effect Bias in person 
perception such that people 
remember (and assign the 
most importance to) the traits 
they observe first.

The social perceiver
turned to cognitive psychological theories of memory and, in particular, the 
notion of associative networks (Anderson, 1990). This type of memory model 
assumes that people store propositions, which consist of ideas or nodes that are 
linked by the associations between them. For example, various propositions (e.g., 
seeing a person is kicking a ball, the ball is a football, the person is wearing a 
football kit) have various nodes (e.g., person, kicking, ball, football kit), which are 
related to, or associated with, each other. In this type of memory model, some 
links between nodes are stronger than others but links can become stronger the 
more they are rehearsed. In other words, the more people think about people 
kicking balls, footballs and football wear, the stronger these attributes and events 
become linked together. Memories are also more likely to be recalled if there are 
multiple memory routes, or more ways to retrieve the memory. Recalling involves 
the activation of nodes and the subsequent activation of related nodes along asso-
ciative links. If someone recalls a person kicking a ball, they are also likely to think 
of football because these nodes are strongly associated. 
This type of associative network model can explain specific processes related to 
person memory. For example, if we have a strong impression of a person, we tend 
to remember information that is consistent with our impression (Fiske and 
Neuberg, 1990). Perhaps counterintuitively, however, people tend to more 
successfully recall information about a person if it is inconsistent with their general 
impression of the person. For example, we might be more likely to recall that a 
person likes sewing if we know they are also a professional wrestler. Social 
psychologists argue this is often the case, because information that is inconsistent 
with impressions demands more attention, generates more thought, and thus 
strengthens the links between nodes. This may reflect people’s increased effort to 
reconcile information with their beliefs (Hastie, 1988; Srull and Wyer, 1989). 
What does person memory consist of and how do we use it?
Theorists generally assume that person memory is organized so that positive and 
negative features are clustered together. More specifically, Schneider, Hastorf and 
Ellsworth (1979) argued that trait information is typically organized around the 
dimensions of competencies (e.g., intelligence) and socially desirable characteris-
tics (e.g., friendliness). Trait inferences about a person are a result of complex 
processes of assigning causal attributions for people’s behaviours. Memory for 
appearance is typically based on observable information (e.g., Lydia has brown 
eyes) and is stored like a ‘picture in the mind’. Memory for behaviours is typically 
organized with respect to the person’s goal in performing a behaviour (e.g., Mike 
swore at the cat because he was in a hurry and the cat was in his way) (Hoffman, 
Mischel and Mazze, 1981). 
Typically, people remember others as a cluster of traits, appearances and behav-
iours, especially if they know them well, as is the case for close friends and family. 
According to Sedikides and Ostrom (1988), this produces more accurate person 
memories that are easily recalled. However, when we first encounter an individual, 
we may not be familiar enough with their traits to be able to organize a set of 
Associative network memory 
model whereby ideas or 
nodes are connected by 
associative links.

useful information about them. Instead, we may organize our impression of that 
person by judgements we make based on their group membership. As we will 
discuss later in this chapter, people heavily rely on information about groups – 
namely stereotypes – in order to make social judgements. But to what extent do 
people use person memory? Interestingly, not very much at all. Based on a review 
of a large number of findings, Hastie and Park (1986) concluded that people tend 
to form impressions in a more online fashion, that is, they rely disproportionately 
on information that comes in through the process of communication and impres-
sion formation rather than what is stored in memory. 
Heuristics and biases in social cognition
We are by no means perfect scientists. We lack the time, information and sheer 
processing power to always make perfect judgements. Thus, we are prone to using 
certain heuristics. Heuristics are rules of thumb that can be used to make judge-
ments that are not 100 per cent reliable, but which give an approximately accurate 
answer in most situations. In a set of studies that helped Daniel Kahneman later 
win the Nobel Prize for economics, he and his colleague Amos Tversky 
(Kahneman and Tversky, 1973; Tversky and Kahneman, 1974) discovered that 
people use three key heuristics to guide their decision making in everyday situa-
tions – the representativeness heuristic, the availability heuristic, and the anchoring 
and adjustment heuristic. We discuss these heuristics in turn and then discuss 
some other biases that affect our social cognition.
The representativeness heuristic
One of the most basic tasks in social cognition is categorization – essentially 
deciding which social categories people belong to. Categorizing in a reliable way 
requires a lot of information and complex reasoning processes that may not be 
within our reach. In order to get the job done, we often take a shortcut – we put 
people into a category simply on the basis that their attributes seem similar to, that 
is, representative of, other members of that category – the representativeness 
heuristic. For example, suppose you begin to get to know Tony, a neighbour in his 
thirties, who is shy, quietly spoken, very neat, helpful and always reading. If you 
were to guess his occupation, you might say that he is a librarian; certainly this 
occupation feels like a more likely guess than, say, a tradesman. This guess may 
often turn out to be right, and so the heuristic often serves us well. However, it is 
unreliable and can lead us into error. It can dangerously ignore so-called base rates; 
for example, the fact that there are many more managers than librarians and Tony 
is therefore much more likely to be a manager than a librarian. If you knew abso-
lutely nothing about Tony except that he was a man in his thirties, and were still 
asked to guess his occupation, you would be much more likely to say he is a 
manager than a librarian. 
The tendency to pay insufficient regard to base rates because of the representa-
tiveness heuristic is illustrated by the conjunction fallacy. Here is an example of the 
representativeness heuristic

people are placed in 
categories based on their 
similarity or resemblance to 
the category.

conjunction fallacy – let us say that, after a while, you also notice that your neigh-
bour Tony uses a hemp bag and cycles everywhere rather than driving. This, on 
top of everything else you know about him, is likely to tempt you into thinking 
he is not only a librarian but also an environmentalist. This is because he appears 
to be representative of both categories. Indeed, Tversky and Kahneman (1983) 
showed that when equipped with this kind of information, people indicated that 
conjunctions (that is, statements that suggest that people are a member of two 
categories), such as ‘Tony is an environmentalist librarian’, were judged more 
likely than either of the single statements, ‘Tony is a librarian’, or ‘Tony is an 
environmentalist’. Logically, however, this cannot be correct. Each statement 
might be wrong, and if either is wrong, then the conjunction is wrong. If Tony is 
not an environmentalist, or he is not a librarian, then he is not an environmentalist 
librarian. Thus, the probability of the joint statement being correct can only ever 
be as high as the probability of the less likely single judgement, and it will be 
lower so long as the other statement is not 100 per cent guaranteed to be accurate.
Bodenhausen (1990) obtained results that are consistent with the notion that we 
use heuristics especially when we lack the cognitive resources to think through 
our judgements thoroughly. He asked participants a set of standard questions to 
determine their chronotype, in other words, whether they are a ‘morning’ person 
who is at their most alert and clear-minded in 
the earlier part of the day, or an ‘evening’ person 
who is at their peak later in the day. He then put 
them through a test of the conjunction fallacy in 
the morning or afternoon, where participants 
were asked to make judgements based on infor-
mation such as that given above in the example 
of Tony. Consistent with previous research, the 
majority of participants committed the error. 
However, participants were more likely to do it 
when they were not at their best time of day 
(e.g., ‘evening’ people taking part at 9am), and 
less likely to do it when the time of day suited 
them (e.g., ‘evening’ people taking part at 8pm). 
In a second experiment, Bodenhausen (1990) 
found that participants, at their ‘wrong’ time of 
day, were also more likely to rely on ethnic stereotypes when judging the guilt or 
innocence of a suspect (Figure 3.13). Under some circumstances, we may lean on 
stereotypes, just as we lean on the representativeness heuristic, when we do not 
have the cognitive resources to think more rationally. Bodenhausen’s (1990) study 
also highlights the dependence of mind upon body – a major theme emerging in 
social psychology over the past few years.

CriTiCAl FOCuS
The conjunction fallacy
as we discussed in Chapter 1, human beings are unlike 
other objects of scientific study – fruit flies or molecules, 
for example – in a very important respect, which is that 
they actively think about the experimental procedure they 
are undergoing, and tend to wonder why the 
experimenter is presenting them with the tasks and 
materials of the experiment. If you are a participant in a 
conjunction fallacy study, there is a good chance you will 
wonder, consciously or unconsciously, why the 
experimenter is telling you all this information that makes 
tony look like both an environmentalist and a librarian. 
You are likely to infer they are making the case that tony is 
both. otherwise, the experimenter would seem to be 
breaking the rules of normal conversation by presenting 
you with irrelevant information. For example, if they do 
not want you to infer that tony is an environmentalist, 
why are they telling you about his hemp bags and green 
transport habits? 
Dulany and hilton (1991) found evidence that the 
conjunction fallacy not only (or even necessarily) reveals 
something profound about the erroneous processing of 
probabilities. It also shows that participants follow normal 
conversational rules by inferring that the experimenter is 
suggesting to them that people (e.g., tony) belong to both 
categories (e.g., environmentalist, librarian). Indeed, 
slugoski and Wilson (1998) measured participants’ 
conversational skills, reasoning that some people are better 
at understanding and following the rules of conversation 
than others. they found that those with better 
conversational skills were more prone to the conjunction 
fallacy and other apparent errors of judgement. using good 
conversational logic and reading between the lines of what 
an expert is telling you about tony may be a more effective, 
more social way to learn about your social environment 
than relying on base rate probabilities. 
other criticisms of the idea that people neglect base 
rates were put forward by koehler (1996). one of 
koehler’s criticisms is that our social environment is full 
of rich and highly informative cues that sometimes tell 
us more than base rates ever could. some of the cues in 
the conjunction fallacy are also so strong that they 
change the way the logic of probability should be 
applied. let us say that tony gives you two business 
cards. one is for his job as a librarian, the other for his 
role as an advocate in an environmentalist organization. 
You then have reasonably certain information that tony 
is, indeed, both an environmentalist and a librarian. It is 
now less likely he is an environmentalist but not a 
librarian, because this would mean he is lying to you, 
and has gone to the trouble of giving you an invalid 
business card. although the cues we considered before 
(e.g., the hemp bag, the cycling, the librarian-like 
demeanour) may be less certain than, say, business 
cards, if you have enough of them, you can become 
increasingly convinced that it is more likely that tony 
belongs to both categories and not just one of them. In 
sum, the representativeness heuristic may be more 
reliable, in everyday life, than the use of base rates, 
which tversky and kahneman (1983) supposed to be 
more rational. however, it seems relatively clear that 
participants do not have such rich information in studies 
like tversky and kahneman’s (1983). thus, in these 
studies, it is reasonable to describe their judgement that 
tony must be an environmentalist and a librarian as a 
fallacy, based on the apparent representativeness of 
tony as a member of both categories. even participants’ 
reliance on the normal logic of conversation in such 
studies (Dulany and hilton, 1991; slugoski and Wilson, 
1998) can be described as a normally useful but 
sometimes misleading heuristic. 
Questions
1 given that in everyday life we don’t always have access 
to the information we need to make robust logical or 
statistical inferences, would you say that all our social 
cognitive processes are heuristic? 
2 Imagine you say: ‘I reckon tony’s an environmentalist 
and a librarian’, and an obnoxious student in your class 
mocks you for committing the conjunction fallacy. 
Instead, they say: ‘tony’s a librarian, but not an 
environmentalist.’ Is their statement any more likely to 
be true than yours? Is their statement really any 
different from a conjunction fallacy?

The social perceiver
The availability heuristic
The availability heuristic is based on how available certain knowledge or ideas are 
to us when we make judgements – how fluently they come to mind. It is also 
known as the ease-of-use heuristic. A good illustration of the availability heuristic 
is to be seen in the aftereffects of seeing a good, scary film. People often enjoy 
‘freaking out’ their friends after such films by playing tricks on them – jumping 
out of doorways at them and so on. Our readiness to interpret normally innocent 
stimuli such as strange or sudden noises, shadows and so on after seeing scary 
films is, in part, because scary interpretations of these stimuli are more mentally 
available to us. Thus, ‘it’s a monster’ and other ideas – normally so far-fetched 
that they never occur to us – are much more at the forefront of our minds. Partly 
because the idea of monsters is so readily available, we assume, probably uncon-
sciously, that it is plausible. 
Schwarz, Bless, Strack et al. (1991) conducted one of the most well-known and 
compelling demonstrations of how the availability heuristic influences our 
thinking. To help you really get inside the logic of their experiment, we invite you 
to do the Try it yourself exercise below. It’s worth the effort. Once you are 
finished, read on.
Try it yourself on a blank screen or piece of paper, write down 6 times you have been friendly, then 12 times you 
have been assertive. after doing this task, how friendly would you say you are? and how assertive? 
Did you notice how difficult it is? The first few examples of assertiveness prob-
ably came easily, and then it became increasingly difficult. It would be understand-
able if you gave up at some point without generating all 12 examples. Schwarz et al. 
(1991) ensured that all their participants generated exactly the number of examples 
as they were instructed. Fortunately for some of their participants, they were not 
asked to generate as many as 12. Instead, they only had to generate 6. The number 
of examples (6 or 12) was the key independent variable in these experiments. The 
dependent variable was simple – participants were asked to rate how assertive they 
are. Intuitively, you might think that after generating 12 rather than only 6 exam-
ples of being assertive, participants would see themselves as more assertive. After 
all, they have just produced twice as much evidence of their assertiveness. But, in 
fact, participants saw themselves as less assertive after generating 12, rather than 6, 
examples of their assertiveness. Similarly, participants who were asked to recall 12 
(versus 6) unassertive behaviours rated themselves as less unassertive. 
These results appear to show that people were led to believe they were unasser-
tive (or assertive) because they had found it difficult to remember occasions in 
which they had acted accordingly. In another of Schwarz et al.’s (1991) studies, 
participants were convinced that their childhood was less happy after being asked 
to recall more, rather than less, happy memories. This is exactly in keeping with 
the availability heuristic. If evidence for an idea is difficult to bring to mind, people 
infer that the idea is less plausible. This is, essentially, a causal attribution as we

have been discussing throughout this chapter, that is: ‘It’s hard to remember times 
I was assertive because I’m not an assertive person.’ 
One of Schwarz et al.’s (1991) experiments provided clear evidence for the 
attributional processes underlying the availability heuristic. In addition to asking 
participants to generate either 6 or 12 assertive or unassertive behaviours, they 
were told either that most participants in a previous task had found this task diffi-
cult or easy. The rationale for this manipulation was participants should read more 
into their ease or difficulty of retrieval if they think it is unusual. If they think 
everyone finds the task similarly easy or difficult, then the effort they’re expending 
probably won’t seem to say anything about their assertiveness. The diagnostic 
condition provides participants with an alternative attribution for their difficulty 
in recalling many examples of being assertive, that is: ‘It’s not because I’m unasser-
tive: others found this a difficult task too.’ Under these conditions, participants 
who were asked to generate 12 examples of being assertive no longer assumed 
they were less assertive. If anything, the findings suggested that the more examples 
you listed, the more assertive you saw yourself as (see Figure 3.14).

Exploring further the trick of manipulating the availability heuristic has been used widely in research to 
influence people’s beliefs about a range of topics. Can you find any more examples? You could use google scholar or 
another database (scopus, Web of science) to find articles that have cited the paper by schwarz et al. (1991). search 
through the titles and abstracts until you find papers that have used their methodology. alternatively, you could 
search for combinations of terms like ‘availability heuristic’, ‘recall’ and ‘number of instances’.
The anchoring and adjustment heuristic
As we have seen, people have an amazing, although not infallible, ability to make 
quick, reasonably accurate, initial judgements on the basis of very little informa-

137
The social perceiver
tion. According to Tversky and Kahneman (1974), we use these initial judgements 
as an anchor for our later judgements – the anchoring and adjustment heuristic. In 
other words, our first judgement is the one that, to a large extent, we stick with, 
making adjustments on the basis of later information. Let us say the first time you 
visit London, the streets are full of rubbish, and you do not visit some of the most 
attractive, well-kept areas of the city. Having made this first impression, it is hard 
to shake it off, even if you later come across lots of pieces of information suggesting 
that London really is a reasonably tidy place. Perhaps the refuse collectors had 
been on strike that day, and it had been one of the busiest shopping days of the 
year. Even if you see some statistics that support the idea that London is not an 
especially dirty city, it is likely that you are going to stick, somewhat, with your 
initial impression (Gilovich, Medvec and Savitsky, 2000).
This heuristic is often exploited by retailers. Imagine, for example, that you are 
on holiday and see a coat in a store that you really like, priced at €200. It is just a 
little more than you can afford, so, reluctantly, you put it back on the rack and 
walk out. You visit another store and see the same coat priced at €150. Seems like a 
good buy, right? There is every chance that you will now buy it. However, if the 
first store had been charging €100 for the coat, you would feel that the €150 price 
is excessive. This is because the first price you came across for the coat – either 
€100 or €200, is the anchor by which you judge other information. It is only 
slowly, through multiple experiences, that you would revise your impression of 
how much the coat is really worth. It is possible to apply these principles to a 
cause other than pure profit. One can manipulate the price people are willing to 
pay for an environmental cause using the logic of anchoring and adjustment. If led 
to believe that a large investment was necessary, then people are more willing later 
to pay a lesser, although still large, amount (Knetsch, 2010). 
This also has a clear application to negotiation (Pruitt, 1981; Rubin and Brown, 
1975). If you want to obtain a good price, start with a low, even insulting offer. So 
long as the vendor does not immediately walk away from the deal having taken 
offence, this initial low offer will advantage you by serving as the ‘anchor’ by 
which subsequent prices are judged. The adjustments made to the starting price 
will result in a better deal, for you, than if a higher offer were later adjusted 
(Benton, Kelley and Liebling, 1972; Northcraft and Neale, 1987; Ritov, 1996).
Other biases and errors in social cognition
Heuristics illustrate the duality of human beings discussed in the opening to this 
chapter. Human beings are very clever, in the sense that they use reasoning strate-
gies that generally get them through the many social cognitive challenges of their 
everyday lives, but they are also not so clever, in that these strategies can seri-
ously let them down. There are a number of other social cognitive errors that 
reflect this duality. People are prone to any number of biases and errors, because 
they use strategies that make a certain kind of sense, or help them cope with the 
demands of their lives. Creative thinking by experimental social psychologists

exposes these strategies by catching participants in the act of making major, and 
sometimes amusing, errors. 
Negativity bias
As we mentioned earlier, the valence (positivity or negativity) of information is 
important, and in particular, negative information tends to hold more weight in 
person perception than positive information (Fiske, 1980). Again, it is assumed 
that this is the case because negative information is more attention-grabbing. In 
particular, negative information may appear more distinctive or extreme and 
therefore attract more attention (e.g., Skowronski and Carlston, 1989). Negative 
information therefore tends to be more diagnostic of the target than positive infor-
mation. Unfortunately, once negative information has been presented and this 
influences the overall impression that is formed, it is difficult to defuse the nega-
tive information. Even presenting a multitude of positive information may not be 
enough to reverse a negative impression (e.g., Hamilton and Zanna, 1974). There-
fore, information valence is an important feature in impression formation. The 
bias towards negative information is pervasive, and makes a certain kind of sense. 
Being predisposed to see the worst in people, animals and other objects has always 
helped us to avoid disease, poisoning, being killed or eaten. Whether fortunately 
or unfortunately, it also helps people to protect their cultural norms and values by 
sanctioning and removing the ‘bad apples’ who threaten them. According to one 
review, negative things, be they people, events or traits, are seen as more conta-
gious than good things (Rozin and Royzman, 2001). 
Hindsight bias: the things that happened had to have happened
You may remember an occasion when you heard the result of a sporting match, 
election or some other competitive event. After hearing what happened, you said 
to yourself: ‘Well, that was predictable!’ But was it predictable, or is what you 
experienced the result of another common social psychological bias? In such a 
case, it is likely that the experience is an example of the hindsight bias – the tendency 
for people to exaggerate how much they could have predicted an outcome after it 
happened, which we discussed briefly in Chapter 1 with respect to people’s 
perceptions of the predictability of social psychological findings (Choi and 
Nisbett, 2000; Fischhoff, 1975; Richard, Bond and Stokes-Zoota, 2001; Slovic and 
Fischhoff, 1977; Werth, Strack and Förster, 2002). Also known as the ‘I knew it all 
along’ phenomenon, the hindsight bias means that outcomes can seem inevitable 
and predictable once the outcome is known. In particular, people see the outcome 
as having been in line with their expectations, no matter what the outcome was. In 
other words, a completely different outcome would also be interpreted as being in 
line with one’s expectations (Hawkins and Hastie, 1990). 
Many studies have documented the hindsight bias. For example, Arkes, 
Wortman, Saville and Harkness (1981) showed that doctors were more likely to 
indicate they knew an uncommon diagnosis to be correct if told they were correct 
than if they were not. The bias has also been shown in legal settings (e.g., Casper, 
Hindsight bias the tendency 
for people to exaggerate 
how much they could have 
predicted the outcome after it 
happened.

The social perceiver
Benedict and Perry 1989; Harley, 2007). A study by Carli (1999) demonstrated the 
potential power of the hindsight bias. In this study, student participants read about 
a dating scenario between a pair called Barbara and Jack that ended in one of two 
ways – either with a marriage proposal or with a rape. The stories were identical in 
every respect except for the final line. Nevertheless, people saw the ending – based 
on the details of the story – as predictable in both situations. Two weeks later, the 
participants were also more likely to rate sentences as having been part of the 
story (when they were not), to the extent that the statement was consistent with 
the outcome of the story. For example, people were more likely to agree that state-
ments such as ‘Jack was a drinker’ appeared in the rape story rather than the 
marriage proposal story. Likewise, they were more likely to agree that statements 
such as ‘Jack gave Barbara roses’ appeared in the marriage proposal story rather 
than the rape story. Therefore, people’s tendency to process information in this 
biased manner may influence how they understand and interpret important events.
As we mentioned earlier, the hindsight bias also influences how people perceive 
real events. For example, Bryant and Guilbault (2002) examined people’s predic-
tions about whether US President Clinton would be convicted in his impeachment 
trial in 1999. After the trial, where he was found not guilty, participants reported 
that they knew all along what would happen. This judgement was made even 
though before the announcement of the acquittal, participants reported feeling 
that a conviction was likely. Thus, even when people report being unsure before-
hand, they still report that they knew what would ‘happen all along’ when they 
know the outcome. 
Various factors have been found to influence the hindsight bias. For example, 
Roese and Olson (1996) showed that hindsight biases are more likely to occur for 
negative outcomes than positive outcomes. They argued that this is the case 
because negative events tend to trigger more sense-making cognitions such as 
counterfactual thinking (imagining alternatives to reality, or how things might have 
been different) and causal attributions. Other researchers have found that it is 
possible to attenuate the hindsight bias under certain conditions. For example, 
Arkes, Faust, Guilmette and Hart (1988) showed that people succumbed to the 
hindsight bias less if they were asked to provide at least one reason for the event. 
Arguably, if people are asked to provide concrete reasons, perhaps they have to 
rely less on ‘filling the gaps’. Casper, Benedict and Perry (1989) observed hind-
sight biases in jury decision making and found that pre-existing attitudes also 
influence the extent to which people succumb to the hindsight bias (see also 
Harley, 2007). 
What causes the hindsight bias? Hoffrage, Hertwig and Gigerenzer (2000) 
argued that the bias may be adaptive. Specifically, after receiving feedback about 
an event, people update their knowledge, which leads them to exaggerate the 
extent to which they knew the result. For example, after finding out that her 
boyfriend cheated on her, a young woman has learned something about her 
boyfriend – that he is not terribly faithful. Armed with this new and unfortunate 
knowledge, his cheating on her does not seem to be so surprising (see Figure 3.15).

Thinking and feeling
In another series of studies, 
Nestler, Blank and von Collani 
(2008) found that people who 
were under conditions of high 
cognitive load were more likely 
to 
commit 
hindsight 
bias, 
suggesting that the psycholog-
ical processes required to make 
accurate, non-biased judge-
ments about outcomes require 
effort. Other researchers have 
argued that motivations may 
affect hindsight bias. People want to feel that events, especially negative events, are 
within their control, so that they can obtain some sense of optimism about the 
future. Thus, they tend to be less prone to hindsight bias following negative rather 
than positive events (Pezzo and Beckstead, 2008; Pezzo and Pezzo, 2007). 
Exploring further there may be other causes of hindsight bias. use an internet search engine or psychology 
articles database to see if you can identify other reasons why it may be useful to have ‘known it all along’.
Question to consider reread question 3 at the start of the chapter. Why do you think people often say that social 
psychology findings are ‘obvious’? as an exercise, think of a classic study in social psychology and make some 
arguments for why the findings were not predictable. 
Confirmation bias
People tend to seek and to notice information that confirms their beliefs more 
than information that disconfirms their beliefs. They will even go so far as to 
ignore information that disconfirms their beliefs. This tendency is called the confir-
mation bias (Trope and Thompson, 1997). Alternatively, they may ask questions 
designed to confirm expectations. For example, if you meet a person from France 
for the first time, you might ask them about their love of cheese and red wine, or if 
you meet someone from Australia, you might ask them questions about going to 
the beach. Restricting the amount of information a person is able to provide 
enables expectations and stereotypes to be confirmed. Perceivers can therefore 
seek out information that confirms what they think.
Research by Westen, Blagov, Harenski et al. (2006) demonstrated that people 
interpret information about others in ways that confirm their political leanings. 
During the 2004 presidential election in the USA, participants from both the 
Democrat and Republican ‘sides’ were shown multiple statements about the 
Democratic candidate John Kerry, the Republican candidate George W. Bush, or a 
neutral public figure. Sometimes, these seemed to expose contradictions in what 
these politicians had said. For example, Mr Bush was reported as saying that Ken

(or even ignore) information 
that disconfirms one’s beliefs.

The social perceiver
Lay, the CEO of Enron, was a great friend of his, but later, after the scandalous 
collapse of Enron, he denied knowing him. The researchers found that the contra-
dictory information was evaluated differently depending on the pre-existing 
political leanings of the participants. Specifically, participants were much more 
likely to interpret statements as genuinely revealing a contradictory stance by the 
politician concerned if they were personally opposed to them. In this way, partici-
pants interpreted information in ways that confirmed their original beliefs. A 
further aspect of this study is that participants’ evaluations were carried out while 
they were in an MRI scanner, which monitors brain activity. As participants rated 
apparently contradictory statements about their preferred candidate (but not an 
opposing candidate), emotional centres in the brain were aroused. The authors 
concluded that their results capture an active, emotion-laden process of dealing 
with information that is contradictory to one’s beliefs. 
Evaluation by association
As we have seen, people use associations between things to learn about causal rela-
tionships in their environment – if X and Y co-occur, there is a chance that X is 
causing Y. Indeed, this associative reasoning is the essence of how animals learn, and 
has been recognized by psychologists since Pavlov conceived the principles of clas-
sical conditioning in the 19th century. The human mind is largely associative – 
people who associate with each other are seen as having similar properties, and 
positive or negative perceptions of one stimulus can ‘rub off’ onto our impressions 
of another stimulus that is associated with it in our minds. Our associative minds, of 
course, are gleefully exploited by advertisers, who seek to pair a product or brand 
with positive associations, such as attractive models, values or lifestyles. Our asso-
ciative minds can also lead us to like or dislike people by the mere fact of association. 
For example, relatives and friends of mentally ill or overweight people experience 
stigma by association, being devalued because of their association with a stigmatized 
individual. This happens among children as well as adults (Latner, Roseall and 
Simmonds, 2007), and can have negative consequences for the psychological health 
of the targets of stigma by association (Östman and Kjellin, 2002). It may be that 
sometimes there is a logic behind stigma by association. People who are related to 
stigmatized individuals, or who choose to spend time in their company, really may 
be more likely to share some of their characteristics. However, stigma by association 
is, sometimes, simply unfounded. Hebl and Mannix (2003), for example, found that 
male job applicants were denigrated simply because they were seated next to an 
overweight (vs. normal weight) woman while waiting to be interviewed. This ‘mere 
proximity’ version of stigma by association was found regardless of whether partici-
pants had anti-fat attitudes, whether they thought they knew them, or whether they 
were described as a highly intelligent, award-winning student. 
The associative nature of impression formation has an important implication – 
be careful what you say about others. Mud sticks, but it sticks to the person 
throwing the mud, as well as the person getting hit by it. Building on their earlier 
work on spontaneous inference (Carlston and Skowronski, 1994), Skowronski, 
Stigma by association the 
tendency for people to 
devalue someone because 
of their association with a 
stigmatized individual.

142
Thinking and feeling
Carlston, Mae and Crawford (1998) introduced an ingenious twist. In their new 
experiments, participants were presented with a photograph of a person, with a 
caption indicating how they described the behaviour of someone else. For 
example, imagine one of the photos was of you, describing something one of your 
friends did. Later, people associated the trait implied by the behaviours with the 
person who had described them – not only with the person who had done them. 
They labelled this phenomenon spontaneous trait transference. This is another 
social cognitive bias that happens automatically – it is dependent on ‘linking’ 
things together associatively, rather than ‘thinking’ about them consciously and 
logically. Sometimes, therefore, what you say about others says something – to 
others – about you (see also Douglas and Sutton, 2006). 
Projection and false consensus
It is difficult to know what others are thinking or feeling, or to predict what they 
are going to do. One of the tricks we have up our sleeves is projection. Projection is 
the process by which we attribute our own characteristics (be they attitudes, 
emotions, habits or traits) to other people. This concept made its way into social 
psychology through the writings of Freud, who saw projection as a defence 
mechanism – a way of denying that one has unwanted needs or desires by attrib-
uting them to other people. However, social psychologists do not use the term in 
this way any more. It is used as a way of solving a social cognitive problem – 
working other people out on the basis of limited information – rather than a way 
of denying one’s own nature. 
To illustrate, Douglas and Sutton (2011) asked British undergraduates to eval-
uate 17 conspiracy theories, such as the theory that the Apollo moon landings 
were faked, or that Princess Diana was murdered. The more highly participants 
had earlier scored on a measure of the trait of Machiavellianism – an amoral will-
ingness to exploit others – the more they were inclined to endorse these conspiracy 
theories (seeing them as true, plausible, coherent, interesting and worth consid-
ering). The relationship between Machiavellianism and endorsement of these 
conspiracy theories was mediated or driven by personal willingness to conspire. 
In short, Machiavellian participants were more likely to indicate that they would 
personally play a part in conspiracies such as the murder of Princess Diana, and, 
for this reason, were more likely to see conspiracy theories as believable. In a 
second study, Douglas and Sutton asked half their participants to recall a time 
when they had helped another person out. The intention was to make these 
participants feel a little more moral and thus less willing to conspire than the 
control group. As predicted, participants who recalled helping someone out were 
less willing to take part in conspiracies and, as a result, were less likely to find 
conspiracy theories to be true, plausible, coherent and so on (see Figure 3.16).

The social perceiver
Magical thinking
Research suggests that people are susceptible to what is known as magical thinking – 
thinking based on assumptions that are not rational, but are still compelling 
(Rozin and Nemeroff, 1990). For example, many hold the belief that when two 
objects touch each other, they pass on properties to each other (law of contagion). 
Also, many believe that objects that resemble each other share fundamental prop-
erties (law of similarity). Thinking about social events can, therefore, be suscep-
tible to magical thinking. Rozin, Millman and Nemeroff (1986) demonstrated how 
people’s behaviour is influenced by these laws of magical thinking – also known as 
sympathetic magic. For example, they showed that laundered shirts previously 
worn by a disliked person were less desirable than those previously worn by a 
neutral or liked person. Rozin et al. also demonstrated that people are less accurate 
at throwing darts at photographs of liked (versus disliked) individuals. 
Also, as we saw in Chapter 2, people’s need for control means that they some-
times see connections between events, even if these connections seem rather 
magical and unrealistic. Sometimes, these cognitions are related to person percep-
tion. For example, Pronin, Wegner, McCarthy and Rodriguez (2006) had partici-
pants perceive that they had harmed another person using a voodoo hex. The 
connection between the hex and the harm caused to the other person was seen as 
stronger if the participant had first been induced to harbour evil thoughts towards 
the victim. Thus, magical thinking and superstition play a part in how we view 
others and the social world. 
Exploring further ‘harry potter films “boost magical thinking” in children’, according to subbotsky, hysted and 
Jones (2010). they found that children who watched extracts from these films were more creative, solving problems 
more easily and creatively (e.g., ‘I would fly away on my broomstick’) than children who did not view the extracts 
(e.g., ‘I would run away’). perhaps try to find the article in your own time and think about some of the possible 
implications of these findings for social cognition in children.
The nature of social cognition
As we have seen in this chapter and also Chapter 2, there are plenty of reasons to 
doubt the view that people are always rational, conscious thinkers. In this section, 
we consider research showing that much of our social cognition seems to happen 
outside our conscious awareness. Second, much of our social cognition seems to 
happen outside the self altogether. Further, social cognition is not only done indi-
vidually, but also collectively. It is therefore important to outline what is ‘social’ 
about social cognition. 
Automatic versus controlled social cognition
Historically, people have been thought to be largely in control of their behaviour, 
making conscious decisions about what to do. But as we saw in Chapter 2, people’s 
thoughts, feelings and behaviours are often influenced by factors they are unaware 
Magical thinking thinking 
based on non-rational 
assumptions about the ability 
of events to affect each 
other in ways that cannot be 
accounted for by the known 
laws of physics. 

144
Thinking and feeling
of (Nisbett and Wilson, 1977), people erroneously think their behaviour is influ-
enced by things that do not affect it (e.g, Leavitt and Christenfeld, 2011), and are 
prone to thinking they intentionally did things they didn’t do (Wegner and 
Wheatley, 1999). Over the centuries, the importance of unconscious thoughts, 
feelings and decisions has been highlighted by religion and literature. However, 
Freud was the first to place the unconscious centre stage in psychology. Freud’s 
ideas largely fell out of favour in experimental psychology and, with it, main-
stream social psychology. However, since the 1970s, researchers have paid 
increasing attention to the aspects of people’s mental and social lives that happen 
outside their awareness. Now, as we shall see throughout this book, many find-
ings highlight the importance of the unconscious on our social lives – on topics as 
diverse as aggression, persuasion, intergroup relations, and the environment. 
A number of theories in social psychology have distinguished between 
controlled processing – thoughts, feelings and emotions we would describe as 
conscious in the traditional sense – and automatic processing, which we would not. 
There are four features that, together, define whether a psychological process is 
automatic or controlled:
1 Awareness: People are often unaware of stimuli that are influencing them. As 
we shall read below, people can be influenced by visual stimuli or subliminal 
primes on a computer screen, that is, those they did not consciously notice. In 
other instances, they may be aware of a stimulus, but unaware that it is influ-
encing their behaviour (remember in Chapter 2 how Nisbett and Wilson’s 
shoppers preferred items on the right of a display, but did not realize it).
2 Intention: Some psychological processes may happen without us intending to 
start them. For example, studies have shown that sitting behind an impressive 
desk causes people to pursue power over others, without being aware of their 
goal (Chen, Lee-Chai and Bargh, 2001). 
3 Controllability: Some psychological processes are difficult for people to stop 
or prevent. Sometimes, this is simply because they are unaware of those proc-
esses. But in other cases, such as when they engage in unwanted stereotyping 
of other groups, people find it difficult to stop, as we shall see in Chapter 12 
(Devine, 1989). 
4 Efficiency: An automatic process does not require conscious attention, whereas 
a controlled process does. Think back to Gilbert and Osborne’s (1989) study of 
the correspondence bias, encountered earlier in the chapter. People were prone 
to the bias only when under cognitive load – when their conscious attention 
was consumed by another task. When their attention was free to focus on 
forming an impression of stimulus persons, they were not prone to the bias. 
This suggested that the processes that led to the correspondence bias are auto-
matic, and the processes that correct the bias are controlled. 
Theories that distinguish between automatic and controlled processes are 
known as dual process theories. However, it is important to note that the distinc-

145
The social perceiver
tion is not as sharp as you might think. Bargh (1994) 
described awareness, intention, controllability and 
efficiency as the four jointly sufficient conditions – or 
the four horsemen – of automaticity (see Figure 3.17). 
He also noted that there are few, if any, cases in which 
interesting social psychological processes meet all 
four criteria for automaticity (see also Kahneman and 
Treisman, 1984). You may intend to form an impres-
sion of another person, for example, but be unaware of how you do it. Walking 
down the street is an efficient process, in the sense that it is so learned that you do 
not need to consciously think about it most of the time, but at the same time you 
can control it, that is, you can stop it if you want to. Thus, most psychological 
processes can be said to have both automatic and controlled features. 
That said, there are some truly remarkable demonstrations of automaticity in 
social psychology. Studies using the technique of priming – activating associations 
in memory – give social psychologists insight into how our thoughts can influence 
other thoughts, and even our behaviours. One well-known example is a study by 
Bargh, Chen and Burrows (1996), who asked participants to complete a sentence 
containing words such as ‘retired’, ‘wrinkle’ and ‘sentimental’. After doing so, the 
experimenters observed participants walking down the corridor as they left the 
laboratory and found that those who had been primed with age-related words 
moved more slowly. In another study, Chen and Bargh (1997) presented photo-
graphed faces of Black men to White university students so quickly (13 ms) that 
the participants did not notice them. Later, these participants behaved in a more 
hostile way towards an interaction partner while playing a collaborative game. 
The rationale is that a ‘Black men are hostile’ stereotype, current in the USA, 
activated the concept of hostility and so caused participants to behave in a hostile 
way. Indeed, much of our thinking and behaving is influenced by events or obser-
vations of which we are not aware, and, as such, much of our social cognition is 
implicit rather than explicit.

Experimental control and replication
the classic studies by Bargh, Chen and Burrows (1996) 
produced some of the most widely cited and striking 
results in social psychology in recent decades. however, 
relatively few direct replications of these results have 
been published. recently, a Belgian team of researchers 
published the results of two attempts to replicate the 
Bargh et al. (1996) study, in which participants had walked 
more slowly after being primed with an elderly stereotype 
(Doyen, klein, pichon and Cleeremans, 2012). Closely 
following the method of the original study, they observed 
no effect. however, in their second study, they did observe 
the original effect when the research assistant running the 
study was led to expect that participants would walk 
slower after being exposed to the elderly stereotype. they 
concluded that unconscious priming effects were likely to 

146
Thinking and feeling
explain Bargh et al.’s original effects, but not in the way 
that Bargh et al. thought. participants appeared to walk 
more slowly, because they had unconsciously been 
influenced by the expectations of the experimenter, not by 
the elderly prime. If Doyen et al. are right, the participants 
in their study (and perhaps Bargh et al.’s) were remarkably 
similar to Clever hans – picking up and conforming to 
subtle cues in the experimenter’s behaviour. this is a 
classic case of a ‘demand characteristic’ in experimental 
social psychology (see Chapter 1). Further research is 
required to determine whether the original studies of 
Bargh et al. (1996) are replicable without such instructions 
to the experimenter, and, indeed, whether the findings of 
Doyen et al. (2012) are themselves replicable. 
this points to a couple of problems inherent in 
mainstream social psychology. the first is that without 
careful experimental control, experimenters’ biases may 
subtly influence the results of their research, even when 
they are setting out to collect data in a scrupulously 
honest and professional way. researchers, like 
participants themselves, are prone to automatic social 
thought, emotion and behaviour that can influence their 
findings. more generally, in principle, there is always – or 
almost always – another way to explain a given finding 
than that put forward by the researchers who obtained it. 
the second problem is that biases in the publication 
process, combined with the way researchers use statistics 
to test their ideas, can lead to overconfidence in the results 
of published findings. as noted in Chapter 1, every finding 
could arise from chance alone – so, in principle, the results 
of Bargh et al.’s studies, like those of any other studies, 
could have been a ‘fluke’. 
In sciences like social psychology, researchers try to 
reduce the risk of making false conclusions by subjecting 
their results to significance testing, which determines how 
likely it is that a given result could have emerged by 
chance alone. generally speaking, the results are seen as 
signifying a ‘real’ effect rather than a ‘fluke’ if p < .05, that 
is, if there is less than a 5 per cent or 1 in 20 possibility that 
the results could have happened by chance. the problem 
is, run a study 20 times over, and even if there is no ‘real 
effect’, chances are you will observe a significant result,  
p < .05, at some point. In general, it is hard to publish ‘null 
effects’, where the difference between conditions or the 
relationship between variables is not statistically 
significant. one reason for this is that journals want to 
showcase new and eye-catching findings; another is that 
null effects can be hard to interpret (was the idea wrong? 
were the methods inappropriate?). Yet another reason is 
that when a finding has been shown to be significant 
before, a failed attempt to replicate that finding can be 
especially troubling and hard to understand, and so is less 
likely to be accepted by the scientific community. thus, 
instead of seeing the light of day, these findings tend to 
languish, unpublished, in the ‘file drawers’ of researchers. 
this file drawer problem is a major issue in sciences like 
social psychology that rely on significance testing. the 
more unpublished null effects there are, the less confident 
we can be in the published tip of the iceberg. the 
significant published effects need to be seen in the context 
of the number of studies that have failed to replicate 
them – and this number is generally unknown. the 
published effects are increasingly likely to have emerged 
either by chance or because of some unreported aspect of 
the way the original study was done; for example, Doyen 
et al.’s results suggest that the experimenter running the 
studies reported by Bargh et al. may not have been as 
‘blind’ to conditions as was suggested by their written 
account of the methods. 
also, meta-analytic investigations help, where the 
researchers ask their peers to provide them with 
unpublished data, allowing published results to be 
considered in the context of unpublished attempts to 
replicate them. Continued replication is crucial, so that null 
effects can see the light of day. at the time of writing, 
several of our colleagues are embarking on a programme 
of research to attempt to replicate key findings in social 
psychology.

The social perceiver
This distinction between automatic and controlled processes is often 
described using other terms – you will often read about implicit vs. explicit, 
conscious vs. conscious, or heuristic vs. systematic processes. For example, in 
Chapter 4, you will read about the heuristic-systematic model of persuasion, 
which separates the different social cognitive processes that occur when people 
encounter persuasive stimuli. On the one hand, there are the systematic (or 
controlled) processes that involve careful reasoning and close attention to infor-
mation, and on the other, there are the heuristic processes where people do not 
consciously attend to information but use heuristics to process what they see 
(Chaiken, 1987; Chaiken, Liberman and Eagly, 1989). The notion of implicit and 
explicit processes runs throughout the study of social cognition as researchers 
attempt to understand what people can and cannot control about their thinking, 
feeling and acting.
One interesting development in the study of the unconscious side of social 
cognition is the finding that actions often influence thought. For example, a 
growing body of research suggests that the physical movements people engage 
in while they are evaluating stimuli (e.g., objects, people) determine how the 
stimuli are judged. Specifically, engaging in behaviours that typically accompany 
positive attitudes tend to lead people to evaluate stimuli favourably, whereas 
engaging in behaviours that typically accompany negative attitudes tends to lead 
people to rate the stimuli less favourably. For example, Strack, Martin and 
Stepper (1988) asked participants to either hold a pen between their teeth (an 
action that facilitates the use of muscles typically associated with smiling), or 
between their lips (an action that inhibits the use of muscles typically associated 
with smiling). They were then asked to watch a series of cartoons. It was found 
that participants who watched the cartoons under conditions that facilitate the 
smiling muscles rated the cartoons as more humorous than those in the inhib-
iting condition. This kind of effect has come to be known as ‘embodiment’ or 
‘embodied social cognition’. We discuss embodiment and associated research in 
more detail in Chapter 4. 
The social nature of social cognition
What exactly is social about social cognition? Social cognition assumes that ‘real-
world’ social issues and problems (e.g., prejudice) can be understood with respect 
to basic cognitive processes. Thus, the core topic of study for social cognition 
researchers is people, specifically how people think about themselves and other 
people. The discipline is therefore different from cognitive psychology, in that it 
focuses on how people see themselves within their social world, and not just how 
they perceive other ‘things’ such as inanimate objects. Understanding the ‘social’ 
in social cognition relies on the distinction between people and things. People 
perceive their environment and are perceived by others within it. People intention-
ally interact and influence those around them. Crucially, much of social cognition 
is shared. For example, we read about stereotypes earlier in this chapter – gener-

148
Thinking and feeling
alizations about groups and the characteristics of members of groups – and these 
beliefs are shared among many people. The sharedness of social cognition makes 
it inherently social.
By applying cognitive psychology to social phenomena, social cognition offers 
a powerful way to understand such phenomena. However, one drawback is that 
early social cognition neglected many social and emotional aspects of social expe-
riences and it therefore became isolated from other research being carried out in 
social psychology. Many critics of social cognition argued that the area was 
overly reductionist, that is, it reduced complex social phenomena down to their 
most basic cognitive level and there was very little left that was truly social 
(Forgas, 1983; Markus and Zajonc, 1985; Moscovici, 1982; Zajonc, 1989). Markus 
and Zajonc (1985) went so far as to say that the restricted focus on cognition 
would be short-lived. It is true that social cognition has often dealt with social 
phenomena in a rather reductionist way, and recent developments in social 
neuroscience – the study of brain correlates of behaviour (see Chapters 1 and 
15) – are even more reductionist. However, other areas of social cognition are 
much less reductionist and pay closer attention to the social context. For example, 
the way people think about and act towards social groups draws heavily on social 
cognitive theories such as social identity theory (Chapters 10 and 11). How and 
why people comply and conform demonstrates how thinking and behaviour is 
influenced by the social context (Chapter 9). Research on attitudes and persua-
sion shows how behaviour and individuals’ attitudes are heavily influenced by 
social forces (Chapters 4 and 6). Social cognition also now pays closer attention 
to the emotions that people feel in social contexts (Chapter 4). These develop-
ments distinguish social cognition from cognitive psychology, and keep social 
cognition relevant to social psychology as a whole. 
More recently, researchers have been paying increasing attention to how social 
cognition is ‘social’, in the sense that it is done collaboratively, and not just by 
individuals (e.g., Holtgraves and Kashima, 2008; Smith and Collins, 2009; Sutton, 
2010). This is the notion of distributed social cognition. You engage in distributed 
social cognition all the time, even if you’re not aware of it. When you are talking 
about a party or family occasion and ask someone to remind you of the name of 
the person who said something embarrassing, you are engaging in distributed 
memory (memory that is distributed across more than one person, within a social 
network). When you are gossiping (Chapter 5), you are effectively engaging in 
collective person perception, working together to decide who’s clever, trustworthy 
or to be avoided. Stereotypes, group norms and cultural beliefs are all outcomes of 
distributed social cognition, which we will encounter several times throughout 
this book. To study social cognition does not entail a focus on the private mental 
processes of the individual mind.

The social perceiver
Chapter summary
In this chapter, we considered two key social processes in  
social cognition – causal attribution and person perception – 
and discussed various errors that social perceivers can make 
while engaging in these processes. We also discussed the 
nature of social cognition. throughout this chapter, you will 
have learned that:
• social cognition is the study of the cognitive underpinnings 
of social thought and behaviour. 
• Causal attribution – the process of assigning a cause to an 
event – is an important social process that can contribute to 
feelings about the self and others. In many respects, people 
are rational and scientific in the way they explain events, but 
sometimes they are prone to bias, especially when lacking 
time, motivation or information. this can affect all aspects of 
their life, such as their emotional wellbeing, relationships 
and educational performance.
• two well-known ‘errors’ in attribution are the 
correspondence bias (the tendency to attribute behaviours 
to stable, underlying personality traits without sufficient 
evidence) and the actor-observer bias (the tendency for 
actors to attribute their own behaviour to the situation  
and for observers to explain behaviours in terms of 
personality traits). 
• other biases and errors include the self-serving attribution 
bias (the tendency for people to attribute the causes of 
negative events to aspects that deflect blame from the self), 
self-serving biases (seeing the self as better than average), 
unrealistic optimism (viewing outcomes for the self as 
better than outcomes for others), the illusion of control 
(belief that we have more control over the world and the 
things that happen than we actually do), the false consensus 
effect (the tendency to view one’s own behaviours as more 
typical than they really are) and the false uniqueness effect 
(the tendency to see the self as more likely to perform 
positive behaviours and be less biased than others).
• the study of person perception (or impression formation) is 
the study of how people make judgements about others, 
and the information they use to make these judgements.
• asch’s configural model suggests that we form a holistic 
impression of people that integrates a small number of 
important cues. these are known as central and peripheral 
cues. the algebraic model suggests that people assign 
positive and negative valence to various person attributes 
and combine them to make a general evaluation of a 
person. It is generally accepted that people use a weighted 
average of traits to make the impression, but some 
information (especially negative information) tends to be 
weighted more heavily.
• First impressions are quick, accurate and powerful. Factors 
influencing person perception include a person’s physical 
appearance (especially their attractiveness). sometimes, 
traits people observe first tend to be assigned the greatest 
importance (the primacy effect), but they often give more 
attention to information that is observed most recently (the 
recency effect). 
• the notion of associative networks allows social 
psychologists to explain how they integrate and organize 
information about people into memory.
• Because we often lack the processing power to make perfect 
judgements, we often rely on heuristics, or rules of thumb, 
that enable us to make approximate judgements. examples 
of such heuristics are the representative heuristic (people 
are placed into categories based on their resemblance to the 
category), the availability heuristic (where the likelihood of 
an event is based on how quickly knowledge or ideas come 
to mind), the anchoring and adjustment heuristic (where 
inferences are influenced by initial knowledge or 
information), the negativity bias (the tendency to add more 
weight to negative information), the hindsight bias (the 
tendency for people to exaggerate how much they could 
have predicted an outcome after it happened), the 
confirmation bias (the tendency for people to notice 
information that confirms their beliefs and often ignore 
information that disconfirms them) and evaluation by 
association (assigning value to a person because of their 
association with another person).
• other biases include projection (the attribution of our 
characteristics onto other people) and magical thinking 
(thinking based on non-rational assumptions). emotions 
also strongly influence social cognition and behaviour.
• much of our thinking and behaviour is influenced by events 
or observations of which we are not aware. also, our 
thoughts are often influenced by our behaviours so that our 
cognition is ‘embodied’.
• the ‘social’ in social cognition comes from the unique focus 
on how people think about themselves and other people. 
social cognition may sometimes be too reductionist, but 
recent developments have attempted to reintroduce more 
of the ‘social’ in social cognition.
In this chapter, we have focused on how people understand 
the social world. In Chapter 4, we focus on how people judge 
and evaluate the social world. We discuss the core 
psychological topics of attitudes, emotions, social judgement 
and decision making.

Why are morning people morning people?
1 recall from the Critical focus box in Chapter 2 how the ego 
depletion effect may depend on people’s belief that their 
self-control runs out after a while. people who think you run 
out of self-control, end up running out of self-control. Can 
you apply a similar argument to Bodenhausen’s (1990) 
study? might the increased use of stereotypes by ‘evening 
people’ in the morning depend on their belief that they can’t 
think very well in the morning? have a think about this and 
see if you can write down an argument for your position in 
three or fewer sentences.
2 Can you think of a way to measure people’s beliefs in their 
own cognitive capacities at different times of the day? 
propose a questionnaire of three or fewer items.
3 Can you think of a study using the measure you have 
developed? the aim of this study would be to test whether 
people’s beliefs in their own cognitive capacities at different 
times of the day are correlated with their use of stereotypes. 
more generally, we are aiming to test whether morning 
people use stereotypes in the evening (and vice versa), just 
because they think they’re not capable of processing 
information very well at the ‘wrong’ time of day. assume 
that you can use exactly the same measure of stereotyping 
and chronotype as Bodenhausen (1990) used. We are 
interested here in how you use your new measure. 
4 Can you think of a way to manipulate people’s beliefs in 
their cognitive capacities? In other words, can you ‘trick’ a 
morning person into thinking they are clever and complex 
thinkers even in the evening? 
5 Can you think of an experiment (or quasi-experiment) using 
the manipulation you have developed? In other words, can 
you manipulate people’s beliefs in their own cognitive 
capacities at various times of the day, and show that this 
overrides their chronotype?

Student project
Victim blame in stranger and acquaintance rape 
James sims studied as an 
undergraduate student at the 
university of kent and his 
dissertation supervisor was Dr 
robbie sutton. his research 
examined the attributions that 
people make in rape case scenarios. 
We covered the topic of attribution – 
how people explain events and 
behaviours – in this chapter. 
My topic and aims
When I looked at the topic of stranger and acquaintance rape, I 
was shocked at how badly victims are treated, and wanted to 
explore why victims are treated as though they have committed 
the crime themselves. 
the current research on rape attitudes highlights how 
people ascribe a lot of blame to victims when they know their 
attacker, as they are seen as ‘leading them on’ or acting in a 
manner that may suggest they are ‘asking for it’. these shocking 
judgements run through society, and such views appear to have 
been normalized because of the existence of rape myths. these 
attitudes become an issue when a perpetrator is put on trial, as 
members of the jury are likely to have these common 
misconceptions and negative attitudes about the victim, which 
can affect their ability to give a fair and accurate judgement 
based on the evidence provided. It is hard to secure a 
conviction, as the only witnesses in the crime are the two 
people involved: the victim and the perpetrator. acquaintance 
rapes are the most common type of rape, and the difficulty in 
securing a conviction is additionally hampered by the fact that 
consensual sex is more of a possibility between two people 
who are acquainted. 
my study examined the issue of victim blame in stranger and 
acquaintance rape as a function of whether the rape was 
achieved or merely attempted. higher blame for an achieved 
rape was predicted, as just world theory highlights that people 
are likely to struggle with the concept that a person has been a 
victim of a horrific crime for no reason, so tend to reach a 
conclusion that the victim must have done something to 
deserve the attack. In other words, that she must have ‘led him 
on’ or was ‘asking for it’.
My methods
participants were given questionnaires containing a short, easy 
to understand scenario of an alleged rape. the questions that 
followed were quick to complete, and focused on victim and 
perpetrator blame, derogation, likeability and trust violation. 
anoVa and mediation analyses were conducted to explore 
whether victims of rape are blamed after an attempted or an 
achieved rape.
the mediation analyses were challenging, as they had not 
been taught to us at undergraduate level. But having sought 
advice from my supervisor and read up on some articles about 
it, a full mediation analysis was conducted on trust violation, 
which helped explain the relationship between 
acquaintanceship and levels of victim blame. 
My findings and their implications
Initial results indicated that victims were blamed more in a 
stranger rape scenario, and a mediation analysis indicated that 
violation of trust fully mediated the relationship between 
acquaintanceship and levels of victim blame. the analysis 
highlighted that because a victim is entitled to trust someone 
she knows, she is therefore blamed less as a result. this was an 
unexpected finding, which was contrary to current research 
findings. there were no significant effects found regarding rape 
outcome, which was the primary aim of the study.
the results have great repercussions for future research, as 
they highlight that there are some cases in which the traditional 
stranger/acquaintance effect can be reversed. although this 
effect was not originally expected, it was an important finding, 
and I have been able to explore the effect in more detail for my 
msc research this year. When you focus on the idea that a victim 
is entitled to trust someone she knows, then people are far 
more forgiving in their judgements towards her.
My journey
I am just completing my msc thesis. I continued working with 
my supervisor to explore the effects that I found in my final-year 
project, and have explored how trust violation, relationship 
‘baggage’, and behavioural signals can all contribute to flipping 
the stranger/acquaintance effect of victim blame. In other 
words, these factors worked in portraying the victim as less 
blameworthy at higher levels of acquaintanceship. so far, we 
have discovered that relationship ‘baggage’ aggravates how 
much a victim is blamed, and victims are likely to be blamed 
more when they are seen as having a previous relationship 
history with their attacker.

The social perceiver
I have learned a lot from my research. You learn how 
important it is to stick to deadlines, and to seek support and 
guidance if you feel stuck. It teaches you how to work as a 
scientist, and massively extends your knowledge and 
understanding in the subject area. the findings have led to a 
successful and ground-breaking set of results in my msc studies, 
which I also hope to publish in order to contribute to 
psychological research and improve rape victim support.
My advice
the final-year project can feel really daunting at first, and 
especially scary considering how much you need to write. But 
once you start collecting data, it’s a really exciting experience. 
You feel like a true scientist collecting data for your own study, 
which has the potential to become a published paper and can 
make a real-world contribution. If you have concerns, just chat 
to your supervisor or other students. pace yourself, set yourself 
targets and deadlines, and keep in close contact with 
supporting staff. and, most importantly, you are allowed to 
have fun with the process, so relax and enjoy.

In this chapter, we begin by considering the nature of attitudes, values and ideologies. We 
then consider how and why attitudes form and change, and highlight different types of 
attitudes. Further, we consider the distinction between explicit and implicit attitudes and 
then turn our attention to the role of our bodies, and emotions, in our social judgements and 
behaviours. By the end of the chapter, you will have a clear understanding of the important 
roles played by attitudes and emotions in our daily social lives.

Thinking and feeling
The poet E.E. Cummings wrote: ‘Since feeling is first, who pays any attention to 
the syntax of things/will never wholly kiss you.’ This is an eloquent, if offbeat, 
statement of the importance of feeling, passion and preference in the lives of 
human beings. Chapters 2 and 3 were largely devoted to the study of the know­
ledge people have of themselves and others. This chapter is devoted to people’s 
preferences, emotions and gut­level reactions. It is about how people feel about 
their social world, much more than what they know or believe about it. The study 
of preferences, in particular – or ‘attitudes’ as they are called in social psychology – 
is perhaps the most central topic in our discipline. Although most of this chapter 
is concerned with attitudes, we will encounter attitudes in every single chapter in 
this book. The study of attitudes has increasingly been supplemented by the study 
of emotions, and in recent years, the study of how not just our brains but the rest 
of our bodies are implicated in our attitudes and emotions. The poet, perhaps, 
would approve of the focus on feelings and, increasingly, emotions in social 
psychology. And he appeared to anticipate research into the role of our bodies in 
our feelings when, later in the same poem, he wrote: ‘my blood approves,/and 
kisses are a better fate than wisdom.’ 
We begin this chapter by considering what attitudes are, and their relation to 
broader concepts such as values and ideologies. We then consider how and why 
we form attitudes, and what can cause our attitudes to change. Next, we outline 
different types of attitudes, in particular, the important distinction between 
explicit and implicit attitudes – broadly speaking, those we can consciously articu­
late versus those we cannot. We then review recent work on the role of our bodies, 
and our emotions, in our social judgements and behaviours. 
What are attitudes?
Attitudes are typically defined as a person’s evaluations of various aspects of their 
social world (Eagly and Chaiken, 1993; Tesser, 1993; Tesser and Martin, 1996). 
People have attitudes concerning just about everything. For example, people hold 
attitudes about other people, groups of people, food, the weather, education, 
marriage, ideas, books, films  – the list is endless. The thing an attitude is about can 
be described as an attitude object. In general, where an evaluation of an object, 
concept or otherwise can be formed, an attitude will emerge. Of course, such 
evaluations can vary in the extent to which they are favourable or unfavourable. 
For example, we may have a positive attitude towards one group of people but a 
negative attitude towards others. Another way of describing attitudes is that they 
are preferences. Seen this way, we can understand that attitudes are not exclusively 
possessed by human beings. However, human beings appear to be unique in the 
content of their attitudes, and how they can reflect on and express their attitudes. 
As Banaji and Heiphetz (2010, p. 353) put it:
Bundles of preferences characterize every living organism; without them, plants 
would not turn toward the Sun and cockroaches would not run away from it.

The social judge
In us, preferences exist not only in these built­in forms shared with other living 
beings but in distinctly human ways, such as the consciously molded attitudes 
we convey through artistic expression, the moral codes by which we judge our 
worth and failings, or the words we craft to describe imagined utopias. 
Time to reflect Look up the Oxford English Dictionary online or in hard copy, or use a search engine to search 
‘attitude definition’. Apart from the psychological meaning of the word ‘attitude’, what other meaning does the 
word have? this reveals that the psychological meaning of ‘attitude’ is another example of the use of metaphors 
borrowed from the physical sciences. Bear this in mind later in this chapter when we discuss embodied social 
cognition – the relationship between body and mind.
Attitudes are not always straightforwardly positive or negative – they can 
sometimes be mixed or ambivalent (e.g., Glick and Fiske, 1996; Priester and Petty, 
2001). For example, we might perceive chocolate cake to be both tasty and bad for 
us, so our attitudes are at once positive and negative. Attitude ambivalence is an 
important and wide­reaching concept in social psychology. As we saw in Chapter 
2, many people are narcissistic, meaning they have ambivalent attitudes towards 
themselves – at once positive and negative – which can lead them to be defensive, 
constantly seeking praise and validation from others, and reacting aggressively to 
criticism or rejection. As we shall see in Chapter 11, people often have ambivalent 
attitudes towards groups of people, with both negative and positive aspects, which 
can profoundly affect relationships between groups. These are just two examples 
of how attitudes can have important emotional, behavioural and social conse­
quences (Ajzen and Fishbein, 1980; Petty and Krosnick, 1995).
Attitudes can be distinguished from other, related concepts in social psychology. 
Values are enduring, evaluative beliefs about general aspects of life that go beyond 
specific objects and situations (Maio, 2010; Rokeach, 1973). For instance, ‘equality’ 
and ‘happiness’ are examples of personal values that generally transcend specific 
events. Values are organized along a hierarchy from those that are most important 
to those that are least important to the self (Ball­Rokeach, Rockeach and Grube, 
1984). Rokeach (1973) suggested that values are higher order concepts than atti­
tudes; and values that are particularly important to people influence and organize 
their attitudes. For instance, if a person strongly values health and fitness, this is 
likely to influence attitudes to various attitude objects such as exercise, diet and 
drinking alcohol. A person who has positive attitudes towards exercise, dietary 
restraint and drinking in moderation is more likely to engage in these behaviours 
(e.g., Homer and Kahle, 1988). Thus, a person’s values can indirectly influence 
behaviour through their influence on attitudes. In a similar fashion, knowing 
something about a person’s values can help us predict their opinions about justice 
in the world (Feather, 1991). Bardi and Schwarz (2003) found that people’s values 
(e.g., traditional values) were correlated with participants’ self­reported behaviour 
(e.g., following traditions). 
The study of values has revealed important cultural differences. Some cultures 
value conformity, whereas others value self­expression. Roughly, this corresponds

to the individualism–collectivism dimension encountered in Chapter 2. Also, 
people from some cultures value tradition more strongly, whereas in other 
cultures, rational, secular, ‘modern’ ideas are more valued (Esmer and Petterson, 
2007). These are important differences, with implications for whether cultures will 
adopt democratic systems of government. For example, countries with autocratic 
(non­democratic) governments tend to become democratic if their population 
endorses values that are more self­expressive, rational and secular than their 
current system of government would suggest (Inglehart and Welzel, 2005). 
However, recent research has also revealed an apparent human universal – across 
cultures, there appear to be 10 key values (see Figure 4.1). Further, although these 
are endorsed to varying degrees in different cultures, their relationship to each 
other is the same across cultures. In other words, values that are positively (or 
negatively) associated in one culture also tend to be positively (or negatively) 
associated in other cultures (Schwartz, 1992, 2011). 
Try it yourself Can you find which cultures highly value conformity and which highly value self-expression 
(individuality)? try an internet search for the ‘World Values survey’. this global research project publishes an 
excellent pdf brochure online that summarizes its findings for a public audience, and locates different countries and 
regions of the world in terms of their values (Inglehart and Welzel, 2011). You might also want to find, and 
complete, the 21-item version of the schwartz Values survey by means of an internet search. this instrument is often 
used in cross-cultural studies of values and is probably the best example of how values are currently measured.
As well as being more general, values differ from attitudes in other ways. For 
example, people have often thought hard about their attitudes and have come to 
adopt attitudes after much consideration. As we shall see in Chapter 6, attitude 
change following persuasion is often longer lasting and more profound when people 
have really thought about the arguments presented to them. However, people find 
it difficult to articulate the reasoning behind their values. People simply have the 
experience of holding certain values dear without always knowing why. Maio and 
Olson (1995) demonstrated this in a series of studies where they asked participants

FigurE 4.1 The Schwartz value circumplex (or ‘wheel’) this model of 
values has been widely tested worldwide and seems to offer a model 
of how values are organized in all human societies. Values that are 
positively associated are close together on the circumplex (e.g., security 
and power). thus, people who endorse one value strongly will also tend 
to endorse neighbouring values strongly. Conversely, values that are 
opposite to each other on the wheel are negatively associated (once 
participants’ tendency to agree with all the values is controlled for). thus, 
people who strongly endorse security tend not to endorse self-direction 
so strongly. different segments of the wheel loosely correspond to overall 
orientations. For example, self-direction and stimulation correspond to 
openness to change, whereas achievement and power correspond to 
self-enhancement (the desire to achieve high status, even at the expense 
of others if necessary).

The social judge
to think about the reasons why they hold certain values. Performing this task 
changed their values. If people already had well­thought­out reasons for their 
values, we would not expect them to change as a result of a few minutes’ thought. 
Thus, Maio and Olson (1995; also see Bernard, Maio and Olson, 2003a, 2003b; Maio, 
2010) argued that values are ‘truisms’ or self­evident and hardly worth mentioning. 
ideologies, like values, are more general than attitudes. Whereas values refer to 
the importance one attaches to various aspects of life, ideologies refer to an inter­
related and widely shared set of beliefs that serve to explain social realities 
(Thompson, 1990). Ideologies typically refer to social, economic or political 
systems, and contain ideas that not only explain those systems but also suggest 
how they should be run (Jost, 2006). They can influence values, attitudes and 
intentions to commit behaviours (Crandall, 1994). For example, sexist ideology, as 
we shall see in Chapter 11, is a set of beliefs about the roles that men and women 
occupy, and should occupy, within society. It is associated with attitudes to any 
number of attitude objects, including rape victims, career women, abortion, 
cosmetic surgery, and women’s lifestyle choices during pregnancy. Ideologies are 
important to people because they offer them a way to agree on an understanding 
of the world and what actions they should take (Jost, Ledgerwood and Hardin, 
2008). But, they are often hotly contested – as in the battles between sexism and 
feminism, left­wing and right­wing ideology, and so­called ‘fundamentalist’ and 
secular ideology (Jost, 2006). For more insight into the importance of ideologies 
in everyday life, and their relation to attitudes, see the Social psychology in real 
life box below on political conservatism (Chapters 11 and 14 also deal at length 
with ideologies).

Political attitudes
the ideology of 
political conservatism 
(also known as right-
wing political 
orientation) has been 
widely studied by 
social psychologists in 
the past decade or 
two. Conservatism 
takes different forms in 
different countries, but 
two essential attitudes have been identified as 
characteristic of conservatism, wherever it is found (Jost, 
Glaser, Kruglanski and sulloway, 2003). one is a relatively 
positive attitude to income inequality. Conservatives 
‘consider people as inherently unequal and due unequal 
rewards’ (Erikson, Luttberg and tedin, 1988, p. 75). 
Another is a relatively negative attitude towards social 
change, as compared to tradition and the status quo. 
Attitudes, then, are fundamental to politics. What drives 
people to adopt this conservative cluster of attitudes? 
Generally speaking, the results of research into this 
question do not make for pleasant reading if you happen 
to be a conservative/right-winger (but may delight you if 
you are a liberal/left-winger). But they are worth reading, 
because they reveal a good deal about where attitudes 
and ideologies come from and the purposes they serve. 
one source of conservative ideology appears to be fear 
and anxiety – those to the right of the political spectrum 
fear threat, loss and death more than those on the left 
(Jost, Federico and Napier, 2009). they also tend to see the 
world as a more dangerous place (duckitt, 2001). Further,

they are more ‘closed-minded’ – less tolerant of ambiguity, 
and more inclined to prefer simple, straightforward, 
quickly obtained and apparently certain answers and 
explanations. For this reason they are less inclined to 
poetry, travel and foreign films (Jost et al., 2003; see also 
Calogero, Bardi and sutton, 2009, who showed that closed-
mindedness is associated with ‘conservation’ values on the 
schwartz value circumplex). the argument is that right-
wing ideology relieves fear and anxiety by affirming the 
social order and hierarchy that is contained in the status 
quo (Banaji and heiphetz, 2010; Jost et al., 2003). Indeed, 
some research suggests that despite their underlying 
anxieties, conservatives are actually happier than liberals 
(Napier and Jost, 2008; van heil and Brebels, 2011 – but for 
different findings, see Choma, Busseri and sadava, 2009; 
duriez, Klimstra, Luyckz et al., in press). 
much of this research is correlational and therefore 
hard to interpret in causal terms. Perhaps conservative 
ideology causes a disdain for ‘foreign’ things, and does not 
spring from closed-mindedness, for example. however, 
there is some longitudinal and experimental research that 
makes for even worse reading for conservatives. In 
analyses of data from national surveys of 15,000 British 
citizens born either in 1958 or 1970, hodson and Busseri 
(2012) found that children with lower IQs were more 
likely to grow up to be politically conservative. Partly for 
this reason, they also grew up to be more racist. Eidelman, 
Crandall, Goodman and Blanchar (2012) found other 
evidence that reduced capacity to engage in high-level 
thought also increases political conservatism. In one of 
their studies, they went into a bar, and found that the 
more drunk the bar patrons, the more right-wing their 
attitudes became. In subsequent experiments, the same 
authors found that placing participants under cognitive 
load or time pressure also made them more conservative. 
the picture that emerges from this research into 
political conservatism seems to be that it is an ideology 
adopted by those who are wracked with fear and less able 
to devote effortful, sophisticated thought to political 
information. It is not a flattering picture. however, some 
upsides to political conservatism have been suggested – 
apart from the possibility that they are happier, they are 
informed by moral principles that are of less interest to 
liberals, including loyalty, respect for authority and purity 
(Graham, haidt and Nosek, 2009). they are also more 
likely to judge people according to moral principles (haidt 
and hersh, 2001). You may not necessarily agree with 
these moral principles or the use of morality to judge 
people. Nonetheless, it is clear that, in some respects, 
morality is more important to conservatives.
Questions
1 Can science tell us about the rights and wrongs of 
different political positions? 
2 most social psychologists, like most social scientists 
(Cardiff and Klein, 2005; Klein and stern, 2005), 
identify as liberal/left wing. Few identify as 
conservative/right wing. A show of hands in a room full 
of roughly 1,000 researchers at the 2011 meeting of 
the society for Personality and social Psychology – the 
world’s leading annual meeting of social 
psychologists – uncovered some 800 liberals and 3 
conservatives (tierney, 2011). do you think the 
tendency for research to be unflattering about political 
conservatism might stem from the biased 
representation of left-wingers/liberals in social 
psychology? (Bear in mind that with rare exceptions, 
scientists do not falsify their results.) If so, how?
3 the research on the relationship between political 
conservatism and happiness is correlational. Can you 
find any experimental evidence that political 
conservatism affects mood or wellbeing? If not, do you 
think it is possible to design such an experiment? 
Thus far, we have seen that attitudes are essentially evaluations of specific 
objects and entities in people’s social worlds. This definition, however, does not 
tell us much about an important aspect of what attitudes are, that is, how they are 
structured. Much research into attitudes has focused on this question of struc-
ture – what components attitudes have and how they are related. Up until the 
1990s, this research was dominated by a tripartite model of attitudes (see Figure 4.2). 
In this model, attitudes are seen as having three facets (e.g., Breckler, 1984; Smith, 
Bruner and White, 1956):
Tripartite model of attitudes 
A model of the structure of 
attitudes which assumed 
that attitudes have three 
components: cognitive, 
affective (emotional) and 
behavioural.

1 cognitive: we can think about the positive and negative aspects of an attitude object
2 affective: we can feel positive or negative emotions towards an attitude object
3 behavioural: we can behave favourably towards an attitude object (typically by 
seeking it out or approaching it) or unfavourably (typically by avoiding it). 
Thus, if you like dogs (in preference to, say, cats), you will probably think that 
dogs have positive attributes, for example they are playful, loyal and friendly. You 
will also have warm feelings towards dogs, and you will be more likely to choose 
to have a dog as a pet or interact with dogs you meet. 
By and large, this tripartite view of attitudes has fallen 
out of favour (Banaji and Heiphetz, 2010; Tesser and Shaffer, 
1990). Part of the reason for this is that since we are inter­
ested in the relationship between attitudes and behaviour, 
we want to study how people’s behaviour is related to how 
they think and feel about attitude objects. We do not want 
to simply defi ne their behaviour as an inherent part of their 
attitude (Zanna and Rempel, 1988). To take an example, let us 
say that someone believes in all the tenets of a major world 
religion, such as Islam, and associates posi­
tive emotions with that religion. However, 
they do not behave in accordance with 
their beliefs and emotions. Should we say 
they are not religious, or they do not have 
very religious attitudes? Surely, it is more accurate to say they do not behave in 
accordance with their attitudes? Indeed, behaving in ways that are discrepant with 
one’s attitudes has interesting causes and effects in its own right, as we shall see 
throughout this chapter, for example when we read about cognitive dissonance. 
Other research has focused on the complexity of attitudes. We can see attitudes 
as comprising sets of evaluative beliefs about an attitude object. Your attitude 
towards dogs can be simple, in that it is based on only a small number of aspects or 
dimensions of dogs, for example how sociable they are. Another person’s attitudes 
may be more complex, for example they may think about other dimensions, such 
as the way they smell, the mess they make and the way they look. Specifi c evalua­
tions of an attitude object can be consistent, that is, they may all have the same 
valence. For example, ‘dogs look cute’, ‘they are friendly’ and ‘I like that doggy 
smell’ are all positive. However, they may be evaluatively inconsistent, as in ‘dogs 
are friendly’, ‘dogs look cute’, but ‘I hate the way they smell’. Research suggests 
that attitudes become stronger – more extremely positive or negative – if they are 
both complex and evaluatively consistent. If attitudes are evaluatively inconsis­
tent, they become weaker or more moderate as they become more complex (Judd 
and Lusk, 1984) (see Figure 4.3). Complex and inconsistent attitudes may be espe­
cially likely to lead to a moderate position on a topic when people have thought 
actively about the inconsistency and attempted to integrate their various beliefs 
(e.g., ‘dogs smell bad, but that is partly because they are so much fun and love to

play outside’) (Tetlock, 1984). This kind of integration of positive and negative 
beliefs is probably what we mean in everyday life when we say that someone has a 
‘balanced and considered view’ on a topic.
Attitude formation
Since attitudes are such an important and wide­reaching aspect of social psychology, 
it is important to understand where they come from. If a person likes dogs, why do 
they like dogs? If a person has a positive attitude towards their country’s leader, how 
did this attitude form? Does it even make sense to say that a person ‘likes dogs’, or 
are attitudes highly unstable across time and responsive to situational forces? Most 
social psychologists argue that attitudes are learned from others. However, some 
argue that attitudes come about due to mere exposure, while others argue for a 
genetic component to attitudes. We will discuss each approach in this section. 
Why do we form attitudes?
Before we consider the details of how people form attitudes, it is useful to under­
stand why they do so. The study of attitude function is the study of why we have 
attitudes. It is a special case of the study of motivated social cognition, which we 
encountered in Chapter 3. In a landmark paper, Katz (1960) defined four func­
tions of attitudes:
1 The knowledge function: Attitudes work as useful schemas or mental guides 
that help people make sense of many different kinds of information within a 
complex social world. Attitudes help us form opinions about factors related to 
the attitude object, so that thinking about the social world gets a little bit easier 
(Katz, 1960). Another way of looking at this is that attitudes perform a know­
ledge function that helps people focus on the important characteristics of an 
Attitude function the study of 
why people have attitudes.

FigurE 4.3 Attitude extremity as an outcome of complexity 
and consistency If your attitudes to a person are mixed 
or inconsistent, then the more dimensions you evaluate 
someone on, the less extreme your attitudes become. on 
the other hand, if your attitudes to an object are consistent, 
then your attitudes will become more extreme as the number 
of dimensions on which you evaluate the attitude object 
increases. For example, if you don’t like the way someone 
looks or who their friends are, you will have a negative 
overall attitude to them. And if you add more dimensions 
of judgement, and your assessment of the person on these 
dimensions is also negative – their values, intelligence and 
so on – the intensity of your dislike will only increase. on 
the other hand, if your assessment of the person on these 
dimensions is mixed, considering more dimensions will lead 
to a less extreme attitude (Judd and Lusk, 1984). 

163
The social judge
attitude object so that they know how best to deal with it quickly and effec­
tively. Thus, it is important to people that they feel confident in the accuracy 
and legitimacy of their attitudes (although as we saw in the Social psychology 
in the real world box earlier, this need is stronger in some people than others). 
Also, it is important to people that attitudes appear to be consistent with each 
other, so that they feel they are in possession of a coherent set of knowledge, 
beliefs and feelings about the world. This is one reason we are more likely to 
form attitudes that are consistent with our other attitudes (as we shall see in the 
coverage of balance theory and the APE model of attitudes later in this chapter). 
So, you will make choices more easily, quickly and with a greater sense of 
confidence if you feel your attitudes to alternatives (different jobs, different 
election candidates, different houses) are consistent and informed.
2 The utilitarian function: Attitudes can help us obtain rewards and avoid punish­
ments. By having the ‘right’ attitudes, people might think that others will look 
favourably on them, so that expressing attitudes can perform an impression 
management function (Chaiken, Giner­Sorolla and Chen, 1996; Cialdini, Petty 
and Cacioppo, 1981; Jellison and Arkin, 1977; Nienhuis, Mansted and Spears, 
2001; Snyder and Swann, 1976). For example, some cultures frown on prejudice 
towards certain groups (e.g., blind people), but actively endorse prejudice 
towards certain other groups (e.g., pregnant women who drink alcohol) (Cran­
dall, Eshleman and O’Brien, 2002). Expressing positive attitudes to the right 
groups and negative attitudes to widely disliked groups is a way of affirming 
membership of the group, being valued and liked by others, and avoiding 
others’ disapproval. 
3 The value expressive function: Attitudes may allow individuals to express their 
deep­seated values. If equality is an important value to you, there is a good 
chance you will be motivated not to harbour negative feelings and thoughts 
about disadvantaged social groups (Monteith, Ashburn­Nardo, Voils and 
Czopp, 2002). Attitudes that express values are often the most resistant to 
change (Maio and Olson, 2000) and, as we shall see, are more likely to inspire 
commitment to attitude­consistent behaviours such as volunteering (e.g., 
Murray, Haddock and Zanna, 1996). 
4 The ego defensive function: Attitudes can protect us from psychological threats. 
As we saw in Chapter 2, having a positive attitude to ourselves – high self­
esteem – appears to make us less anxious and defensive when confronted with 
the inevitability of our own death, which is perhaps the supreme psychological 
threat (Greenberg, Solomon and Pyszczynski, 1997). 
Thus, your attitudes can help you feel that you understand the world and your 
place in it, can help you win friends and avoid making enemies, can help you 
express your deepest values, and can help protect your psychological equilibrium 
from ideas and realities that threaten and perturb you. These functions of attitudes 
influence the attitudes we form. Now, we consider the specific psychological 
processes that affect attitude formation. 

164
Thinking and feeling
Mere exposure
Sometimes, simply being exposed repeatedly to a person or object can cause 
people to form more positive attitudes towards them. Zajonc (1968) termed this 
the mere exposure effect. In other words, merely being exposed to something often 
enough makes us like it. For example, you may see a particular cat on your way to 
university every day and develop a soft spot for that cat when you do not particu­
larly like other cats. You may watch a particular news programme on TV because 
your friends like to watch it and you are more likely to switch over to this 
programme in future. The mere exposure effect does not require a person to take 
any action towards the attitude object. For example, Zajonc (1968, 1970) found 
that people were more likely to say that familiar nonsense words or characters 
(ones they had been exposed to earlier in the experiment) meant something posi­
tive (see Figures 4.4 and 4.5). Harmon­Jones and Allen (2001) found that people 
smiled more when they saw familiar faces rather than unfamiliar faces. As we will 
discuss in Chapter 7, the mere exposure effect is a strong determinant of the extent 
to which we are attracted to other people. The more we see them, the more we 
tend to develop positive attitudes towards them. 
The mere exposure effect seems to say 
something startling and profound about the 
way our attitudes are formed. For Zajonc 
(1968, 1970), it suggested that ‘preferences 
need no inferences’, that is, we can form 
positive or negative attitudes without any 
thoughts about the object. Our psycholog­
ical makeup appears to be such that our 
attitudes are shaped entirely by the objec­
tive features of our environment – in this 
case, how common and visible the attitude 
object is. Thus, the mere exposure effect provided an important, early line of 
evidence that attitudes and cognition are largely automatic and informed by 
factors that people are not aware of (Chapters 2 and 3). 
However, the meaning of the mere exposure effect may not be so straightfor­
ward. In a major meta­analysis of the mere exposure effect, Bornstein (1989) 
found that it was larger in experiments where stimuli were presented only very 
briefly. In a subsequent set of experiments, Bornstein and D’Agostino (1992) 
presented stimuli such as photographs and geometric shapes either subliminally 
(5 ms exposures – just 1/200th of a second) or supraliminally (500 ms exposures – 
fully half a second). The mere exposure effect was more pronounced when shapes 
had earlier been presented subliminally. On the back of the meta­analytic find­
ings (Bornstein, 1989) and their own experimental results, Bornstein and 
D’Agostino (1992) argued that mere exposure to a stimulus happens because of 
the operation of two processes. First, familiar objects are perceived more 
fluently – after being exposed to a novel stimulus, our perceptual systems learn 
Mere exposure effect the 
more exposure we have to a 
stimulus, the more we tend 
to like it.

about them so that subsequent exposures are easier and faster to process. Second, 
people do not make the correct attribution for this perceptual fluency. Rather 
than attributing the fluency to the object’s familiarity, they assume that they like 
the object. This is why, they argue, people are more prone to the mere exposure 
effect after having been only subliminally exposed to stimulus objects before. 
They simply do not realize they have seen the objects before, and so cannot 
correct their erroneous judgement that their fluency is attributable to some prop­
erty of the object, rather than its mere familiarity. Further support for this inter­
pretation came from correlational analyses of their results. Specifically, the more 
participants recognized the stimuli as having been seen before, the less prone they 
were to liking them, although Hansen and Wänke (2009) later found that 
conscious recognition did not affect the mere exposure effect. In later experi­
ments, Bornstein and D’Agostino (1994) found that the mere exposure effect was 
reduced when people were told they had seen familiar stimulus objects before, or 
were told that familiarity can increase liking. Thus, the more able people are to 
realize they have encountered familiar stimuli before, the less prone they are to 
the mere exposure effect. 
Bornstein (1989) and Bornstein and D’Agostino’s (1992, 1994) account estab­
lishes that with controlled processing, people are able to correct for the mere 
exposure effect. However, it is not yet clear whether their findings establish that 
preferences do need inferences; that is, that the mere exposure effect only happens 
when people make an incorrect inference or misattribution of perceptual fluency 
to something other than the mere familiarity of a stimulus. There is no direct 
evidence that people make these attributions in the first place. (Bear in mind that 
any such attributions are probably made unconsciously, so it is probably not 
useful to ask participants what attributions they are making.) However, more 
recent findings do suggest that people make inferences on the basis of familiarity. 
In particular, when stimuli are more fluent than people expect them to be, they 
appear to like them more (e.g., Dechêne, Stahl, Hansen and Wänke, 2009). It seems 
something like an inference is happening, presumably at an unconscious level, 
along the lines of: ‘This stimuli was easier to look at than I would have expected it 
to be, so I must find it likeable.’ 
Time to reflect the mere exposure effect contradicts the proverbial wisdom that ‘familiarity breeds contempt’. 
Why do you think familiar stimuli are liked more? In particular, can you think of an evolutionary explanation for this 
effect? In other words, what survival or reproductive advantage would be conferred on individuals if they prefer 
familiar to unfamiliar attitude objects? Can you think of a way to test your hypothesis?
Social learning
Most social psychologists agree that our attitudes are largely learned from others. 
We observe others, we listen and we interact with others and naturally we learn 
about their attitudes. Many of our own attitudes are acquired this way. It is argued 
that this social learning occurs through the following processes. 
Social learning People 
acquire their attitudes (as 
well as behaviours) often 
from others.

Classical conditioning
This basic psychological process (also known as evaluative conditioning) can facili­
tate attitude formation. During a typical classical conditioning study, a stimulus 
(usually neutral to begin with) called the ‘conditioned stimulus’ is repeatedly paired 
with another stimulus (the ‘unconditioned stimulus’) that already evokes a positive 
or a negative reaction (the unconditioned response). For example, in Pavlov’s 
([1927]1960) initial investigations of canine digestion, the same laboratory techni­
cian would feed the dogs routinely. Naturally, the dogs would salivate (the uncon­
ditioned response) when food arrived (the unconditioned stimulus), but after a 
while, the dogs would salivate at the sight of the laboratory technician (the condi­
tioned stimulus). They had come to associate the technician with the food so that, 
eventually, the presence of the technician alone was enough to elicit the natural 
response. Pavlov tried pairing a bell with the delivery of food and the same effect 
occurred. After a while, the dogs would salivate at the sound of the bell. 
Although this may seem like a basic psychological effect with very little rele­
vance to attitudes, social psychologists argue that it is potentially important in 
determining the formation of attitudes. In particular, if a stimulus is associated with 
an object that elicits a negative response, then a negative attitude may reasonably 
form to that stimulus. On the other hand, if a stimulus is associated with an object 
that elicits a positive response, then a positive attitude may emerge. For example, a 
child may observe that every time their parent sees a disabled person, they display 
negative nonverbal responses. The negative nonverbal responses make the child 
feel upset, but initially, exposure to disabled persons does not elicit a negative or 
positive response. However, with repeated exposure to the pairing of the neutral 
stimulus (disabled persons) with the negative stimulus (negative nonverbal behav­
iours), the child may come to associate disabled persons with feeling upset and thus 
develop a negative attitude towards them. This attitude has therefore been directly 
learned from the parent by the process of classical conditioning (see de Houwer, 
Thomas and Baeyens, 2001; Zanna, Kiesler and Pilkonis, 1970). 
There is evidence to suggest that this process more often than not occurs 
outside the awareness of the learner by a process known as subliminal conditioning. 
For example, Krosnick, Betz, Jussim and Lynn (1992) exposed student participants 
to photos of another person doing everyday things such as shopping for food. 
Prior to each photograph of this stimulus person, other photographs were 
presented very briefly (13 ms) – so briefly, in fact, they could not be consciously 
recognized. These photos were of highly pleasant or unpleasant stimuli (e.g., a 
couple on their wedding day, a pair of kittens and smiling friends playing rugby, 
versus a bloody shark, a face on fire and a bucket of snakes). The dependent vari­
able was the participants’ feelings towards the original person in the photos. Find­
ings revealed that participants who had seen the positive photos paired with the 
person felt more positively towards the person than those who had been exposed 
to a negative pairing (Figure 4.6). 
Like the mere exposure effect, evaluative conditioning studies have shown that 
attitude learning can occur at an unconscious level (Walther, 2002). Although the 
Classical conditioning simple 
form of learning where a 
stimulus eventually evokes 
positive or negative reactions 
through repeated pairing with 
another stimulus.
Subliminal conditioning 
Classical conditioning that

167
The social judge
basic learning itself may be largely unconscious, research 
shows that consciousness does play an important role. For 
example, one study suggested that evaluative conditioning 
effects were wiped out when participants were placed 
under cognitive load, and so did not have conscious 
resources free to pay attention to the stimuli they were 
being exposed to (DeDonder, Corneille, Yzerbyt and 
Kuppens, 2010). Further, an experiment by Gast and 
Rothermund (2011) suggests that evaluative conditioning 
is stronger when participants are instructed to pay atten­
tion to how positive or negative the stimuli are. Thus, 
paying attention to stimuli pairings, and in particular 
whether they are desirable or undesirable, seems to allow 
associative learning to happen more strongly. 
Thus far, findings are mixed on a final, important issue regarding the extent to 
which evaluative conditioning happens as a result of automatic or controlled proc­
esses. This concerns the role of conscious awareness that the attitude object is 
being systematically paired with negative or positive stimuli. Some findings 
suggest that awareness of this contingency enables people to correct the tendency 
to like objects paired with positive stimuli, and dislike objects paired with negative 
stimuli (Walther and Nagengast, 2006). Others suggest that a degree of awareness 
of the contingency between the attitude object and other stimuli is actually neces­
sary for evaluative conditioning (Bar­Anan, De Houwer and Nosek, 2010). Thus, 
we still do not know for sure whether evaluative conditioning depends partly on 
an inference (e.g., ‘this object is associated with other positive things, so I like it’, 
rather like ‘any friend of yours is a friend of mine’), or whether it happens auto­
matically and is actually corrected (e.g., ‘I have some positive feelings for this 
object, but this is only because it is paired with other positive things’) (for a review, 
see Gawronski and Bodenhausen, 2011). 
Whatever the precise mechanism that underpins evaluative conditioning, 
researchers are now widely using these implicit learning paradigms. Exposure to 
repeated pairings of self­related stimuli to positive stimuli in the laboratory has 
been shown to have the potential to increase self­esteem (Baccus, Baldwin and 
Packer, 2004; Ebert, Steffens, von Stülpnagel and Jelenec, 2009; Grumm, Nestler 
and Collani, 2009); as well as reduce the liking for chocolate (Ebert et al., 2009) 
and the craving for alcohol (Houben, Schoenmakers and Wiers, 2010). Olson and 
Fazio (2006) also managed to reduce racial prejudice among white participants by 
pairing white faces with negative stimuli and black faces with positive stimuli. 
Instrumental conditioning 
Being praised for doing or saying something is also a good way to learn. For 
example, your friends might praise your taste in wine so that the next time you are 
asked for your opinions about wine by other people, you are likely to articulate 
the response that was received favourably by others. This is an example of the

process called instrumental conditioning – when a behaviour is followed immedi­
ately by a positive outcome, it is reinforced and more likely to be repeated. On the 
other hand, when a negative response follows a behaviour, it is weakened or 
suppressed and is therefore less likely to be repeated. Like classical conditioning, 
the principle of instrumental conditioning can also be applied to attitudes. For 
example, if a child makes a statement that is followed by smiles and laughter from 
a parent, this positive response makes it more likely that the child will repeat the 
statement in future, in order to receive the same positive outcome. There is some 
evidence to suggest that adults’ attitudes can be reinforced by positive feedback. 
For example, Insko (1965) showed that participants’ responses to an attitude 
survey were influenced by positive feedback on the responses they gave a week 
earlier. In summary, reinforcing one’s attitudes with positive feedback means that 
the attitudes are more likely to survive and be expressed on other occasions.
Observational learning 
We also learn by simply observing others (Bandura, 1977), and this is another way 
in which people can form attitudes. For example, a child may overhear conversa­
tions between grownups or watch how they behave in specific situations. The 
child will often take on the information and it will influence the attitudes they 
develop. Similarly, observing people’s behaviour on TV and in other forms of mass 
media can influence attitudes. There is some evidence to suggest that observational 
learning forms a significant role in attitude development. For example, children 
may express derogatory attitudes about particular ethnic groups but in reality 
they know very little about them – the attitude must have been learned by listening 
to or observing others (Aboud, 2005; Allport, 1954). Weisbuch, Pauker and 
Ambady (2009) found that characters in popular US television shows exhibited 
more negative facial expressions and body language to Black, versus White, char­
acters (even when Black and White characters’ social status was matched). Partici­
pants in their study viewed scenes in which this bias was evident. Although they 
did not consciously notice the bias, they were influenced by it, reporting more 
prejudiced attitudes on the Implicit Association Test, a measure to which we will 
return later in this chapter (see also Chapter 11). Observational learning can influ­
ence attitudes towards unfamiliar social groups. Findings show that people take 
on others’ attitudes about groups when they do not have any experience or 
knowledge about the group themselves (e.g., Maio, Esses and Bell, 1994). This 
influence may be even stronger if, through the process of social comparison, we 
want our attitudes to be similar to those of others we admire. In Chapters 9 and 
14, we return to the influence of group norms on our attitudes. 
Innate factors
There is a growing body of evidence suggesting that genetic factors also play a role 
in attitude development. Unlike the social learning approach, this approach 
suggests that important features of attitude development occur because they are 
inherited (Arvey, Bouchard, Segal and Abraham, 1989; Keller, Bouchard, Arvey et 
instrumental conditioning

The social judge
al., 1992; Olson, Vernon, Harris and Jang, 2001). Much of this research centres 
around studies of identical and non­identical twins. As you know, identical 
(monozygotic) twins have exactly the same genetic makeup. In contrast, non­
identical (dizygotic) twins, while having comparable life experiences, do not share 
the same amount of genetic material. Thus, if, on average, attitudes of identical 
twins are more strongly related than attitudes of non­identical twins, this is some 
evidence to suggest that attitudes can be inherited (see Figure 4.7). Indeed, find­
ings show that these relationships are stronger for identical twins, for attitude 
objects as diverse as big parties, playing chess, roller coaster rides, abortion, the 
death penalty and capitalism (Olson et al., 2001). 
Although diverse, these attitudes – towards novelty, risk and political beliefs – 
tend to be organized by political conservatism, as we saw earlier in this chapter. 
Political conservatism also seems to be heritable. Bouchard, Segal, Tellegen et al. 
(2003) found that conservative social attitudes are shared more strongly by mono­
zygotic than dizygotic twins. This study focused on twins who were reared apart. 
In this case, similarities in upbringing cannot account for similarities in attitudes 
(Martin, Eaves, Heath et al., 1986; Waller, Kojetin, Bouchard et al., 1990). This is 
not to say that genetics accounts for all (or even most) of our attitude formation. 
On the contrary, evidence suggests that genetic effects are fairly small. Other 
research suggests that genetic factors do not strongly determine attitudes (e.g., 
Rozin and Millman, 1987; see also Chapter 13 for a critical evaluation of twin 
studies). However, it is intriguing to learn that the way we think, in addition to 
physical factors such as height and hair colour, appears to be influenced by our 
genetic makeup.
There is also some evidence to suggest that attitudes that are determined more 
by genetics are also more difficult to change (Crelia and Tesser, 1996), more 
important to people (Olson et al., 2001) and more likely to determine their behav­
iour (Crelia and Tesser, 1996; D’Onofrio, Eaves, Murrelle et al., 1999). Some 
researchers argue that these fascinating genetic effects are probably determined by 
general dispositions to be ‘positive’ or ‘negative’, which in turn influence how 
people evaluate aspects of the social world (e.g., George, 1990). Further research is 
required to determine whether the apparent heritability of political conservatism 
really means that our genes influence our political orientation per se, or instead 
affect some general psychological trait like optimism­pessimism, which in turn 
shapes our worldview. 
Attitude consistency and balance
As we have seen, attitudes have a knowledge function, and so people prefer to 
have harmonious, consistent thoughts and feelings towards the people and objects 
in their lives. Heider (1958b), the influential social psychologist who founded 
attribution theory (Chapter 3), described this basic principle of harmony and 
consistency in terms of Gestalt psychology. When attitudes are consistent with 
each other, they are in a state of balance and form a coherent whole or unit. If 
we have a positive attitude to one object, we tend to form positive attitudes to

other objects it is positively related 
to. The simplest and most cited 
example is in interpersonal rela­
tions and can be summed up with 
the proverbs, ‘any friend of yours is 
a friend of mine’ (when spoken to a 
friend), and ‘my enemy’s enemy is 
my friend’. Heider (1958b) asked 
his readers to imagine triads, 
involving two people and some 
attitude object (which might be another person). The attitude relation between 
each of the elements in the triad can be positive or negative. Let us say that you are 
opposed to the death penalty, but in discussions with one of your friends, it turns 
out that they are strongly in favour of it. In this case, your liking of your friend, 
their liking of the death penalty and your loathing of the death penalty form an 
unbalanced triad (see Figure 4.8). A likely response to this unbalanced triad is to 
change attitudes. Shocked to discover your friend’s attitudes, you may now like 
them less. Alternatively, you may be motivated to listen carefully to your friend’s 
opinion and revise your opinion on the death penalty. If you were to change your 
mind on the death penalty, your attitudes would then be balanced, and together, 
form a coherent unit – a balanced triad. Heider’s (1958b) triads have an elegant 
property. They are balanced if multiplying the signs returns a positive value. Thus, 
three positive attitudes, or two negative attitudes and one positive attitude within 
a triad mean that attitudes are balanced. One negative attitude, or three negative 
attitudes, mean that they are unbalanced. 
Many studies investigated Heider’s (1958a) balance theory in the context of 
such triads and broadly supported it (e.g., Curry and Emerson, 1970; Insko, 
Songer and McGarvey, 1974; Monsour, Betty and Kurzweil, 1993; Newcomb, 
1961; for a review, see Crandall, Silvia, N’Gbala et al., 2007). As predicted, atti­
tudes are more likely to change if they are unbalanced. Balance theory also helps 
to predict attitude formation. Thus, if your friend, rather than someone you 
cannot stand, likes a film or performer you have not heard of, your initial attitude 
to that new attitude object is more likely to be positive, too. Balance theory 
continues to be influential in many areas of social psychology and related fields, 
including child development, marketing and group processes (e.g., Brusco and 
Steinley, 2010; Hummon and Doreian, 2003; Woodside and Chebat, 2001). It 
stands as the first model to embody the importance of the consistency of attitudes, 
which, as we saw earlier, is important to their knowledge function. Balance theory 
also brought attention to the social aspects of attitudes. It established that, over 
time, we tend to share the attitudes of people who are close to us. For example, 
this basic principle has been developed by researchers working on shared reality 
(Figure 4.9). In close relationships, typically within social groups, people often 
work together to achieve a self­consciously shared set of attitudes to the world 
(Echterhoff, Higgins and Levine, 2009; Hardin and Higgins, 1996; see Chapter 5 
FigurE 4.8 An unbalanced

unbalanced triad (a), you

other person likes the death 
penalty. since the multiplied 
signs are negative (there is 
one negative relation and 
two positive relations), the 
triad is not balanced, and 
the attitude relations do not 
form a coherent unit. When 
aware of this lack of balance, 
people tend to revise their 
attitudes. For example, they 
may revise your opinion of the 
death penalty. If you come to 
approve of the death penalty, 
a balanced triad (b) is formed.

for more about the social construction of a shared reality through communica­
tion). This sense that ‘we see things the same way’, or ‘we are on the same page’ is 
exactly in keeping with Heider’s (1958a) balance theory.
Social representations: the social formation of attitudes
The broad principle established by balance theory is that attitudes are not formed 
in a social vacuum. Our attitudes are influenced by other people and are often 
formed socially. Social representations theory (Moscovici, 1963, 1983, 1988) suggests 
that beliefs about the world – including evaluative beliefs, or attitudes – are built up 
by groups of people through processes of social interaction. Moscovici drew on 
Durkheim’s ([1912]2001) notion of ‘collective representation’ – societally shared 
beliefs and attitudes – but abandoned the term ‘collective’ because he wanted to 
capture the notion that different representations of the same topic may be held by 
different sections of a society, or even by the same individual, at different points in 
time. Thus, Christian and Muslim students in the UK tended, in a study by Rafiq, 
Jobanuptra and Muncer (2006), to have different beliefs about the Iraq War. 
Although both groups shared generally negative attitudes to the war, and agreed on 
many of its causes, there was a notable difference, in that Muslim students were less 
likely to connect the war on Iraq to the so­called ‘war on terror’. In another study 
by Liu and Hilton (2005), Ma¯ori (indigenous) and Pakeha (ethnically European 
descendants of settlers) were also found to have different social representations of 
New Zealand history. Notably, Pakeha had a generally negative view of their ances­
tors’ behaviour during colonization, but to a lesser extent than Ma¯ori. Social repre­
sentations are important because our attitudes are informed by our group and 
cultural memberships and are built up by social and cultural practices (discussions, 
media portrayals, art and science). They also demonstrate how we form attitudes to 
attitude objects that are outside the realm of our social experience. Thus, people 
living in overwhelmingly indigenous areas of their own country often harbour 
negative views of immigrant groups with whom they may have little or no contact, 
although social representations theory is not the only way to explain this (see, for 
example, Berg, 2009, and also Chapters 11 and 12 on intergroup contact). 
Social representations theory has attracted many criticisms. One pithy critique 
came from Potter and Litton (1985, p. 82), who described it as ‘a concept in search 
of a theory’. What they meant is that although the theory provides the appealing 
central concept of social representations, it does not offer a precise account of how 
social representations form, or how they affect other social psychological processes. 
As we saw in Chapter 1, one of the main jobs of theories in social psychology is to 
identify and explain causal relationships so that we can understand how and why 
social phenomena happen. Other criticisms of the theory attack the central concept 
itself, describing it as too vague and all­encompassing (Billig, 1988; Jahoda, 1988). 
Although Moscovici has offered definitions of social representations, it is not 
always clear what counts as a social representation, and ambiguity surrounds 
whether a social representation refers to the process by which people arrive at a 
common set of concepts, or the set of concepts itself (Wagner, 1998).

Thinking and feeling
Defenders of social representations theory have responded to such criticisms 
with points that are both reassuring and worrying. Reassuringly, they point out 
that the relationship between social psychological phenomena is intimate and 
complicated, and we should not always expect to find simple or definitive accounts 
of social psychological phenomena (Marková, 2000; Voelklein and Howarth, 
2005). Worryingly, they appear to use the complexity of social psychological 
phenomena to resist the pressure to provide clear definitions of concepts in the 
theory. Thus, talking about the phenomena of interest to social representations 
theory, Marková (2000, p. 430) wrote that ‘attempts to provide an exhaustive defi­
nition of such phenomena are based on a misconception of their nature’. Voelklein 
and Howarth (2001, p. 437) suggest that ‘Moscovici is keen not to apply a defini­
tion that is too restrictive as complex social phenomena cannot be reduced to 
simple propositions.’ This reluctance to define terms precisely – in other words, 
the trend towards ‘mysticism’ – is worrying because any kind of academic enquiry 
needs to be clear and explicit. However, if we are prepared to suspend these 
worries, it is clear that social representations theory has inspired much research, 
which has generated discoveries about shared concepts, attitudes and behaviours, 
casting light on a range of topics, including how people collaborate to form atti­
tudes to their history (Liu and Hilton, 2005; Sibley, Liu, Duckitt and Khan, 2008), 
political conflicts (Elcheroth, Doise and Reicher, 2011), political ideology 
(Corbetta, Cavazza and Roccato, 2009), technology (Devine­Wright and Devine­
Wright, 2009), disease (Mayor, Eicher, Bangerter et al., in press) and the environ­
ment (Smith and Joffe, in press). 
Exploring further In 2011, a special issue of the journal Political Psychology contained articles devoted to social 
representations theory. If you have access to this journal (some articles may be available to public readers on the 
internet), browse through the articles to get a sense of how the theory has developed. some of the articles (e.g., 
Elcheroth et al., 2011) spend time explicitly defining and developing the theory. do you think that social 
representations theory is now on a firmer scientific footing, offering clearer definitions and accounts of causal 
processes?

implicit and explicit attitudes
In Chapter 3, we encountered the important distinction between automatic and 
controlled social cognition. As we saw, we have more conscious awareness of, and 
control over, some aspects of our social cognition than others. Attitudes are no 
exception. A great deal of research has uncovered that far from having one attitude 
to an object we can consciously report, we have a mixture of unconscious (or 

173
The social judge
implicit) and conscious (or explicit) attitudes. To understand this distinction, it is 
first necessary to have some idea of how attitudes are measured in social 
psychology. Thus, before exploring the different causes and functions of implicit 
and explicit attitudes, we briefly consider how attitudes are measured in social 
psychology. Sometimes, social psychologists simply ask people what their atti­
tudes are, or observe their behaviour in order to gauge their attitudes. On the 
other hand, they may use less direct measures, using specific tests designed to tap 
into people’s attitudes, or they may measure people’s physical responses to atti­
tude objects as an index of their attitudes.
Direct measures of attitudes
Attitudes are difficult to examine because unlike many physical objects, they 
cannot be observed. Thus, social psychologists often rely on people’s own self­
reports of their attitudes. The most common approach to doing this is simply to 
ask people to respond to questions about their attitudes, that is, ask them what 
they think. For example, you may have participated in a phone survey where a 
person asked you for your opinions about electronic goods, food, drink or some­
thing else. You may have completed a political opinion poll. In such cases, your 
attitudes are being measured. In studies of people’s attitudes, social psychologists 
make use of attitude scales, a series of questions designed to measure specific atti­
tudes. These scales are tested many times to ensure they are valid and reliable. A 
well­designed scale will measure the direction and strength of a person’s attitudes 
on a particular topic (Dawes and Smith, 1985; Edwards, 1983; Likert, [1932]1974). 
For example, if you were asked to complete a scale concerning your attitudes 
surrounding popular conspiracy theories, you may be asked to rate your agree­
ment with a set of statements, on a scale like this (from Douglas and Sutton, 2008, 
2011; also Wood, Douglas and Sutton, 2012):
Princess Diana was murdered by rogue cells within MI6
Completely disagree 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 Completely agree
Your averaged responses inform a researcher whether or not you endorse 
conspiracy theories, and how much you endorse such theories. Measuring atti­
tudes in this way is relatively easy and noninvasive, so it is not surprising this is 
the most popular way in which social psychologists tend to measure attitudes. 
However, social psychologists also observe people’s behaviours in order to judge 
their attitudes. For example, a researcher may measure whether people volunteer 
to stuff envelopes for a campaign or give money to a charity in order to assess 
their attitudes towards the cause, or how those attitudes change in response to 
contextual changes (Deci, 1975; Jonas, Schimel, Greenberg and Pyszczynski, 2002; 
Wilson and Dunn, 1986). Observational studies are often used in organizational 
psychology to observe workers’ attitudes to their co­workers and aspects of the 
workplace such as promotion decisions (Schwarzwald, Koslowsky and Shalit, 
1992). Observing what people do is therefore a good technique for understanding 
their attitudes in a range of settings.

a person’s attitudes on a topic.

Thinking and feeling
There are many advantages to these sorts of measures. In the case of attitude 
scales especially, the expense is relatively small and it is quick and easy to gauge 
people’s attitudes. On the other hand, there are some drawbacks to using these 
methods. Most importantly, they rely on people being honest. Much of the time, 
people will say what they think and behave in ways that reflect their attitudes, so 
scale and observational methods can be effective. However, when topics are sensi­
tive and people may feel embarrassed or afraid to say what they really think, self­
report and observational measures may be less effective measures of people’s actual 
attitudes. Social desirability is a powerful motivator, so sometimes researchers need 
to think of other ways to measure people’s ‘less desirable’ attitudes. 
One way to do this is to include a lie scale in the mix of the attitude scales of 
interest (e.g., Barrett and Eysenck, 1992; Reynolds and Richmond, 1979). Such 
scales were originally introduced into personality measures in order to detect 
whether people ‘fake good’ on scores of other scales, to make themselves look 
more socially desirable (O’Donovan, 1969). Lie scales are made up of items listing 
behaviours and issues that are either socially desirable but not frequently practised 
(e.g., ‘I am always nice to everyone’) or frequently practised but socially undesir­
able (e.g., ‘I never say things I shouldn’t’). From participants’ responses, lying can 
be diagnosed when a set of desirable but infrequently performed behaviours are 
endorsed by the participant as being done frequently, and when frequently 
performed undesirable behaviours are denied by the participant. These responses 
can be statistically analysed alongside the attitude measures to compensate for 
social desirability concerns in attitude research. For example, in one study, Sutton 
and Farrall (2005) used a lie scale to demonstrate that men’s attitudes towards crime 
(and specifically their fear of crime) were more marked than those of women, once 
lying was taken into account. In other words, men were more likely to be dishonest 
in expressing their feelings about crime, but using a lie scale allowed the researchers 
to show that men were actually more fearful of crime than women. 
It is also possible to get around people’s desire to look good simply by making 
their responses anonymous, so that their responses are not identifiable and they are 
not accountable for the views they express. However, social psychologists have 
also designed more indirect ways of examining attitudes that get around people’s 
social desirability concerns. Some examples are discussed in the following section.
Indirect measures of attitudes
One such indirect measure is called the bogus pipeline procedure. Here, the partici­
pant is attached to a device known as the bogus pipeline (see Figure 4.10), and told 
it can detect their ‘true’ attitudes (Jones and Sigall, 1971; Quigley­Fernandez and 
Tedeschi, 1978; Roese and Jamieson, 1993). This is presumed to cause participants 
to fear that dishonest responses would be noticed, causing them to indicate their 
attitudes more honestly than usual. This technique has been used widely in areas 
such as the detection of substance abuse in teenagers (e.g., Murray and Perry, 
1987), alcohol abuse among pregnant women (Lowe, Windsor, Adams et al., 
1986), distorted thinking that supports offending among child molesters (Gannon, 

175
The social judge
2006) and socially sensitive behaviours in surveys (Tourangeau, Rips and Rasinski, 
2000; for a 20­year meta­analysis of bogus pipeline research examining studies up 
until the early 1990s, see Roese and Jamieson, 1993). 
Social psychologists have also devised physiological measures to examine 
people’s attitudes. For example, Cacioppo, Petty, Losch and Kim (1986) devised a 
measure that monitors muscular movements in the face to examine the direction 
and intensity of attitudes. The muscular movements are measured electronically 
through a process called electromyography (EMG), which specifically measures 
the electrical activity of the muscles. When people are happy or sad, different 
muscles in the face contract. Much of the time, this can be seen. For example, 
when someone is unhappy, their brow may contract into a frown, and when they 
are happy, the corners of their mouth will turn upwards. However, facial move­
ments related to emotional or attitudinal experiences cannot always be seen. EMG 
allows researchers to examine subtle facial movements. Cacioppo and Petty (1979) 
used this technique to examine people’s attitudes. They asked participants to listen 
to a speech that either opposed or supported their views on alcohol possession or 
university student housing visiting rules. Participants’ EMG activity corresponded 
to the direction and intensity of their attitudes. Specifically, participants who 
opposed the speech showed more activity in the brow muscles associated with 
frowning and disapproval, whereas those in favour showed more activity in the 
muscles associated with smiling.
In recent years, advances in neuroscience have afforded researchers another 
way to measure attitudes – to observe the brain’s responses to attitude objects. 
This is not a straightforward process. Attitudes are defined as evaluations or 
appraisals, and so are rather abstract concepts that may not translate into any 
particular psychological mechanism. If they do not, attempts to observe them in 
the brain may be misplaced (Amodio and Harmon­Jones, 2012). Nonetheless, 
some researchers have had success in capturing neural correlates of at least some 
aspects of attitudes. One approach to this is to use event­related potentials (ERPs), 
which can be observed using electroencephalogram equipment. As we saw in 
Chapter 1, this approach is particularly well suited to capturing rapid, short­term 
neural responses to stimuli. Crites and Cacioppo (1996) observed exaggerated 
P300 responses (associated with attention, arousal and updating of beliefs) in 
response to attitude objects that participants disliked. Cunningham, Espinet, 
DeYoung and Zelazo (2005) found that stimulus concepts rated as ‘bad’ (e.g., 
murder, terrorism, immigration) triggered these P300 responses in the right hemi­
sphere of the brain, whereas objects rated as ‘good’ (e.g., love, babies, technology) 
triggered the same responses in the left hemisphere. These findings suggest the 
intriguing possibility that, to some extent, the brain hemispheres are specialized 
for positive and negative attitudes. 
Another approach is functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), a ‘brain­
mapping’ technique that tracks which regions of the brain are being activated by 
monitoring changes in blood flow. In keeping with Amodio and Harmon­Jones’s 
(2012) observation that attitudes are not psychological processes, many brain

this enhances the illusion that

these conditions than they

regions are activated in response to negative and positive attitude objects 
(Cunningham, Raye and Johnson, 2004). The amygdala, which is strongly associ­
ated with emotion, is activated when positively evaluated stimuli are presented 
(Zald, 2003), and still more strongly in the presence of negatively evaluated stimuli 
(LeDoux, 2000). Researchers have tried examining fMRI and ERP readings to 
explore the neuroscience of prejudice, and findings reveal that multiple areas of 
the brain are involved (Ibáñez, Haye, González et al., 2009). Perhaps the most 
interesting finding to emerge from this line of research is that neural responses 
associated with error recognition and cognitive control appear very quickly in 
response to other­race faces. This suggests that the inhibition of racial prejudice 
may be engrained in the brain and may occur even in the absence of a conscious 
effort to control the bias (Amodio, Harmon­Jones, Devine et al., 2004). 
Although the use of neuroscience to assess attitudes is in its infancy and is beset 
by problems, there has been a lot of research on the use of performance measures 
to assess attitudes. Performance measures borrow from the techniques and concepts 
of cognitive psychology, and assess reaction time and accuracy of responding on 
computerized tasks (Gawronski and Bodenhausen, 2011). The two most commonly 
used performance measures of attitude have been the go/no­go association task or 
GNAT (Nosek and Banaji, 2001), and the implicit Association Test (iAT) (Greenwald, 
McGhee and Schwartz, 1998). Of these two, the IAT is used most often, and is 
featured below in the Ethics and research methods box.

The implicit Association Test (iAT)
Participants in an IAt study typically sit behind a computer 
and are asked to press different keys to match concepts 
during a series of trials. For example, in the first trial, 
participants may be asked to tap a key on the left-hand 
side of the keyboard if they see a word they associate with 
‘good’ and the right-hand key when they see a word that 
is associated with ‘bad’. they do so for a series of words 
and their reaction time is measured. In the second trial, 
participants may be asked to perform a similar task but 
this time matching two different concepts. For example, 
they may be asked to tap left when they see a word they 
associate with ‘me’ and right when they see a word 
associated with ‘them’. Again, their reaction time is 
measured. the third trial gets a little more complicated. 
here, participants may be asked to tap left when they see 
a word associated with either ‘me’ or ‘good’ and right 
when they see a word associated with either ‘them’ or 
‘bad’. their reaction times are again recorded by the 
experimenter. Finally, on the fourth trial, participants may 
be asked to tap left when they see a word associated with 
either ‘me’ or ‘bad’ and right when they see a word 
associated with either ‘them’ or ‘good’. on which trial 
would you expect participants to be slowest? research 
suggests that participants are typically slowest to respond 
on the final trial. Before reading on, think why this might 
happen. Why do you think participants are slowest on the 
trials when they are asked to respond when they see 
words associated with ‘me’ and ‘bad’ or ‘them’ and ‘good’? 
Greenwald et al. (1998) argue that the IAt tests people’s 
automatic preference for some classes of stimuli over 
others. It is based on the idea that attitudes are associative 
mental networks and that associations are stronger if an 
attitude exists than when it does not. so, people will be 
able to more quickly link concepts that are related (for 
them) than those that are not. thus, in the example above, 
‘me’ or ‘good’ responses should be faster than ‘me’ or ‘bad’ 
responses – after all, people tend not to think of 
themselves as bad, so the association between ‘me’ and 

177
The social judge
‘bad’ should therefore be less accessible. on the other 
hand, ‘them’ and ‘bad’ associations are typically stronger, 
so people are often faster at responding to this pairing. to 
give another example, if a student dislikes university 
lecturers, they will be likely to respond ‘yes’ more quickly 
to words like ‘nasty’, and ‘no’ to words like ‘nice’ than if 
they had no negative attitude towards university lecturers. 
many studies have used the IAt to examine implicit 
attitudes towards racial groups (e.g., mcConnell and 
Liebold, 2001), gender attitudes (e.g., Greenwald, Nosek 
and Banaji, 2003) and homosexuality (e.g., steffens and 
Buchner, 2003; see Greenwald, Poehlman, Uhlmann and 
Banaji, 2009 for a recent review). the popularity of the IAt 
even led to the publication of a tongue-in-cheek 
suggestion that since there are no people left alive who 
have not done the IAt, dead people should be exhumed 
and asked to do it (Bones and Johnson, 2007). 
As well as satire, the IAt has attracted many serious 
criticisms. For example, some researchers have shown that 
responses to the IAt – said to be a measure of the extent to 
which a person endorses evaluative associations – do not 
correlate very well with other, more explicit attitude 
measures (e.g., Karpinski and hilton, 2001). Perhaps, 
therefore, the IAt may be a better measure of the 
associations a person has been exposed to rather than the 
extent to which they endorse the associations themselves. 
however, this criticism may miss the basic point of dual 
attitude theories, in that implicit attitudes are supposed to 
be different from explicit attitudes (e.g., Bagenstos, 2007; 
Gawronski and Bodenhausen, 2011; rydell, mcConnell and 
mackie, 2008). Further, the correlation is weak but 
statistically reliable, as we would expect (Greenwald et 
al., 2009). Another, perhaps more serious problem is that 
although the IAt is designed partly to circumvent the 
problem of socially desirable responding, with practice, 
people can fake it (steffens, 2004). Finally, other social 
psychologists have criticized the IAt on a number of 
dimensions, such as the viability of the underlying 
association model itself, that is, the reasoning behind why 
IAt effects occur, and the difficulties in interpreting IAt 
scores (Fiedler, messner and Bluemke, 2006; mitchell and 
tetlock, 2006). Nevertheless, the popularity of the IAt as a 
measure of implicit attitudes is remarkable. As of June 
2012, the original article (Greenwald et al., 1998) had 
been cited 3,821 times in articles on Google scholar.
Questions
1 research on implicit prejudice inevitably has political 
repercussions. For example, some scholars have argued 
that the ubiquity of implicit prejudice uncovered by the 
IAt and similar measures highlights the need for 
affirmative action programmes in employment. since 
unconscious bias against minority groups is 
everywhere, the argument goes, a deliberate bias 
towards them needs to be introduced to counteract it 
(Jolls and sunstein, 2006; Kang and Banaji, 2006). It has 
also been seriously argued that as part of recruitment 
and hiring processes, employers should consider 
running applicants for jobs through the IAt (e.g., Ayres, 
2001). What are the arguments for and against the use 
of the IAt in hiring decisions – is it legitimate not to hire 
someone because they come out as prejudiced on the 
IAt? Consider the ethical, scientific and logistical 
arguments for and against the use of this technology.

Thinking and feeling
The relationship between explicit and implicit attitudes
Implicit and explicit attitudes tend, for the most part, to be positively correlated 
(Gawronski and Bodenhausen, 2011; Wilson, Lindsey and Schooler, 2002). For 
example, your attitudes to your best friends are likely (for the most part) to be 
positive whether they are measured on a self­report scale, or with a reaction time 
performance measure like the IAT, or even if we were to use measures from physi­
ology and neuroscience. Nonetheless, they differ in many interesting ways (Rydell 
et al., 2008; Wilson, Lindsey and Schooler, 2002), which are displayed in Table 4.1. 
Broadly speaking, we can say that it is harder for people to deliberately change 
their own or others’ implicit attitudes, as compared to their explicit attitudes, 
through appeals to logic and the other normal techniques of persuasion (e.g., 
Petty, Tormala, Briñol and Jarvis, 2006). However, implicit attitudes to new atti­
tude objects may be formed more quickly than explicit ones. You may display a 
subtle negative or positive bias towards a person or group, for example, before 
you can report any negative thoughts or feelings towards them (Ashburn­Nardo, 
Voils and Monteith, 2001; Gregg, Seibt and Banaji, 2006). Although implicit atti­
tudes are slower to change, they can be highly dependent on the situation. For 
example, given the widespread prejudice felt towards Roma Gypsies around 
Europe, a typical European might find negative appraisals like ‘dishonest’ quickly 
activated when they see a Gypsy in a shopping centre, but at the same time, posi­
tive appraisals like ‘musical’ at a folk festival (for a demonstration of the same 
logic with attitudes to Black people in the USA, see Barden, Maddux, Petty and 
Brewer, 2004). As we have seen, implicit attitudes are more likely to be socially or 
personally unacceptable than explicit attitudes (Degner and Wentura, 2008; 
Rudman and Kilianski, 2000), because people are reluctant to admit to others 
(Tourangeau and Yan, 2007) or themselves (von Hippel and Trivers, 2011) that 
they possess them. Another key difference is that implicit attitudes are more likely 
than explicit attitudes to influence our unplanned, spontaneous behaviours. For 
example, Dovidio, Kawakami and Gaertner (2002) found that implicit racial bias, 
as measured by the IAT, more strongly affected negative body language during 
interactions across racial boundaries. In another study by Hoffman and Friese 
(2008), female German university students with positive implicit attitudes to 
sweets were more likely to eat sweets in the laboratory, independent of their 
explicit attitudes. The effect of implicit attitudes was heightened when the students 
had consumed alcohol, suggesting that implicit attitudes are more likely to influ­
ence our behaviours when we are unable to devote controlled cognitive processes 
to ‘stop them’ from working on us. 
Why are implicit and explicit attitudes different from each other? Probably the 
most influential current theoretical account of the implicit­explicit duality is 
Gawronski and Bodenhausen’s (2006, 2007, 2011) associative-propositional evalua-
tion (APE) model. According to this model, implicit and explicit attitudes are the 
behavioral outcomes of separate mental processes. Implicit attitudes spring from 
associative processes, such as evaluative conditioning. Associative processes can 
also be triggered by similarities between the stimulus and something in memory.

179
The social judge
Ever found yourself liking (or disliking) someone partly because they remind you 
of someone you used to know? This phenomenon was first noticed by Freud, 
who called it transference, and it is one of Freud’s ideas to receive empirical 
support (e.g., Andersen, Reznik and Manzella, 1996). When these associations are 
activated in memory, an implicit evaluation will follow. On the other hand, the 
APE model holds that explicit attitudes spring from propositional processes. These 
are akin to beliefs or conclusions, and are defined as the validation of information 
that is implied by activated associations. Thus, for example, you might have a 
positive implicit attitude to a person simply because they have been paired with, 
or are similar to, another person who you value. This positive attitude might show 
up in an IAT, for example, or in some other indirect test of reaction time or accu­
racy. However, your implicit positive attitude may not necessarily lead you to 
draw the propositional conclusion that they really are a nice or attractive person. 
Whether you do so will depend partly on whether you think this conclusion is 
logically warranted, given what you know about them. 
The APE model is relatively new, but evidence already suggests that it predicts 
and explains effects that are both interesting and useful. For example, consider 
two ways of reducing prejudiced attitudes towards disadvantaged outgroups – an 
important topic in social psychology, to which we return at great length in Chapter 
12. One approach is to negate stereotypes (e.g., to practise repeatedly saying 
‘Gypsies are not thieves’). Another is to affirm counter­stereotypes (e.g., to 
repeatedly say ‘Gypsies are honest’). Both techniques may work to reduce explicit 
prejudice – after doing this for long enough, people are likely to endorse preju­
diced statements about Gypsies, since they are reminding themselves that many 
Gypsies are honest, that it is not warranted to label an entire group as thieves and 
so on. However, one technique is likely to have disastrous effects on implicit 
prejudice towards Gypsies. Which one, do you think? Since implicit attitudes are 
built up by associative processes including evaluative conditioning, the negation 
task has a cruelly ironic effect. It repeatedly pairs ‘Gypsies’ and ‘thieves’, so that in

Thinking and feeling
the very act of trying not to be prejudiced, a person 
who repeatedly says ‘Gypsies are not thieves’ is 
actually training their associative mental systems to 
produce an even stronger negative emotional reac­
tion to Gypsies. Much the same logic, in relation to 
racial prejudice in the USA, was demonstrated in an 
experiment by Gawronski, Deutsch, Mbrikou et al. 
(2008) (see Figure 4.11).
Attitudes and behaviours
Attitudes are important to people. But to what 
extent do attitudes predict what people do? This 
question has occupied social psychologists for 
many years, and is central to the practical significance of attitudes. For example, 
are attitudes towards minority groups important if they have little effect on how 
people treat members of minority groups or influence what people say about 
them? The link between attitudes and behaviours is, therefore, an important 
issue to study. In a classic study, LaPiere (1934) demonstrated that attitudes do 
not necessarily determine what people do. At the time the study was conducted, 
psychologists generally agreed that attitudes were predispositions to behave in a 
certain manner (Allport, 1924), so they assumed that attitudes would be closely 
related to behaviour. LaPiere investigated if this link would exist in the study of 
prejudiced attitudes. Over the course of two years, he travelled around the USA 
with a young Chinese couple. In doing so, he stopped at 184 restaurants and 66 
hotels. At all these establishments (with the exception of one), the Chinese 
couple were served courteously and politely. However, after this study, LaPiere 
contacted each establishment and asked the proprietors if they would serve 
Chinese clientele. Overwhelmingly, the business owners said that they would 
not serve Chinese visitors; out of 128 businesses that responded, a staggering 92 
per cent said they would not. Thus, LaPiere’s demonstration suggests that atti­
tudes do not always predict people’s behaviour. A more modern example might 
be how people respond to ‘political correctness’. Negative attitudes have not 
necessarily disappeared, instead people monitor their behaviour so that it 
becomes more socially acceptable. Attitudes do not, therefore, always predict 
what people do. 
Other research points to a tenuous link between attitudes and behaviours. For 
example, Wicker (1969) noted that the correlation between the two – based on a 
comparison between responses to questionnaires and actual behaviours – is typi­
cally lower than 0.3. This is relatively low considering that a perfect correlation is 
1.0 and represents only a low or moderate effect size. These findings call into 
question the validity of questionnaire methods that examine people’s attitudes. If 
there is little link between people’s attitudes and what they actually do, then

how prejudice reduction 
techniques can backfire if they 
are not informed by sound 
theory and evidence.

The social judge
perhaps social psychologists are focusing too much time on a construct that means 
very little to social reality. From your own experience, you will probably be able 
to think of many instances where your attitudes do not match your behaviour. 
For example, you might think that your best friend’s taste in music is awful but 
you do not tell them this because you do not want to jeopardize the friendship. 
Instead, you say nothing or compliment your friend’s taste in music and so your 
attitude is inconsistent with your behaviour.
Further, there is a growing body of research demonstrating that automatic or 
spontaneous behaviour sometimes completely bypasses conscious attitudes. You 
may recall from Chapter 3 Bargh, Chen and Burrows’ (1996) study in which 
participants walked more slowly after seeing words that were related to stereo­
types of the elderly. This kind of automatic behaviour has been demonstrated in 
many other studies. For example, priming people with achievement goals leads 
them to persevere more with difficult tasks (Bargh, Gollwitzer, Lee­Chai et al., 
2001). Priming people with French music in a market makes people buy more 
French wine and playing German music makes people buy more German wine 
(North, Hargreaves and McKendrick, 1999). Further, Dijksterhuis and van Knip­
penberg (1998) subliminally primed participants with the concept of either profes­
sors (educated, intellectual) or football hooligans (uneducated, non­intellectual). 
They found that participants who had been primed with the concept of professors 
performed better on a general knowledge test than participants who had been 
primed with football hooligans. 
However, on many occasions, people’s attitudes and behaviours are consistent 
with conscious attitudes. For example, you might hold strong left­wing political 
views and behave in support of these attitudes by becoming a member of progres­
sive political parties and even participating in political rallies. People who hold 
negative attitudes about particular social and ethnic groups will often display 
prejudice towards those groups. It is therefore too pessimistic to say that attitudes 
are not important. Indeed, social psychologists agree that it is less of a question of 
whether attitudes determine behaviours at all, but when they do so. Social 
psychological research has focused more on this question in recent years. Specifi­
cally, while attitudes do indeed predict behaviour on many occasions (Bohner and 
Wänke, 2002; Kraus, 1995; Petty and Krosnick, 1995), the situation and aspects of 
the attitudes themselves are important. Other features such as values and habits 
also predict the extent to which attitudes and behaviours are linked.
Situational factors
It is not always possible to express or act on our attitudes. As in the above example, 
we often do not want to hurt people’s feelings, so we cannot openly express nega­
tive attitudes to their ethnicity or their most recent haircut. Likewise, acting on 
our political beliefs can sometimes be offensive because not everybody holds the 
same beliefs. Forcing one’s attitudes on others can have negative consequences, so 
much of the time people keep their attitudes to themselves. Thus, there are many 
situational constraints on the link between attitudes and behaviours. In many 

182
Thinking and feeling
cases, situational constraints prevent the expression of attitudes (Ajzen and Fish­
bein, 1980; Fazio, Roskos­Ewoldsen and Powell, 1994). In most of these cases, 
these situational constraints relate to the strength of social norms and conventions. 
On the other hand, many situational factors facilitate the expression of atti­
tudes. For example, it becomes easier to express one’s political attitudes in an 
online political forum or at a rally. Thus, perhaps unsurprisingly, people tend to 
seek out situations where they are able to express their attitudes (Snyder and 
Ickes, 1985) and, as a result, the attitudes can be strengthened (DeBono and 
Snyder, 1995). The expression of attitudes is often determined by situational 
factors but, at the same time, attitudes determine what situations people choose 
to find themselves in. 
Attitudinal factors
Aspects of the attitudes themselves can determine the extent to which they are 
associated with behaviours. One factor is how the attitudes were formed in the 
first place. Some evidence suggests that attitudes formed on the basis of experi­
ences are more strongly associated with behaviours than attitudes based on obser­
vation or other indirect ways (Fazio and Zanna, 1981; Haddock, Rothman, Reber 
and Schwarz, 1999). For example, Haddock et al. demonstrated that the strength 
of people’s attitudes towards assisted suicide was influenced by people’s experi­
ence of having a direct encounter with assisted suicide. In general, attitudes that 
have been formed through a direct experience are more closely related to actual 
behaviour (Doll and Ajzen 1992; Regan and Fazio, 1977). 
The strength of the attitude is also important. In short, the stronger the atti­
tudes, the more likely they influence behaviours (Holland, Verplanken and van 
Knippenberg, 2002; Petkova, Ajzen and Driver, 1995). Attitude strength is deter­
mined by three factors. First, the accessibility of the attitude is important, that is, 
how easily it comes to mind and how quickly it can be expressed (Eagly and 
Chaiken, 1998). Stronger attitudes tend to be more accessible and therefore exert a 
stronger influence on behaviour (Fazio, 1986). Fazio argues that accessible atti­
tudes are more useful because they are quickly retrieved from memory and thus 
more easily help people make decisions. They can be automatically activated and 
have a stronger impact on behaviour (Fazio, Blascovich and Driscoll, 1992; Fazio 
and Powell, 1997). At the same time, highly accessible attitudes can be resistant to 
change and can hinder decision making in situations where attitude objects change 
(Fazio, Ledbetter and Towles­Schwen (2000). Second, the intensity of the atti­
tude – or how strong an emotional reaction is evoked – influences attitude strength 
(Crano, 1995; Fishbein, 1967; Krosnick, 1988; Sivacek and Crano, 1982). Finally, 
the extent to which a person knows a lot about the issue or object in question 
influences attitude strength (Krosnick and Smith, 1994). These attitudinal factors 
all predict the correspondence between attitudes and behaviours (e.g., Holland, 
Verplanken and van Knippenberg, 2002). 
Attitude–behaviour consistency is determined by the specificity, as well as the 
strength, of attitudes. Some attitudes are focused on specific objects or situations 

183
The social judge
and some are more general. For example, a person might be prejudiced against 
immigrants in general, or they may focus their negative attitudes on one specific 
immigrant group. Research suggests that the link between attitudes and behaviour 
is closest when the level of specificity is more closely matched (Ajzen and Fish­
bein, 1980, 2005; Fazio et al., 1994). Ajzen and Fishbein (1980) argued that one 
reason why many studies have failed to find a close correspondence between atti­
tudes and behaviours is because researchers have tried to predict specific behav­
iours from general attitudes. To give an example, whether one helps a person of a 
specific immigrant group is more likely to be associated with their beliefs about 
that group in particular, rather than immigrants in general. A study by Davidson 
and Jaccard (1979) supports this argument. They found that women’s general atti­
tudes towards birth control did not predict their use of the contraceptive pill as 
well as more specific attitudes such as their attitudes towards using the contracep­
tive pill within the next two years. In summary, the more specific the attitude in 
question, the more closely it is likely to be linked to behaviour. 
Values and ideology
Priming values also influences people’s choices so they become more aligned with 
their values (Verplanken and Holland, 2002), such as when people are primed to 
think about the environment, they behave in a way that is friendly to the environ­
ment. Ideology is a similar construct to values. As we saw earlier, this concept 
refers to an interrelated and widely shared set of beliefs that serves to explain the 
social situation (Thompson, 1990). Ideologies typically refer to social or political 
contexts (e.g., sociopolitical and religious ideologies). They can influence values, 
attitudes and intentions to commit behaviours (Crandall, 1994).
Habits and individual differences
A person’s habits can also predict their behaviour on future occasions. For 
example, if a woman gets into the habit of conducting breast self­examination 
every month, this will be a strong predictor of her intentions to continue doing 
so. In a study that supports this hypothesis, Trafimow (2000) found that univer­
sity students who habitually used condoms during sex reported that they 
intended to do so in future sexual encounters and, specifically, on the next occa­
sion. It has been argued that when behaviours are habitual, people do not need to 
think about their attitudes or whether their actions are appropriate. In some 
respects, the attitude­congruent behaviour becomes automatic (e.g., Norman and 
Conner, 2006). 
Individual differences can also determine the link between attitudes and behav­
iours. For example, a person’s consistency in answering questions about their 
personality is more likely to be higher in their behaviours on relevant dimensions 
(Bem and Allen, 1974). To give an example, a person who typically responds to an 
extraversion/introversion scale in the same way will typically behave in an extra­
verted or introverted manner in social interactions more so than someone whose 
responses are less consistent.

How do attitudes predict behaviours?
In addition to knowing the conditions under which attitudes predict behaviour, 
social psychologists are also interested in how it all happens. The theory of planned 
behaviour (and its predecessor, the theory of reasoned action) proposes that people 
make a decision to behave in a particular way as a result of a sequence of rational 
thought processes (Ajzen and Fishbein, 1980; Azjen, 1991). First, a person 
considers various behavioural options and their consequences and possible 
outcomes. These options are evaluated and a decision is made to perform a behav­
iour or not. This decision is then indicated by behavioral intentions, which are 
argued to be a key predictor of whether or not the behaviour is actually performed. 
These intentions are further influenced by a person’s attitudes towards the behav­
iour (whether they think the behaviour will have positive or negative conse­
quences), subjective norms (what people think others will think about the 
behaviour) and perceived behavioural control (whether or not a person thinks 
they can perform the behaviour).
The theory works as follows. If a person is considering an action such as joining 
a progressive political party, the question of whether or not they do so can be 
addressed by the theory of planned behaviour (see Figure 4.12). Specifically, the 
intention to join the political party depends on the person’s intentions to do so, 
which are determined by their attitudes towards the behaviour (is joining the 
party a good thing to do?), subjective 
norms (do others think that joining 
the party is a good thing to do?) and 
perceived behavioural control (is it 
easy to join the party?). If these 
factors are satisfactory and intentions 
are strong, the person is more likely 
to join the political party. If, on the 
other hand, one of the determinants 
of intentions is not favourable (e.g., the person’s closest friends abhor that partic­
ular political party), the chances of the person forming the intention and eventu­
ally performing the behaviour are reduced.
Research supports the principles of the theory. For example, Ajzen and Madden 
(1986) found that students’ grades were only influenced by their own predictions 
when they took their own abilities into account. It is perhaps unsurprising that 
students wish to achieve good grades – after all, they are valued (attitudes). Also, 
subjective norms suggest that good grades are desirable in general. However, 
unless the issue of behavioural control is met, the predictive value of the attitude is 
diminished. In a study of nine behaviours that range from relatively easy to 
control (e.g., taking health supplements) or relatively difficult (e.g., getting a good 
night’s sleep), Madden, Ellen and Ajzen (1992) found that perceived control influ­
enced the predictive accuracy of intentions and actions. Further, the easier the 
behaviour was seen to be controllable, the more it predicted actual behaviour. The 
theory of planned behaviour has been applied extensively in health psychology, 
Theory of planned behaviour 
theory concerning how 
attitudes predict behaviour. 
It argues that several factors, 
including subjective norms, 
attitudes towards the 
behaviour and perceived 
behavioural control, 
determine behavioural 
intentions concerning the 
behaviour, and, in turn, 
intentions strongly determine

such as in the study of safe sex behaviours (e.g., Sheeran and Taylor, 1999), 
smoking (Godin, Valois, Lepage and Desharnais, 1992) and alcohol consumption 
(e.g., Conner, Warren, Close and Sparks, 1999). It has also been applied to the 
study of driving behaviour (e.g., Parker, Manstead and Stradling, 1995). The 
theory has been found to be good at predicting what people do (for a review, see 
Armitage and Conner, 2001). In recent years, the theory of planned behaviour has 
been supplemented with Gollwitzer’s (1993, 1999) concept of implementation 
intentions. If people not only form an intention to do or achieve something, but 
also specify exactly when and how they will do so, the link between intentions 
and behaviours becomes much stronger (see Applying social psychology at the 
end of the chapter for more details). 
Unlike the theory of reasoned action and the theory of planned behaviour, the 
attitude to behaviour process model focuses on situations where a person does not 
have time to carefully reflect on different behaviours and their consequences. 
Many times, people need to react and perform a behaviour quickly. How do they 
do this? Fazio (1989) has argued that sometimes behaviours are determined by our 
attitudes in a more automatic manner. Encountering the attitude object, or a rele­
vant cue to the object, may automatically activate your attitude (i.e., your evalua­
tion) of that object. The extent to which your attitude is activated depends on the 
strength of the mental association between the object and its evaluation. Once 
these attitudes are activated, they will shape your perceptions of the object and the 
situation. Our awareness of social norms (what is generally acceptable and unac­
ceptable) is also activated. Put together, and all happening very quickly, these 
factors influence our behaviour. So, for example, if a random person interrupts a 
private conversation you are having with a friend, this event triggers attitudes 
about people who interrupt. You are also likely to think of the general social 
norms surrounding conversations – one of which is that people generally know 
not to interrupt private talk between friends. You then quickly perceive the event 
(probably that this person is rude) and you are likely to behave accordingly by 
asking the person to leave you and your friend alone. So, this theory proposes that 
people behave rather spontaneously when their attitudes are activated.
Cognitive dissonance
So far, we have discussed the extent to which people’s behaviours are consistent 
with their attitudes, when attitudes predict behaviours, and how this occurs. We 
know our attitudes do not always predict our behaviours, and this, of course, has 
consequences. Think of how it makes you feel when you comment positively on 
your friend’s recent disastrous haircut. What emotions do you experience when 
you articulate an attitude you don’t really mean? Most of us would agree that we 
feel uncomfortable. After all, we are not being true to ourselves. Another classic 
example is the fact that most people believe the evidence of a strong link between 
smoking and lung cancer, and yet a significant percentage of the population 

186
Thinking and feeling
continues to smoke. People know they are not doing the right thing by their 
bodies, yet still continue with the behaviour. Social psychologists call this being in 
a state of cognitive dissonance (Festinger, 1957). Cognitive dissonance is defined as 
the unpleasant psychological state that occurs when people notice that their atti­
tudes and behaviours (or their various attitudes) are inconsistent with each other. 
The study of cognitive dissonance has uncovered one of the most profound, 
surprising and important messages of social psychology – while our attitudes 
influence our behaviour, our behaviour also strongly influences our attitudes. 
What we do affects how we think and feel. 
Cognitive dissonance was empirically demonstrated in a classic study by 
Festinger and Carlsmith (1959). They had people participate in a boring experi­
ment where they were asked to perform repetitive tasks such as turning pegs on a 
board and removing the pegs one by one and then putting them all back. At the 
end of the study, the experimenter asked the participant for help. If they agreed to 
help, their task was to convince the next ‘participant’ (actually, a confederate) that 
the task was enjoyable and interesting. The payment for telling this lie was either 
$1 – obviously a measly sum for lying – or $20 – which in the late 1950s was a 
princely sum. Festinger and Carlsmith predicted that participants who agreed to 
describe the task as enjoyable to another participant would be put in a state of 
cognitive dissonance: they had volunteered to perform a behaviour that was 
inconsistent with their attitudes. Since $1 is not enough to justify lying, Festinger 
and Carlsmith predicted that participants’ attitudes 
towards the experiment would change. Participants 
could not reasonably attribute their lie to the mone­
tary reward, and so to resolve the inconsistency 
between their behaviour (saying the task was inter­
esting) and attitudes (they found the task boring), 
they would have to revise their attitudes (so privately 
evaluate the task as less boring). Findings confirmed 
this hypothesis. As can be seen in Figure 4.13, 
participants in the $1 reward condition rated the 
experiment as less boring than control participants, 
who were not asked to convince the confederate that 
the task was interesting. Further, in a condition 
where participants were paid $20 to lie to the participants, they rated the experi­
ment as relatively boring. Since $20 is a handsome reward for lying, participants 
could resolve the dissonance between their attitudes and behaviour by attributing 
their behaviour to the reward. This is striking finding: paying participants more to 
convince others that a task is interesting caused them to think they enjoyed it less. 
This is a clear example of what happens to people’s attitudes and behaviours 
when they experience cognitive dissonance. Festinger (1957) argued that people’s 
motivation to reduce dissonance, rather than changing people’s behaviours, can 
actually change their attitudes. In other words, to deal with dissonance, people 
often change the way they think rather than the way they behave. Cooper and

The social judge
Fazio (1984) argued that four conditions need to be satisfied for dissonance to 
produce these types of effects:
1 The individual has to realize that the inconsistency has negative consequences: If 
the inconsistency has no negative consequences, it is unlikely that people will 
feel tension between the attitude and the behaviour. For example, if people 
reflect on the evidence that smoking causes ill health and the evidence is 
dismissed, no tension will occur. On the other hand, people who endorse the 
attitude that the behaviour (smoking) causes ill health are likely to experience 
cognitive dissonance (Cooper and Brehm, 1971).
2 The individual has to take responsibility for the action: Specifically, for disso­
nance to occur, the person needs to feel responsible for the attitude­incongruent 
behaviour. In the case of smoking, people need to think they are freely respon­
sible for the decision to smoke. If people feel they have been told what to do, or 
coerced into performing the behaviour, the behaviour will not necessarily be 
inconsistent with their attitudes, so dissonance is unlikely to occur (Linder, 
Cooper and Jones, 1967).
3 The individual has to experience physiological arousal: Dissonance is an uncom­
fortable physical experience (Croyle and Cooper, 1983). For smokers, they 
probably feel unhappy or anxious that their smoking could cause them ill health. 
4 The individual has to attribute the feeling of physiological arousal to the action itself: 
People need to be able to make the link between the feeling (e.g., being unhappy or 
anxious) and the behaviour (e.g., smoking) (Losch and Cacioppo, 1990). 
These conditions produce a state of cognitive dissonance. Studies of cognitive 
dissonance suggest that people who are in a state of tension will change their atti­
tudes to be more consistent with the behaviour they have performed. In many 
cases, the tension is fairly minimal. For example, it requires little commitment for 
a participant to tell another participant the white lie that a boring study is inter­
esting. However, there is some evidence to suggest that the state of tension is 
especially strong when the inconsistencies are self­relevant, that is, they compro­
mise people’s positive sense of self (Baumeister, 1982; Steele, 1988). The need to 
reconcile inconsistent behaviours and attitudes therefore becomes stronger. For 
example, imagine putting up with an unhappy long­term relationship or working 
in a dead­end job. Because the feeling of dissonance is often chronically uncom­
fortable, people usually want to do something about it. According to dissonance 
theory (Aronson, 1968; Festinger, 1957), there are various ways in which people 
can reduce dissonance so that they feel better about what they are doing. 
Reducing dissonance
First, people can approach the dissonance directly. In other words, they can focus 
on explicitly addressing the discrepancies between their attitudes and behaviours. 
There are various different ways to do this. First, people can change their attitudes 
so that they are more consistent with their behaviours. In the case of making 
comments about a friend’s haircut, a person can attempt to change their attitude 

188
Thinking and feeling
about the haircut by carefully evaluating it and convincing themselves that it is not 
such a bad haircut after all. A way of convincing oneself in this way is to find new 
information that supports the inconsistency with the behaviour. For example, 
similar haircuts might have been praised in the popular press or worn by a top 
model, supporting one’s comments to the friend that the haircut is a good look. In 
short, a person can change their attitudes so that they closely match their behav­
iours. This everyday way of reducing cognitive dissonance is well supported in the 
literature. For example, Elliot and Devine (1994) showed that the discomfort expe­
rienced by attitude –behaviour inconsistency could be alleviated by attitude change.
Another way to reduce dissonance is simply by reducing the importance of the 
inconsistency. For example, we might decide that it is not such a bad thing to say 
one thing about a friend’s haircut and mean something else. In other words, we 
might trivialize the discrepancy between our attitudes and behaviours. To do so, 
we may argue that the attitudes are not important in the first place, so if they are 
inconsistent with what we actually say or do, this is not really much of a problem. 
One study suggests that people do this with respect to cigarette smoking. In a 
study with an undergraduate student sample, Pervin and Yatko (1965) found that 
smokers reduced dissonance by minimizing the validity of anti­cancer research 
findings and the personal danger of smoking. 
Another approach is less direct. Instead of addressing the attitude–behaviour 
discrepancy explicitly, people may instead seek to reduce the discomfort associ­
ated with the discrepancy (Steele, 1988). Steele argues that the choice of such 
strategies occurs when attitudes are more important and we do not want to change 
them. For example, a person might hold strong views in support of one political 
party but compliment a friend’s views in support of dubious opposing policies. 
This is likely to feel uncomfortable and one way to reduce the discomfort is to 
engage in a process of self-affirmation. Here, people reaffirm positive thoughts 
about themselves. In the above example, they may remember they attended a 
political rally the week before and they are an active campaigner for their party. 
By affirming their positive self­view and reminding themselves of the importance 
of their attitudes, people can reduce the discomfort created by dissonance (e.g., 
Elliot and Devine, 1994). Research also suggests that there are other ways in which 
people can reduce dissonance. For example, expressing positive affect can make 
people feel better (Cooper, Fazio and Rhodewalt, 1978) and consuming alcohol 
also helps (Steele, Southwick and Critchlow, 1981). 
Thus, there are several options for people to reduce cognitive dissonance. 
However, it is also clear that people do not always seek to reduce dissonance. 
Think, for example, of smokers who know all the evidence of the dangers of 
smoking and yet still continue to smoke. Why do they do this? In many cases, the 
addiction to smoking prevents a person from dealing with the discrepancy between 
attitudes and behaviours. A smoker may know that smoking is harmful but they do 
not seek to reduce dissonance because the addiction overrides the need to do so. 
This also raises the question of just how negative the state of dissonance actually is. 
If people live with it relatively easily, can we necessarily say that it produces nega­

tive affect? The answer is yes. Harmon­Jones (2000) examined if dissonance makes 
people feel bad. He had participants write counterattitudinal essays (essays in 
which they were asked to express views contrary to their own) – in this case, they 
were asked to write that a boring paragraph was interesting. Some of the partici­
pants were asked to perform the task under conditions of low choice, that is, they 
were simply asked to argue that the boring paragraph was interesting. The 
remaining participants, however, were asked to do this under conditions of high 
choice, that is, they were told they could write what they wanted but it would be 
appreciated if they could write that the boring paragraph was interesting. In this 
condition only, dissonance was predicted because participants were expressing, of 
their own choice, attitudes inconsistent with their own beliefs. Findings confirmed 
this prediction. Participants in the high choice condi­
tion felt more discomfort and greater negative affect 
than participants in the low choice condition. This 
effect occurred despite the fact that participants threw 
their essays away afterwards. Thus, the negative feel­
ings could not have been due to the concern that 
others may sanction them for their comments. In 
general, therefore, dissonance appears to make people 
feel uncomfortable (see Figure 4.14). 
This feeling of discomfort is crucial to cognitive 
dissonance theory and separates it from a closely 
related theory that we briefly encountered in Chapter 
2 – self­perception theory (Bem, 1967, 1972). Bem 
argued that since we do not have reliable knowledge of 
our own attitudes, we infer them from our behaviour. Thus, when we behave in a 
way that is inconsistent with our attitudes, we unconsciously infer that our attitude 
position cannot be very strong, after all. If we say we enjoyed a task when given a 
$1 reward, rather than a $20 reward, it is a reasonable inference that we must have 
enjoyed it at some level. In order to make this inference, we do not need to go 
through aversive psychological states, neither do we need to be motivated to escape 
them. However, research has shown that people do experience discomfort in cogni­
tive dissonance experiments, much as Festinger’s (1957) model predicted (Galinsky, 
Stone and Cooper, 2000; Kiesler and Pallak, 1976). And, as we have seen, the extent 
of this emotional discomfort is related to the extent of attitude change (Elliot and 
Devine, 1994).

Biological vs. cultural influences on cognitive dissonance
From largely European and US­based studies, it cannot necessarily be concluded 
that all people experience dissonance. However, research does suggest that disso­
nance is common across cultures (Heine and Lehman, 2007). Not only is it

universal among humans, it also seems that cognitive dissonance is experienced by 
other animals, too. We will illustrate this point by describing a delightful experi­
ment by Egan, Santos and Bloom (2007) into post­decisional dissonance among 
monkeys. But first, you will need to understand what post-decisional dissonance is 
and how it relates to the theory of cognitive dissonance. The idea is that when you 
make a choice between two or more options, the fact that you have chosen one is 
dissonant with the fact that the other options also had appealing features. To 
resolve this dissonance, people need to change their attitudes by derogating the 
choice they did not make, and/or increasing their positive evaluation of their 
chosen option. Results of an early experiment by Brehm (1956) were true to this 
prediction. US consumers rated a variety of domestic appliances and were then 
allowed to choose between two they evaluated equally, to take home as a gift. 
After making their choice, participants’ evaluation of their chosen appliance 
increased, while their impression of the other appliance worsened. 
The setup of Egan et al.’s (2007) study was as follows. Monkeys were initially 
presented with two different coloured chocolate sweets (specifically, M&M’s) in 
see­through cages. In the ‘free choice’ condition of the experiment, the cage was 
open in front of both M&M’s, so the monkey could choose which one it wanted 
(the openings were placed so that the monkey could reach its preferred M&M, but 
not both at the same time). In the ‘no choice’ condition of the experiment, the 
opening to just one of the M&M’s was open, so the monkey could only reach one 
of them. After the monkey had taken the M&M, the researchers gave the monkey 
a choice between the M&M it had not taken, and a new M&M in a third colour. 
The dependent measure was how often the monkey took the new, third M&M 
rather than the one they had not taken in the first trial. What would you predict 
would happen, on the basis of post­decisional dissonance? Well, cognitive disso­
nance theory suggests that in the free choice condition, monkeys would be more 
likely to reject the M&M they had not taken in the first trial. This is because the 
appealing qualities of the non­chosen M&M are dissonant with the fact that the 
monkey had chosen the other one. This leads to a revision of attitudes – specifi­
cally, to derogation of the non­chosen M&M. Thus, when given a choice between 
this M&M and a new one, they opt for the new one. On the other hand, monkeys 
in the no choice condition experience no dissonance and do not derogate the 
M&M they could not choose in the first trial. And what were the results? They 
supported these predictions. In the no choice condition, monkeys chose the M&M 
they could not take in the first trial around 60 per cent of the time. In the free 
choice condition, they chose the M&M they did not take in the first trial only 39 
per cent of the time, preferring the new, third M&M instead. 
Alert readers may have spotted a potential problem with this experimental 
paradigm – perhaps monkeys reject the non­chosen M&M in the second trial 
simply because they dislike it. If they dislike yellow M&M’s, for example, they 
will not choose it in the first trial, nor will they choose it in the second. Hardly 
surprising, you might say. This is, in fact, a criticism of the ‘free choice’ paradigm 
in the study of post­decisional dissonance – positive attitudes to the chosen object 

191
The social judge
and negative attitudes to the rejected object may not reflect post­decisional disso­
nance but simply pre­decisional preferences (Chen and Risen, 2010; Risen and 
Chen, 2010). Egan et al. (2007) attempted to control for this by carefully pretesting 
each monkey’s preference for M&M’s. They ensured that monkeys were given 
triads of M&M’s that they had preferred equally in an earlier session. However, 
this does not guarantee that monkeys had not changed their minds since the time 
their preferences were initially tested (some days before), or that on the day of the 
main experiment, they simply liked some colours more than others. 
Fortunately, a simple experiment suggests that although this alternative inter­
pretation cannot be ruled out, the free choice paradigm does genuinely reveal that 
making a choice causes people to valorize the alternative they chose and derogate 
the alternative they did not choose. In a follow­up study, Egan, Bloom and Santos 
(2010) gave monkeys the illusion that they had chosen one of two sweets (this 
time, Skittles). They did this by showing monkeys two different Skittles, hiding 
them in a box in front of the monkey, but then covertly removing a Skittle. The 
monkey was then allowed to put its hand into the box, thinking that there were 
two Skittles, but in fact there was only one. After the monkey had taken the Skittle 
from the box, the experimenter pretended to remove the other Skittle from the 
box, to heighten the illusion that the monkey had made a free choice. In a second 
trial, the monkeys really did have a free choice, this time between the Skittle they 
had been led to believe they ‘rejected’ from the first trial and a second Skittle (see 
Figure 4.15). When they thought they 
had freely chosen not to take the Skittle 
in the first trial, they rejected it in the 
second trial, in favour of a new alterna­
tive, 60 per cent of the time. When they 
thought they had no choice the first 
time, they rejected it significantly less 
often – only 49 per cent of the time, 
which is how much you would expect 
them to reject it by chance.
The genius of this ‘blind choice’ 
paradigm is that the monkeys’ choices 
in the first trial cannot reflect their pref­
erences, since their free choice was an 
illusion. In other words, their attitudes 
could not have affected their behaviour. 
Their rejection of the second sweet in 
the following trial, compared to the 
control group who did not believe they 
had chosen, shows that choosing an 
option – or believing one has chosen an 
option – affects one’s preferences. This 
is a clear case in which behaviour affects

attitudes. Egan et al. (2010) obtained much the same results with a sample of human 
children. Also, Sharot, Velasquez and Dolan (2010) independently came up with 
another version of the blind choice paradigm and showed that adult humans respond 
in much the same way. Participants chose between two holiday packages, not 
knowing what the holiday destinations were. To give participants the illusion of 
informed choice, they were told that the holiday destinations associated with the 
two packages were flashing on the screen subliminally and that such information 
affects people’s choices. In fact, only nonsense strings of characters (e.g., &^£(%^&) 
were appearing. After making their ‘choice’ between options A and B, participants 
were told, at random, that they had chosen a holiday to Greece over a holiday to 
Thailand (or vice versa). This caused participants to subsequently rate the holiday 
they thought they had chosen more favourably than the alternative holiday. 
Thus, we can say that cognitive dissonance appears not to be unique to humans. 
It is not clear whether cognitive dissonance confers some kind of survival advan­
tage, and therefore may have evolved, or whether it is a by­product of some other 
more universal cognitive and emotional machinery possessed by humans and 
other animals alike. For all animals, human or not, the knowledge function of 
attitudes means that a consistent set of attitudes about the world is likely to be 
advantageous, that is, there is some survival advantage in preserving a consistent 
set of knowledge about the world (McGregor, Nash, Mann and Phills, 2010). 
This is not to say that culture is not important to cognitive dissonance, but rather 
than affecting the amount of cognitive dissonance that people experience, culture 
seems to affect the specific triggers that cause it. For example, Heine and Lehman 
(1997) asked Canadian and Japanese students to choose a set of 10 CDs from a 
bunch of 40. The participants were also asked to evaluate how much they would 
like to own each of the CDs they chose. After they had done so, participants were 
told they could have either the CD they rated fifth or the one they rated sixth. 
They were asked to choose and then rate the two CDs again. Results revealed that 
Canadian students rated the CDs further apart in terms of favourability than they 
did at the beginning of the experiment. In other words, they reduced dissonance by 
rating the chosen CD as more favourable (and the unchosen CD as less favourable) 
than they originally did. However, the Japanese participants did not do this. Heine 
and Lehman (1997) argued that their findings provide evidence for the importance 
of cultural factors in cognitive dissonance. Specifically, they argued that the Cana­
dian students demonstrated a more Western response to dissonance related to the 
fact that the self is more implicated in individual actions such as making decisions. 
Making good decisions is highly valued but making bad decisions poses a threat to 
self­esteem. Therefore, rating the chosen CD as more favourable is helpful because 
it restores the feeling that the course of action was correct. Japanese students, on 
the other hand, did not exhibit this Western response – arguably because in Eastern 
cultures, the self is linked less closely to individual decisions and actions. Instead, 
these are determined more by social obligations and, as a result, they are less likely 
to experience dissonance in such situations. 

193
The social judge
Hypocrisy
When attitudes and behaviour are inconsistent, the discomfort that people experi­
ence can often be likened to hypocrisy. In particular, when people say they support 
a particular attitude or behaviour, but act in a way that is inconsistent with the 
attitude or behaviour, they look (and often feel) like a hypocrite. For example, a 
person may be a strong public advocate of limiting energy usage to reduce the 
impact of climate change, but may own a large home with many rooms and many 
appliances. Perhaps this person can ‘talk the talk’ but does not ‘walk the walk’. 
One only has to think of the criticism faced by Al Gore, former US vice president 
and subject of the 2006 documentary An Inconvenient Truth, to see how detri­
mental this kind of hypocrisy – whether true or simply alleged – can be. However, 
feelings of hypocrisy like this can be useful. In particular, if people are aware they 
are publicly advocating an attitude or behaviour but behaving inconsistently, they 
can experience strong dissonance (e.g., Aronson, Fried and Stone, 1991). It is 
unlikely that the strong feelings of dissonance would be eliminated by the tactics 
we discussed earlier, such as self­affirmation and doing other positive things. 
Instead, the person may need to act in a way that directly removes the dissonance. 
For example, Stone, Wiegand, Cooper and Aronson (1997) asked a set of 
participants to make a video where they advocated the use of condoms to promote 
safe sex. Afterwards, they were asked to think of reasons why they personally had 
not used condoms in the past, or reasons why people in general might not use 
condoms. At the end of the study, participants were asked if they would either like 
to buy condoms (a direct attempt at reducing dissonance), or make a donation to a 
homeless charity (indirect). The findings showed that when participants were 
asked to think of reasons why they personally had not used condoms in the past, 
they chose to buy condoms more so than in the condition where they were asked 
to think of people in general and their reasons for not practising safe sex. Stone et 
al. argued that the maximization of hypocrisy made people more motivated to 
reduce dissonance, and therefore they chose the most direct route to do so. In 
summary, feelings of hypocrisy can bring about positive behaviour change. When 
people are painfully aware that their behaviours do not match up to their own 
publicly stated standards and they have the means to rectify this discrepancy, it is 
likely they will change their behaviour to be more consistent. 
Exploring further Use Google or another search engine to find some examples of famous hypocrites. What 
happened to them? did they change their behaviours when made aware of their hypocrisy?
Embodied social cognition
Cognitive dissonance is not the only means by which our behaviour can affect our 
attitudes. A growing body of research suggests that people’s attitudes are influenced 
by their physical actions, even at the most basic level. Early research in this area 
drew on self­perception theory (Bem, 1967, 1972), which asserts that people become 
Hypocrisy Publicly supporting 
an attitude or behaviour and 
yet behaving in a manner 
that is inconsistent with the 
attitude or behaviour. 

194
Thinking and feeling
aware of their own attitudes by looking at what they do. Thus, people look at their 
own behaviours and infer their attitudes from those behaviours. This may seem a bit 
strange – most people would think they always know their own attitudes – but there 
is some evidence that people infer their attitudes from their overt behaviours, and 
this is not only the case for weak or trivial attitudes. After writing counterattitudinal 
essays, arguing, for example, that students should have less control over what they 
learn, people come to believe that their attitudes were originally more in favour of 
their written position (Bem and McConnell, 1970). People inferred their attitude 
not from what they thought originally, but from what they had written. 
As mentioned earlier, this happens at an even more basic level. For example, a 
growing body of research suggests that the physical movements people engage in 
while they are evaluating stimuli (e.g., objects, people) strongly determine how 
favourably the stimuli are evaluated. Specifically, engaging in behaviours that 
typically accompany positive attitudes tends to lead people to evaluate stimuli 
more positively, whereas engaging in behaviours that typically accompany nega­
tive attitudes has the opposite effect – people tend to rate the stimuli less favour­
ably. This effect has come to be known as an example of embodiment or embodied 
social cognition. 
For example, in one study, Wells and Petty (1980) asked participants to either 
nod their heads vertically (a behaviour associated with agreement) or shake their 
heads horizontally (a behaviour associated with disagreement) while listening to 
persuasive messages about a university­related topic. They found that the head 
movements later modulated participants’ judgements of the message. Specifically, 
head nodding led to more positive attitudes towards the persuasive messages than 
head shaking (see also Tom, Pettersen, Law et al., 1991). In another study, 
Cacioppo, Priester and Berntson (1993) investigated the relationship between 
another attitude­relevant movement (arm flexion/extension) and a novel stimulus. 
Specifically, they demonstrated that novel Chinese ideographs presented during 
arm flexion, that is, pushing upwards from underneath a table – a behaviour asso­
ciated with approach and positive attitudes – were later evaluated more favourably 
than ideographs presented during arm extension, that is, pushing downwards 
from the top of a table – a behaviour associated with avoidance and negative atti­
tudes. In yet another striking study, Strack, Martin and Stepper (1988) asked 
participants to watch some funny cartoons while either holding a pen between 
their lips or their teeth (see Figure 4.16). Asking participants to hold the pen 
between the teeth facilitates the contraction of the zygomaticus (smiling muscle), 
whereas holding the pen between the lips inhibits the contraction of this muscle. 
Results from this study revealed that people rated the cartoons as funnier in the 
‘teeth’ condition (see also Stepper and Strack, 1993). 
To give another example, Schubert (2004) showed that making a fist can influ­
ence men’s and women’s automatic processing of words that are related to the 
notion of power. Many studies show similar findings, demonstrating that bodily 
postures and physical behaviours are related to positive and negative inclinations 
towards objects (e.g., Chen and Bargh, 1999; Epley and Gilovich, 2004; Friedman 
and Förster, 2000). Further, these inclinations influence attitudes towards the 
Embodiment (embodied

influence attitudes, social 
perception and emotion.

objects. Therefore, attitudes seem to be determined (partly at least) by people’s 
embodied responses (see Niedenthal, Barsalou, Winkielman et al., 2005). 
Sometimes, objects do not need to be present to create an embodied response. 
For example, Förster and Strack (1997, 1998) conducted a study where participants 
were asked to generate the names of famous people and later classify them as people 
they liked, disliked or to whom they felt neutral. During the experiment, half the 
participants were asked to flex their arm upwards on a table (an approach behaviour) 
or to push down on the table (avoidance). Results revealed that participants who 
had performed the approach behaviour thought of more ‘liked’ famous people than 
disliked people. On the other hand, participants in the avoidance condition thought 
of more ‘disliked’ famous people than famous people they liked. Thus, variations in 
simple muscle movements in the arm caused people to recall completely different 
(evaluatively positive vs. negative) information from short­term memory. 
These rather amazing research findings seem to show that our ability to 
perceive our bodily position and movement, or proprioception, plays a funda­
mental role in thoughts, feelings and actions that are logically irrelevant to what 
our bodies are doing. As we noted earlier, sometimes the body responds to atti­
tude primes (e.g., Bargh et al., 1996). To give another example, generating words 
about pride and disappointment can influence a person’s posture (Oosterwijk, 
Rotteveel, Fischer and Hess, 2009). People sit or stand tall when thinking about 
pride, and slump when thinking of disappointment. Findings like these suggest 
that the body is closely related to the processing of social information (Niedenthal 
et al., 2005). Theorists argue that cognitive representations (such as the mental 
‘building blocks’ of attitudes) are closely related to their physical context. 
Specifically, cognition, or what we think, depends significantly on actual bodily 
states. To help understand this point, reflect on your behaviour during telephone 
conversations. You probably smile, frown, gesture, point and move around 
according to the content of your conversation, even though there is no communi­
cative point in doing so, since you are talking to someone who can’t see you. Our 
thoughts, feelings and bodily movements are so interconnected that it is difficult 
to ‘turn off’ our body language. As we shall shortly read, it may be more difficult 
to have certain thoughts or experience emotions when we cannot perform the 
body language normally associated with them.  
Mimicry and imitation
Another line of research also suggests that our minds and bodies are intimately 
linked, with important consequences for attitudes and social behaviour. People often 
embody the behaviours of other people in their presence by imitating or mimicking 
their actions. For example, you can probably remember a time when you found 
yourself crossing your arms when somebody else crossed their arms, or smiling at a 
person who was smiling at you. For many years, researchers have argued for the 
importance of mimicry and imitation in social interaction (e.g., Bandura, 1977; 
Lipps, 1907). Indeed, mimicry and imitation are behaviours that humans engage in 
from birth. For example, babies imitate the behaviours of adults (Meltzoff and 
Moore, 1977, 1989). Mimicry remains important as humans become skilled commu­

nicators – when people talk, their rate of speech often matches each other’s and they 
speak for a similar amount of time (e.g., Cappella and Planalp, 1981). Further, 
listeners tend to mimic speakers’ gestures (e.g., Bavelas, Black, Chovil et al., 1988). 
In another interesting study by Chartrand and Bargh (1999), an experimenter 
rubbed their nose or shook their foot while they interacted with participants. 
Participants who observed the experimenter scratching their nose were more likely 
to do so themselves (rather than shaking their foot), whereas participants who had 
observed the experimenter shake their foot were more likely to do this (rather than 
scratching their nose). In other words, watching someone do something makes it 
more likely the person will also perform that action. 
Why do people do this? Theorists argue that mimicry and imitation facilitate 
cooperation and empathy among people who interact (e.g., Hatfield, Cacioppo 
and Rapson, 1994; Neumann and Strack, 2000; Semin, 2000). Some additional 
research findings support this position. For example, higher levels of mimicry 
increase liking between partners and the perception that the interaction is going 
smoothly (Chartrand and Bargh, 1999). People who are close or like each other 
also tend to mimic each other more (e.g., van Baaren, Maddux, Chartrand et al., 
2003). Research also suggests that imitation is driven by a specific neural mecha­
nism. Specifically, Rizzolatti, Fadiga, Fogassi and Gallese (2002) observed that 
particular circuits involved in the production of motor behaviour also become 
active in response to perceived motor behaviour. Thus, watching someone running 
activates the same parts of your brain that you would need to run. Mirror neurons 
appear to be important in this phenomenon. When you watch someone performing 
an action, neurons that represent that action are activated in your premotor 
cortex – the part of the brain responsible for the same action (Iacoboni, 2009). 
Although this hard­wired tendency to mimic may help us learn from others 
and increase liking (Hatfield et al., 1994), mimicry does not always pay. Kavanagh, 
Suhler, Churchland and Winkielman (2011) found that observers rated a confed­
erate as less competent if they mimicked an unfriendly person, than if they 
mimicked a friendly person or did not mimic at all. Mimicry may be seen as inap­
propriate in some cases – a naive, misplaced attempt to be liked – and thus may 
cause damage to your reputation. 
Embodiment of emotions
There is growing evidence for the embodiment of emotions – brief, specific 
psychological and physical responses to objects and events. One line of evidence 
for this is sensitivity to others’ facial expressions, which can cause us to mimic 
their emotional responses. Wicker, Keysers, Plailly et al. (2003) showed that the 
insula – a brain area responsible for processing somatosensory information – was 
activated when participants were exposed to disgusting smells. Crucially, however, 
it was also activated when they watched a film in which other people were 
displaying expressions of disgust. So, there is some evidence to suggest that people 
have an embodied response to emotions they perceive in others’ body language. 
This response is similar to their own response. Mirror neurons appear to be able 
to influence our emotional as well as our motor behaviour.

The social judge
Other research has demonstrated that people mimic others’ emotional facial 
expressions (e.g., Bush, Barr, McHugo and Lanzetta, 1989; Dimberg, 1982). To give 
an example of how this works in the laboratory, Bavelas, Black, Lemery and 
Mullett (1986) asked a confederate to fake an injury and then grimace as if in pain. 
Participants who observed this behaviour were also more likely to grimace. They 
were more likely to do so if they could clearly see the actor’s emotional expression. 
People’s imitation of others’ emotions seems, in many cases, to be automatic and 
sometimes even outside consciousness. For example, some research shows that 
people respond with positive and negative facial expressions to subliminal pictures 
of people smiling and frowning (Dimberg, Thunberg and Elmehed, 2000). Other 
findings have shown that people automatically mimic facial expressions in pictures 
as they are asked to categorize them into emotional expressions (Wallbott, 1991). 
Being able to mimic also helps people to recognize emotions in others’ faces. In 
one study, Niedenthal, Brauer, Halberstadt and Innes­Ker (2001) asked partici­
pants to view a series of facial expressions being morphed into different facial 
expressions. The participants’ task was to detect the point at which the expression 
changed. Some participants were free to mimic the faces being shown to them, 
while others were prevented from mimicking by being asked to hold a pen 
between their teeth and lips. It was found that participants who were free to mimic 
were quicker at detecting the point at which the expression changed than partici­
pants who were prevented from mimicking (see also Niedenthal, Ric and Krauth­
Gruber, 2002). These findings are important because they show that feedback 
from facial mimicry helps people to process emotional expressions. This can be 
quite helpful in social interaction; for instance, psychological processes like this 
may help people to better empathize with others. In a demonstration supporting 
this prediction, Zajonc, Adelmann, Murphy and Niedenthal (1987) showed that 
couples’ facial similarity was closer after 25 years of marriage than at the begin­
ning of the marriage. Couples grow to look more and more like each other. This 
makes sense, since couples are motivated to empathize with each other and will be 
more likely to mimic each other’s emotional expressions. Over time, this mimicry 
causes permanent changes in facial structure. 
Some other work suggests that people’s emotional experiences can be directly 
related to their bodily movements. For example, Stepper and Strack (1993) asked 
participants to either sit upright or slumped in a chair while completing an 
achievement test. Participants were given bogus feedback about their perform­
ance – everyone was told they had done well. When participants were later asked 
to evaluate their own performance, participants who had sat upright expressed 
more pride in their performance than participants who had sat slumped in a chair. 
In another study, Riskind (1984) showed that adopting an upright posture and a 
smiling facial expression facilitated participants’ retrieval of pleasant memories 
compared to unpleasant memories. Again, this is strong evidence that behavioural 
and emotional experiences are closely linked. 
This point is reinforced by some work on the emotional consequences of Botox 
treatment – the injection of a strain of botulism into the skin in order to reduce the 
signs of ageing. The injection has the effect of partially paralysing facial muscles,

which gives rise to the subtle appearance of emotional blankness in the faces of 
those who opt for the treatment. If proprioception is crucial to emotional experi­
ence, we might expect that Botox patients’ reduced ability to express emotion 
with their facial muscles would interfere with their perception and experience of 
emotion. This does, in fact, seem to be the case. Havas, Glenberg, Gutowski et al. 
(2010) found that after undergoing Botox treatment, participants were slower to 
read sentences that referred to anger and sadness. The facial expressions of these 
emotions normally require the use of the newly paralysed muscle. Neal and Char­
trand (2011) also found that Botox injections reduced people’s ability to detect 
emotions on other people’s faces. Davis, Senghas, Brandt and Oschner (2010) 
found that Botox patients, compared to those undergoing other cosmetic treat­
ments, were less likely to report negative emotions such as inability, depression 
and anxiety. Being less able to express these emotions with facial muscles seems to 
cause people to be less likely to experience them (Figure 4.17). 
Time to reflect do you think the reduction in negative affect following Botox is fundamentally heart-warming or 
deeply scary? In Chapters 2 and 11, we explore the phenomenon of objectification – the tendency to reduce oneself 
or others to their physical appearance – which seems largely to give rise to cosmetic surgery (Calogero and Pina, 
2010). davis et al.’s findings (2010) seem to suggest that by altering our appearance in this particular way, people 
really do reduce their capacity to experience emotion, and in this sense take one step to reducing themselves from a 
fully experiencing ‘subject’ to a non-experiencing ‘object’. other forms of cosmetic surgery do not induce facial 
paralysis and so do not have these strange emotional effects.
CriTiCAL FOCuS
Embodied social cognition
the surge in remarkable research findings linking the body 
and the mind has given rise to a movement known as 
‘embodied social cognition’ or ‘embodiment’, which 
suggests that the body and its role in our attitudes, 
emotions and behaviours should be placed centre stage in 
social psychology (e.g., Barsalou, 1999; marsh, Johnston, 
richardson and schmidt, 2009; Niedenthal, Winkielman, 
mondillon and Vermeulen, 2009; schubert and semin, 
2009; Winkielman and Kavanagh, 2012). the basic idea 
behind this movement is that the function of social 
cognition is to facilitate social action. our brains and 
bodies have evolved together and constantly feed back to 
each other. thus, it is a mistake to sharply separate mind 
and body (for a related view in clinical and cognitive 
psychology, see the engaging book by damasio, 2006, 
called Descartes’ Error: Emotion, Reason, and the Human 
Brain). Advocates of this view oppose the traditional idea 
in psychology that our behaviour is guided by mental 
representations, separated from our senses and 
movements. In its place, they argue that our mental 
representations are deeply embedded in specific sensory 
modalities and in our bodily experiences, postures and 
movements. thus, in place of abstract mentalistic concepts 
like schemas, social psychology should be concentrating 
more on perception and action. 
While the findings associated with this position are 
undeniably fascinating, as we have seen, there is 
controversy over whether they cumulatively show that 
our social minds are really ‘embodied’. A lot of findings are 
taken to fall under this umbrella, but may not show that 
our bodily sensations and movements are taking the place 
of our minds, as we traditionally understand them 
(Fiedler, 2009). For example, people who are induced to 
sit or stand up straight, in a ‘powerful’ fashion, think in the 
same way as people who are really powerful (Carney, 
Cuddy and Yapp, 2010). this might implicate some special 
brain regions involving bodily experience, suggesting that 
the representation of power is embedded there. however, 

199
The social judge
it might more simply suggest that sitting like this primes 
the concept of ‘power’, and so like any other prime, such 
as a power-related word on a computer screen, 
encourages people to think powerfully (Landau, meier and 
Keefer, 2010). similarly, a lot of research commonly 
understood to be concerned with ‘embodiment’ may not 
reveal the role of our bodies and senses in our decision 
making but rather that human beings have developed 
sophisticated metaphors linking abstract concepts to 
specific physical experiences (Lakoff and Johnson, 1980, 
1999). For example, some researchers have found that 
experiencing physical warmth makes us see others as 
‘warmer’, that is, friendly and approachable (e.g., Williams 
and Bargh, 2008). others have found that notions like God 
and the devil, and good and evil, are associated with 
physical height (meier, hauser, robinson et al., 2007). We 
can understand these results simply in terms of mental 
schemas, without having to rethink the fundamental basis 
of social psychology. 
Questions
1 As you revise this chapter, think about the concept of 
embodied social cognition. how many of the findings 
you have been reading about can be explained in 
terms of basic bodily and perceptual processes? how 
many seem to require abstract mental thought?
2 What other criticisms of the concept of embodiment 
can you find, using Google scholar or another academic 
database? some useful articles include Fielder (2009), 
Goldman and de Vignemont (2009) and Zwaan (2009). 
this is a fast-moving research area and you can 
probably find later ones too. 
3 Can you think up an experiment into embodied social 
cognition, along the lines of those you have read about 
in this chapter? think of a gesture or posture, for 
example, that corresponds to a certain attitude or 
mindset. Can you covertly induce this posture, and test 
whether the bodily gesture can cause this? What 
dependent measure can you use?
Emotions and social judgement
Emotions help guide social judgement. Because many of the judgements and deci­
sions people have to make are complex, they often rely on the way they feel about 
them to help them make judgements and come to decisions. For example, people 
may rely on a ‘gut feeling’ to decide whether or not to take a new job, whether to 
buy a new car, move house or move in with their boyfriend/girlfriend rather than 
dealing with the vast array of information associated with the issue. According to 
Schwarz and Clore (1983), people use emotions as pieces of information to guide 
social judgement. This feelings-as-information perspective proposes that emotions 
provide fast and reliable information about the issue that help shape what people 
do (Clore, 1992; Clore and Parrott, 1991; Schwarz and Clore, 1983). According to 
Forgas (1995, 2000), people tend to use emotions as information when they make 
complex rather than simple judgements. 
In a study testing this theory, Schwarz and Clore (1983) studied the effects of 
the weather on people’s emotions. They approached volunteer participants on the 
telephone on either a sunny or cloudy day and asked them – all things consid­
ered – how satisfied or dissatisfied they were with their lives. They were also asked 
to rate their general happiness. In one condition, participants were just asked to 
rate their life satisfaction and happiness, the researchers predicting that partici­
pants would generally show greater life satisfaction on sunny rather than cloudy 
days. In another condition, however, participants were first asked about the 
weather, the researchers reasoning that people would attribute their life satisfac­

tion and happiness to the weather and therefore discount these feelings when 
making these ratings. The researchers found evidence to support their theory. 
When asked to rate their happiness and life satisfaction (without thinking about 
the weather), participants predictably rated these variables higher when they were 
tested on a sunny rather than a cloudy day. On the other hand, participants who 
had been asked first about the weather rated their happiness and life satisfaction at 
the same level on both sunny and cloudy days (see Figure 4.18). 
There is a wealth of literature making a similar point. For example, the emotion 
of anger significantly influences social judgements. In many studies, researchers 
have shown that simply remembering a time in the past when they were angry leads 
participants to blame others for their problems and to assume that unfair things 
will happen to them in future events (e.g., DeSteno, Petty, Wegener and Rucker, 
2000; Keltner, Ellsworth and Edwards, 1993; Lerner, Goldberg and Tetlock, 1998). 
Further, being in a bad mood often leads people to rate objects less favourably. For 
example, people in a bad mood are likely to rate products less favourably, but are 
also less likely to like politicians and economic policies (Forgas and Moylan, 1987). 
People who are experiencing a state of fear perceive danger and threat to a greater 
extent and are more pessimistic (e.g., Lerner and Keltner, 2001). In general, there is 
much evidence to support the supposition that 
emotions influence judgement. 
Emotions also influence more complex 
reasoning processes. Specifically, being in a 
good or bad mood can influence the extent to 
which people rely on detailed situational infor­
mation or stereotypes. For example, Boden­
hausen, Sheppard and Kramer (1994) found that 
people who were experimentally induced to 
experience sadness were less likely to stereotype 
others than participants who had been induced 
to feel anger. This does not mean that stereo­
types are bad, nor does it mean that being happy 
makes people take ‘shortcuts’ and rely on 
simpler types of information. Some research on 
creativity suggests that the emotion of happi­
ness can make people think more flexibly and

creatively, coming up, for example, with more novel examples of categories (Isen, 
1993; Isen, Daubman and Nowicki, 1987). Positive mood can therefore facilitate 
creativity and openness – characteristics that may be useful in domains such as the 
workplace; indeed, some findings suggest that mood plays a significant role in 
workplace creativity (Madjar, Oldham and Pratt, 2002). In general, social psycholo­
gists agree that positive mood broadens the way people think, which can have posi­
tive consequences for social interaction such as gaining knowledge from others, 
increasing empathy, building social networks and increasing the positivity of rela­
tions between groups (e.g., Fredrickson, 1998, 2001; Waugh and Fredrickson, 2006). 
Emotions are also important in guiding our moral judgements. In one interesting 
study, Haidt (2001) showed how people use their emotions to judge whether things 
are right or wrong. He asked a sample of university students to read a story about a 
brother and sister who have sex once, while both using birth control. When asked 
whether the pair did something wrong, most of the participants immediately said 
‘yes’ – a response typically associated with physical expressions of disgust. 
However, when asked why the behaviour was wrong, participants’ responses 
became less assured. For example, many participants argued that it was wrong 
because breeding within families is dangerous for genetic reasons, but recall that 
both parties were said to have used birth control. Subsequently, many participants 
said that they just ‘know that incest is wrong’. Haidt argues that, like many other 
types of social judgements, moral judgements are often based on gut feelings about 
what is right and wrong (Greene and Haidt, 2002; Haidt, 2003). People in Haidt’s 
study ‘just knew’ that incest was wrong but could not necessarily recall or articu­
late reasons why they had come to this judgement. Instead, the emotional response 
of disgust probably guided participants’ moral judgements about the situation. 
Emotions not only guide moral judgement, they can also guide moral behaviour. 
For example, people often experience shame and guilt for their immoral actions 
and consequently are more likely to want to make up for those actions (Tangney, 
Miller, Flicker and Barlow, 1996; Tangney, Wagner, Hill­Barlow et al., 1996). 
However, others experience these emotions to a lesser degree and are more likely 
to participate in criminal behaviour (e.g., Blair, Jones, Clark and Smith, 1997). 
Many studies of emotions and moral judgements have been based on the study 
of anger and disgust; indeed, these are the most common emotions felt in response 
to moral violations. However, research has demonstrated that these emotions 
occur in different domains. Specifically, anger is experienced more in relation to 
moral violations about rights and freedoms (Rozin, Lowery, Imada and Haidt, 
1999; Vasquez, Keltner, Ebenbach and Banaszynski, 2001), whereas disgust is 
typically related to impurity of body, mind or character (Haidt, Koller and Dias, 
1993; Rozin et al., 1999). Interestingly, feelings of disgust (but not anger) strongly 
predict attitudes towards homosexuality as being immoral (e.g., Inbar, Pizarro, 
Knobe and Bloom, 2009; van de Ven, Bornholt and Bailey, 1996). 
Question to consider reread question 4 at the start of the chapter. Is it likely that Kieran was experiencing disgust, 
or a different emotional response? Why do you think people label these sorts of emotional responses as ‘disgusting’?

Chapter summary
In this chapter, we considered the nature of attitudes, attitude 
formation and attitude change. We distinguished between 
explicit and implicit attitudes and, finally, we focused on the role 
of our bodies and emotions in determining our social judgements 
and behaviours. specifically, you will have learned that:
• Attitudes are a person’s evaluations of various aspects of 
their social world. they can be positive, negative or 
ambivalent. they can be distinguished from values and 
ideologies, but both can affect attitudes. 
• research suggests that attitude strength is determined by their 
complexity and consistency. Attitudes are formed as a result of 
four functions: the knowledge function (wanting to make 
sense of the social world), the utilitarian function (helping us 
gain rewards and avoid punishments), the value expressive 
function (allowing us to express our values) and the ego 
defensive function (protecting us from psychological threats). 
• mere exposure to a person or object can cause an attitude to 
form. many attitudes are learned from others through various 
processes such as classical conditioning, instrumental 
conditioning and observational learning. some evidence also 
suggests that genetic factors play a role in attitude 
development. social representations theory asserts that 
people form attitudes through processes of social interaction.
• People prefer to have harmonious, consistent attitudes and 
seek to find balance. 
• Implicit (unconscious) and explicit (conscious) attitudes can 
be measured in a variety of ways, such as directly via self-
reports, or indirectly via procedures such as the bogus 
pipeline procedure, the Implicit Association test, and 
physiological measures. Implicit and explicit attitudes tend 
to be correlated but differ in several important ways. 
• research is mixed on the ability of attitudes to predict 
behaviours, and situational factors play a pivotal role in the 
expression of attitudes (also attitude formation, specificity, 
values, habits and attitude strength). 
• the theory of planned behaviour proposes that people make 
a decision to behave in a certain way based on a sequence of 
rational thought processes. 
• Cognitive dissonance refers to the unpleasant psychological 
state that occurs when people notice that their attitudes and 
behaviours are inconsistent. this appears to be a universal 
phenomenon and can be likened to the feeling of hypocrisy. 
People attempt to reduce dissonance in a variety of ways.
• research on embodied social cognition demonstrates that 
people’s attitudes are influenced by their physical actions, even 
at the most basic level. People often embody the behaviours of 
others in their presence by mimicking their actions, which may 
be a way to facilitate cooperation and empathy.
• Emotions also help guide social judgements. Because many 
judgements are complex, people often rely on the way they 
feel in order to make them. Emotions are also important in 
guiding our moral judgements. 
our concern in this chapter has been on attitudes, emotions and 
behaviour. In Chapter 5, we turn our attention to the social 
psychology of communication.

implementation intentions: turning ideas into 
action
As we saw in this chapter, the link between attitudes and 
behaviour is statistically robust, but surprisingly weak. 
Although attitudes, under the right conditions, will cause us to 
form appropriate intentions, intentions account for only 20–30 
per cent of the variance in behaviour. one of the main reasons 
for this is that people have good intentions, but fail to act on 
them (orbell and sheeran, 2000). In the past two decades, 
researchers have found a deceptively simple way to 
substantially increase the relationship between intentions and 
actions. this is of interest not only to researchers who are 
interested in the link between attitudes and behaviour, but also 
to anyone who wants to gain greater control of themselves and 
translate their best intentions into action. the technique is 
called implementation intentions (Gollwitzer, 1993, 1999). 
Gollwitzer (1993, 1999) writes that when psychologists (and 
non-psychologists) think of intentions, they normally think of 
‘goal intentions’. these take the form ‘I intend to reach X’, where 
X is some desired end state. thus, ‘I intend to study hard for the 
forthcoming exam’ is a classic goal intention. Implementation 
intentions are a subtype of these goal intentions. they specify 
when, where and how the goal will be reached. they take the 
form: ‘When situation X arises, I will perform response Y.’ For 
example: ‘When my favourite tV show finishes on monday 
night, I will take out my textbook and make notes from Chapter 
4.’ theoretically, Gollwitzer expected that implementation 
intentions would help people achieve their goals in two main 
ways. First, by specifying a suitable situation in which the 
response is to be performed, they help a person notice and pay 
attention to the opportunity to act. second, by specifying the 
response that is to be performed, they help people, when the 
time is right, to act more or less automatically. they do not have 
to consciously plan their behaviour in the moment, since when 
they earlier formed an implementation intention, they created 
a mental representation of the behaviour. In a nutshell, 
implementation intentions work by ‘passing the control of 
one’s behaviour on to the environment’ (Gollwitzer, 1993, p. 
173). In this way, they are supposed to ironically allow people 
to intentionally take advantage of the automaticity of human 
behaviour (which we reviewed in Chapter 3). 
do they work? the answer, in the many studies that have 
been conducted since then, is generally ‘yes’. Implementation 
intentions have been found to increase goal achievement, 
sometimes dramatically, in many areas of life (for reviews, see 
Gollwitzer, 1999; Gollwitzer and sheeran, 2006). these include 
intentions: to engage in exercise (milne, orbell and sheeran, 
2002; Prestwich, Lawton and Conner, 2003); have cervical cancer 

204
Thinking and feeling
screening (sheeran and orbell, 2000); improve memory 
performance for older adults (Chasteen, Park and schwarz, 
2001); comply with speed limits (Elliot, Armitage and Baughan, 
2003); reduce disgust reactions (Gallo, mcCulloch and Gollwitzer, 
2012); reduce implicit prejudice on measures such as a shooter 
task (see Chapter 11 for a description of this task), the IAt and 
the GNAt (mendoza, Gollwitzer and Amodio, 2010; stewart and 
Payne, 2008; Webb, sheeran and Pepper, 2010); and reduce the 
effects of social anxiety (Webb, obonaiye, sheeran et al., 2010). 
research has largely supported Gollwitzer’s (1999) analysis of 
how implementation intentions work (e.g., Brandstätter, 
Lengfelder and Gollwitzer, 2001; Webb and sheeran, 2007), and 
has uncovered additional mechanisms. For example, Webb and 
sheeran (2007) found that implementation intentions helped 
participants overcome ego depletion (explored in Chapter 2). 
Achtziger, Gollwitzer and sheeran (2008) found that 
implementation intentions helped shield participants’ goals 
from unwanted thoughts and feelings. Koole and van’t spijker 
(2000) found that implementation intentions helped 
participants overcome the planning fallacy (Buehler, Griffin and 
ross, 1994), the widespread tendency to underestimate the 
time it takes to complete a task. Ajzen, Czasch and Flood (2009) 
found that implementation intentions increased people’s 
feeling of commitment to a task and their conscientious pursuit 
of its completion.
1 turn the following goal intentions into implementation 
intentions that might be applicable in your life:
• ‘I want to revise effectively for an upcoming assignment 
or exam.’
• ‘I want to break an undesirable habit.’
• ‘I want to get in contact with someone I feel I’ve been 
neglecting.’
2 Imagine you are working for one of the following:
• A health agency that wants to promote healthy eating 
among patients at risk of cardiovascular problems. 
• An environmental agency that wants to promote changes 
to low-carbon behaviours such as taking shorter showers 
and using public transport.
• A charity that wants to increase self-examination 
behaviour for breast or testicular cancer.
Using Google scholar or another academic database, find 
papers that review the literature on implementation 
intentions, and also one or more papers that report 
applications of implementation intentions to problems 
similar to the one you have chosen to address. In 400 words 
or fewer, describe implementation intentions, how they can 
be useful to the goals of the organization, and suggest how 
they could be specifically applied.
3 Using Google scholar or another academic database, can you 
find any papers that suggest that implementation intentions 
are sometimes no better, or may even backfire, relative to 
goal intentions? 
4 Using Google scholar or another academic database, can you 
find papers that suggest how the benefits of implementation 
intentions can be increased?

Embodied warmth
Ever since the pioneering study of Asch (1946), we have known 
that ‘warmth’ is a central trait in impression formation (see 
Chapter 3). If you think someone is warm, you will probably 
evaluate them positively on other dimensions too. It seems 
obvious, when we think about it, that the trait label ‘warm’ is a 
metaphor, meaning something like friendly and approachable. 
From the point of view of Lakoff and Johnson (1980, 1999), we 
might expect the metaphor to be based on our bodily 
experience. For example, it might be that in our early life, we 
learn an association between physical warmth and social 
intimacy through the experience of being cradled in adults’ 
arms (Landau, meier and Keefer, 2010). 
If there is a metaphorical link between bodily and social 
warmth, we would expect physical feelings of warmth to cause 
us to rate people, and other objects, more positively, and in 
general to seek, or be conscious of, social intimacy. there is 
intriguing evidence for this. For example, Williams and Bargh 
(2008) found that when participants held a warm (versus cold) 
cup, they rated another person as more friendly. Ijzerman and 
semin (2009, Experiment 1) used the same manipulation and 
found that it caused participants to rate themselves as socially 
closer to their friends and family members. In another study, 
Ijzerman and semin (2009, Experiment 2) manipulated the 
temperature of the laboratory. In a physically warm (rather than 
cold) laboratory, participants felt socially closer to the 
experimenter. other findings show that the metaphor works in 
the reverse direction, that is, thoughts about social isolation can 
make us feel colder. Zhong and Leonardelli (2008) asked 
participants to recall a time they had been socially excluded 
(Experiment 1) or exposed them to the experience of being 
isolated on a computer interaction (Experiment 2) (see Chapter 
8 for more information on the study of ostracism). these 
manipulations caused participants to rate the laboratory as 
colder and to express a heightened desire for warm food and 
drinks. People do not rely only on warm food and drinks to 

205
The social judge
warm themselves up, according to a recent study by Zhou, 
Wildschut, sedikides et al. (2012). they also use the ‘warm’ 
emotion of nostalgia. Using a diary study methodology, Zhou et 
al. found that participants reported engaging more in nostalgic 
memories on colder days. Placing participants in a colder room 
also caused them to engage in more nostalgia. 
how much, though, does social intimacy, friendliness or 
‘warmth’ really have to do with our bodies? As we saw in this 
chapter, one of the key ambiguities surrounding the concept of 
‘embodied social cognition’ concerns how much our bodies are 
really involved in our thoughts and emotions. It could be, 
simply, that having developed a cultural metaphor that equates 
physical and social warmth, any reminder of one kind of 
warmth affects perceptions of the other. Perhaps, then, all that 
these findings demonstrate is that priming concepts (see 
Chapter 3) work in intriguing and previously undreamt-of ways. 
1 one way of priming the concept of warmth would be to 
display pictures of obviously warm scenes on a computer 
screen (e.g., steaming cups of coffee, the sun, a desert). 
• Can you think of any other ways to prime the concept of 
‘warmth’, without placing participants in physically warm 
environments or allowing them to interact with 
physically warm stimuli?
• If you did this, and asked participants to rate how friendly 
a target person is (e.g., the experimenter, or a stranger 
they read about), what would you expect to find based 
on the theory that embodied social cognition effects are 
driven largely by conceptual metaphors (e.g., Landau et 
al., 2010)? And what you would expect to find based on 
the theory that embodied social cognition effects are 
driven directly by bodily experiences? 
• this critical test between the two different theoretical 
views has not been run, to our knowledge, and certainly 
does not appear to have been published. What if both 
views are right? In other words, what if the relationship 
between perceptions of physical and social warmth is 
driven by a metaphor and also by the bodily feeling of 
warmth being an intrinsic part of the way we think and 
feel? how would you test this? (hint: you should think of 
experimental designs that include a control condition in 
which warmth is not primed, a condition in which the 
concept of warmth is primed, and a condition in which 
participants physically experience warmth.) describe 
your method and your predictions – based on the idea 
that both the concept and the physical experience of 
warmth is important – in 300 words or less.
2 thus far, research has established that social isolation makes 
people feel colder, and social inclusion and ‘warm’ 
memories make people feel warmer. however, the precise 
mechanism for this is not understood. Perhaps perceptions 
of friendliness and intimacy cause changes in blood flow, for 
example by activating the sympathetic nervous system 
(associated with approach and the activation of behaviour) 
rather than the parasympathetic nervous system (associated 
with avoidance and the inhibition of behaviour). In keeping 
with this possibility, Ekman, Levenson and Friesen (1983) 
found that emotions affect skin temperature. Indeed, several 
types of emotional arousal tend to make the skin warmer, 
including anger, happiness and surprise (Levenson, Ekman 
and Friesen, 1990). this leaves open two interesting 
possibilities regarding the idea that the metaphor ‘warmth’ 
is really rooted in immediate physical, bodily reality. First, 
people who are interpersonally ‘warm’ may actually be 
physically warm. second, people and stimuli who are liked, 
and who arouse feelings of social closeness, may make us 
not only feel warmer subjectively, but objectively warmer. 
how would you test each of these possibilities? outline your 
ideas in less than 300 words. 
Student project 
Accurately predicting strangers’ emotions in the 
laboratory predicts higher quality relationships 
in real life 
Argyro-despoina Antypa studied as a 
masters student at the University of 
Crete, supervised by dr Konstantinos 
Kafetsios. In this chapter, we considered 
the importance of emotions in people’s 
social lives. Argyro-despoina’s research 
investigates how well people are able to 
‘read’ others’ emotions.  
My topic and aims
my study investigated how people process socioemotional 
information. Using laboratory experiments and naturalistic 
social cognitive methods, my project examined links between 
how accurately we perceive other people’s facial emotion 
expressions (using a laboratory task) and emotion perception 
and experience in naturally occurring everyday interactions, 
also taking into account intrapersonal differences in both cases. 
the project was done for a laboratory course on social cognition 
and was part of a research collaboration between my 
supervisor dr Kafetsios at the University of Crete and Professor 

206
Thinking and feeling
Ursula hess at humboldt University, Berlin, which looked at 
social factors in emotion perception. 
the course on social cognition was part of a msc degree, 
‘Brain and mind’, and much of the msc concerned neuroscience 
topics. Being an interdisciplinary msc (between medicine, 
psychology, sociology, neuroscience), it also included topics on 
social psychology. I was interested in social psychology and 
hence it was interesting (and challenging) to carry out a project 
that looked at how perceiving other people’s facial emotion 
expressions affects actual social interactions using both 
laboratory and field methods. 
My methods
the course provided hands-on training in experimental and 
naturalistic sociocognitive methods of emotion perception and 
both these methods were applied in my project. In the 
laboratory, we examined how accuracy and inaccuracy in 
perceiving facial emotion expressions, while people interact in 
a group, could be affected by how other people in a group 
express emotion and how they orient towards the person who 
is the target of emotion perception. 
In the field, we collected participants’ reports of how they 
affectively experienced their everyday, naturally occurring social 
interactions with other people, and how they perceived the other 
people with whom they interacted: friends, partners, family and 
others. Every time they met with another person for more than 
10 minutes, participants recorded in a printed ‘diary’ how they 
felt and how they perceived the other person’s emotions.
the project also included individual difference measures and 
controls, such as trait emotion regulation, emotional 
intelligence abilities, adult attachment orientations, positive 
and negative affectivity, and big five personality traits.
My findings and their implications
In the experimental emotion perception task, participants 
systematically recognized the emotion corresponding to the 
target expression as intended (e.g., sad, angry, happy). the 
levels of accuracy and inaccuracy in this task were independent 
of each other.
Interestingly, accuracy and inaccuracy in perceiving facial 
expressions in a group situation in the laboratory was 
associated with how people perceived their friends and 
relatives in real-life interactions. 
Participants who perceived emotions more accurately in a 
group situation in the laboratory task reported a more positive 
interaction experience in everyday interactions, especially in 
social interactions with more close persons (close friends, 
partners, family), while participants who perceived emotions 
inaccurately in the laboratory task tended to have more 
negative interaction experiences. these associations continued 
to be significant even when we controlled for individual 
differences that may have accounted for emotion perception 
inaccuracies, such as insecure attachment, emotional 
intelligence abilities or trait level affect and emotion regulation.
From these findings, we concluded that accurately inferring 
the emotional expressions of other people when these 
expressions are embedded within a social context not only 
depends on how good one is at the task at hand, but also on 
social factors such as the presence of other people who are, at 
the same time, expressing emotions.
the combination of experimental and naturalistic 
methodologies for the description of emotion perception in 
social interaction indicated relationships between 
experimental and real-life experiences and these findings (and 
the methodological approach itself) are likely to be useful for 
further research.
My journey
At present, I am applying for further research work as I would 
like to continue working in research. I am applying for positions 
that meet my interests. 
Because of my msc project, I had the opportunity, along with 
the necessary time and appropriate supervision, to further 
study emotion theories and sociocognitive methodologies, and 
to be trained and conduct psychological experiments. In 
addition to the knowledge and skills this project offered me, I 
feel I have also gained a new perspective in psychology and its 
methods. As a psychologist completing a masters-level degree 
in neuroscience, I was fascinated by the possibilities that a 
social psychological perspective can have and the project 
revived my interest in the field. 
My advice
my personal recommendation would be to try to work on a 
topic you really want to learn more about, and something that 
seems really interesting to you.

A chapter like this one is quite often missing from social psychology textbooks. 
We think this is an unfortunate oversight for a number of reasons. In particular, 
communication – the transfer of information from individual to individual, or from 
group to group – is at the heart of social interaction. It is difficult to think of a 
social interaction that occurs without it. Also, a multitude of social psychological 
phenomena can be observed through communication. For example, it is through 
communicating with others that we express our emotions, 
our thoughts, our intentions and our identities. Communi-
cation is also fundamentally social. The development and 
use of language are strongly embedded in cultural and 
social systems, so there are many social antecedents and 
consequences of communication (Holtgraves, 2010). 
Communication is also vital to the study of social 
psychology because it is the primary means by which 
people influence (and are influenced by) others. 
It is therefore surprising that communication has long 
been a neglected topic in social psychology. While topics 
such as social cognition, group processes, aggression and 
others have seen major theoretical and empirical advances 
over previous decades, advances in the study of communi-
cation have not been as plentiful (Fiedler, 2008). This is not to say that communi-
cation is completely ignored. For example, persuasive communication is a topic 
covered largely under the banner of social cognition (see Chapter 6) and self-
presentation processes are mostly dealt with under the umbrella of the self (see 
Chapter 2). However, the study of communication is often missing from social 
psychological theorizing. It is perhaps for this reason that a chapter on communi-
cation is quite often missing from undergraduate social psychology textbooks. 
In this chapter, we will underline why communication is such a vital topic in 
social psychology. We will examine how communication is shaped by our culture 
and how a language can influence what we think. We will talk about some of the 
ways in which our communication with others reveals important aspects of 
ourselves, our personalities and our identities. We will discuss how language can 
be characterized as a ‘tool’ to communicate beliefs and stereotypes. We will then 
devote some time to discussing the features of nonverbal communication, conver-
sation and discourse. Finally, we turn to communication in the digital age and how 
new media shape our social interactions. The study of communication is extremely 
complex and draws on many different disciplines such as linguistics, sociolinguis-
tics, sociology, cognitive psychology and literature. It not only encompasses the 
way people speak to each other but also how they communicate without words. 
To study communication, we must also attempt to understand what people intend 
to do or say, as well as the subtle aspects of communication that enable them to 
conceal their intentions and instrumental goals. Before we address these many 
issues, we need to know a bit about language and the ‘rules’ that govern our 
linguistic interactions with others.

Communication
Language and the ‘rules’ of language
A language is simply a set of sounds (phonemes), structured into meaningful 
components (morphemes), which are then organized into meaningful units of 
words, sentences and complete statements or remarks. Within a language, words 
are the smallest unit of meaning and form the foundations of larger meaningful 
units such as sentences, paragraphs and whole conversations. The organization of 
a language depends on different sets of rules – morphological rules on how to 
structure sounds into words and syntactic rules about how communicators should 
organize words into sentences that make sense. Further, the meaning of our utter-
ances, that is, complete units of speech, is further determined by a set of semantic 
rules so that we, as communicators, can generate language that makes sense to 
others. Together, these rules make up the grammar of a language. Shared knowl-
edge of a language’s grammar enables us to communicate meaning to others and 
understand others’ meaning when they communicate with us. Language enables 
us to communicate about almost anything with anyone and is such a powerful 
social tool that we would be completely lost without it.
Of course, different languages vary in many ways, including their grammatical 
rules. For example, some languages have a system that uses grammatical gender, 
where nouns are classified along masculine, feminine and neutral dimensions, 
which are prefaced with appropriate gendered pronouns. Variations in linguistic 
features such as grammatical gender can influence the meaning of an utterance. 
For example, consider the noun ‘papa’ in Spanish – ‘el papa’ refers to the pope, ‘la 
papa’ refers to a potato, and ‘papá’ refers to one’s father. 
Despite these differences, all human cultures have languages with sophisticated 
rules of grammar. This obviously confers a massive survival advantage. Our use of 
language allows us to share and accumulate knowledge within families and 
communities, in ways that no other animal can. It allows us to collectively think 
about and solve important challenges. Human beings can strategize about fights 
with other groups, for example, before the fight happens, when there are no 
members of those groups physically present. Similarly, hunting, building, tool 
making and all sorts of other activities are greatly enhanced by the capacity that 
language gives us to pass on knowledge and collectively plan and organize 
ourselves. We pay a heavy biological price for this linguistic competence. The 
shape of our jaws and mouths, for example, has changed to enable us to produce a 
sophisticated array of sounds. To make room at the back of the mouth for these 
functions, our teeth have become crowded, which means that we, unlike other 
animals, are prone to problems with our wisdom teeth. Further, we are more 
prone than many animals to choking for much the same reason. Clearly, the 
survival advantage that language gives us outweighs these very real and tangible 
risks (Corballis, 2003; Pinker, 1994). 
With these considerations in mind, some theorists, such as Chomsky (1957), 
have argued that there is an innate component to language or a linguistic nativism, 
such that the human brain contains a ‘hard-wired’ set of rules for organizing

language (see also Pinker, 1994). It is said that this innate system enables children 
to learn the rules of language with amazing speed and efficiency. Indeed, it seems 
that the average two-year-old can produce and comprehend 500 words and a five-
year-old as many as 3,000 words (Aitchison, 2003; Holtgraves, 2010). Advocates 
of this point of view note that it appears to be easy to learn language early in 
childhood – in the so-called ‘critical learning period’ – but hard to learn languages 
later in life, as if the brain were biologically prepared to learn language early on. 
There is evidence that isolated communities of young children will spontaneously 
create grammatical languages even when they grow up in the absence of any 
language. For example, Nicaraguan sign language appears to have been developed 
by deaf peasant children who had no exposure to sign language and were naturally 
deprived of language (Senghas and Coppola, 2001). Children who grow up in new 
territories where immigrants use pidgin – a simplified mixture of languages that 
lacks rigorous rules of grammar – typically create Creole languages, which retain a 
mixture of words from different languages but impose a strict grammatical system 
on them (e.g., Sandler, Meir, Padden and Aronoff, 2005). Of course, these very 
young children, often preschool or lacking formal schooling, have little or no 
formal training in grammar, and may be unable to articulate the grammatical rules 
they have invented. 
However, other theorists argue against the universal grammar hypothesis. They 
argue that language has adapted to the structure of the human brain – if it’s 
universal, or if people appear to be able to create grammatical languages, this is 
because language reflects the way our brains are programmed to think (Chris-
tiansen and Chater, 2008). These critics suggest that there are so many structural 
departures between languages that the concept of a universal grammar is unreal-
istic – languages are just too different (e.g., Lock, 1978, 1980). This perspective 
also asserts that most of the meaning in language is determined by social context. 
Despite this (as yet unresolved) debate, theorists generally agree there are some 
basic features of language that allow it to convey meaning. Of particular relevance 
to social psychology, linguistic researchers and philosophers, such as Austin, 
Searle and Grice (discussed in the next section), have identified some of the 
features of language that enable people to communicate meaning to others and 
also understand the meaning and intentions of others. After all, the primary func-
tion of communication is to transfer information to other people, so language 
needs to be set up to enable people to do so. 
The features that enable the communication of social meaning are best under-
stood by way of an example. Consider the statement: ‘I’m here now.’ How do we 
know what this means? At face value, this statement informs the listener about the 
physical presence of the person making the utterance, but is this always what the 
person really means? Clearly not – the meaning of an utterance is largely 
dependent on the context in which it is made and the speaker’s intention. But how 
exactly do we understand what people say to us? How do we deal with the ambi-
guities of a person’s language? Also, how do we convey our meaning and inten-
tions to others? The study of these questions is called pragmatics.

Pragmatics
Sometimes, we say things in ways that do not match their literal meaning. Using 
the above example, ‘I’m here now’ could be intended as an apology for being late, 
a reassurance to a sick friend, or a boastful announcement of arrival at a meeting. 
Despite this range of possibilities, listeners are skilled at being able to infer the 
speaker’s intended meaning. Communicators are able to reflect on the context 
and relevance of utterances in order to understand their meaning and respond 
accordingly. These skills are obviously important for our everyday social interac-
tions. For a conversation to be successful, communicators need to be able to 
understand each other. 
Austin (1962) argued that people are able to separate literal meaning from 
intended meaning and work out what people intend to say because they have the 
ability to determine the actions performed by speech. In this speech act theory, Austin 
argued that all language is performative, in that it allows people to perform or 
achieve actions, so that in making statements, we intend something to happen. He 
argued that there are three characteristics of utterances that enable people to do this: 
1 locution: the non-ambiguous or literal meaning of an utterance. In the case of 
the example ‘I’m here now’, the locution is that the person is physically present. 
2 illocution: the action performed by the utterance. For example, this may be the 
apology or the reassurance and reflects the intention of the person making the 
utterance. 
3 perlocution: the utterance may also have unintended consequences. For example, 
saying ‘I’m here now’ might make the addressee angry, especially if made in a 
context where the statement is perceived as boastful or unapologetic. 
Austin argued that people are adept at understanding these possibilities but they 
are also able to accurately distinguish the speaker’s meaning. Further developing 
speech act theory, Searle (1975) argued that it is sufficient to use indirect language 
to convey meaning, that is, people do not even need to say approximately what 
they mean to say for them to be understood. For example, if you have ever seen a 
sign stating ‘This is a no smoking area’, you are able to understand, even though 
it is an indirect statement, that you are not permitted to smoke there. In general, 
people are able to interpret the intentions of others despite the apparent indirect-
ness of their speech (Figure 5.1). In most cases, when people have mastered a 
language, indirect speech acts are as effective as those that are direct. People 
search for meaning in utterances and are generally good at finding the correct,

intended meaning. But how exactly are recipients able 
to do this? How is it that people can distinguish 
between what is said and what is meant? Of course, 
the context is important; as we will discuss next, 
philosopher H. Paul Grice (1975, 1989) argued that 
communicators also follow certain cooperative ‘rules’ 
when they speak to one another. 
Grice and the cooperative principle
Grice (1975) devised the theory of conversational implica-
ture, in which he argued that speakers tend to be coop-
erative when they talk. Specifically, communicators mean more than they say 
because they mutually adhere to what is known as the cooperative principle. In 
Grice’s words (1975, p. 45), speakers should aim to make their ‘conversation 
contribution such as it is required, at the stage at which it occurs, by the accepted 
purpose or direction of the talk exchange in which you are engaged’. In other 
words, people should communicate in ways that are consistent with the context 
and topic being discussed – they need to follow rules that make it work and, in 
general, communicators do appear to follow the rules so that the communication 
meets its intended purpose. What are these ‘rules’? Grice argued that there are 
four rules, which he called maxims of communication:
1 Quantity: communicators make their contribution to the conversation as 
informative as required for the current purpose of the exchange but do not 
make their contributions more informative than required.
2 Quality: communicators generally attempt to make their contributions true, do 
not say things they know to be false, and do not say things for which they lack 
adequate evidence.
3 Relation: communicators aim to only say things that are relevant.
4 Manner: communicators aim to be clear and straightforward and avoid ambiguity.
Grice argued that conversation generally works because people follow these basic 
rules of communication. We are able to understand others and others are able to 
understand us because we hold the same assumptions about the rational and effi-
cient nature of talk. These principles guide our conversations with others and we 
can understand what people intend to say because we assume they also follow the 
Gricean rules of communication. 
There are, however, always exceptions to the rule. Sometimes, people break 
the rules in a subtle fashion and at other times, they openly flout them. Crucially, 
people tend to mutually assume everyone will adhere to the cooperative principle 
and the four Gricean maxims, so this assumption assists the receiver to interpret 
the speaker’s utterances. Specifically, they will assume that the communicator 
intended to be clear, relevant, truthful and informative, and interpret the meaning 
based on these principles. When a communicator violates the cooperative prin-
ciple in some way, this influences the receiver’s interpretation of what they say.

Communication
For example, Holtgraves (2010) highlights the example of a conversation between 
former US President Bill Clinton and an interviewer with ABC television in 
2008. The interviewer asked Clinton if he felt that Obama was suitably qualified 
to be president:
Interviewer:  You think he’s completely qualified to be president?
Clinton:  
The constitution sets qualifications for the president, and then the 
people decide who they think would be the better president. 
Perhaps because Clinton’s comment was narrow and uninformative (so violating 
the maxim of quantity), it was interpreted by many as a less than convincing 
endorsement of the future president. 
Consider also the example of a university student complaining about the work 
being too difficult, and receiving the lecturer’s response: ‘Well, this is a university.’ 
This flouts the maximum of quantity (it is obviously a university, so it was not 
necessary for the lecturer to say this), but the meaning of this statement can be 
clearly understood despite the violation of the rule. In this case, flouting a Gricean 
maxim tells the student exactly what the lecturer means (that is, university work is 
meant to be difficult), with a slight touch of sarcasm. Indeed, flouting maxims can 
be a powerful way for communicators to convey implicit meaning in everyday 
social interactions.

Communication
As we have seen, the rules of language are powerful in many different ways. 
However, breaking the rules can be powerful too. Another way we slightly break 
the rules of communication is in our conversations about ‘delicate’ matters, when 
we often adopt politeness strategies – phrasing utterances as a function of particular 
social concerns. 
Politeness
Some things are not easy to communicate. Imagine trying to tell a friend that they 
smell bad, or perhaps you can remember an occasion where you needed to 
confront someone you thought was telling a lie. These are not easy situations to 
deal with and a certain level of delicacy is often required. Indeed, in social interac-
tions, what people say to others can make or break their relationships, so as 
communicators, it is important to know what and how to say things so that social 
relationships are maintained.

Brown and Levinson (1978, 1987) argued that people manage these types of 
situation through the use of politeness strategies. They devised a theory of polite-
ness phenomena and argued that in communication, a great deal of difference 
between what is said and what is implied can be attributed to politeness. To 
explain, Brown and Levinson referred to the notion of face (Goffman, 1959). A 
person’s face is like their self-esteem. You may have heard the expression ‘to save 
face’, referring to the basic human need to maintain a positive sense of how one is 
viewed by others. In everyday social situations, face is often put at risk. Even in 
basic social interactions where people respond to simple requests such as being 
asked for the time, face is put at risk because the person on the receiving side of 
the request has to go out of their way to do something for someone else. When we 
communicate such requests to other people, we typically attempt to compensate

for these threats to face by being polite. For example, if we want to ask a stranger 
for the time, we may use a question like ‘Excuse me, please could you tell me the 
time?’ rather than ‘Give me the time’. The first request is clearly more polite and 
saves the recipient from experiencing feelings of awkwardness. 
Face comes in two varieties:
1 positive face: a person’s wish to be well thought of. It is the desire to be under-
stood, liked and treated nicely. Threats to this kind of face can be particularly 
harmful. For example, a complaint about the quality of a person’s work is a 
threat to their positive face. 
2 negative face: a person’s wish not to be bothered and to go about one’s business 
unimpeded. Thus, telling someone there is a long wait in the doctor’s surgery is 
a threat to negative face. 
Because these threats to face feel unpleasant, our utterances are often oriented to 
the positive or negative face of those we interact with. To counteract threats to 
positive face, we might use expressions of solidarity like ‘Got the time, mate?’, 
whereas to deal with threats to negative face, we might use expressions of restraint 
such as ‘Could I perhaps just ask you what the time is?’ Alternatively, we can go 
‘off record’ and use indirect approaches such as ‘Oh dear, I’ve left my watch at 
home!’ These types of utterances can be just as powerful as direct language and 
some research has demonstrated that these strategies are often judged to be more 
polite than direct strategies (e.g., Francik and Clark, 1985; Gibbs, 1986; Holtgraves 
and Yang, 1990). Clearly, we have many options to deal with threats to face and 
you may be able to think of many different examples of how you use polite 
language in your everyday social interactions.

Brown and Levinson studied the languages of three different cultures, Tamil 
(southern India), Tzeltal (spoken by Mayan people in Mexico) and British/Amer-
ican English, and argued that there are distinct universals in politeness phenomena. 
It appears that, universally, communicators tend to assess the ‘burden’ of the 
request on the addressee and as the burden is increased, the level of politeness 
increases. However, the use of politeness strategies is not the same for every 
person we deal with. Our use of politeness strategies differs depending on the 
status differential in the interaction and what is expected. For example, research 
suggests that less powerful individuals are more likely to use negative politeness 
(indirect) strategies when they are making requests to more powerful individuals 
(Brown and Gilman, 1989; Holtgraves and Yang, 1990). Further, people in higher 
positions of power are less likely to display politeness in conversations (Holt-
graves and Yang, 1990, 1992; Leichty and Applegate, 1991; Lim and Bowers, 1991) 
and this effect has been demonstrated cross-culturally (Ambady, Koo, Lee and 
Rosenthal, 1996; Holtgraves and Yang, 1992).

Communication
Further, the ‘closeness’ of the relationship between the addresser and the 
addressee can sometimes predict the use of politeness strategies – less politeness is 
used in closer relationships (Brown, 1993; Johnstone, Ferrara and Bean, 1992). 
However, one important boundary condition for politeness strategies to be used 
at all is that the relationship between the addresser and the addressee is generally 
positive (Slugoski and Turnbull, 1988). Statements are judged less polite when the 
dyadic (two-person) relationships are negative and in positive relationships, even 
indirect insults are interpreted as being more polite. Finally, people who are in sad 
moods tend to prefer greater politeness than people in happy moods (Forgas, 
1999). Brown (1965) postulated a universal norm of politeness and formality in 
communication behaviour, which, in the intervening five decades, has not been 
contradicted by evidence. The universal norm is that we use more formal, polite 
forms of address when communicating with people higher than us in a social hier-
archy, and those who we do not know very well. Thus, across human cultures, 
language appears to convey and reinforce social hierarchy and social distance.

politeness, where did Siobhan go wrong and why?
In general, there is often a mismatch between the way a communication seems 
and how it is intended to be interpreted. Communicators are generally skilled at 
being aware of this mismatch and are able to work out what others actually intend 
to say and do. At the same time, there are some good reasons why utterances 
should not always be taken at face value. We use politeness strategies to ‘soften the 
blow’ in tricky social situations in order to maintain positive social relationships. 
Now that we know a bit more about language and the ‘rules’ of communication, 
and how people actively interpret what we say, we will move on to the effects our 
language can have on our own cognitions. 
Language, culture and cognition
It has been argued that language has significant power over people’s thoughts. This 
perspective on language was made famous by the anthropologist Benjamin Whorf 
(for a review, see Fiedler, 2008). In its extreme form, this argument posits that 
language entirely determines thought. As such, people who speak different languages 
see the world in different ways (Whorf, 1956). To give an example, the English 
language has a linear conception of time (e.g., days/hours/minutes) and any point in 
time is a point on a linear timeline, but the Native American Hopi language lacks a 
tense system. So do Hopi and English speakers have a different experience of time? 
Some research suggests they might. For example, Hong, Chiu and Kung (1997) 
exposed ‘westernized’ Hong Kong Chinese students either to images common in 
Chinese culture (e.g., dragons), or to neutral perspective drawings. After exposure 
to the Chinese drawings, participants were found to endorse traditional Chinese

values to a greater extent and they also made more internal attributions than partici-
pants who viewed neutral pictures. It was argued that the drawings activated a 
cultural meaning system, which determined how the participants perceived the 
world around them. Similarly, Earle (1969) found that bilingual Chinese students 
were less dogmatic (on responses to a dogmatism scale) when they responded to the 
scale in English as opposed to when they responded in Chinese. Bond (1983) found 
that bilingual Hong Kong Chinese students endorsed ‘Western’ values more when 
they responded to a questionnaire in English than students who completed the 
questionnaire in Cantonese. Further, Ramírez-Esparza, Gosling, Benet-Martinez et 
al. (2006) demonstrated this cultural frame switching in relation to personality. They 
asked Spanish-English bilinguals to respond to a scale of the big five personality 
characteristics (openness, conscientiousness, extraversion, agreeableness and 
neuroticism) either in Spanish or English. They found that across three bilingual 
samples, extraversion scores were higher in English than in Spanish (see Figure 5.3). 
Similar findings were uncovered for the traits of agreeableness and conscientious-
ness. Wang, Shao and Li (2010) found that bilingual adolescents in Hong Kong were 
more collectivistic when answering questions in Chinese and more individualistic 
when answering questions in English (see Chapter 2).

Another useful example can be seen in a study by Kashima and Kashima (2003), 
who distinguished between languages that use personal pronouns, such as English 
(e.g., ‘I went out last night’) and those in which pronouns are optional (e.g., ‘Went 
out last night’), such as Japanese. The former is a linguistic practice consistent with 
the speaker’s emphasis on the individual, whereas the latter is a practice more 
consistent with collectivism. Kashima and Kashima demonstrated that people 
from countries where pronouns were used scored higher on Hofstede’s (1980) 
individualism scale than those from countries where pronouns are optional. 
Together, these findings support the idea that because different languages are 
learned in different settings, different cultural knowledge structures are learned 
and the use of the language influences thought and even personality.

Communication
Does language entirely determine thought? Most theorists would say not, 
taking a moderate perspective on the issue (e.g., Hoffman, Lau and Johnson, 
1986). Instead of arguing that language entirely determines thought, theorists tend 
to argue that language allows people to communicate more easily about aspects of 
the world that are important (Krauss and Chiu, 1998). It is clear that people live in 
complex, continually changing environments and in order to survive in such envi-
ronments, they need to act in a coordinated, cooperative way. To do this, people 
need a shared focus, when required, on a discrete subset of goal-relevant objects 
and events. This is where language becomes important. Like a ‘lens’, language 
directs the joint focus of senders’ and recipients’ attention, thought and memory. 
In this sense, it constrains the reality that people experience (Sutton, 2010). 
The focusing, lens-like power of language is often obvious, as in the statement 
‘There’s a car coming’, which focuses the listener’s attention. At other times, 
however, it is more subtle. Masculine generic language is a good example. Here, 
linguistic convention in English has long had it that masculine terms, such as 
‘man’, ‘his’ and the collective noun ‘man’, can be used to represent people in 
general, irrespective of gender. Thus, our examples are supposed to refer to 
‘person’, ‘his or her’ and ‘humanity’, respectively. Nonetheless, Ng (1990) showed 
that participants who had been presented with these masculine generic terms did 
not encode them in this gender-neutral way. Rather, a subsequent memory test 
showed that they had encoded the masculine generic as referring to men and not 
women. This result suggests that male individuals will tend to be seen as the ones 
who contribute ‘manpower’, who are responsible for the achievements of 
‘mankind’ and so on. Technically, people should think of individuals of both 
genders when the masculine generic is used, but they do not. Of course, it is true 
that the masculine generic effect occurs partly because words like ‘man’ and ‘his’ 
are often used to refer only to males, and so acquire an association with male 
referents that is carried over even into other contexts. However, we see here the 
power of words to focus attention, memory and cognition, irrespective of the 
linguistic rules and conventions that are supposed to govern it. 
Relations between other groups are also affected by this lens-like power of 
language. Of particular importance are the words that people use to denote groups. 
Of course, some of these verbal labels are derogatory, as in ‘fags’, whereas others 
are neutral or positive, as in ‘gays’ (Carnaghi and Maass, 2007). In this respect, the 
labels are like vessels with which positive and negative attitudes to a group are 
communicated. The complexity of group labels is also important (Leader, Mullen 
and Rice, 2009; Mullen, Calogero and Leader, 2007). Here, complexity is a property 
of a set of group labels, rather than any single group label. Each label indicates a 
particular means of categorizing the group, for example according to its territory, 
language or customs. A set of labels is simple if it tends to cluster within just one of 
these categories. It is complex if it is distributed across several categories, meaning 
that available group labels collectively indicate many facets of the group. 
Leader et al. (2009) experimentally varied the complexity of labels for an 
outgroup – group insults known as ethnophaulisms – derogatory terms to describe

Relating
people of particular ethnic groups. Participants exposed only to simple sets of 
labels subsequently indicated negative attitudes and intentions towards the group, 
while those exposed to complex labels indicated more positive attitudes and inten-
tions. Perhaps complex sets of labels call attention to and focus people’s thoughts 
on the three-dimensional human character of groups, making negative attitudes 
and intentions difficult to justify. 
Another way in which language shapes cognition is in the saying is believing 
effect (e.g., Echterhoff, Higgins and Levine, 2009; Hausmann, Levine and Higgins, 
2008). This effect occurs when the act of describing persons or groups changes 
subsequent memory for them. For example, when you believe your audience does 
not like a group, you are more likely to describe the group in negative terms and 
subsequently remember them more negatively. The saying is believing effect tends 
to grow over time. Attributing negative traits to a group creates, in memory, an 
association between the group and those traits. If you have just made the negative 
comments, you will remember them clearly and realize that they contribute to 
your negative feelings about the group. If you made the comments some weeks 
ago, you are less likely to recall exactly what you said and why. Thus, the negative 
mental associations seem attributable to the group itself, rather than what you 
have said about it. The general point made by the saying is believing effect is 
crucial for understanding the language–cognition interface – our language changes 
how we, as well as our audiences, think (for reviews, see Fiedler, 2008; Hausmann 
et al., 2008; Holtgraves and Kashima, 2008).

Language, personality, identity and gender
Language is a useful vessel to us for another reason – people can infer things about 
us from what we say. As discussed in the previous section, what people say can 
convey to recipients something about a speaker’s thoughts and beliefs. However, 
how people say what they say can also be a useful source of information for 
receivers. In other words, our language use can convey ‘clues’ or social markers to 
receivers about who we are, what we are feeling and what we are thinking (Scherer 
and Giles, 1979). 
Personality
First, listeners often make inferences about a speaker’s personality characteristics 
from their language use. A typical experiment to examine inferences about person-

ality dimensions utilizes the matched guise technique, where speech characteristics 
are manipulated experimentally and participants are asked to evaluate the speaker 
along dimensions such as competence and sociability. Findings have generally 
shown that rapid speech rates are associated with high ratings of competence, 
sociability and trustworthiness, while long, silent pauses are associated with low 
ratings of competence. Utterance length is associated with ratings of dominance. 
Finally, elevated social pitch is associated with perceptions of deceit and emotional 
instability, but variability in vocal pitch is associated with perceived dynamism 
and extraversion (Scherer, 1979; for a review, see Krauss and Chiu, 1998). There is 
some evidence to suggest that differences in personality do indeed predict differ-
ences in speech style (e.g., Furnham, 1990), but little evidence that ‘true’ variations 
in language (due to personality traits) can be accurately detected by recipients. 
Identity
Many researchers have investigated how language use can provide an indication of 
a person’s social class and status. George Bernard Shaw popularized public aware-
ness about this issue in his play Pygmalion (later adapted into the musical My Fair 
Lady), in which he depicted a young Cockney flower seller with ‘kerbstone 
English’ that would probably ‘keep her in the gutter for the rest of her days’ 
(Shaw, [1916]1951, p. 28). Indeed, Shaw was right in some ways – people can infer 
a lot about us from how we speak. Speakers know this and will often go to great 
lengths to change the way they speak and conceal their origins, as was the case for 
Eliza Doolittle in Shaw’s play, who became a ‘project’ to a professor of phonetics. 
The most significant indicator of social status is at the phonological level, that 
is, one’s accent. Perceived class variations in accents seem to occur in most socie-
ties (Guy, 1988). Research demonstrates that varieties in speech communities can 
be ordered on a continuum of ‘prestige’ and that speakers’ evaluations reflect this 
ordering (Bradac, 1990; Giles and Coupland, 1991). In the UK, for example, 
regional accents and those from urban areas, such as Birmingham’s ‘Brummie’ 
accent and London’s Cockney accent, tend to be associated with lower ratings of 
social class. In general, speakers who deviate from the more standard or received 
pronunciation (rP) accents tend to be judged less favourably than middle-class 
speakers (Giles, 1970; Giles and Powesland, 1975). People are able to rate socio-
economic status quickly and accurately. For example, Ellis (1967) asked partici-
pants to judge the social status of recorded voices and they were able to rate the 
speaker’s socioeconomic status with remarkable accuracy. They could even do so 
based on hearing a speaker count from 1–10. The advent of new digital techniques 
for linguistic analysis has made it possible to examine the influence of various 
different linguistic markers on person perception. For example, Campbell-Kibler 
(2007) used the matched guise technique to examine the influence of using ‘ing’ in 
a spoken word (e.g., washing) or dropping the ‘g’ (e.g., washin). It was found that 
the use of ‘ing’ was associated with higher ratings of education and articulateness 
compared to when the ‘g’ was dropped. Typically, findings suggest that standard 
speakers are rated as more confident, competent and intelligent than non-standard

speakers, but that non-standard speakers fare better on ratings of solidarity 
dimensions such as friendliness and generosity (Marlow and Giles, 2008; Ryan,

Although people’s language use typically identifies them with a particular social 
or ethnic group, which may, in turn, have positive or negative consequences for how 
they are judged, language is one of the most significant and important markers of 
identity. Despite the potential consequences of being identified with a group 
through language, it is difficult for people to change the way they speak. Equally 
importantly, people may not want to do so. If an individual is proud of their 
ethnicity, they may be more motivated to maintain aspects of their language and 
linguistic style that mark this identity. For example, an Indian person who has lived 
in Britain for 20 years may still speak with a strong Indian accent, partly because it is 
difficult to change one’s accent but partly because speaking with an ethnically 
marked accent means that the person can maintain an important identity and there-
fore also maintain their distinctiveness. Further, interactions between groups can 
influence linguistic behaviour. Giles, Bourhis and Taylor (1977) devised the concept 
of ethnolinguistic vitality, arguing that differences in group status and support for a 
language can determine the continued use and sometimes even the survival of a 
language in a particular social context. Sometimes, languages cease to be used among 
groups who live away from their first country. One example is third-generation 
Japanese people residing in Brazil, who have all but lost their Japanese linguistic 
culture (Kanazawa and Loveday, 1988). The Japanese language suffered in this 
context arguably because it had low ethnolinguistic vitality. However, in some cases, 
this lack of status and support can encourage the revival of dying languages. For 
example, Hebrew and Welsh have both seen a resurgence in recent years by speakers 
across the world (Fishman, 1989). Competence in the language is also an important 
predictor of its survival (Coupland, Bishop, Evans and Garrett, 2006). 
It is the case, however, that people linguistically adapt to their environment. At 
a general level, people tend to adapt their speech style to the context in which they 
are placed. Speech accommodation theory asserts that people will make adjustments 
to their speech style based on who they are speaking to and the motives involved 
in the communication (Giles and Smith, 1979; Giles, Coupland and Coupland, 
1991; Giles, Taylor and Bourhis, 1973). For example, try to remember a time when 
you spoke to someone who had a different accent. After a while you may have 
noticed your speech style changing and becoming more like your listener’s, and 
their speech style may have been doing the same thing and becoming more like 
yours. This is an example of speech accommodation and can result from a variety 
of motives, such as trying to be better understood or wanting to be liked by the 
communication partner.

Communication
Occasionally, people will converge their speech to their listener’s as in the above 
example. This process of speech convergence typically occurs when two friends 
converse. Speech convergence increases the extent to which the communication 
partners’ speech styles are similar, and this increases interpersonal liking and 
approval (Bourhis, Giles and Lambert, 1975). In a similar way, lower status indi-
viduals may shift their speech style to be more like a higher status individual’s 
(and vice versa) to equalize the conversation, again promoting liking. However, in 
other interactions, a different picture can emerge. For example, in a situation 
where two groups have a less than positive relationship, their speech patterns 
might diverge. This speech divergence can serve to maintain a group’s distinctive-
ness from the other. This divergence is particularly prominent in situations where 
a lower status group has the perception that they can linguistically ‘pass’ for 
members of the high status group. While the former will attempt to converge to 
the higher status speech style, the latter will diverge in order to maintain its 
distinctiveness from the lower status group. However, in other cases where 
linguistic vitality is high (e.g., Welsh speakers in the UK), the minority group is 
likely to diverge to accentuate their distinctive and identity-rich accent (Bourhis 
and Giles, 1977; Giles and Coupland, 1991). This use of language is sometimes 
self-conscious, and is often contentious and political. Those speaking regional, 
distinctive accents often confront, and themselves generate, the criticism that ‘We 
won’t get ahead speaking like that!’ People understand both the benefits, and the 
potential downsides, of speaking with distinctive minority accents that may not 
confer high status in wider society (Marlow and Giles, 2010). 
There is widespread evidence for speech accommodation processes. Even Queen 
Elizabeth II’s English accent has been found to change over the years, moving from 
an extremely upper-class RP accent to a more standard RP accent (Harrington, 
2006). More recently, speech accommodation theory has been extended to include 
accommodation in nonverbal behaviours too. Renamed communication accommoda-
tion theory or sometimes just ‘accommodation theory’, it is argued that people 
converge and diverge on a range of behaviours associated with language (Coupland, 
2010; Giles and Ogay, 2007; Giles, Mulac, Bradac and Johnson, 1987). We will talk 
more about nonverbal communication later in this chapter.

Gender
Researchers have also been interested in speech differences related to gender. 
However, these are often quite complex and difficult to interpret. For example, 
there are significant differences in the vocal pitch of female and male speakers, but 
the extent to which this relates to anatomy or social factors is difficult to deter-
mine. However, within vocal register ranges, females tend to use the middle part 
of the register, whereas males favour the lower part of the register (Krauss and 
Chiu, 1998). Arguably, it is more socially desirable and stereotypical for men to

speak with a ‘deeper’ voice. A study of Japanese women’s speech over several 
years revealed another interesting finding. In general, Japanese women tend to 
favour the upper part of the speech register more than other cultures, but this has 
changed over the years and their voices have ‘deepened’. The change coincides 
with changes in women’s societal status, providing further indication that speech 
may be influenced by gender and gender roles (Kristof, 1995).

This raises interesting questions about language, gender and power, an issue 
Lakoff (1973, 1975) addressed directly. In addition to differences in vocal pitch, 
Lakoff argued that women display a female speech register in which speech 
differs to that of men’s on different levels, indicating women’s subordinate posi-
tion in society. This is outlined in Table 5.1. Lakoff argued that women display 
distinctive characteristics of speech in their conversations and that this register 
serves as a marker for women’s subordinate social status. Specifically, she argued 
that the female speech register reinforces attributions to stereotypes, such as 
incompetence and timidity, which can be damaging for women. This hypothesis 
is supported by findings related to other gender differences in language use, such 
as the finding that in conversations, women tend to interrupt less often than men 
(Ng and Bradac, 1993; Reid and Ng, 1999; Zimmerman and West, 1975). 
However, other findings support the idea that instead of this register being 
unique to women, it is characteristic of low status groups in general (Lind and 
O-Barr, 1979; McFadyen, 2011) and is therefore more likely to be a ‘powerless’ 
linguistic style (Blankenship and Holtgraves, 2005). However, it is also the case 
that the majority of this research has been carried 
out in the English language, so findings cannot 
necessarily be generalized to other cultures (Eckert 
and McConnell-Ginet, 1999). More recently, 
Leaper and Robnett (2011) conducted a meta-
analysis of studies investigating gender and 
language style. They found that there was a small, 
but statistically significant effect in which women 
used more tentative language. However, this effect

Language and stereotyping
Through language, we also let others know what we think about our own and 
other groups. Of course, the simplest way in which language can transmit ideas 
about groups is for senders to explicitly assert them (e.g., ‘Group A is amazing’ or 
‘Group B is aggressive’) (Sutton, Douglas, Elder and Tarrant, 2008). However, this 
type of explicit open statement can have its disadvantages. For example, in making 
such bold assertions, people run the risk of being seen as biased or even preju-
diced. So, it is not surprising that language provides avenues to express ideas about 
groups more indirectly. For example, it is possible to transmit stereotypes of a 
group without explicitly referring to it. One can, for example, describe the behav-
iour of individual group members in biased ways (e.g., Fiedler, 2008; Lyons and 
Kashima, 2003; Maass, 1999; Wigboldus and Douglas, 2007). 
Serial transmission
An example of such a bias is when talking about a particular group or group 
members, a communicator can describe more behaviours that are consistent, 
versus inconsistent, with stereotypes. For example, Lyons and Kashima (2003) 
asked participants to retell a story that contained stereotype-consistent and incon-
sistent information about individual group members in serial communication 
chains. These chains are rather like the children’s game sometimes called ‘Chinese 
whispers’. Typically, playing this game shows that as the original story is told to a 
recipient who in turn tells it to another recipient and so on, it bears less and less 
resemblance to the original. Indeed, Lyons and Kashima found that by the time 
the story had reached the end of the chain, much of the stereotype-inconsistent 
information had disappeared, while significantly more of the stereotype-consistent 
information had survived. Imagine you were told a story about a working-class 
football fan who, among other things, drank a lot of beer and wrote a moving and 
eloquent poem to his boyfriend. You tell this story to another person, who passes 
it on to a third person, who passes it on to a fourth. The first piece of information, 
being stereotype consistent, is more likely to last to the end of this chain than the 
last. Crucially, Lyons and Kashima (2003) found that this bias was stronger when 
communicators were led to believe that the stereotype was widely shared by 
others in their community. It appears that people tend to reproduce stereotype-

consistent information because they think it is consistent with a shared worldview, 
or a common ground, and is therefore likely to be easily understood and accepted 
by recipients (Clark, 1996; Kashima, Klein and Clark, 2007; Klen, Clark and 
Lyone, 2010). In contrast, information that is inconsistent with widely shared 
stereotypes is less likely to result in successful communication. Instead, communi-
cators may anticipate receiving puzzled or even argumentative responses. 
This suggests that senders implicitly view their language as a vessel – a means to 
transmit information in the context of a shared set of assumptions about the world 
(Sutton, 2010). Ironically, they therefore withhold pieces of stereotype-inconsistent 
information, fearing that these would disrupt transmission. Apparently, how 
people think about language affects how they use language. This reflexivity gives 
language the power to do much more than transmit thought. The serial transmis-
sion paradigm illustrates why we can view cognition and language as ‘two sides of 
the same integral whole’ (Fiedler, 2008, p. 45), capable of creating and modifying 
reality as well as reproducing it. 
Subsequent research has shown that the desire to be liked by one’s conversation 
partner is important (Castelli, Pavan, Ferrari and Kashima, 2009). Telling people 
stories that contradict our shared beliefs about the world can be highly informa-
tive, but is a socially risky strategy, in part because it may lead to failures of 
communication. When people strongly want to be liked, they are more likely to 
withhold stereotype-inconsistent information (Clark and Kashima, 2007). Thus, 
driven by the temporary, small-scale, ‘local’ goals we have in conversation (to 
transmit information, to be liked), our actions inadvertently have the effect of rein-
forcing cultural assumptions, including stereotypes. Another line of research leads 
to a similar conclusion. Fast, Heath and Wu (2009) found more famous, familiar 
sports players are discussed more by fans, independently of how well they are 
actually performing. In this case, the desire to find ‘common ground’ in conversa-
tion trumps the actual quality of players, and reinforces the fame of players who 
are not necessarily any better. An interesting ‘blind spot’ in social psychological 
research is the possibility that the desire to find common ground in our everyday 
lives reinforces the often lamented ‘celebrity culture’ of recent years, in which 
obviously mediocre people achieve high levels of cultural prominence (Marshall, 
2006) (see Blind spot in social psychology exercise at the end of the chapter). 
Language abstraction
Whereas the study of serial transmission is concerned with biases in what behav-
iours are described, much research has been devoted to biases in how they are 
described. A considerable body of research has examined how language may 
perpetuate and transmit stereotypes and prejudice in a process called the linguistic 
intergroup bias (LIB) (Maass, 1999; Wigboldus and Douglas, 2007). Informed by the 
linguistic category model, which asserts that descriptions of events can occur at 
varying levels of abstraction from concrete (e.g., verbs) to abstract (e.g., adjectives) 
(Semin and Fiedler, 1988), the LIB assumes that behavioural events can be 
described at different levels of abstraction, ranging from concrete verbs such as

Communication
‘hit’ or ‘kissed’ to adjectives such as ‘violent’ and ‘affectionate’ and also nouns (e.g, 
‘aggressor’) (Carnaghi, Maass, Gresta et al., 2008). As language becomes more 
abstract, it conveys less about the situation and the specific form of the behaviour, 
implies longer duration, and conveys more about the characteristics of the person 
whose actions are described. 
In the LIB, ingroup members’ positive behaviours and outgroup members’ 
negative behaviours are described in abstract terms, as if they reflected the under-
lying qualities of each group. In contrast, ingroup members’ negative and outgroup 
members’ positive behaviours are described in concrete terms, as if they were 
isolated events quite unrelated to how group members would normally behave 
(see Table 5.2). Therefore, even if an equal proportion of the positive and negative 
behaviours of each group were described, ingroup members’ would be described 
more favourably. The LIB occurs in many intergroup contexts, in many countries, 
in several languages, and in naturally occurring settings as well as the laboratory 
(for a review, see Wigboldus and Douglas, 2007). In part, the linguistic 
bias reflects the impact of stereotypical expectancies on the way 
people encode social information. Having encoded a negative behav-
iour abstractly, perhaps because of ingroup bias, people are more 
likely to describe it in those terms (Ruscher, 1998). The transmission 
of information in more abstract terms also leads to more stereotypical 
impressions being formed by recipients (Karpinski and von Hippel, 
1996; Wigboldus et al., 2000).
The LIB is affected not just by how communicators have encoded events. It may 
reflect a motivational tendency to protect one’s social identity – it is heightened 
when communicators perceive an outgroup to be threatening, arguably because 
they are motivated to derogate it while bolstering the ingroup (Maass, 1999). The 
LIB is also greater for people who score high on the need for cognitive closure – a 
desire to possess a definitive answer to a topic (Webster, Kruglanski and Pattinson, 
1997). It is also influenced by mood (Beukeboom and Semin, 2005, 2006), know-
ledge about the recipient (Fiedler, Bluemke, Friese and Hofmann, 2003), proprio-
ceptive cues such as arm extension (Beukeboom and de Jong, 2008), contextual 
expectations such as legal and employment settings (Rubini and Menegatti, 2008; 
Schmid and Fiedler, 1996, 1998) and culture. With respect to culture, Kashima, 
Kashima, Kim and Gelfand (2006) found that South Korean speakers tend to use 
verbs to describe social objects, but English speakers tend to use adjectives (see also 
Maass, Karasawa, Politi and Suga, 2006). It is argued that this occurs because adjec-
tives are more abstract and are therefore devoid of contextual referents. This decon-
textualizing linguistic process is less consistent with collectivistic cultural practices. 
Further research suggests that under some circumstances, communication goals 
may even reverse the bias, which in interpersonal terms is called the linguistic 
expectancy bias. For example, the linguistic expectancy bias would normally imply 
that people describe their friends’ positive and enemies’ negative behaviours 
abstractly, and their friends’ negative and enemies’ positive behaviours concretely – 
because these descriptions correspond to what is expected. However, given a

temporary motivation to describe an enemy in positive terms, communicators 
tend to use abstract language to describe their positive behaviour and concrete 
language to describe their negative behaviour, reversing the normal bias (see Figure 
5.4). The linguistic bias is also reversed for descriptions of friends, where, for 
negative behaviours, descriptions become more abstract with an instruction to 
describe the behaviour unfavourably (Douglas and Sutton, 2003; for a review, see 
Wigboldus and Douglas, 2007). Thus, the strategic use of abstract and concrete 
language may allow communicators to create impressions of ingroup and outgroup 
members that diverge from their own perceptions. Far from merely replicating 
biased mental representations (although this is in itself an extremely important 
function), the LIB may be used to create new ones. 
Although communicators appear able to use linguistic bias strategically, they 
also appear to have limited power to inhibit bias when instructed to do so 
(Douglas, Sutton and Wilkin, 2008). As a result, even communicators with egali-
tarian intentions may be prone to the LIB, and so unwittingly contribute to inter-
group bias (Maass, 1999). Sometimes, therefore, people will be unable to stop 
themselves from transmitting their stereotype when they communicate with 
others. Obviously, people rely on this vessel-like property of language to gain 
information about groups from people who have direct knowledge of the group. 
However, as Sutton (2010) argues, language is not a perfect vessel because its use 
not only transmits but also transforms information. People cannot always be 
unbiased in their communication, so the ‘true’ nature of information changes as it 
is passed on from person to person – stereotypes are changed, and new stereotypes 
are formed. In sum, language changes social information and transcribes it from 
psychological to societal media. Once made public, the information will impact 
on the psychological representations of many others. 
Nonverbal communication
The old saying goes that ‘actions speak louder than words’ and to examine the 
extent to which this is true, we now turn our attention to nonverbal communication. 
Nonverbal communication is everything that communicates a message but does

not involve words. DePaulo and Friedman (1998, p. 4) define nonverbal commu-
nication as ‘the dynamic, mostly face-to-face exchange of information through 
cues other than words’ (see also Ambady and Weisbuch, 2010). When you think 
of nonverbal communication, you probably think of things like gestures, facial 
expressions and tone of voice. However, the term can be considered to be even 
more broad than this – when social psychologists think of nonverbal behaviours, 
they also think of things like dress style and tattoos, which communicate informa-
tion about personality, identity, likes and dislikes without a person needing to 
utter a word. Nonverbal communication can also be something as simple as how 
furniture is arranged in a room. For example, picture a situation where you walk 
into a lecturer’s office to find yourself immediately confronted by their desk – 
what are they trying to communicate to their visitors? Does this make the lecturer 
seem approachable? Clearly, it is not always necessary to use words to convey a 
message loud and clear (see Figure 5.5). People can communicate a great deal of 
information without using words (Ambady and Rosenthal, 1992, 1993; DePaulo 
and Friedman, 1998). Theorists have also argued that the ability to communicate 
nonverbally is at the core of our social intellect – the ability to infer others’ motives, 
emotions, personality and intentions, and the communication of information 
about ourselves (Ambady and Weisbuch, 2010). It is surprising therefore that 
nonverbal communication has been relatively overlooked in mainstream social 
psychology compared to other topics. 
Perhaps this is because it is often difficult to separate nonverbal communica-
tion from speech in everyday social interaction (Krauss and Chiu, 1998). Also, 
people are capable of such a wide variety of nonverbal behaviours, hundreds of 
thousands of facial expressions, gestures and movements in all (Pei, 1965), and 
when one or more behaviours are used in combination with others, and together 
with speech, it is difficult to break down and code distinct behaviours to try to 
understand their purposes and consequences. Although difficult to study, it is 
clear that nonverbal cues serve several purposes in communication. In particular, 
Patterson (1983) argued that nonverbal behaviour can help people communicate 
by enabling them to:
 o express intimacy with others: Close personal distance, touching, gaze and posi-
tive facial expressions enable a person to establish intimacy and the opposite 
would indicate a desire to keep social distance.

 o establish dominance in conversations: Threatening gestures in conversation are 
likely to lead the receiver to see the speaker as aggressive.
 o facilitate the achievement of goals: If a person wants something across the 
room, pointing to the object indicates the desired goal of the speaker. 
 o regulate conversation: Behaviours such as gestures, gaze and expression can 
indicate a person’s intention to speak or a desire to regulate turn-taking in 
conversation.
 o provide information about one’s thoughts and feelings: A person’s facial expres-
sions, the way they move and the way they look at others can give observers a 
good idea of what that person is thinking. Likewise, a person’s vocal pitch and 
speech rate (paralanguage) can lead observers to make inferences about a 
communicator’s state of relaxation or anxiety.
Overall, nonverbal cues are a powerful tool for enhancing communication (see 
also Argyle, 1990). 
The use of nonverbal cues helps us communicate information and messages above 
and beyond the simple use of words. Sometimes, we even use nonverbal cues that 
contradict what we say and this too can be powerful. For example, what might it 
mean to say to someone that you are happy while showing a big smile versus making 
the same statement with a frown or a sneer? From the first interaction, the recipient 
might believe that the smiling person is actually happy as they have stated, but a 
sneer or frown might be interpreted as dishonesty or sarcasm (Bugental, Love and 
Gianetto, 1971). Clearly, the nonverbal cues we use when we speak to others can 
add an extra dimension to our communication. Nonverbal cues are therefore a vital 
part of being able to communicate successfully. Also, we learn nonverbal communi-
cation like we learn a first language, without any formal training. Sometimes, we do 
not even know we are using it. In many ways, we take nonverbal communication 
for granted, so much so that we often underestimate its importance and impact. 
There are many types of nonverbal communication and the following sections 
specifically cover some of the main types of nonverbal behaviours that accompany 
speech, such as touch, facial expressions, gestures and nonverbal information 
conveyed in speech. These are also known as co-verbal behaviours, because although 
they can occur without speech, they are the types of nonverbal behaviours that 
people exhibit when they converse with others. We examine how social psycholo-
gists study these behaviours, how people’s nonverbal behaviours are influenced by 
the presence of others, and how people ‘decode’ others’ nonverbal behaviours. 
Finally, we highlight the role of nonverbal behaviours in deception.

Touch
At a basic level, we communicate with others through touch. For example, placing 
one’s hand on another person’s shoulder can be a way of communicating comfort

Communication
to them when they are ill or upset. Alternatively, placing a hand on a person’s 
chest can be a way to communicate that you want them to go away. Touch is 
therefore a powerful means of communicating with another person without the 
use of words. There are many different types of touch. Heslin and Patterson 
(1982) argued that there are five specific types of touch based on the objectives 
they are intended to achieve:
1 Professional/functional, for example a physician touching a patient
2 Social/polite, for example shaking someone’s hand
3 Friendship/warmth, for example friendly touch such as hugging
4 Love and intimacy, for example kissing
5 Sexual, for example making love.
The meaning of the touch is therefore dependent on who is being touched (and 
where) and the context in which the touching occurs. For example, an affectionate 
touch between a romantic couple may be meant to communicate enduring love, 
whereas a similar touch between friends can be a gesture of friendship. Of course, 
touch is not always positive. People often use touch to assert dominance over 
others and induce compliance – sometimes these goals are achieved by aggressive 
touches such as shoves and slaps (Burgoon, Buller and Woodall, 1989).
There are also distinct gender differences in the effects of touch. For example, it 
appears that, in general, women like to be touched more than men but it depends 
on who is doing the touching (Burgoon et al., 1989; Heslin, 1978). For example, 
women report not liking touch from male strangers at all, whereas men do not 
mind the touch of a female stranger. Women are also more likely to read sexual 
messages into touch than are men (Heslin and Alper, 1983). In general, people are 
more likely to touch people of the opposite sex than the same sex, but men touch 
women more than women touch men (Henley, 1973). This later finding may 
reflect differences in status because it has also been found that people who ‘make 
the first move’ in touching another person are seen as higher status. In judging the 
pleasantness of being touched by another person, people could be influenced by 
sex differences related to status differences between men and women in society. 
There are also significant variations in touch across cultures. People from some 
cultures (e.g., Mediterranean, Middle Eastern and South American) use a lot of 
touch in their communication but others (e.g., British, American and Asian) do 
not (Argyle, 1990). Like gender differences in touching, these cultural differences 
have the capacity for misinterpretation and miscommunication. 
In relation to touching parts of people’s bodies, humans also show contextual 
preferences for the space that is maintained between people’s bodies in communi-
cation. In other words, they are able to communicate with others through the 
interpersonal distance they keep from others. Keeping a larger interpersonal 
distance makes it possible for a person to conceal information from the person 
they are interacting with. For example, a large interpersonal distance might make 
it more difficult for a recipient to detect and read nonverbal communication cues, 
whereas being ‘up close and personal’ allows people to see more and also do more

(e.g., touch). Therefore, people may vary their interpersonal distance from others 
as a way of maintaining privacy and intimacy. Hall (1966; see also Hall, 1984) 
conducted observational studies on interpersonal distance and observed four 
‘zones’ of interpersonal distance. People use these zones of distance in interper-
sonal contact situations depending on the context and who is being spoken to (see 
Figure 5.6). These zones are as follows:
1 Intimate zone: this is the ‘up close and personal’ distance (up to 0.5 m) that 
allows people to read and detect the most subtle nonverbal cues. This distance 
also makes it easier to touch and detect other personal cues such as body 
temperature and smell. It is generally reserved for close intimate relationships 
such as romantic couples. 
2 Personal zone: this distance is still close (typically 0.5–1 m) allowing touch to 
occur, but not so close that body temperature and smell can always be detected. 
It is generally observed between friends and close acquaintances.
3 Social distance: typically used in casual interactions with strangers, newer or 
more distant acquaintances, this distance (usually 1–4 m) does not typically 
allow touch to occur, but still allows people to maintain eye contact and observe 
other nonverbal cues such as facial expressions. 
4 Public distance: this is the largest distance in social communication (over 4 m) 
and is typically used in professional situations to signal differences in status, 
power or the desire for interaction. For example, bosses may distance them-
selves in meetings by heading the table and keeping employees at an acceptable 
public distance. 
Like touch in general, differences in interpersonal distance can be 
a powerful way to communicate with another person. Imagine 
interacting with an acquaintance who suddenly ‘invades’ your 
personal space. What are they trying to communicate to you? What 
do you think of them? Perhaps more importantly, what would you 
do? Argyle and Dean (1965) argued that people strongly protect 
their interpersonal distance and attempt to compensate for any 
threats to this distance. Because interpersonal distance is such a 
strong marker of intimacy, people will go to some lengths to protect 
themselves and maintain their desired level of intimacy. In particular, 
if our personal space is challenged in some way (e.g., by someone 
getting too close to us in conversation), we tend to adapt by making 
adjustments in other cues (e.g., by looking away). We also use inter-

personal distance to maintain differences in social status (Dean, Wills and Hewitt, 
1975). Again, there are cultural differences in interpersonal distance. For example, 
some cultures think nothing of standing very close to one another during conver-
sation, but it may make others feel uncomfortable (Hall, 1966).

Facial expressions
Perhaps the most studied mode of nonverbal communication is people’s facial 
expressions. Facial expressions are changes in the face that can occur as an auto-
matic response to an internal state (e.g., feeling or emotion) or as a voluntary 
response to a social situation (e.g., letting someone know a feeling or emotion). 
They can also be used to replace words, such as raising one’s eyebrows to ask a 
question. Over the years, social psychologists have been most interested in discov-
ering if facial expressions are consistent within specific emotions and also if facial 
expressions of emotion are effectively decoded by others. This has largely 
stemmed from Darwin’s (1872) position that there is a small set of human emotions 
that are associated with a set of facial expressions. Indeed, later research has shown 
that there are six basic emotions (happiness, sadness, anger, fear, surprise and 
disgust) and that these are reflected in six basic emotional facial expressions 
(Ekman, 1982; Ekman and Friesen, 1975). These basic expressions are associated 
with distinguishable patterns of muscular activity. 
Research suggests that people’s facial expressions tend to match the emotion 
being expressed in their voices (Putnam and Krauss, 1991; Winton, Putnam and 
Krauss, 1984). Also, the facial expressions associated with the six basic emotions 
have been shown to be relatively universal (Ekman, 1971; Ekman and Friesen, 
1971; Ekman, Friesen, O’Sullivan et al., 1987). In many studies, Paul Ekman and 
his colleagues showed people from many different countries a series of photos 
depicting the six basic emotions and found that people in a variety of Western, 
Asian and tribal cultures were very accurate in recognizing the six different 
emotions. Moreover, they were accurate in judging the expressions of faces from 
within their own culture and from other cultures. Thus, facial expressions of 
emotion appear to be largely consistent across cultures. Whether this reflects 
innate links between facial movements and emotional expression or universals in 
socialization processes (or both – see the Critical focus box later) is an interesting 
question, but while many other social psychological factors vary across cultures, 
facial expressions of basic emotions appear to be more or less universal. 
The work of Ekman and his colleagues has been extremely influential; indeed, 
most investigations of emotional facial expressions use the photographs developed 
in his research. Some researchers have, however, criticized this method, arguing 
Facial expressions  Voluntary 
or involuntary changes in the

236
Relating
that the use of static, posed photographs cannot capture the dynamic nature of 
emotional expressions (e.g., Russell, Bachorowski and Fernandez-Dols, 2003). 
Other techniques have been developed to get around this issue, such as a technique 
devised by Krauss, Curran and Ferleger (1983), where research participants are 
asked to identify emotions from video footage. The findings using this technique, 
as well as the cross-cultural consistency of facial emotions, largely echo the find-
ings from Ekman’s research. Ekman’s own work has led to the development of the 
Facial Action Coding System – a standardized way of measuring small muscle 
movements that can allow for the decoding of emotional facial expressions and 
comparisons of human expressions with animal (e.g., chimpanzees) expressions 
(Vick, Waller, Parr et al., 2007).
One important point to note is that although facial expressions appear to be 
consistent across cultures, there are some important cultural differences in the 
rules governing when the expressions can be displayed. In other words, while the 
basic expression of the emotion may be innate and therefore universal, the display 
rules for the emotion for a particular culture are not fixed and must be learned. For 
example, it appears to be less acceptable for men in Western cultures to show 
emotions than women (Argyle, 1990), so they must learn the display rules that are 
appropriate for their cultural context. Another example of appropriateness within 
the same culture dictates that people are not permitted to laugh at funerals, but 
laughing is more than appropriate with the same group of people in a different 
context (e.g., at the pub). 
In light of examples like this, Ekman (1971) argued that the universals of 
language are restricted by cultural norms of acceptability. Research supports this 
argument. For example, Ekman (1973) found that when Japanese and American 
participants were asked to view an unpleasant video in private, both groups 
displayed facial expressions of negative emotions. However, when later talking 
about the video with an experimenter, the Japanese participants did not continue 
to display these expressions, unlike the American participants. Both groups 
adhered to their own cultural display rules for the expression of negative emotions. 
Another interesting example is that people tend to be better at recognizing facial 
expressions within their own race or ethnic group (Kitayama, Mesquita and Kara-
sawa, 2006). Thus, while basic facial expressions might be the same across cultures, 
the subtleties of expressions (and subsequent decoding of these expressions) might 
be dependent on cultural differences in expressing emotions.

Gestures
People communicate with their faces and they also communicate with their hands 
and arms in ways that are different from basic touching. For example, think about 
how you ask for the bill in a busy restaurant. Think about how you would 
communicate with a driver who disobeyed a road rule. It is likely you will think

Communication
of some kind of expression that involves your hands and arms in order to deal 
with these social situations. The many common movements we use to communi-
cate, both with and without verbal communication, are another kind of nonverbal 
communication known as gestures (Ekman and Friesen, 1972). Gestures are 
common in groups who do not speak (e.g., religious groups who have taken a vow 
of silence) and the hearing-impaired where specific languages of gestures (sign 
languages) facilitate communication. Also, gestural movements are common when 
people who do not speak the same language communicate with each other. 
There are many different types of gestures and, again, some are universal. For 
example, imagine someone asks you for directions – you are likely to point your 
finger in the direction the person should go. If someone silently offers you the 
popcorn in the cinema, it is likely that you will either accept with a smile or decline 
with an appropriate hand gesture. Gestures go along with speech to help us say 
what we want to say but they can also replace speech when it is not possible. Some 
of these latter types of gestures are called emblems or quotable gestures and again 
many of these are widely understood across cultures, such as waving the hand to 
say hello. However, many gestures are culture specific. One example is the 
‘moutza’ in Greece, in which the open palm of the hand with extended fingers is 
thrust towards the recipient, accompanied by an expletive or insult. This gesture is 
likely to have little impact on, or at least meet with some confusion from someone 
outside Greece. Also, the same gesture can mean different things in different 
cultures. For example, ‘no’ in the UK is signalled by shaking the head from left to 
right, but the same gesture in India means ‘yes’. 
In cases such as this, cross-cultural miscommunication may arise. One must be 
careful not to offend people with gestures that can be highly offensive in some 
cultures. For example, the ‘thumbs up’ gesture can mean a job well done or other 
kind of positive response to a British, American or Australian person, but to 
someone in the Middle East, this is an insulting ‘up yours!’ Clearly, it is advisable 
to consult one’s travel guide to avoid miscommunications while travelling. As an 
interesting aside, you may be familiar with HSBC advertisements that appear on 
TV and in international airports. In these adverts, the bank argues that its under-
standing and sensitivity to different cultural practices around the world makes it 
the ‘world’s local bank’. An awareness of cross-cultural differences in nonverbal 
communication is considered to be important for effective business practice. 
Also, the cultural basis of gestures is reinforced by the fact that new gestures 
are formed regularly and some that have originated from the popular media have 
become commonplace, everyday gestures. For example, gesturing to make the 
letter ‘L’ on one’s forehead to signify that the recipient is a ‘loser’ was apparently 
first used in the film Ace Ventura: Pet Detective in 1994. 
Although gestures vary widely across cultures, they are used in all cultures; 
indeed, in our evolutionary history, gestures preceded speech as the main channel of 
communication (Corballis, 2003). The recent interest in embodied social cognition 
(Chapter 4) has seen an upsurge of interest in gestures and their function. Research 
shows that gestures are not merely an optional ‘added extra’ in thought and commu-

Gaze
When a person communicates one on one with another person, they spend two-
thirds of the time looking at the other person’s eyes – a process known as gaze 
(Argyle and Ingham, 1972). Further, people also spend about a third of their time 
in conversations engaged in mutual eye contact with another person (eye contact or 
mutual gaze). Gaze is an important aspect of nonverbal behaviour. The amount of 
time a person spends gazing and the type of gazing can give a lot of information 
about what the person is feeling, their personal status and their intimacy with the 
person they are looking at. For example, just like interpersonal distance and touch, 
people tend to gaze more at people they like and people with whom they seek 
greater intimacy. People also like others who gaze more (Kleinke, 1986; Kleinke,

nication, but play a fundamental role. If you are speaking and cannot bring a word 
to mind, gesturing it helps you (Krauss, 1998). This finding has been used to help 
people who have difficulties after a stroke (Hadar, Wenkert-Olenik, Krauss and 
Soroker, 1998). Similarly, gesturing helps people comprehend words (Goldin-
Meadow and Singer, 2003). Gesturing left, right, up and down helps speakers and 
listeners alike as they try to solve spatial problems (Hostetter and Alibali, 2008). 
Sitting or standing up straight, in the fashion of a powerful person, causes physio-
logical changes that are indicative of power (Carney, Cuddy and Yap, 2010).

Communication
Bustos, Meeker and Staneski, 1973). Of course, gaze is not always positive. 
Unwanted eye contact from strangers or disliked individuals can be uncomfort-
able. As such, people will often explicitly avoid making eye contact with others 
and adopt special strategies (e.g., wearing sunglasses) to steer away from embar-
rassing social situations and maintain their privacy. 
Time to reflect Think of some of the situations in your life when you have wanted to avoid eye contact with 
another person. Why did you want to do this? How exactly did you avoid the eye contact?
Again, there are some interesting gender differences in gaze in the use and 
interpretation of eye contact. For example, women have been shown to engage in 
more eye contact than men (Hall, 1984; Henley and Harmon, 1985). Also, the 
rules of gaze appear not to be universal. For example, while in Western cultures 
people tend to gaze more when they are listening than speaking (Argyle and 
Ingham, 1972), one study showed that a sample of African American communica-
tors adopted the opposite pattern – they gazed more when speaking (LaFrance 
and Mayo, 1976; for two studies of cultural differences in gaze, see Adams, 
Franklin, Rule et al., 2010; Schofield, Parke, Casteñada and Coltrane, 2008). 
People tend to use gaze as a way of signalling intentions in conversation such as 
the intention to begin speaking, so different cultural patterns like this could be the 
source of confusion and miscommunication. As in all aspects of nonverbal 
communication, it is important to take into account cultural differences so that 
insulting and embarrassing situations can be avoided (Hall, 1966). 
Nonverbal communication, self-presentation and influencing others
Like much of what we do, our nonverbal behaviours are influenced by the presence 
of others (see also Chapter 9). Simply sitting in a room with other people alters our 
facial expressions, gestures, gaze and posture so that they are different from how 
they would normally be if we were sitting alone in a room (DePaulo, 1992; LaFrance, 
1979; Morris, 1977). Why do we do this? As with other types of self-presentational 
behaviours, it partly comes down to the human desire to be liked (Argyle, 1990). We 
change even the most basic nonverbal aspects of our behaviours in response to what 
others are doing and what we think others think (and what we would like them to 
think) about us. 
Our nonverbal behaviour is influenced by the presence of others in a variety of 
ways. For example, we may ‘mimic’ other people’s gestures, postures and pauses, 
our accents change, our gaze patterns more closely match those of the communi-
cation partner and, at a more general level, we take turns in conversation (Bush, 
Barr McHugo and Lanzetta, 1989; Hatfield, Cacioppo and Rapson, 1994; Provine, 
1989, 1992; Stel and van Knippenberg, 2008). Argyle and Dean (1965) argued that 
people typically reach an equilibrium in conversations and maintain it by 
responding in compensatory ways to any changes in their conversational partner’s 
behaviour. In other words, we make adjustments in the way we speak and in our 
nonverbal behaviours in response to what our conversation partners are doing.

Also, people tend to use nonverbal cues differently when they are attracted to the 
person with whom they are talking. Specifically, a process of coordination occurs 
more when people like each other. Smiles and affectionate gazes are generally 
linked to liking, attachment and relationship satisfaction. Likewise, positive 
nonverbal expressions and coordination increase interpersonal rapport. However, 
just like positive feelings and satisfaction, hostility can also be reciprocated 
through nonverbal communication (Cappella, 1997). 
Much of this behaviour is automatic (see Chapter 3). That is, many of our 
nonverbal communications are spontaneous and implicit responses to others and 
the context around us. Nevertheless, there is some evidence to suggest that 
communicators do have some awareness of, and control over, their nonverbal 
expressions and can use them to manage their image and influence other people 
(DePaulo, 1992). Think, for example, about the behaviours of politicians during 
their speeches. What we see is typically slick and controlled with respect to 
nonverbal behaviours. Such individuals sometimes hire coaches to help them 
eliminate confusing or deceptive nonverbal behaviours from their communication. 
While this may not always be perfect, it is clear that people do have some control 
over the image they present to the world via their nonverbal behaviours. 
The nonverbal behaviour of others can also influence what people think. For 
example, Weisbuch and Ambady (2009) exposed female participants to a series of 
silent video clips featuring female actors of varying body sizes. As the actors’ body 
sizes marginally increased, the participants received either increasingly positive 
nonverbal behaviour from others (pro-heavy condition) or increasingly negative 
behaviours (pro-slim condition). Results revealed that participants in the pro-slim 
condition reported desiring a slimmer figure and admiring slimmer women more 
than participants in the pro-heavy condition. This occurred despite the fact that 
the participants were unable to identify the patterns of clips, and even when they 
were given monetary reward for their participation. It therefore appears that indi-
rect and nonverbal social influence can exert an automatic influence on people’s 
preferences (see Table 5.3). 
It is also interesting to note that people’s nonverbal cues can sometimes deter-
mine the behaviours of others. In a recent study, Beukeboom (2009) showed that 
the nonverbal cues exhibited by listeners can influence our subsequent language. 
Beukeboom asked undergraduate students to watch a video about a kiosk owner 
and then describe the video to two other people. These people were confederates 
who were asked by the experimenter to display either a positive (e.g., smiling and 
nodding) or negative (e.g., unsmiling and frowning) listening style. When speaking 
to a positive listener, people tended to use more 
abstract, subjective language, whereas when 
speaking to a negative listener, people stuck to 
objective facts and concrete details through the use 
of concrete language. Further, the positive listeners 
elicited more comments about the thoughts and 
emotions of the target in the video, and partici-

pants in this condition also gave more of their own opinions. It is argued that the 
positive listening style acts as a sign of agreement and understanding, which 
encourages people to give a more interpretative account. On the other hand, a 
negative listening style makes the speaker more cautious and descriptive. Thus, 
the nonverbal cues of listeners could have a significant impact on what people 
communicate and therefore what information is passed on to others. 
In general, the expectations of one person can sometimes determine the behav-
iour of another. For example, evidence suggests that the expectations of healthcare 
personnel can affect the outcomes of their patients’ medications (DiMatteo, 1993; 
Roter and Hall, 1992; Whitcher and Fisher, 1979), biased interviewers can elicit 
expected or stereotypical responses from their interviewees (Fiske, 1998; Gilbert, 
1998; Hyman, 1954; Weitz, 1972; Word, Zanna and Cooper, 1974) and teachers’ 
expectations can influence students’ academic performance (Ambady and 
Rosenthal, 1992, 1993; Harris and Rosenthal, 1985). Nonverbal cues such as touch, 
gaze and tone of voice undoubtedly play a significant role in these effects. 
How well do people decode nonverbal behaviours?
In studying some of the factors (such as age and gender) that might influence 
nonverbal communication, psychologists have examined people’s general 
nonverbal sensitivity – their ability to discern other people’s thoughts, feelings and 
intentions from their nonverbal behaviour. Using the profile of nonverbal sensi-
tivity test (Rosenthal, Hall, DiMatteo et al., 1979), everyday life situations are 
performed by an actor and video clips are presented to participants in varying 
modalities (e.g., facial expressions, body movements and tone of voice). Partici-
pants are then asked to ‘decode’ the nonverbal behaviours in the test (e.g., what is 
the person in the scene thinking, doing and feeling?). Using this procedure, it is 
possible to measure individual differences in sensitivity to nonverbal cues and 
examine some of the consequences of these differences. Using this test, it has been 
found that people’s nonverbal sensitivity generally improves with age and experi-
ence (Buck, 1984; DePaulo and Rosenthal, 1982; Rosenthal et al., 1979). Also, 
psychopathology sometimes compromises people’s ability to understand 
nonverbal behaviour (Buck, 1984; Rosenthal et al., 1979). Further, women appear 
to be better at reading most facial expressions and other nonverbal cues than men. 
Using a newer test called the test of nonverbal cue knowledge (Rosip and Hall, 
2004), it has been shown that women show a better knowledge of nonverbal cues, 
supporting the social psychological explanation that because of women’s social 
roles (e.g., nurturing and child rearing), they are encouraged to be more expressive 
and emotionally responsive than men (Mansted, 1992). 
Other, more complex relationships exist. For example, it has been found that 
doctors who are good at reading body cues tend to have more satisfied patients 
(DiMatteo, Hays and Prince, 1986). Also, students who score high on nonverbal 
sensitivity learn more than less sensitive students (Bernieri, 1991). Finally, 
nonverbal sensitivity is linked to competence and status in children (Feldman, 
Philippot and Custrini, 1991). So, there is some evidence for individual differences

in sensitivity to nonverbal behaviour. It should be noted, however, that basic intel-
ligence (Rosenthal et al., 1979) and the ability to recognize faces (Etcoff, 1989) do 
not correlate with nonverbal sensitivity.

Nonverbal communication and deception
An interesting question that follows is whether nonverbal cues reveal the ‘inner 
truths’ that people may not want to reveal. Many talk shows introduce ‘experts’ 
who ‘decode’ body language to establish that a person is being dishonest. This 
echoes the popular belief that while people may be able to control what they say 
in order to hide their deceit, which is more often than not the case (Knapp, Hart 
and Dennis, 1974), they cannot control their nonverbal behaviour or may even 
overcompensate for their deceit, which makes matters worse. This is not always 
the case. In particular, research shows that facial expressions are not very helpful 
in aiding people to detect deception (Ekman and Friesen, 1974; Zuckerman, 
DePaulo and Rosenthal, 1981). Based on facial expressions, receivers’ accuracy in 
detecting whether or not someone has lied is not much better than chance because, 
in general, it seems that people are able to exert some control over their facial 
expressions and adjust them in an attempt to hide deceit. 
However, it appears that problems may arise when people place too much 
effort into controlling their facial expressions. In doing so they can forget that 
they are displaying cues to deception in other aspects of their nonverbal behav-
iour. For example, while people are focusing on their facial expressions, they may 
not be thinking about their elevated vocal pitch (Ekman, Friesen and Scherer, 
1976), their excessive fiddling with objects (Knapp et al., 1974) or the number of 
times they touch their face (Ekman and Friesen, 1974). These other nonverbal 
channels can therefore become ‘leaky’ and receivers may perceive that something 
is up. Overall, though, receivers do not seem particularly adept at reading 
nonverbal deceptive cues (DePaulo, 1994). While people may experience a general 
feeling of suspicion, they cannot necessarily pinpoint exactly if and how they are 
being deceived (DePaulo and Rosenthal, 1979). Contrary to popular belief, 
women are no better at detecting lies through nonverbal cues than men (Rosenthal 
and DePaulo, 1979).
On the upside, however, people in professions that require them to detect lies 
are often better at doing so than the general population (Mann, Vrij and Bull, 2004; 
Vrij, Mann, Robbins and Robinson, 2006). Also, it has been found that nonverbal 
behaviours are most helpful to people in detecting deceit the more the ‘liars’ are 
motivated to hide their deceit. This motivational impairment effect means that 
people, in trying too hard to hide their deceit, actually make it easier for others to 
notice (DePaulo, Kirkendol, Tang and O’Brien, 1988). Further, other research 
suggests that women are more likely to show the motivational impairment effect

more likely to be detected by recipients (DePaulo et al., 1988). Finally, people 
appear to find it easier to detect deceptive emotional communication than decep-
tive unemotional communication (Warren, Schertler and Bull, 2009). In summary, 
it is not always the case that people can ‘hide’ their attempts to mislead others but 
at the same time, there are many variables that influence people’s ability to conceal 
their deceit (see also DePaulo, Lindsay, Malone et al. 2003).

Communication
Conversation and discourse
Of course, in our everyday conversations, we communicate with words and 
nonverbal cues at the same time. For example, people use both verbal (e.g., words 
like ‘hello’, ‘go ahead’ and goodbye’) and nonverbal (e.g., waving, pausing, 
looking away) cues to begin, take turns in, and end interactions with others. 
People are generally skilled in their use of verbal and nonverbal conversational 
cues and resist attempts to violate conversational norms such as interrupting 
when someone has not finished what they are saying (e.g., Ng and Bradac, 1993; 
Reid and Ng, 1999). Communicators also make use of back channel communication 
cues (e.g., ‘uh huh’, ‘sure’, nodding and so on) to allow the speaker to know they 
are listening. Following these ‘rules’ is important to make communication go 
smoothly and rule violations such as interrupting can be perceived as rude, or 
attempts to exert power in a conversation (Ng and Bradac, 1993). Further, the 
norms of communication differ depending on the context of the communication. 
For example, a conversation between a long-term romantic couple or between 
two close friends will probably include more instances of personal disclosure 
than conversations between more distant acquaintances, and the rules of turn-
taking and reciprocity might be less important (Morton, 1978). A doctor–patient 
conversation may contain less reciprocity and turn-taking for an entirely different 
reason – the power difference between the interactants. Of course, to some 
extent, doctors need to take charge of the conversation because they need to 
diagnose the patient’s illness. However, research demonstrates that doctors show 
a tendency to dominate conversations to a significant extent, often allowing little 
scope for patients to respond and ask questions of their own (West, 1984). Thus, 
the power imbalance in this particular interaction significantly influences the 
course of the conversation.

Patterns of communication can also be examined using a technique called 
conversation analysis (CA), where researchers study talk in interactions. CA gener-
ally endeavours to describe the structure and patterns of interactions in everyday 
conversations (e.g., Drew, 2005; Heritage, 2005; Pomerantz and Mandelbaum, 
2005; Sacks, Schegloff and Jefferson, 1974; Schegloff, 2007). Typically, a researcher 
devises a research question or problem and then collects data via video or audio-
recorded conversations. The researcher does not intervene in the data collection so 
that the analysis examines natural talk in interactions. Once the data have been 
collected, a researcher transcribes the conversation and, based on an inductive 
data-driven analysis, examines patterns in the conversation. Thus, rather than an 
experiment or observational study where hypotheses are formulated prior to the 
study taking place, the outcomes and conclusions drawn from CA are driven by

the data itself. Much of what we know about turn-taking in conversation is drawn 
from research using CA (e.g., Sacks et al., 1974). Using CA, researchers have iden-
tified that turn-taking is almost universal in conversation – communicators tend 
to talk one at a time, leaving little gaps and with little evidence of people talking at 
the same time. 
Another approach adopted by social psychologists to analyse conversation is to 
conduct discourse analysis (DA). DA refers to a number of methods used to analyse 
written texts (e.g., newspapers, articles), spoken language (e.g., conversations, 
speeches) or sign language use (see also Chapter 1). DA is based on the fact that 
conversations rarely take place in a neutral environment, so the context of the 
conversation is important. Specifically, what happens in discourse can be related 
to context, power and interaction. It is argued that mainstream methods in the 
social psychology of communication (e.g., artificially designing linguistic mate-
rials and speech) fail to capture the meaning of the communication. First, the 
content of conversations provides information about the people who are talking. 
For example, a teenager is likely to talk about completely different topics to 
someone in middle age. Second, the way in which people talk to one another (e.g., 
paralinguistic cues, nonverbal cues) can largely determine the meaning of the 
conversation. Therefore, isolating and examining specific features of communica-
tion can mean that researchers miss the meaning of the communication and can 
misunderstand how communication influences attitudes. Specifically, discourse 
analysts argue that language and non-linguistic cues are impossible to separate and 
that researchers should therefore examine the entire discourse in order to under-
stand its meaning and influence (Billig, 1987; Edwards, 1997, 2005; Edwards and 
Potter, 1992, 2001; Giles, Coupland, Henwood et al., 1990; Potter, 1996; Potter 
and Wetherell, 1987; Wetherell and Potter, 1992). 
Discourse analysts have developed discourse-based alternatives to the study of 
many mainstream topics in social psychology. For example, memory and causal 
attribution have been examined through everyday event reporting (Edwards and 
Potter, 1992, 1993; Middleton and Edwards, 1990). The role of emotions in rela-
tionships and actions has been studied through how people call upon emotional 
states in their personal narratives such as disputes and in counselling situations 
(Edwards, 1997, 1999). DA has also been used extensively in the study of prejudice 
(e.g., Condor, 1988; Potter and Wetherell, 1987; van Dijk, 1993) and in the study 
of crowds, collective action and protest (Drury and Reicher, 2005; Reicher, 2001, 
2004). In general, discourse analysts argue that by examining an entire discourse, it 
is possible to see people doing the kinds of things for which psychology has a set 
of explanations and definitions (Edwards, 2005). This is the main point of depar-
ture between DA and mainstream social psychology. While mainstream social 
psychologists argue that the unit of analysis can be the individual, the group or a 
specific cognition (e.g., attitude, emotion and so on), discourse analysts argue that 
the basic unit of analysis should be the talk. The cognitions and psychological 
constructs that social psychologists investigate are assumed by some discourse 
analysts to exist only through talk (e.g., Edwards, 1997; Potter, 1996; Potter and

Wetherell, 1987). This view poses problems for mainstream social psychology, 
which is one reason why the DA approach is often critiqued and the two 
approaches are often perceived to be at odds with one another (Giles and Coup-
land, 1991). Perhaps more optimistically, mainstream and DA approaches may be 
able to inform each other to gain a clearer understanding of how social psycho-
logical processes occur and are brought about through communication. 
Communication and technology
Recently, the market research company Student Monitor (2012) conducted a life-
style and media survey, which revealed that the top five things that are ‘in’ on 
university campuses across the USA were drinking beer followed by using Face-
book, text messaging, using iPods and drinking other types of alcohol. Thus, two 
of the top five activities among university students – at least according to this 
survey – involve communication via technologies that simply did not exist a few 
years ago. One important question for social psychologists is how these technolo-
gies influence our communication and social behaviour. Perhaps unsurprisingly, 
this is a growing area of research. 
Computer-mediated communication
Most of the research on communication via new technology so far has focused on 
computer-mediated communication (CMC) and the differences between CMC and 
face-to-face communication. Of course, as other technologies develop (e.g., text 
messaging, social networking, microblogging), more research will emerge, but for 
now most of the research has been concerned with how people communicate via 
email and the internet. More specifically, many studies of CMC have focused on 
the capacity of CMC users to communicate anonymously and on the hypothesis 
that communication via computers is different from other modes of communica-
tion. This idea has been explored extensively in a variety of settings since the 
beginnings of CMC, such as work-related behaviour (e.g., Siegel, Dubrovsky, 
Kiesler and McGuire, 1986; Sproull and Kiesler, 1986), the development of online 
relationships (e.g., Lea and Spears, 1995; van Gelder, 1985) and the level of hostility 
in CMC (e.g., Douglas and McGarty, 2001, 2002; Kiesler, Siegel and McGuire, 
1984; Lea, O’Shea, Fung and Spears, 1992). CMC is generally perceived to allow 
communicators the freedom to act in ways they normally would not, and liberate 
them from normal rules and standards of behaviour. The general argument that 
communication over the internet is disinhibited stems from the argument that 
anonymous behaviour releases people from constraints that would normally keep 
behaviour regulated and in line with societal norms and standards. This concept of 
deindividuation (Diener, 1980; Zimbardo, 1969) means that people are able to get 
away with bad behaviour because they do not need to answer for it. You will learn 
more about deindividuation in Chapter 10 on group behaviour. Generally, the 
concept of deindividuation is used to explain a variety of features of CMC, such as 
Computer-mediated 
communication (CMC)

Relating
the higher levels of disclosure that are witnessed in CMC versus face-to-face 
interaction (Joinson, 2001), even if this is reasonably superficial (Attrill and Jalil, 
2011), high levels of hostile, disinhibited or flaming behaviour witnessed over 
computer networks (e.g., Kiesler et al., 1984; Lea et al., 1992) and the tendency for 
hate groups to use the internet to transmit their views and recruit new members 
(see Douglas, McGarty, Bliuc and Lala, 2005; for overviews, see Douglas, 2007, 
2008). Also, going back to the topic of lying and deceit, a recent study showed 
that people who were highly motivated to tell lies were better able to do so in a 
text-based communication medium than when communicating face to face 
(Hancock, Curry, Woodworth and Goorha, 2008). Thus, the complete elimination 
of nonverbal cues may provide the freedom to violate social norms and also pave 
the way for people who want to deceive others. 
There is also some evidence of other negative phenomena existing in CMC. For 
example, research by Williams, Cheung and Choi (2000) and Zadro, Williams and 
Richardson (2004) has examined how people deal with being ostracized in a 
computer-mediated setting, such as when their emails are unanswered or they are 
ignored in a chat room. Using a unique program called the ‘Cyberball’ program, 
Zadro et al. (2004) showed that people have strong negative emotional reactions 
when they are ostracized in a CMC setting, even when they think they are only 
interacting with a computer. These reactions stem from an overarching need to 
belong and be socially included. However, the ambiguity of communicating with 
someone via a computer and the uncertainty concerning why they are being 
ignored (e.g., it could just be technological problems) does not attenuate the nega-
tive impact of ostracism (see Chapter 8). Also, there is evidence that people are 
often harassed, ‘cyberstalked’ and bullied when they communicate over the 
internet (Baruch, 2005; Khoo and Senn, 2004; Ybarra and Mitchell, 2004) and 
women and youths are the most common victims of these phenomena. Again, the 
most common explanation for these phenomena is that the medium is anonymous 
and therefore allows perpetrators to get away with negative behaviour. This may 
be the case, but it is unclear whether these phenomena actually occur more in 
CMC than in face-to-face communication.

Also, it is clearly the case that CMC is not always bad. One perspective 
proposes that what people do when they communicate via computers is governed 
more by group norms and standards than we might think. In particular, the social 
identity model of deindividuation effects (Reicher, Spears and Postmes, 1995; 
Spears and Lea, 1994), which we will revisit in Chapter 10, argues that anonymity 
can facilitate the enactment of social identity. Rather than proposing that 
anonymity always leads to chaos and deregulated behaviour, Spears and Lea 
(1994) proposed that anonymity of the self to a powerful audience may be liber-
ating in another way – anonymous communicators need not feel pressured to 
conform to the norms and expectations of the group (see also Reicher and Levine, 
1994a, 1994b), but may enact other aspects of their identity that the group would 
normally deem unacceptable. CMC can therefore equalize the context of commu-
nication to make it less constrained by communicators’ status. In other situations, 
the presence of an ingroup audience can strengthen the salience of the group’s 
norms and people will react more strongly in accordance with those norms rather 
than going against them (e.g., Douglas and McGarty, 2001, 2002; Postmes, Spears, 
Sakhel and de Groot, 2001; Sassenberg and Boos, 2003). Thus, there is more 
purpose to anonymous behaviour than previous theories might suggest. Overall, 
the internet provides people with a choice to either identify themselves or not, and 

250

this freedom may facilitate the expression of their identity to both opponents and 
like-minded individuals and groups. 
People have also found neat ways to deal with the limited nonverbal cues 
present in CMC. You will all be familiar with the use of emoticons such as smiley 
faces made up of keyboard symbols to denote emotional reactions, such as :–) for 
happiness and :–( for sadness. Because of the limited nonverbal cues available to 
computer-mediated communicators, these tools have become a valuable way of 
expressing what would otherwise be lost (Derks, Bos and von Grumbkow, 2004; 
Walther and D’Addario, 2001). Interestingly, there is some evidence that women 
may make more use of emoticons than men (Wolf, 2000).

Other technologies
As mentioned earlier, less is known about the social psychological implications of 
other new technologies such as mobile phone communication. However, some 
theorists point to the potential for mobile phone communication to affect how we 
think and behave in significant ways. For example, Katz and Aakhus (2002) argue 
that while mobile phones increase the pace and efficiency of people’s lives, they 
may ‘rob’ them of their leisure time. In always being accessible, people may never 
be released from their daily obligations. It may also be the case that the amount of 
time spent using mobile communication can decrease the amount of time people 
spend communicating face to face (Figure 5.8). This may have implications for 
how people interact with others and the quality of everyday social interactions. 
However, it may be the case that mobile telecommunications can actually bring 
people together, for both good and bad. For 
example, you may have heard the term ‘flash 
mob’ – these are groups of people who assemble 
suddenly in a public place for some specific 
purpose such as a demonstration, or for pure 
entertainment, and then quickly disperse 
(Duran, 2006). Such groups are typically organ-
ized through social networking, SMS messaging 
or viral emails. Clearly, such new technologies 
have the capacity to change the way people 
communicate in a variety of ways.

social contexts suggests that communicators are not conscious

an overview, see Wigboldus and Douglas, 2007). 
However, other research indicates people’s capacity to use

linguistic choices are determined by threats to their own group 
(maass et al., 1996) and communication goals (Douglas and

In this chapter, we turn our attention to the topic of persuasion. We outline some of the factors 
that determine when persuasion will be effective, the key models that explain persuasion, 
some of the techniques that people can use to be persuasive and, finally, how people are 
able to resist persuasion. By the end of this chapter, you will know when and how persuasion 
works and how persuasive techniques are used in advertising, marketing and everyday life.

old one on eBay. He is wondering how best to word 
his advertisement to maximize the appeal of the used 
iPod. What suggestions might you have for Ulrich to 
maximize his chances of making a sale?
2 Imogen asks Clare for some relationship advice. She 
has met a new man and cannot decide whether or not 
to go out with him. Clare offers her advice but then 
Imogen asks if she will go on a double date. What 
is the likelihood that Clare will agree to this? Would 
Imogen have been better off asking Clare directly in 
the first place?
3 Fern watches at her window as a salesman walks 
around her street with a clipboard. When he comes 
to her house, she listens to what he has to say but 
then politely declines to buy the product he is selling. 
Why do you think Fern was so easily able to resist the 
salesperson’s persuasive attempt?

Why do car advertisements often depict attractive women in provocative poses 
draped over car bonnets? Why do famous celebrities promote perfume and beauty 
products? Why do politicians employ staff to write their speeches and help them 
with their campaigns? Try to imagine a day in your life when you are not confronted 
with commercial advertising designed to make you buy the latest fashions, phones 
and experiences. How would you decide what to buy? If political advertisements, 
speeches and propaganda did not exist, how would you decide who to vote for? We 
are persistently exposed to information attempting to influence what we buy, what 
we eat, who we vote for, what we look like, how we spend our free time – the list 
goes on. Indeed, persuading (and being persuaded) forms a vital part of our 
everyday life and it is impossible to imagine a world without persuasion. In this 
chapter, we turn our attention to this core topic in social psychology.
Persuasion is the process by which a message changes a person’s attitudes – how 
they evaluate an object – or changes their behaviours. Attempts at persuasion can 
be powerful. For example, in 1933, millions of people in Germany voted for the 
Nazi Party despite its radical policies, thanks, in no small part, to a highly efficient 
and persuasive propaganda machine. On the positive side, ‘quit smoking’ 
campaigns have had a significant impact on smoking habits in many countries. In 
Britain, for example, smoking fell to its lowest recorded level in 2007 when only 
21 per cent of the population aged 16 and over were smokers (ONS, 2009). Simi-
larly, casualities from road accidents involving illegal alcohol levels dropped 
significantly between 1986 and 1998, reflecting the success of long-standing drink 
driving campaigns. So, persuasion can have both positive and negative effects. 
However, we must note that not all persuasive efforts are effective in changing 
people’s attitudes and behaviour. For example, an attempt that persuades one 
person to quit smoking may not persuade another. Also, a persuasive political 
message that one person finds informative and useful, another may see as propa-
ganda and therefore react negatively to it. Thus, persuasion is a complex and 
important process worthy of social psychologists’ attention. 
Exploring further the study of persuasion is a core aspect of social psychology; one reason being that it involves 
many other areas besides psychology, such as marketing, consumer studies, health and politics. Use a search engine 
such as Google Scholar or a database such as PsycINFo or Web of Science and key in the search term ‘persuasion’. How 
many results do you find? How much social psychological research (roughly) can you see?
Accordingly, a great deal of research has investigated social psychological 
factors involved in persuasion processes (e.g., Cialdini, 2001; Petty and Cacioppo, 
1986a, 1986b; Sagarin, Cialdini, Rice and Serna, 2002). In this chapter, we will 
provide an overview of research and theorizing on the social psychology of 
persuasion. We will begin by outlining some of the conditions that make persua-
sion work. Specifically, we focus on the features of the persuasive source, the 
message itself and the target of the persuasive effort that make the effort successful. 
We then turn to the social psychological theories that explain how persuasion 
works. Here, we pay specific attention to the psychological pathways or processes

attitudes or behaviours.

that have been theorized and shown empirically to make persuasion happen. We 
then talk about some of the specific techniques that people can adopt to reach 
their persuasive targets most effectively. Finally, we focus on the contexts and 
consequences when persuasion attempts ‘backfire’ or simply do not work. 
When does persuasion work?
Before we begin to consider how persuasion works in general, it is useful to know 
about the ‘ingredients’ of successful persuasive efforts that have been identified in 
social psychology. That is, what elements need to be present for persuasion to 
happen? This section focuses on the three main features: 
1 The source of the message: Who is trying to persuade? Perhaps a lecturer is 
attempting to get students to study, a cosmetics advertiser is promoting a new 
type of mascara, or a friend is trying to convince another friend to go to a party. 
2 The message itself: What is the point and how does the message make its point? 
For example, perhaps a lecturer sends a strongly worded email to their students 
to get them to study, or the cosmetics advertiser designs a slick magazine adver-
tisement to promote a mascara. Perhaps a friend sends a friendly text message 
with a picture of everyone else having fun at a party. 
3 The target or audience of the persuasive attempt: Who is receiving the message? 
In our examples, the relevant audiences are the students, the potential buyers of 
the mascara, and the friend sitting at home not attending the party. 
Overall, the persuasion process can be characterized as the study of who says (or 
does) what, to whom, and what is the effect. 
This approach, which forms the basis of contemporary marketing and adver-
tising to date, represents the Yale approach to communication and persuasion. Towards 
the end of the Second World War, Carl Hovland was contracted to work for the US 
War Department to examine how propaganda could be used to gain public support 
for the US war campaign. After the war, his research continued, which resulted in 
this well-known model of the factors involved in persuasion (Hovland, Janis and 
Kelley, 1953). The approach emphasizes the importance of examining the charac-
teristics of the person (or persons) presenting the message, its contents, and the 
characteristics of the person (or persons) who receive it. In particular, Hovland et 
al. identified four steps in persuasion – attention, comprehension, acceptance and 
retention. The various outcomes (opinion change, perception change, emotion 
change and action change) depend on a complex interplay between the source, 
message and recipient. In the next section, we outline what social psychologists 
know about the contribution of the factors identified by the Yale approach.

and puts the world in imminent danger. On the other side are representatives from 
a large oil company who argue that climate change is a myth, instead arguing that 
there have always been phases of heating and cooling in global temperatures. 
Regardless of your views on climate change, which side of the argument should be 
the most persuasive? To give another example, when choosing a new skin care 
product, would you be persuaded by an advertisement depicting an attractive or 
an unattractive celebrity? Clearly, the source of the message matters. Research has 
demonstrated that the source’s attractiveness, likeability and similarity to the 
target, perceived credibility, expertise and trustworthiness are all important deter-
minants of the success of a persuasive attempt.
Attractiveness, likeability, and similarity 
Unsurprisingly, if a message source is perceived to be attractive, it will be more 
persuasive. The reason for this is quite logical – imagine looking at a skin care product 
featuring an attractive and healthy skinned model. When people look at such adver-
tisements, they tend to imagine that if they themselves use the product, they will 
become more attractive just like the model. In a more general sense, attractiveness is 
persuasive. This effect was demonstrated experimentally by Eagly and Chaiken 
(1975), who asked attractive and unattractive people to walk around and request that 
students sign a petition. The attractive persuaders were effective 41 per cent of the 
time, but the unattractive persuaders were only successful 32 per cent of the time. It 
appears that people are also more persuaded by emotional arguments made by 
attractive rather than unattractive people (Chaiken, 1979; Dion and Stein, 1978). 
Other findings suggest that like-
able people are particularly effective in 
eliciting persuasion via video and audio 
messages. Chaiken and Eagly (1983) 
gave participants persuasive messages 
from communicators who seemed like-
able or unlikeable. Likeability had been 
experimentally manipulated by means of 
another passage in which communica-
tors said that they liked the University 
of Toronto – where the participants were 
studying – more or less than their former 
university, the University of British 
Columbia. (Of course, these statements 
made the communicator seem more and 
less likeable, respectively.) In two studies, they found that the unlikeable commu-
nicator was just as persuasive as the likeable communicator in writing, but much 
less persuasive in audio and video messages (see Figure 6.1). Why might this be the 
case? Chaiken and Eagly found that people thought less about the communicator 
in written communication, and more about them in the audio and video condi-
tions. Thus, being able to hear and/or see the source can, to some extent, distract

Persuasion
us from the message and towards the characteristics of the source. Depending on 
the social context, then, communicator likeability can play a disproportionate role 
in determining how much a person will be persuaded. 
Indeed, source attractiveness, be it physical or social attractiveness, appears to 
be a powerful persuasive technique and so, unsurprisingly, is one that advertisers 
are adept at exploiting (see also Chaiken, 1979; Chaiken and Eagly, 1983). One 
only needs to consider a few familiar advertisements on TV to understand the 
power of attractiveness in advertising (Figure 6.2). Attractive celebrities advertise 
anything from washing powder to cosmetics, to prestige cars. The assumption 
behind the use of such people in advertising campaigns is that attractive, likeable 
and popular examples are persuasive and so influence the extent to which 
consumers want to buy the product. Social psychological evidence suggests that 
this is indeed an effective technique (e.g., Chaiken, 1979; Chaiken and Eagly, 
1983). It is so effective that everyday persuaders have a fairly good idea of how 
attractiveness can be exploited to persuade other people. For example, Vogel, 
Kutzner, Fiedler and Freytag (2010) demonstrated that people anticipate the 
success of a persuasive attempt largely based on the attractiveness of the persuader. 
They are also able to exploit attractiveness in attempts to persuade others. 
Exploring further Do you think that persuader attractiveness will have the same effect on all recipients? that is, 
will attractive people tend to persuade everyone? Later on in the chapter, we will discuss the notion of processing 
motivation – the extent to which people are motivated to process a message – and the influence of various different 
types of cues such as persuader attractiveness on different ‘types’ of persuasive targets. As in the previous exploring 
further exercise, take a look at the literature and try to understand when attractiveness ‘works’ and when it might 
sometimes be a less effective tool of persuasion. 
Another persuasive feature related to attractiveness is the extent to which the 
source is seen as similar to the self. We tend to see people who are similar to 
ourselves as more likeable (see Chapter 7) and we are generally more persuaded by 
people we like (Petty, Cacioppo and Goldman, 1981). We also tend to be more 
influenced by people who are members of our own group, probably because we 
remember these messages better (Haslam, McGarty and Turner, 1996; van Knip-
penberg and Wilke, 1992; Wilder, 1990; Wood, 2000). For example, 
a study by Mackie, Gastardo-Conaco and Skelly (1992) asked 
student participants to read a persuasive speech about euthanasia or 
gun control. The speech was said to be from a student at their own 
university or another university. Results showed that the students 
were persuaded by the speech that supposedly came from a person 
within their own institution but were not persuaded when exactly 
the same speech was said to come from someone in a different insti-
tution. Familiarity – something that is strong within groups and 
weaker between groups – is persuasive. However, this is not to say 
that people will accept any old message as long as it comes from 
within one’s own group. For example, Mackie, Worth and Asun-
FigurE 6.2 Attractiveness

in their campaigns.

cion (1990) asked participants to read both weak and strong arguments from within 
the group and found the stronger messages to be more influential, suggesting that 
people do process the content and quality of messages from within the group. 
However, the same study demonstrated that participants were equally dissuaded 
by strong and weak messages from outside the group, suggesting they did not pay 
much attention to the content. Therefore, group familiarity appears to be an 
important predictor of persuasion. Other theorists have argued that the perceived 
validity of social information in general is largely determined by a perceiver’s belief 
that it comes from a self-relevant group. Such a group is more likely to be a reliable 
and qualified source of information about social reality (Haslam, McGarty and 
Turner, 1996; Turner, Hogg, Oakes et al., 1987). This perspective can also explain 
the finding that persuasion tends to be strongest from within the group.
Further, people who act in a similar way to ourselves (e.g., similar gestures) or 
who mimic our own gestures tend to be more persuasive (e.g., Tanner, Ferraro, 
Chartrand et al., 2008). For example, van Baaren, Holland, Steenaert and van 
Knippenberg (2003) demonstrated that a confederate waitress received signifi-
cantly larger tips when she mimicked her customers (e.g., by repeating their order 
to them verbatim) than when she did not (e.g., by paraphrasing). Thus, the wait-
ress was arguably more persuasive in getting tips if she mimicked the customer. In 
another study, van Baaren, Holland, Kawakami and van Knippenberg (2004) 
found that participants who had been mimicked by the experimenter performed 
more prosocial acts such as picking up pens the experimenter had dropped, or 
giving to a charity suggested by the experimenter. Again, the sales industry is good 
at exploiting this knowledge. Salespeople are often trained to mirror and mimic 
their customers to increase the possibility they will make a sale. However, it 
should be noted that similarity does not always produce the most influence. 
Where matters of taste are concerned, people are more influenced by similar 
others, but when the issue is more about facts and being right, dissimilar sources 
can be more influential (Goethals and Nelson, 1973). So, if you were asked who 
was Britain’s best prime minister, you would be more likely to be swayed by the 
input of a friend who shares your own political outlook and might be likely to 
respond like you. However, if you were asked how many prime ministers there 
had been, you might be more likely to listen to a dissimilar source. 
Perceived credibility, expertise and trustworthiness 
As has been demonstrated in a range of studies, sources who appear to be expert or 
competent are more persuasive than those who lack credibility (e.g., Chaiken and 
Maheswaran, 1994; Tormala, Briñol and Petty, 2006; Verplanken, 1991; Wu and 
Shaffer, 1987). You will notice that fitness professionals often advertise exercise 
equipment, dentists (and people with great teeth) advocate toothpaste and sports-
people advertise sporting goods. This kind of advertising works because people 
tend to see fitness professionals as qualified to endorse exercise products and so on. 
Because people are deemed to have the expertise to comment on certain products, 
we take their comments more seriously (see also Tormala and Clarkson, 2007). 

263
Persuasion
Findings show that people are also more persuaded by others they perceive to 
be trustworthy. In particular, if we see someone as having an ulterior motive or 
perhaps suspect that they are actively attempting to manipulate us, we are less 
likely to be persuaded (e.g., Walster and Festinger, 1962). Related to this, we are 
also more likely to be persuaded when we see someone as acting against their own 
self-interests (Eagly, Wood and Chaiken, 1978; Wood and Eagly, 1981). We view 
such people as sincere and therefore more trustworthy. A study by Eagly et al. 
(1978) demonstrates this phenomenon. Participants were asked to listen to a 
political speech in which a person accused a large company of polluting a river. 
Some of the participants were told that the speaker was a pro-business candidate 
addressing a group of company supporters and some were told that the speaker 
was a pro-environmental candidate addressing an environmental protection 
group. Findings revealed that the pro-business candidate was more persuasive. 
Why? Eagly et al. argued that the candidate seemed the most sincere and trust-
worthy because he was perceived to be acting against his own interests. 
Many other variables can influence how trustworthy a persuader appears. For 
example, Miller, Maruyama, Beaber and Valone (1976) found that people who talk 
quickly are judged to be more intelligent, trustworthy and credible and are there-
fore more persuasive. Also, recent exposure to a non-credible message increases 
people’s susceptibility to more trustworthy persuasive sources (Tormala and 
Clarkson, 2007). In a twist on the ‘mere exposure effect’ discussed in Chapter 4, 
repeated exposure to a message can increase the perceived credibility of the source 
and thus the likelihood of being persuaded (Fragale and Heath, 2004). Repetition 
of a message can also make it appear more true (Arkes, Boehm and Xu, 1991; 
Moons, Mackie and Garcia-Marques, 2009), or make the brand name seem more 
‘famous’ and therefore more credible (Campbell and Keller, 2003). 
Although the credibility of the source is an important determinant of persua-
sion, the cause of non-credible communicators is not entirely lost. Over time, 
they may become persuasive. As time goes on, and it is harder to recall who 
presented the message, people’s opinions may be less and less determined by 
source credibility. Instead, they are persuaded by the message itself. This 
phenomenon is called the sleeper effect (Pratkanis, Greenwald, Leippe and Baum-
gardner, 1988). For example, you may have read a piece of information in a 
down-market tabloid or weekly celebrity gossip magazine and immediately 
dismissed it because of its dubious source credibility. However, over time, you 
may forget where you read the information and instead be persuaded by its 
content. This effect was originally demonstrated by Hovland and Weiss (1951). 
They asked student participants to read an article arguing that nuclear submarines 
were safe. Half the participants were told the article was written by Robert 
Oppenheimer (the scientist in charge of developing the atomic bomb) and the 
other half were told the message source was the Soviet news agency Pravda. 
Bearing in mind the political tensions of the time, the second source was much 
less credible than the first. Unsurprisingly, the participants were immediately 
most convinced by the credible source. However, four weeks later, the partici-

pants were tested again and the advantage for the 
credible source disappeared (see Figure 6.3). In 
particular, the participants in the non-credible source 
condition found the article as convincing as the 
participants in the credible source condition. The 
sleeper effect is a robust phenomenon, having been 
demonstrated in a wide variety of contexts and 
experiments (Crano and Prislin, 2006; Kumkale and Albarracin, 2004). However, 
if participants are reminded of the source before asking questions in the second 
phase of the study, the effect disappears (Kelman and Hovland, 1953).
Time to reflect think about the public exposure related to the personal life of golfer tiger Woods during 2010, 
when he was found to have had a number of extramarital affairs. Before the media frenzy, tiger Woods held multi-
million dollar advertising contracts with leading brands such as Nike. Many of these contracts were lost. Is he now 
less qualified to advertise these products?
The message
The source of the message matters, and what the message contains (and how it is 
presented) are also vital ingredients that determine the success of persuasion. First, 
there are many aspects of the message itself that affect its persuasiveness. Here, we 
will talk about the length of the message, its consistency with the audience’s 
opinion, its repetition, the extent to which it arouses fear and whether it is factual 
or emotional.
Message length 
It is not simply the case that longer or more detailed messages are more persuasive 
than shorter messages. Bigger is not necessarily better when it comes to persua-
sion. In many aspects of social psychology, the relationship between variables is 
complex, and the link between message length and persuasion is no exception to 
this rule. For instance, findings show that long messages are more effective if they 
are strong, but they are less effective if they are weak (Petty and Cacioppo, 1984; 
Wood, Kallgren and Preisler, 1985). Also, long, weak messages are less impactful 
than short, strong messages (Friedrich, Fetherstonhaugh, Casey and Gallagher, 
1996). If a person is trying to influence another, they are perhaps best off writing a 
quick message with a few key, strong points rather than writing a longer message 
where the important details can easily get lost. All else being equal (understanding, 
complexity and familiarity), a ‘strong’ message typically includes objective facts 
that are central to an issue, whereas a ‘weak’ message provides information that is 
peripheral to the issue. Message strength can also be influenced by the source’s 
likeability, credibility and consistency.
FigurE 6.3 The sleeper effect People are most convinced by 
credible sources. However, over time, non-credible sources can be 
persuasive because people lose their memory for the source.

Persuasion
Consistency 
The consistency between a persuasive message and the target’s original attitude is 
also an important factor in determining the message’s persuasive effectiveness. For 
example, it would be difficult to persuade an animal rights activist to endorse 
animal testing for cosmetics, or a committed Conservative Party supporter to vote 
for the Green Party. If a message is too distant from the audience’s attitude, it is 
likely the message will be ignored. One demonstration of this effect comes from a 
study by Liberman and Chaiken (1992; see also Sherman, Nelson and Steele, 
2000), who found that coffee drinkers were more likely to reject a message arguing 
for a link between caffeine consumption and ill-health than were non-coffee 
drinkers. The message was incompatible with participants’ love of coffee, so 
perhaps participants simply did not want to know about it. This tendency to 
ignore messages that are inconsistent with our attitudes can have important conse-
quences. For example, one consequence may be that people’s attitudes become 
more extreme over time. If people ignore evidence that disconfirms their opinions 
but keep interacting with like-minded individuals (and thus accrue more informa-
tion that is consistent with their attitudes), then original attitudes may strengthen 
(Pomerantz, Chaiken and Tordesillas, 1995). 
A classic study by Lord, Ross and Lepper (1979) demonstrates this phenom-
enon. In this study, students who were either opposed to or in favour of the death 
penalty were asked to read about the results of two fictional studies. One study 
suggested that the death penalty reduces homicides and the other showed no reduc-
tion. After reading about the studies, participants rated how much their attitudes 
towards capital punishment had changed. Results showed that the participants who 
were against capital punishment at the beginning of the study became more 
opposed to capital punishment after reading the two articles. The participants who 
were originally in favour of capital punishment became more in favour. Their 
ratings of the articles’ strength were also influenced by prior attitudes towards the 
topic (see Figure 6.4). Here, participants who were 
originally in favour of capital punishment rated the 
‘in favour’ article as stronger than the ‘against’ article. 
On the other hand, participants who were originally 
against capital punishment rated the ‘against’ article 
as stronger than the ‘in favour’ article. This latter 
finding points to another interesting fact – viewing 
both sides of an argument does not always make 
people more impartial. People tend to think that 
arguments from their own ‘side’ are stronger, so 
reading or hearing arguments from the other ‘side’ is 
not always going to change people’s minds. 
Repetition 
When you are watching commercial TV, no doubt you get sick of seeing the same 
advertisements over and over again. However, there is good reason why they are

shown so often. Evidence suggests that messages become more effective if they are 
repeated. For advertisers, the logic behind this is that people need to be exposed to 
messages on multiple occasions in order for them to be remembered and recalled. 
Of course, this does not mean that information needs to be repeated endlessly and 
indiscriminately. This would be expensive and would waste a lot of valuable 
advertising money and resources. However, it appears that advertisements are 
most effective when people are exposed to them two to three times per week 
(Tellis, 1987). This echoes other findings suggesting that the simple repetition of 
information can make it appear more true (Arkes et al., 1991). 
However, the picture is a bit more complex than it originally seemed to be. 
Specifically, there is some evidence to suggest that repeated exposure to messages is 
most effective when people are already somewhat familiar with what is being adver-
tised and have had an initially positive response to the advertisement (Campbell and 
Keller, 2003). Repeated advertising of a brand new product is not as effective. In this 
case, a certain level of familiarity is important if repeat advertising is going to work. 
Also, there is some evidence to suggest that the effects of advertisements can plateau 
or even ‘wear out’ with repeated exposure (Campbell and Keller, 2003; Craig, Stern-
thal and Leavitt, 1976; Hughes, 1992). Repetition is, therefore, more likely to be an 
effective persuasive technique when the repetition is carried out with some level of 
variety. Advertisers may need to change their advertisements, techniques or presen-
tation periodically in order to maximize their chances of success. 
Fear arousal 
Messages can also be persuasive by making people feel bad. In particular, many 
persuasion attempts are designed to arouse fear in recipients. Readers in the UK 
will be familiar with ‘stop smoking’ advertisements featuring death-related images 
and graphic depictions of the hazards of cigarette smoking. By making people feel 
scared, vulnerable and aware of their own mortality, advertisers hope that people 
will quit smoking (see the Social psychology in the real world box) and most of 
the time this works (Leventhal, Watts and Pagano, 1967; O’Hegarty, Pederson, 
Nelson et al., 2007). Fear campaigns like this are used extensively in health-related 
advertising, for example. Health advertisements at the height of the swine flu 
outbreak in 2008/09 encouraged people to ‘catch it, bin it, kill it’ (a sneeze, that is) 
or else put others at risk of catching swine flu. In efforts to raise awareness of skin 
cancer, Australian government skin cancer prevention advertisements depicted 
people being cut open on the operating table to remove melanomas. Safe sex 
advertisements, especially prominent in the 1980s, depicted the grim reaper 
bowling down men, women and children in a bowling alley. Such advertisements 
were designed to make people fear AIDS and therefore practise safe sex. At a less 
extreme level, think of advertisements for products like washing machine anti-
limescale tablets, which forecast the complete destruction of the domestic washing 
machine if this product is not used. Fear is a powerful tool of persuasion, and no 
doubt you can think of many other examples where fear is used in advertisements 
and more generally in everyday persuasion attempts. 

267
Persuasion
But how much fear is enough to persuade people? Some research shows that 
the more fear people feel, the more persuaded they are by advertisements (de 
Hoog, Stroebe and de Wit, 2007; Leventhal et al., 1967). However, it is clear that 
fear-inducing advertisements do not always work. After all, people still smoke 
and engage in other risky or unhealthy behaviours. People still sunbathe and 
not everyone buys anti-limescale products for their washing machines. Aronson 
(1997) argued that fear is sometimes ineffective in persuasion because people often 
engage in denial when the problem seems unsolvable. Findings suggest that this 
denial can be avoided, and fear again becomes persuasive when a tangible solution 
to the problem is offered (Devos-Comby and Salovey, 2002; Witte, Berkowitz, 
Cameron and McKeon, 1998). For example, a person may be more likely to stop 
smoking if information about help and support is presented in the advertisement. 
Others have argued that an ‘inverted-U’ curve hypothesis may explain how much 
fear is most effective in persuasion attempts (see Figure 6.5). In particular, Janis 
(1967; see also McGuire, 1969) argued that a moderate amount of fear was most 
effective to induce attitude change. This is probably because people are simply 
not motivated to process the non-threatening message. Also, high levels of fear 
may lead people to be too anxious and therefore sink into denial, so again the 
persuasion attempt is ineffective. However, if people are moderately fearful, they 
are likely to be swayed by a message because there is a reasonable balance – people 
take notice of the message because it 
is moderately threatening, but not so 
threatening as to induce panic (see also 
Block and Keller, 1995). If the problem 
seems solvable, people will do some-
thing about it. More recent research 
(O’Neill and Nicholson-Cole, 2009) 
has demonstrated much the same 
point about advertising campaigns 
encouraging people to reduce their 
carbon footprint in order to mitigate 
the threat of climate change – a subject 
to which we return in Chapter 14.
Exploring further In 2010, a Uk government advertising campaign, called ‘Act on Co2’, was withdrawn after many 
viewers complained that it exaggerated the risks associated with climate change. Use an internet search engine to 
find the campaign (try searching by combining the terms ‘Uk’, ‘climate change’, ‘advertising’, ‘2010’ and ‘campaign’). 
you can view the advertisement and read about the story online (e.g., the BBC News website has a story online 
about it). this costly fiasco highlights another of the dangers of fear campaigns –they can risk a backlash, especially 
when the message being proposed is one that a vociferous minority of the population do not want to hear. Based on 
the findings in this chapter, how would you modify this campaign?

A less extreme version of the fear technique is known as the scarcity technique, 
whereby the persuader makes the item of interest more attractive by convincing 
the target that the item is rare. You will no doubt be familiar with the common 
sales term ‘while stocks last’, or ‘hurry, only one left at this price’, based on which 
people rush to buy the product in question. There is evidence that this technique 
works. For example, Worchel, Lee and Adewole (1975) gave participants a choco-
late chip cookie and asked them to taste and rate it on a number of scales. In one 
condition, there were only two cookies in the jar but in the other condition, the 
jar had 10 cookies. Therefore, in the first condition, the cookies were a scarce 
resource. Worchel et al. found that people rated the cookie as more desirable 
where they were asked to take a cookie from the two-cookie jar, that is, when the 
cookies were a scarce resource.

How to get people to stop smoking
over the past 10 years, public health advertisements in the 
Uk and elsewhere have increasingly featured morbid 
scenes of early graves for smokers and the grieving 
children of parents who have died of smoking-related 
health problems. More common perhaps are 
advertisements featuring scenes of clogged arteries, 
smokers being ‘hooked’ through the mouth by fishing 
lines and advertisements showing blood clots in smokers’ 
dissected brains. these scare tactics are common features 
of health-related advertising and their effects are viewed 
as very powerful. the statistics also speak to the success of 
anti-smoking campaigns, with the lowest levels of 
smoking ever recorded in Britain in 2007. 
one fairly recent innovation in the campaign against 
smoking is to place warnings on cigarette packets. In such 
warnings, smokers are notified in bold, block letters about 
the health risks associated with smoking. For example, 
smokers are told that ‘smoking causes heart disease’, 
‘smoking harms your unborn baby’ and ‘smoking causes 
impotence’. the rationale for using such warnings is that 
an immediate and explicit reminder of the hazards of 
smoking will encourage people not to light up. Does this 
work? As we noted earlier, smoking has definitely reduced 
over the past few years, but recent social psychological 
research provides an interesting twist. Hansen, Winzeler 
and topolinski (2010) conducted an experiment where 
they first measured how important smoking was to the 
self-esteem of 39 student smokers. After this, the smokers 
were divided into two groups. one group was asked to 
look at two cigarette packs that featured death-related 
warnings, while the other group was asked to look at 
cigarette packs that featured death-neutral warnings such 
as ‘smoking makes you unattractive’. Next, all the 
participants rated their attitudes to smoking. 
Findings showed that in students for whom smoking 
was important to their self-esteem, those who viewed 
packets with death-related warnings reported more (not 
less) positive attitudes to smoking compared with those 
who looked at neutral warnings. the opposite pattern of 
results was found in participants for whom smoking was 
not vital to their self-esteem. In other words, for some 
smokers, smoking makes them feel good – they may feel 
that it is an important aspect of their identity or they think 
it makes them look cool. For these people, death-related 
warnings do not have the intended effect and actually 
make them want to smoke more.

Questions
1 Can you think of reasons why the death-related 
warnings do not work for the smokers who derive a 
self-esteem ‘boost’ from smoking? (Hint: check out 
terror management theory by using the Index of this 
textbook or by looking online. the theory states that 
self-esteem is a vital buffer against the fundamental 
fear of death.)
2 What kinds of messages might be more effective on 
these people?
3 What are the potential implications of these findings for 
anti-smoking campaigns? After all, many people who 
smoke genuinely enjoy it and are happy to be smokers. 
Factual appeals versus emotional appeals 
Sometimes, persuaders arm themselves with the objective facts in order to sway 
others. For example, advertisers may present a convincing set of statistics or a list 
of specifications and technical details. At other times, however, advertisers present 
their own or others’ opinions which are more subjective. These two different 
types of persuasive messages are often termed factual and evaluative advertising. 
Both are effective, but which works best? Seemingly, the optimal approach 
depends on the target of the persuasive appeal. Research suggests that analytical 
and well-educated people are more persuaded by rational appeals (Cacioppo, 
Petty and Morris, 1983), while disinterested or disengaged audiences are more 
swayed by their liking for the persuader (Chaiken, 1980). The effectiveness of 
factual versus evaluative appeals also depends on how a person came to have their 
attitudes in the first place. Specifically, if an attitude was acquired through 
emotion, they can be changed by other appeals to emotion. However, attitudes 
acquired via facts and information are less likely to be changed by emotional 
appeals and more likely to be changed by factual appeals (Edwards, 1990; Fabrigar 
and Petty, 1999; Petty and Wegener, 1998). 
Obviously, advertisers use both types of appeals and often use both in the same 
advertisement. Perhaps this intuitively takes into account the fact that different 
people are influenced by different types of appeals, but also that advertisers are 
covering all options. In other words, if an advertisement makes someone feel like 
the product is good and at the same time convinces people of the facts, how can it 
fail to persuade?
The method
Several features of the way in which the message is sent can influence its effective-
ness. For example, whether an argument is presented as one-sided or two-sided is 
often important. Also, when the vital information is presented (first or last) can 
determine how much effect it has on people’s attitudes and behaviours. Further, 
the channel of delivery is important. We will discuss each of these factors in turn. 
Two-sided messages 
People are often presented with more than one argument at once. For example, 
think of members of a jury who hear both the arguments of the prosecution and

the defence and ultimately need to decide on the guilt or innocence of a defendant. 
Thus, persuaders need to know how to deal with competing arguments to enhance 
the effectiveness of their own messages. One way to do this is to present a two-
sided argument; that is, persuaders can present information in favour of an idea, 
attitude or product, but at the same time present information that is against the 
intended persuasion attempt. Two-sided arguments are particularly effective if 
people are aware of opposing arguments (e.g., Jones and Brehm, 1970). For 
example, a study by Werner, Stoll, Birch and White (2002) demonstrated the effec-
tiveness of a recycling campaign that used a prominent counterargument. On a 
university campus rubbish bin, students were asked not to dispose of aluminium 
cans but instead take them to a recycling bin located on an upstairs floor. When 
the message on the bin was accompanied by an acknowledgement of the major 
counterargument against taking the cans upstairs (that it was, of course, inconve-
nient to have to go upstairs to recycle the cans), recycling behaviour reached 80 
per cent. This was a significant increase from a condition where no such message 
was given, and demonstrates that presenting people with a counterargument 
makes a persuasive attempt more effective. Similar effects occur in the court room 
where a defence case appears more credible if lawyers pre-empt some of the infor-
mation that will be used by the prosecution (e.g., ‘of course he has stolen cars in 
the past but he is a good man and there is no evidence that he committed this 
crime’). In presenting conflicting information before it is intended to do damage 
and therefore ‘stealing the thunder’ of the prosecution, the damage is somewhat 
controlled (Williams, Bourgeois and Croyle, 1993). 
In a similar vein, the way in which a message is 
framed can influence its meaning, and therefore 
how it is received. For instance, if a message is 
framed as ‘reverse discrimination’, it is less likely 
to be accepted and is viewed less favourably than if 
it is presented as ‘equal opportunities’ (Bosveld, 
Koomen and Vogelaar, 1997). It is more effective, 
therefore, to promote minority presence in a 
particular profession by advertising that the 
employer values equal opportunities rather than 
advertising that they have a ‘quota place’ for a 
particular minority group. Also, if a message with 
positive outcomes is presented in terms of gain (e.g., gains in wellbeing through 
exercise), it will be more successful than if framed in negative terms (e.g., losing 
weight through exercise). Thus, the way a message is presented and framed influ-
ences its ability to persuade its target.

Persuasion
Primacy and recency effects 
Imagine you are competing in a talent contest and there are 20 performers in the 
line-up (Figure 6.7). Would your chances of winning be better if you performed 
near the beginning, in the middle, or closer to the end? Would people remember 
you better if you went first, would you be ‘lost’ if you went in the middle, or does 
being the most recent performance in the judges’ minds give you the best chance 
of success? Social psychological research gives us some idea of what to expect. 
Some research suggests that information presented first is most persuasive 
(Asch, 1946). For example, Asch showed that if a person is described as ‘intelli-
gent, industrious, impulsive, critical, stubborn and envious’, people tend to form 
more positive impressions of them in comparison to when they are described as 
‘envious, stubborn, critical, impulsive, industrious and intelligent’ (Asch, 1946). 
This is because, in the first description, the more positive information is presented 
first. In this case, the positive information benefits from a primacy effect: it is 
presented first, remembered better and therefore has the most influence on the 
recipient. On the other hand, the second example presents negative adjectives first 
and therefore these have the most influence. 
Try it yourself Here is the list of traits used by Asch (1946). List 1 presents the 
positive traits first and list 2 presents the negative traits first. Asch found a primacy 
effect, such that participants reading list 1 liked the hypothetical person more than 
those who had read list 2. try it on your friends. Ask, say, 20 friends to read one of 
the lists (10 for each list) and then ask them one question: How likeable do you 
think this person is on a scale of 1–7. tally up and calculate a mean for each group. 
Did your results replicate the effect observed by Asch?

This primacy effect has practical implications. First, people tend to side more 
with the arguments they hear first in speeches (Miller and Campbell, 1959), and if 
you are standing for office, it is better to appear at the top of a ballot sheet than 
anywhere else (Moore, 2004). Also, people tend to prefer the first option they are 
presented with in terms of making everyday product choices (Carney and Banaji, 
2008). Further, primacy effects are important in informing our impressions of 
people (e.g., Anderson, 1965; Hendrick and Costantini, 1970; Jones, 
Rock, Shaver et al., 1968). In many cases, it does appear that first 
impressions count.
However, other research suggests that information presented last 
(that is, most recently) can also be persuasive. In particular, this 
recency effect occurs if there is some chance that people will have 
forgotten the information they were presented with first. For 
example, if people are presented with some material and then wait a 
week before receiving another set of material, they are likely to 
forget the first set of information and be influenced by the material 
presented most recently (Miller and Campbell, 1959). This effect was 
originally demonstrated by Luchins (1957), who found that partici-

pants remembered the information they were presented with first (primacy effect) 
in cases where all the information was presented in immediate succession. 
However, when there was a delay mid-way through presenting the information, 
participants remember the most recent information best (recency effect). 
Of course, a complex set of factors influence whether we can expect a primacy 
or recency effect to occur. For example, primacy effects are more common, even 
after a delay, if the first set of information stimulates thinking (Haugtvedt and 
Wegener, 1994). It is thought that the primacy effect is also more common gener-
ally, because accommodating new information means changing one’s initial 
impression – first impressions are strong and people are at their most attentive 
when making initial impressions (Anderson, 1975). However, if the recipients are 
asked to make a commitment straightaway after the most recent information is 
presented, then a recency effect is more likely to occur. Therefore, it is not easy to 
answer the questions posed at the beginning of this section unless we know more 
about the way in which the acts are performed in the talent contest. However, all 
things being equal, primacy effects are the most powerful and, therefore, most of 
the time, it seems that it is better to go first (you might want to read over the 
coverage of primacy and recency effects in impression formation in Chapter 3, 
where conclusions are largely similar).
Exploring further Look up the winners of a judged event (e.g., song or talent contest) over the past few years. 
take, for example, the eurovision Song Contest. If you search for ‘eurovision order 2012’, for example, you can find 
the song order of the final, and if you search ‘eurovision results 2012’, you can also find these results. If you search 
back a few years, does it look like contestants are more likely to win if they appear in the middle, or can you see 
evidence for primary and/or recency effects?
The channel 
The mode through which the information is presented (e.g., face to face, video, TV 
advertisements, flyers and so on) is an important factor in determining the effec-
tiveness of persuasive attempts. There is no denying that TV advertisements can be 
powerful. For example, in the US presidential primaries (the first stages of electing 
the president), the candidates who advertise the most tend to do much better than 
those who spend less on their TV advertising campaigns (Grush, 1980). As we saw 
earlier, repetition of a message can make it more powerful, so repeated presentation 
of the same TV advertisement is likely to have a significant effect on voting behav-
iour. However, more specific features of persuasive attempts can influence their 
impact. Chaiken and Eagly (1976) argued that for information that is difficult to 
comprehend, written information should be the most persuasive because this 
medium gives people the opportunity to carefully work through and consider the 
message at their own pace. To test this, they compared the influence of messages 
presented in written form, or via TV and audio channels (Chaiken and Eagly, 1983). 
In general, they found that video presentations were the most effective in bringing 
about attitude change. However, when the message was more complex or difficult 
to understand, written material had the most impact. So, although common wisdom 
may suggest that the visual impact of TV advertising is the most powerful, in fact a 

273
Persuasion
message’s impact depends more on the type of 
information presented (see Figure 6.8). Adver-
tisers can make good use of this information to 
increase the effectiveness of their campaigns. In 
particular, presenting an advertisement in video 
format takes away targets’ opportunity to 
consider the message, and so they may rely more 
on simple cues presented in the message that are 
not part of the central argument. As we will see 
later, simple cues can often be persuasive in 
effecting attitude change.
Time to reflect Chaiken and eagly’s study was conducted in 1983. A lot has changed since then, and advertisers 
now have a wealth of new advertising media to use, such as websites, social networking sites and SMS messaging. 
take a look Chaiken and eagly’s results. Do you think that ‘easy’ and ‘difficult’ messages would be differentially 
effective in these new media? 
The target or audience
The effectiveness of a persuasive message is also strongly influenced by features of 
the target or audience at whom the persuasive attempt is aimed. For example, 
individual differences, such as gender, age, self-esteem and personality traits, can 
influence the effectiveness of persuasive messages. We will now briefly discuss 
some of these target features that influence persuasion processes.
Gender 
Overall, research tends to suggest that women are more susceptible to persuasion 
than men. Some researchers argue that perhaps this is because women and men 
have different social roles. In particular, women are said to be more cooperation 
focused, whereas men are said to be more focused on independence in their inter-
actions with others (Eagly and Carli, 1981; Eagly, Wood and Fishbaugh, 1981). 
Thus, women are perhaps more socially sensitive or receptive to the influence of 
others than men. Other researchers suggest that gender differences in persuasion 
are also dependent on the nature of the influence attempt (Guadagno and Cialdini, 
2002). In particular, findings show that women tend to be more persuaded by 
face-to-face appeals than other types of written messages like emails, whereas men 
show no difference. Again, perhaps women’s cooperation focus makes it more 
difficult to resist persuasive appeals that are made in person. 
However, other findings suggest that women are only more influenced than 
men when the topic of discussion is something with which males are more familiar 
(Sistrunk and McDavid, 1971). Because most messages used in attitude research 
FigurE 6.8 Attitude change for easy or difficult messages 
the effectiveness of ‘easy’ messages is enhanced by 
video presentation but for ‘difficult’ messages, written 
presentation is the most persuasive.

typically involved male-oriented topics and most experimenters were male, these 
findings raised an interesting point – perhaps the experiments had not been gender 
fair. If topics had been more gender neutral, then results may not have suggested 
that women are more sensitive to influence than men (Eagly and Carli, 1981). Of 
course, this treads into somewhat controversial territory. People tend to think of 
being ‘easily persuaded’ as being a negative trait, much like being of low intelli-
gence. A lot of controversy surrounds the cultural fairness of intelligence tests, so 
perhaps considerations of persuasiveness suffer the same biases. Recently, a study 
by Eaton (2009) showed that gender differences in persuasion were largely 
dependent on the salience of gender norms. Specifically, making people aware, or 
‘priming’ female sex roles, leads to reduced attitude strength in women and there-
fore openness to attitude change. 
Also, to add more complexity to the picture, the persuasive context influences 
gender differences in persuasion. For example, Carli (1990) showed that the 
nature of the speaker (tentative vs. assertive), their gender (male vs. female), the 
nature of the audience (male vs. female) and different combinations of these vari-
ables influence message success. For example, in this experiment, when the 
speaker was female and tentative, male targets were more susceptible to persua-
sion than female targets. However, male speakers were equally influential, irre-
spective of how assertive or tentative they were. The relationships between 
gender and persuasion are quite complex and much about the link between 
gender and persuasion is still unknown. 
Age 
Research suggests that late adolescents and young adults are the most susceptible 
to persuasive messages, so it perhaps unsurprising that these groups are targeted 
heavily by TV advertisers (Krosnick and Alwin, 1989; Sears, 1986). It is argued 
that this demographic is more easily persuadable because, compared to adults, 
younger people have less stable attitudes and show less resistance to authority, so 
their attitudes and behaviours are easier to influence and change. Indeed, some 
countries ban advertising aimed at children, probably for this reason. They are 
seen to be in the ‘impressionable years’ and therefore more easily influenced 
(Sears, 1986). However, other research suggests a different developmental pattern 
of persuasion. Specifically, Visser and Krosnick (1998) found that people in early 
and late adulthood were more receptive to persuasive messages than those in 
middle adulthood. They argued that susceptibility to persuasion is high in early 
adulthood but decreases as people get older. Further, people become less suscep-
tible to persuasion because their accumulated experiences increase their resistance. 
In early adulthood, core attitudes, values and beliefs are formed, and in later adult-
hood, people become more susceptible to persuasion again so that people are the 
least susceptible in middle adulthood. Finally, Visser and Krosnick argued that 
people are generally open to attitude change across the life span, but core attitudes 
and values (secured in early adulthood) tend to be resistant to change throughout 
the remainder of the life span.

275
Persuasion
There is evidence to support all these hypotheses to some extent (e.g., Tyler and 
Schuller, 1991; Visser and Krosnick, 1998). Again, however, the nature of the 
message also matters. For example, Fung and Carstensen (2003) showed that older 
adults were more influenced by messages that focused on meaningful goals (e.g., 
‘Capture the special moments’), but that younger adults showed no preference for 
such messages. Therefore, like gender, the relationships between age and persua-
sion are complex. 
Personality and individual differences 
Research into the personality characteristics that influence how prone a person is 
to persuasion has also yielded quite complicated results. Indeed, many other social 
contextual variables can influence relationships between personality/individual 
differences variables and persuasion. However, one common factor that 
researchers have investigated is people’s need for cognition (NFC) – the extent to 
which they derive fulfilment and enjoyment from thinking about things (Cacioppo 
and Petty, 1982; Haugtvedt and Petty, 1992; Jarvis and Petty, 1996). In general, 
people who have a greater need to evaluate information are more likely to express 
evaluative opinions when they look at new things (e.g., ‘I would never wear that’) 
and will also think more about the information presented. The likelihood that 
they will be influenced by a message will therefore depend on the strength of the 
message (Cacioppo, Petty and Morris, 1983). Weaker messages have lesser impact 
on people who score high on the need to evaluate information. Later in the 
chapter, we will talk more about how individual differences in thinking styles are 
related to persuasion. Need for cognitive closure (NFCC) also influences persuasion 
(Kruglanski, Webster and Klem, 1993), with people who score higher on NFCC 
being generally less susceptible to influence, arguably because they are more 
cognitively closed-minded and essentially less persuadable simply because they 
have a predisposition to ‘make their minds up’ early on. Similarly, people who 
show a preference for consistency (Cialdini, Trost and Newsom, 1995) and show 
high attitude importance (Zuwerink and Devine, 1996) are less likely to be 
persuaded than people who score low on these variables.
Try it yourself this is a shortened version of the NFCC scale. Complete it for yourself. Are you high, medium or low 
in NFCC? Do you think of yourself as someone who is susceptible to influence and advertising?

Mood 
Messages can also be persuasive by making people feel good. Good feelings can 
promote persuasion partly because such feelings enhance positive thinking and 
positive thinking increases impulsive decision making (Bodenhausen, 1993; 
Mackie and Worth, 1991; Moons and Mackie, 2007). On the other hand, when 
people are in a good mood, they are also more likely to associate the message with 
positive feelings and this promotes influence. This effect was demonstrated in a 
study by Janis, Kaye and Kirschner (1965), who showed that people were more 
persuaded by a message they were reading if they were able to snack and consume 
a soft drink while they were reading. Other research reveals more complex effects. 
For example, Bless, Bohner, Schwarz and Strack (1990) found that participants put 
in a sad mood were influenced by counterattitudinal messages when they were 
strong (not weak), but that happy participants were equally influenced by strong 
and weak messages (see also Schwarz, Bless and Bohner, 1991; for a review, see 
Petty and Briñol, 2008). As we saw in Chapter 4, emotion affects cognition, and, 
in particular, being in a sad mood can make people more inclined to think ration-
ally and reach accurate conclusions. 
How does persuasion work?
Above, we highlighted some of the source, message and audience characteristics 
that make persuasion a likely outcome. These findings are useful and a whole 
range of individuals, groups and companies can use these techniques to maximize 
the impact of their persuasive attempts. However, as informative as these findings 
are, they tell us little about exactly how persuasion happens. That is, how are 
certain types of messages successful at influencing people? How does it come 
about that some people are more influenced than others? Researchers have 

277
Persuasion
attempted to uncover the psychological processes underlying persuasion by 
proposing and testing social psychological theories of persuasion. 
Two of the most prominent models are the elaboration likelihood model (Petty 
and Cacioppo, 1986b; Petty and Wegener, 1999) and the heuristic-systematic 
model (Chaiken, 1980, 1987; Bohner, Moskowitz and Chaiken, 1995). Although 
these approaches differ in many respects, they both propose that persuasion 
occurs via two processes, which depend on the different types of persuasive cues 
that are given attention by the target – thus they are dual process models. Both 
models assert that the source of the message and the message itself play distinct 
roles in persuasion and that the outcome of a persuasive interaction also depends 
on the target or receiver’s motivation and ability to process information. Note, 
however, that not all models of persuasion are dual process models. In particular, 
one recent model called the unimodel offers an alternative to the dual process 
models, asserting that the two processes proposed by the dual process models are 
functionally equivalent in the persuasion process (e.g., Kruglanski, Chen, Pierro et 
al., 2006; Kruglanski and Thompson, 1999). Although this model provides a 
competing perspective on persuasion, the dual process models still tend to domi-
nate scientific thought. 
The elaboration likelihood model (ELM)
The elaboration likelihood model (ELM) of persuasion asserts that variations in 
the nature of persuasion outcomes are dependent on the likelihood that recipients 
will engage in elaboration of (or thinking about) the arguments relevant to the 
issue. This model argues that people focus on different features of a persuasive 
message depending on the level of cognitive effort they give to the information 
relevant to the persuasive subject (Petty and Cacioppo, 1986b). Specifically, when 
people think carefully about a persuasive message and pay special attention to the 
argument quality, they are attending to the central cues of the message. Central cues 
are features of the message such as scientific arguments, consumer reports and 
expert arguments. For example, imagine you are booking a holiday abroad and you 
want to ensure you find a good hotel. You may consult a website such as Tripad-
visor.com to browse numerous reviews of various hotels, comments from travel 
organizations and independent travellers’ comments to make the most informed 
choice about where to stay. You think about the reviews in some depth, compare 
them to other reviews and keep a note of the pros and cons of your potential 
choices. You make your choice after careful consideration of the information you 
have. Central cues take a significant effort to process, so whether this route is 
successful depends on people’s ability and motivation to process the cues (see 
Figure 6.9). When people are persuaded by such cues, they are said to be influenced 
via the central route to persuasion. The central route represents the persuasion process 
that occurs when elaboration of the persuasive message is high. Some research

model that advocates for 
two processes leading to a 
psychological outcome. For 
example, the elaboration

assert that there are two

suggests that a specific site in the brain is activated during the elaboration of expert 
arguments (Klucharev, Smidts and Fernández, 2008). Specifically, fMRI studies 
demonstrate that the caudate nucleus is activated, which is an area of the brain 
involved in trustful behaviour, reward processing and learning. More generally, 
‘feeling persuaded’ has been associated with increased activity in specific regions of 
the temporal lobe and prefrontal cortex (Falk, Rameson, Berkman et al., 2010). 
On the other hand, when people attend to the more superficial characteristics 
of a message instead of the argument quality, they are attending to the peripheral 
cues of the message. Consider the same example of booking a holiday. Here, being 
persuaded by peripheral cues means that you would be paying more attention to 
photographs of happy vacationers frolicking in the pool or images of relaxed 
people drinking cocktails in beachside bars rather than detailed written accounts 
of the quality of the breakfast buffet or the airport parking facilities. The slick 
graphical design on holiday websites is also likely to grab your attention. These 
cues do not take a great deal of cognitive effort (or motivation) to process, so they 
can be successful under the right conditions. Being persuaded by these types of 
cues involves the peripheral route to persuasion. The peripheral route represents the 
persuasion process that occurs when elaboration of the persuasive message is 
relatively low. 
It is possible to see the difference between these approaches to persuasion in 
advertisements for a similar product. For example, some car advertisements 
feature arguments about the car’s performance, speed and other specifications that 
give the potential buyer a good overview of the product they are going to get. 
Other car advertisements display attractive models draped over cars with breath-
taking scenery in the background, or other more sophisticated imagery. Computer 
companies often opt for slick advertisements with lots of pictures of the product, 
while others focus more on the technical specifications. Clearly, both routes to 
persuasion are effective and this is why advertisers choose to adopt them in 
different forms and for different audiences (Figure 6.10).

The heuristic-systematic model (HSM)
The heuristic-systematic model (HSM), while also arguing for two distinct proc-
esses to persuasion, puts things slightly differently. Instead of using the terms 
‘central’ and peripheral’, the HSM uses the terms ‘heuristic’ and ‘systematic’ to 
describe conceptually similar processes. According to this model, systematic 
processing occurs when targets actively scan and process the arguments put forward 
in a message. Heuristic processing occurs when people do not carefully consider the 
arguments. Instead, they resort to cognitive ‘shortcuts’ or heuristics to process the

FigurE 6.10 The elaboration

to this model, persuasion 
can occur through either of 
two routes. the central route 
involves the persuasive target 
considering the quality of 
the argument. the peripheral 
route involves reliance on 
superficial cues. the route 
to persuasion depends 
on the target’s ability and 
motivation to process the 
persuasive message. 

279
Persuasion
message. One reason to process a message through the heuristic rather than system-
atic route is because the task of processing a lot of information is just too difficult 
(Chaiken, 1987). Heuristics make the task simpler. For example, instead of listening 
carefully to a person make a detailed argument about the nuances and effects of 
gender differences and judging the argument’s reliability, it is easier to resort to the 
truism that men and women are simply different and that gender differences are 
here to stay. That is, the reliability of the message is judged by applying a simple 
rule, or heuristic instead of attending carefully to the message itself. 
So, while the ELM and HSM are slightly different in the way they see the two 
processes occurring during persuasion, they both argue for two distinct routes to 
persuasion – one involving more complex processing or elaboration of a message 
and the other involving a more instinctive, simplistic processing. People use the 
central/systematic route to persuasion when they attend thoughtfully to a 
message, but use the peripheral/heuristic route when they do not attend thought-
fully to a message or use simple cognitive shortcuts to deal with the message. We 
mentioned the ‘unimodel of persuasion’ earlier, which offers an alternative to the 
dual process models, asserting that the two processes proposed by the dual process 
models are functionally equivalent in the persuasion process (e.g., Kruglanski et 
al., 2006; Kruglanski and Thompson, 1999). It is proposed that in each route, 
receivers of messages try to reach conclusions about what views to hold, using any 
information available to them. Although the dual process models argue that 
different kinds of evidence are used in the two routes (peripheral cues and central 
cues), the unimodel asserts that there is just one process of reasoning involved. 
The processes may appear to be distinct because studies on the ELM and HSM 
have typically involved simple peripheral cues versus complex arguments, and are 
not therefore equalized with respect to complexity. Kruglanski and Thompson 
argue that if these cues are equalized, they will be seen to be processed in similar 
ways and there is no need to study persuasion as two separate processes. You are 
probably thinking this all sounds a bit complicated and, indeed, research is yet to 
clearly tease apart these different explanations. Thus, we maintain our focus on 
the ELM and HSM and will now consider how each of the proposed routes to 
persuasion (central/systematic and peripheral/heuristic) work and the factors that 
influence which route of persuasion people use. 
Exploring further Spend some time on Google Scholar and find some research that relates to kruglanski’s 
unimodel of persuasion. What insights does it offer that are different from the dual process models?
Factors determining the processing route
The first key factor that determines the route to persuasion is the persuasive 
target’s ability to focus. When a person is distracted, preoccupied, interrupted or 
under time pressure, it is difficult for them to concentrate on the central cues of 
persuasion because they require a significantly greater amount of processing than 
peripheral cues. As such, when people lack the ability to focus, they are more

likely to attend to peripheral cues (Petty, Wells and Brock, 1976). Petty et al. 
(1976) empirically examined how the ability to focus can influence how people 
process a persuasive message. They exposed students to either a weak or a strong 
argument in favour of an increase in student fees. The strong message argued that 
an increase in fees would improve teaching by allowing the institution to hire 
better teachers; it would also make class sizes smaller. On the other hand, the weak 
message talked about the more aesthetic benefits of increased fees, such as being 
able to employ more gardening staff and making the campus more attractive. In 
addition to this manipulation, some students listened to the messages without any 
distractions, while others listened to the messages alongside performing a 
distracting task. Participants were then asked to rate their overall agreement with 
the increases in student fees. Results showed that the undistracted participants 
were more persuaded to agree with an increase in student fees after having listened 
to the strong arguments rather than those who had listened to the weak argu-
ments. However, the distracted participants agreed approximately equally in the 
weak and strong message groups (see Figure 6.11). Petty et al. argued that the 
distraction manipulation works to inhibit the dominant cognitive response to a 
message. If a dominant response is to develop counterarguments (a negative 
response), distraction will enhance persuasiveness because the target will not be 
able to generate counterarguments. However, if the dominant response is to 
develop pro-arguments (a positive response), distraction will reduce its persuasive 
impact because people will not have the 
resources to develop pro-arguments. So, 
both favourable and unfavourable responses 
to a persuasive attempt can be disrupted by 
an inability to focus. 
Factors other than distraction can influ-
ence people’s ability to process a message. 
For example, Petty et al. (1976) found that 
in a standing position, people were less 
persuaded by an argument in favour of 
increasing student fees than they were when they were lying down. They argued 
that a standing position enables resistance to persuasion by facilitating the genera-
tion of negative responses, while lying down promotes susceptibility to persua-
sion because it inhibits negative responses. Further, Cacioppo, Sandman and 
Walker (1978) found that participants who were conditioned to increase their 
heart rates were more resistant to persuasion. Arguably, increased heart rate facili-
tates message processing and enables targets to process and reject the message.
The second key determinant of the successful route to persuasion is whether 
the persuasive target has the motivation to process. Sometimes, people are just not 
involved in the message or are simply not interested in the issues relevant to the 
persuasion attempt. Without this motivation to process, findings show that people 
are more likely to rely on peripheral cues to persuasion such as a message’s length 
or speed (Maheswaran and Chaiken, 1991; Smith and Shaffer, 1991). In general, as

Persuasion
a person’s level of involvement in the topic increases, the motivation to engage in 
central/systematic processing increases. The motivation to process a message can 
also be influenced by the recipients’ level of need for cognition (NFC), which we 
briefly discussed earlier. NFC is an individual differences characteristic that 
reflects people’s tendency to engage in and enjoy effortful thought (Briñol and 
Petty, 2005). People who display higher levels of NFC generally have a higher 
elaboration motivation and will therefore be more influenced through the central/
systematic route to persuasion (Cacioppo and Petty, 1982; Cacioppo, Petty, Fein-
stein and Jarvis, 1996; Haddock, Maio, Arnold and Huskinson, 2008; Petty and 
Cacioppo, 1986b).
Try it yourself Like need for cognitive closure, a person’s level of NFC is strongly associated with their 
susceptibility to persuasion. In your own time, complete the NFC scale (by rating your agreement with each 
statement) and see how you score. Do you see yourself as someone who is easily persuaded? What types of cues do 
you think you are most sensitive to? the items with an asterisk will need to be reverse scored (see Chapter 2 for how 
to do this). once you have done this, tally up your score and you have your overall NFC score. the maximum score is 
+72 and the lowest score is –72.

Relating
Other factors also determine how people deal with persuasive messages. For 
example, our mood at the time of a persuasive attempt can influence how the 
message is processed (see Mackie and Worth, 1989; Wegner, Petty and Smith, 
1995). Sometimes, being in a sad mood can encourage a more peripheral/heuristic 
processing depending on the ambiguity of the information (Bohner, Chaiken and 
Hunyadi, 1994). Being in a good mood (e.g., by listening to nice music) can also 
enhance elaboration (Bruner, 1990; Gorn, 1982). The perceived credibility of the 
source is also an important factor, as is the perceived importance of the issue rele-
vant to the persuasion attempt (Chaiken and Maheswaran, 1994). 
It is also important to note that while both routes of persuasion are effective, 
they affect people in different ways in different situations. This may sound rather 
vague, but as you now know, persuasion is a complex phenomenon so it is not 
always easy to give straight answers. For example, a message concerning an issue 
that is important to an individual will be effective in persuading them so long as 
they have the time and resources to pay attention. It is also the case that the same 
cue can be processed in different ways depending on motivation and ability. For 
example, glossy hair on a shampoo advertisement, while typically being processed 
as a peripheral cue to attractiveness, can also be processed centrally because it 
contains information about how effective the shampoo is (so long as we are 
prepared to assume that the model has actually used it). More generally, persua-
sion via the peripheral/heuristic route is typically not as effective as the central/
systematic route in changing attitudes and behaviours in the long term. Peripheral 
route persuasion often results in superficial or temporary attitude change, while 
central route persuasion leads to longer lasting attitudinal and behavioural change 
(Chaiken, 1980; Mackie, 1987; Petty, Haugtvedt and Smith, 1995). 
Time to reflect Imagine you are an advertising executive and are involved in designing advertisements for 
perfume, cars, ‘alcopops’ and energy drinks. What would your advertisements look like for each of the different 
products and why? How do the features of your advertisements map onto the routes of persuasion identified by 
social psychologists? 
What can people do to persuade others?
There are several tactics that people can use to be more effective persuaders. For 
example, they can ingratiate themselves to their target, make small requests before 
plunging in with a more substantial request, make a large and unrealistic request 
before making the intended smaller request, or ‘lowball’ targets with hidden costs 
to a persuasive request. All are effective in eliciting persuasion. We will discuss 
these interpersonal persuasive tactics briefly in turn.
Ingratiation and reciprocity 
One way to persuade people to agree with you or do what you want them to do is 
to first make them like you. A person may ingratiate themselves to their persuasive 
target by agreeing with them, flattering them or simply being nice to them before 
ingratiation A persuasive

283
Persuasion
making the persuasive attempt (Smith, Pruitt and Carnevale, 1982). This can be 
effective, but it may also backfire if the ingratiation is too obvious. Too much flat-
tery, for example, can make people suspicious that the flatterer has ulterior 
motives. If indeed the flatterer intends to influence the target, then the target has 
good reason to be suspicious (Gordon, 1996). A similar technique is to use the 
reciprocity principle to one’s advantage and rely on the accepted convention that 
people will treat others as they are treated themselves (Gouldner, 1960). In other 
words, if someone receives a favour from another person, they are likely to return 
that favour. This is a useful technique in persuasion because doing something nice 
for another person creates good relations and activates the reciprocity principle. 
People feel obliged to do something nice for the other person. The persuasive 
target is receptive to the idea of returning the favour and is therefore more likely 
to be persuaded when a request is made. Indeed, Regan (1971) showed that people 
were more likely to be persuaded if they had received a favour beforehand than if 
they had been given no favour (see also Whatley, Webster, Smith and Rhodes, 
1999). Of course, failure to return a favour can result in heavy social penalties. For 
example, a person who does not abide by the reciprocity principle is likely to be 
deemed a ‘freeloader’ or a ‘sponger’ for taking a social favour but not paying it 
back (Cotterell, Eisenberger and Speicher, 1992). People generally want to avoid 
these sorts of labels and are also likely to feel guilty if they do not return a favour, 
so the norm of reciprocity is a powerful tool of persuasion (Carlsmith and Gross, 
1969). We discuss the reciprocity principle further in Chapter 7 when we cover the 
topic of close relationships.
Door-in-the-face technique 
The door-in-the-face technique is closely related to the reciprocity principle and 
involves the persuader making a large, unrealistic request, which is almost certainly 
refused, and then making a smaller, more realistic request (Cialdini, 1984). This 
technique works because the persuader makes a concession by accepting the target’s 
refusal of the first request. The target then feels obliged to also make a concession 
and is therefore more likely to be persuaded by the smaller, more realistic influence 
attempt. For example, imagine a charity worker asks you to give a £50 donation to 
an appeal. You initially say ‘no’, feeling that this is a lot of money to part with out 
of the blue, but then concede to buying £5 worth of raffle tickets for the same 
appeal. This is known as the door-in-the-face technique because the persuasive 
target first slams the door in the face of the persuader but then opens it a tiny bit to 
concede to a smaller request (Reeves, Baker, Boyd and Cialdini, 1991).
Cialdini, Vincent, Lewis et al. (1975) demonstrated the strength of this tech-
nique in a study where university students were asked if they would like to chap-
erone a group of juvenile delinquents on a trip to the zoo. Unsurprisingly, 83 per 
cent of the students said ‘no’ to this request. However, for students who had first 
been asked if they would like to participate in an intensive counselling programme 
for juvenile delinquents lasting two years, 50 per cent agreed to chaperoning the 
juveniles on the zoo trip. The door-in-the-face phenomenon can therefore be a

powerful technique of persuasion. Cialdini et al. (1975) also argued that this tech-
nique capitalizes on a contrast effect. The small request seems reasonable in 
contrast to the larger intrusive request, so it is seen as much more acceptable. You 
will notice this technique used extensively in sales contexts. For example, a sales-
person may show a prospective TV purchaser a very expensive, top-of-the-range 
TV before showing them cheaper (but still expensive) models. The customer is 
likely to see the latter options as more reasonable than they normally would, 
because they appear to be a nice contrast to the wallet-busting options first 
presented. Note, however, that this technique only occurs if the second request is 
made by the same person as the original request. If two requests are made by two 
different people, the door-in-the-face technique will not work. 
That’s-not-all technique 
The that’s-not-all technique also capitalizes on the reciprocity principle and involves 
the persuader giving the person something that will further convince them to 
comply with the request. The technique involves offering a person a product at a 
high price, not allowing them to respond for a short while, and then offering them 
a better deal by offering another product or lowering the price. Using the example 
above, the TV salesperson might show the customer an expensive TV the customer 
is likely to refuse. However, if the salesperson later shows the customer a cheaper 
TV, or mentions that the TV also comes with a free satellite set-up and a Blu-ray 
DVD player, then the new TV probably seems better value, and perhaps the 
customer is also more likely to feel that they owe the salesperson something for 
‘throwing in’ some extras. When this that’s-not-all technique is used, people are 
more likely to be persuaded by the influence attempt (Burger, 1986). 
Burger (1986) demonstrated that this procedure induces greater compliance 
than in a control condition where participants were given the better deal in the 
first place. However, research demonstrates that this effect is dependent on the 
size of the initial request. For example, Burger, Reed, DeCesare et al. (1999) found 
that, compared to a control group who received only the final request, participants 
who were presented with an initial request that was significantly larger than the 
final request were less likely to comply, whereas those who were presented with 
only a marginally smaller initial request were more likely to comply. Further, 
Pollock, Smith, Knowles and Bruce (1998) demonstrated that this technique only 
occurs when people consider an offer instinctively. 
Foot-in-the-door technique 
The foot-in-the-door technique involves persuaders first making a small and rela-
tively unobtrusive request before making the intended (larger) request. The 
persuader gets their foot in the door with a reasonable appeal, making it more 
likely that they will succeed with the request they are most interested in. Freedman 
and Fraser (1966) demonstrated this effect by asking members of a community to 
display large ugly sandwich boards in their front gardens depicting the message 
‘Drive carefully’. Only 17 per cent of the targets agreed to do this, but for partici-

pants who had agreed to display a small ‘Be a safe driver’ sign in their windows 
two weeks earlier, 76 per cent agreed to the more obtrusive request. Again, we see 
a powerful tool of persuasion. Indeed, one review suggests that this technique can 
even persuade people to eventually comply with large requests such as becoming 
organ donors (Saks, 1978). 
However, this technique does not always work. In particular, if the first 
request is too small and the second request is too large, the foot-in-the-door 
technique will not be effective because the link between the two requests is 
broken (Foss and Dempsey, 1979). One way around this is for the persuader to 
‘build up’ to the larger request by beginning with a small request, making another 
(slightly larger) request and so on, until the large and intended request is made 
(Goldman, Creason and McCall, 1981). A good example of this is how many 
charities work. They may begin by asking for a signature on a petition, follow 
that up with a request for a small donation, then finish with the intended request 
of a monthly direct debit donation. The charity giver is likely to agree to this 
graded persuasive attempt. 
Lowball tactic 
Using the lowball tactic, the persuader changes the terms of the agreement during 
the interaction by introducing hidden costs. For example, imagine you are shop-
ping for a holiday at your local travel agency and you find the perfect getaway for 
what looks like a reasonable price. You are about to make the purchase but at the 
last minute the salesperson lets you know about a special ‘sun tax’ that will add 
£100 to the cost of your holiday. In this example, you have been lowballed. In 
other words, you were told about a hidden cost after you had committed to the 
holiday. What do you do? Research suggests that you would still go ahead and 
purchase the holiday. Specifically, once people are committed to an action, they 
are more likely to stick to their decision, accept the sunk cost and go ahead. 
The power of this technique was demonstrated in a study by Cialdini, 
Cacioppo, Bassett and Miller (1978). In this experiment, half the participants were 
asked to participate in an experiment. If they agreed (56 per cent), they were told 
it began at 7am; 95 per cent turned up. The same request was made of a control 
group, although these participants were immediately told about the 7am start; 
only 24 per cent agreed to participate.

When persuasion does not work
Even when the most powerful persuasive techniques are used, you can probably 
think of many occasions when persuasive attempts do not succeed. For example,

most advertisements you see will not make you go out and buy a product, nor will 
the majority of political messages influence how you vote. In general, people are 
highly resistant to persuasion (Figure 6.12). If they were not, their attitudes (and 
behaviours) would be constantly changing, so it is just as well that people are able 
to resist most persuasion attempts. The next question to consider, therefore, is 
why are people so resistant to persuasion? Here, we will discuss a number of 
factors that enhance people’s ability to stand firm in the face of even the most 
expert and accomplished efforts at persuasion. 
Time to reflect Charities often employ fundraisers to approach people on the street and persuade them to sign up 
to monthly payments to the charity. these fundraisers have been nicknamed ‘chuggers’, or charity muggers, for their 
often insistent approach. Have you ever been stopped by a ‘chugger’ asking for a donation? What persuasive 
techniques did they use? Were you persuaded? How did it make you feel?
Reactance
When people are confronted with a persistent influence attempt, they often 
become annoyed and resentful of the effort to change their attitudes. For instance, 
when a persuader really puts on the pressure, for example a ‘hard sell’ salesperson, 
the target of the influence may become increasingly irritated and resentful. The 
net result – the target reacts against the message and ultimately adopts the 
completely opposite attitude to that of the intended persuasion attempt. This is 
the process of reactance. People can react strongly like this against blatant or 
persistent influence attempts because such attempts are direct threats to personal 
freedom. For example, the ‘hard sell’ salesperson is pushing a person to buy a 
product. Nobody likes to be forced to do something, or to have their personal 
freedom compromised, so the natural reaction is to defy the persuader and go 
one’s own way. Also, nobody likes to have their self-image of an independent 
person challenged, so blatant persuasive attempts are often doomed to failure. 
Research has widely documented this phenomenon (e.g., Brehm, 1966; Rhodewalt 
and Davison, 1983; Rhodewalt and Strube, 1985), which is sometimes also called 
negative attitude change. In this sense, the persuasive attempt can really backfire on 
the persuader, who find themselves confronting someone with a stronger attitude 
or a more defiant resistance to persuasion than before the influence attempt began 
(Tormala and Petty, 2002, 2004). Indeed, threats to personal freedom will often 
create a defiant response, sometimes known as a boomerang effect (Brehm and 
Brehm, 1981). 
Time to reflect Henriksen, Dauphinee, Wang and Fortmann (2006) investigated the effectiveness of tobacco 
industry-sponsored anti-smoking advertisements (versus independent advertisements) on teenagers’ intentions to 
smoke. they found no difference across the two types of advertisements in intentions to smoke, but found that the 
teenagers who had viewed the tobacco industry-sponsored advertisements had more favourable attitudes to the 
tobacco industry. Why do you think this might have occurred? What do you think some of the potential consequences 
might be? Could tobacco industry-sponsored anti-smoking advertisements perhaps do more harm than good?

Persuasion
Prior knowledge/forewarning
When we are aware of a persuasion attempt, are we more able to resist it? For 
example, when we watch a political speech, we know that the politician would like 
to have our vote, but does awareness of this fact mean that they will be less 
successful? When a salesperson walks up to us and hands us a brochure, are we 
less likely to be persuaded to purchase their product? Some research suggests that 
the answer is ‘yes’. Specifically, if people are forewarned about a persuasive 
attempt, they are less likely to be persuaded by the attempt than if they have no 
prior knowledge of the attempt (Cialdini and Petty, 1979; Johnson, 1994). Why is 
this the case? People are more resistant to persuasion after forewarning because the 
advance knowledge of a persuasion attempt activates several cognitive processes 
that are important for persuasion.
For example, advance knowledge gives people the opportunity to develop 
counterarguments that render the attempt less successful. Also, people have more 
time to seek alternative facts and information that are counter to the persuasive 
message. The importance of the original attitude is also important (Krosnick, 
1989; Petty and Cacioppo, 1979). That is, the benefits of forewarning are stronger 
when people consider the associated attitudes to be important than if the attitudes 
are seen as trivial. If a person has strong feelings about a topic, then being fore-
warned of an attempt to change their minds will arm them with the accessibility of 
their own attitudes to counteract the persuasion attempt. 
Counterarguing
People can actively resist persuasion attempts by addressing and arguing against 
attitude-incongruent arguments directly. By being proactive and counterarguing 
against the persuasive attempt, people are able to defuse persuasion attempts and, 
again, this renders such attempts less effective (e.g., Eagly, Chen, Chaiken and 
Shaw-Barnes, 1999). 
In one study, Eagly, Kulesa, Brannon et al. (2000) asked students to listen to 
either ‘pro-life’ (anti-abortion) or ‘pro-choice’ (in favour of women’s choice to 
have an abortion) messages delivered by a female commu-
nicator. The messages were consistent or inconsistent 
with the participants’ prior attitudes (‘pro-life’ or ‘pro-
choice’). After listening to the message, participants were 
asked to list their thoughts throughout the experiment. 
Results revealed that participants had more opposing 
thoughts towards counterattitudinal messages and more 
supportive thoughts during the attitude-consistent 
messages. So, participants generated counterarguments 
against the messages that were inconsistent with their 
attitudes, but supportive arguments for the message that 
was consistent with their existing attitudes (see Figure 
6.13). Therefore, one way that people resist counterattitu-

dinal messages is to actively process the arguments and argue against them. In 
doing so, they provide strong ‘self-defence’ against persuasion attempts. 
Attitude inoculation
In another important line of research, McGuire (1961, 1964) showed that it was 
possible to inoculate people against influence attempts by presenting them with 
weak counterattitudinal arguments before presenting them with a stronger influ-
ence attempt (e.g., a counterattitudinal message). In the same way that immuniza-
tions are designed to fight diseases, weaker arguments ‘inoculate’ people against 
stronger influence attempts. The individual is able to mount a defence and there-
fore becomes less susceptible to the persuasive attempt. McGuire demonstrated 
the effectiveness of attitude inoculation by presenting people with some cultural 
truisms (e.g., it is a good idea to brush one’s teeth after every meal) and presenting 
a counterattitudinal message (e.g., experts say that too much brushing can damage 
one’s gums). If no inoculation occurred, participants were persuaded by the 
attitude-incongruent message, but if participants had been first presented with a 
weak attack on their attitudes, they were much less persuaded. Also, if they were 
asked to write an essay refuting the mild attack, they were less susceptible to the 
stronger persuasive attempt. 
McGuire and Papageorgis (1961) argued that this works because presenting 
targets with weak arguments helps them to generate counterarguments of their 
own, which in turn makes their attitudes more resistant to change. Another 
example was demonstrated by Bernard, Maio and Olson (2003), who found that 
people who were first asked to write and then refute reasons for opposing equal 
opportunities were more resistant to anti-equality messages at a later time. Of 
course, this is not perfect and attitude inoculation will not always work. One 
example of where the effect falls away is when people think that their resistance to 
persuasion has been weak. On such occasions, people can become more suscep-
tible to follow-up influence attempts (Tormala, Clarkson and Petty, 2006). 
Avoidance
Another way to resist persuasion is simply to ignore or filter out information that 
is inconsistent with pre-existing attitudes, or information that you simply do not 
wish to engage with. By engaging in a process called selective avoidance, people 
direct their attention away from information that is inconsistent with their atti-
tudes. For example, instead of exposing oneself to endless advertisements in 
between one’s favourite TV programme, a person has the option of filtering out 
the unwanted advertisements and public messages by checking out what is on the 
other TV channels or by recording the programme and flicking through the 
advertisements. Likewise, people can attend to parts of speeches that support their 
attitudes and ignore the sections they do not wish to hear. This points to another 
interesting phenomenon – people are more likely to attend to messages that are 
consistent with their attitudes (Martin, Hewstone and Martin, 2003; Petty and 
Cacioppo, 1979). That is, while people are more likely to ignore or avoid counter-

attitudinal messages, they give pro-attitudinal messages more attention and 
thought. These two processes, in team with one another, help ensure the stability 
and strength of pre-existing attitudes. 
Other means of resistance to persuasion
Other factors influence people’s resistance to persuasion. Briefly, attitude polariza-
tion is the tendency for people to evaluate mixed information or messages in a way 
that strengthens their original attitudes and makes them become more extreme 
(Pomerantz et al., 1995). Also, the process of biased assimilation is people’s 
tendency to evaluate attitude-inconsistent information as unreliable and less 
convincing than attitude-consistent information (Lord et al., 1979). Like other 
means of resisting persuasion, attitude polarization and biased assimilation protect 
people’s original attitudes from new information designed to change those atti-
tudes. Further, people can protect their attitudes by questioning the source of the 
persuasive message if the attitude it presents is different from their own. For 
example, one common finding is that people accuse the media of being biased and 
therefore untrustworthy, particularly if they present a view contrary to their own. 
This hostile media bias increases resistance to persuasion and can mean that people 
reject even the strongest arguments (Duck, Terry and Hogg, 1998; Vallone, Ross 
and Lepper, 1985).

How do people understand persuasion?
Social psychologists know a lot about how people can be 
persuaded, the models that explain persuasion and the 
features of individuals that lead them to be more 
persuaded. However, for all psychologists know about 
persuasion, they know less about the sense that people 
make of this important social phenomenon. What motives, 
thought processes and intuitive concepts affect observers’ 
judgements of messages’ persuasive power and, 
conversely, of people’s susceptibility to persuasion? In 
other words, what commonsense representations do 
people have about persuasion? Do they have any conscious 
knowledge of the tools they use to persuade people and 
how they themselves are persuaded? this is an intriguing 
gap in the literature on persuasion and attitude change.
A good starting point to address this issue is research 
on the third-person effect (TPE), which is the tendency 
for people to assume that persuasive attempts have more 
influence on others than they do on the self (Davison, 
1983). People have a basic assumption that persuasion is 
experienced differently by themselves and others (see 
also Chapter 3). this applies in many different media 
domains such as politics and the news, political speeches 
and advertising (e.g., Cavazza and Mucchi-Faina, 2008; 
Douglas and Sutton, 2004; Duck, terry and Hogg, 1995; 
Gibbon and Durkin, 1995; Gunther, 1995; Hoorens and 
Ruiter, 1996; Perloff, 1989; Reid, Byrne, Brundidge et al., 
2007; tal-or, 2007). the tPe is said to reflect a self-serving 
bias; that is, people see themselves as less susceptible to 
persuasion than others because being ‘gullible’ is viewed 
as an undesirable trait. In a sense, people like comparing 

290
Relating
themselves downwards with people who are less 
fortunate or able than themselves. Supporting this 
account, the tPe tends to be stronger among individuals 
high in self-esteem (e.g., Perloff, 1989) and internal locus 
of control (e.g., Haridakis and Rubin, 2005). 
However, in addition to arising from these self-serving 
processes, the tPe may also result from people’s intuitive 
psychological understandings of persuasive processes. 
these intuitive theories of persuasion have not been 
examined before despite their potential impact on 
persuasion judgements and behaviours. At a general level, 
it is in the nature of human beings to engage in 
psychological theorizing. People constantly wonder about 
psychological states and traits, and invoke these 
psychological constructs in explanations of their own and 
others’ behaviour (Heider, 1958a; Malle, 2004). In doing 
so, they make use of culturally shared assumptions and 
intuitive theories about human psychology (Fletcher, 
1995; Levy, Chiu and Hong, 2006; Wegener and Petty, 
1998). It is reasonable to hypothesize that people do the 
same to understand how persuasion works.
In some of our own research, we have addressed this 
issue, to try to gain more knowledge of how people 
understand persuasion. Specifically, if we want to know 
how people understand persuasion, we need to begin by 
focusing on what we, as social scientists, already know 
about persuasive processes. So, we focused on the 
elaboration likelihood model discussed earlier in this 
chapter. Based on research testing the principles of the 
eLM, we know that factors such as need for cognition 
(NFC) determine the extent to which people are 
influenced by different types of persuasive media (e.g., 
Cacioppo et al., 1996; Haddock et al., 2008). In particular, 
people who are high in NFC tend to be persuaded by 
central cues such as scientific evidence and strong 
arguments, whereas those who are low in NFC often 
appear to be more susceptible to peripheral cues – 
features of a message that do not typically provide logical 
or empirical grounds to accept the central argument of a 
message (Petty and Wegener, 1999). We investigated 
whether people’s intuitive understanding of persuasion 
resembles the eLM in one key respect. Specifically, we 
investigated whether perceived NFC is negatively related 
to perceived susceptibility to persuasive advertisements 
that contain peripheral cues. 
In the study (Douglas, Sutton and Stathi, 2010), we 
asked undergraduate participants how much each of 
several advertisements would affect themselves or other 
undergraduate students. these advertisements employed 
peripheral cues rather than direct arguments in favour of 
the advertised products. We used a between-groups 
design to determine whether the predicted tPe (lower 
perceived influence on the self than others) is influenced 
by perceived NFC. Specifically, we predicted that 
individuals would tend to rate themselves as higher than 
other undergraduates in NFC and that this difference 
would be able to account for the tPe. Results supported 
this hypothesis, demonstrating that people’s intuitive 
understanding of persuasion resembles an established 
theoretical model of persuasion (the eLM) in a key 
respect. Specifically, perceived NFC is related to perceived 
resistance to persuasion by advertisements that rely on 
typically peripheral cues. this gives psychological and 
evaluative meaning to resistance and susceptibility to 
persuasion, helping explain why individuals are 
motivated to see themselves as less influenced than 
others. of course, people may not necessarily be able to 
articulate their understanding of this link between NFC 
and persuasion. For example, it is unlikely that people 
would be able to invoke NFC as a construct in everyday 
life because it is probably not readily accessible, unlike 
features such as intelligence and critical thinking. this 
research provides the first evidence that people do 
indeed use their intuitive understanding of persuasion 
and the personal characteristics associated with 
persuasion to judge the extent to which persuasive 
attempts will be successful. 
Questions
1 In this study, Douglas et al. (2010) only tested people’s 
responses to glossy advertisements. What do you think 
might have happened if they had focused on 
advertisements containing strong arguments?
2 How do you think other models of persuasion (e.g., the 
HSM and unimodel) would account for these findings?
3 What might be some of the implications of these 
findings? For example, do you think that people could 
use their understanding of persuasion in their own 
attempts to achieve social influence?
intuitive theories theories people have about human thought and behaviour that arrive from ‘intuition’. these are also called 
‘lay theories’ because they relate to how everyday people think about thought and behaviour.

Persuasion
ETHiCS AND rESEArCH METHODS
Subliminal messages
People are consciously aware of most messages that are 
designed to influence their attitudes and behaviours. 
However, using subliminal stimuli, advertisers sometimes 
attempt to influence people through an unconscious 
route. Subliminal (‘below threshold’), unlike supraliminal 
(‘above threshold’), stimuli are any type of sensory 
stimulation that occurs below an individual’s absolute 
threshold for conscious perception. the idea of subliminal 
messages has caused some controversy over the years. For 
example, in 1985, two young men attempted suicide (one 
succeeded) and their families argued that it was because 
of the subliminal message ‘do it’ in the song ‘Better by 
you, better than me’ by British band Judas Priest. the 
families sought damages in the region of US$6 million and 
although the case was dropped, the judge ruled that the 
events would not have taken place if it were not for the 
‘power of suggestion’. A more recent example occurred in 
a US political tv advertisement run by the Republicans 
during the 2000 election, where the word ‘RAtS’ was 
quickly flashed on screen during the advertisement. this 
was a subliminal message aimed to induce negative 
feelings about the Democratic Party and its policies. 
Subliminal messages such as these have been used in 
advertising for many years. 
 the results of some laboratory studies suggest that 
they work. For example, krosnick, Betz, Jussim and Lynn 
(1992) showed participants pictures of people 
performing everyday tasks. Before looking at the 
pictures, the participants had been subliminally 
presented with pleasant (e.g., kittens) or unpleasant 
images (e.g., dead bodies). krosnick et al. found that 
when paired with pleasant subliminal images, 
participants rated the target people more favourably than 
those for whom the pictures were paired with unpleasant 
images (see also Dijksterhuis, Aarts and Smith, 2005; 
karremans, Stroebe and Claus, 2006; Strahan, Spencer 
and Zanna, 2002). However, outside the laboratory, there 
is little evidence that subliminal messages work. 
Specifically, there is no evidence that subliminal 
messages will induce people to go out and buy things 
they do not want to buy, or do things they do not want to 
do (DeFleur and Petranoff, 1959; Pratkanis, eskenazi and 
Greenwald, 1994; trappey, 1996). 
So, is all the fuss over nothing? Perhaps, but whether 
subliminal messages are effective, marginally effective or 
not effective at all, they still present an ethical issue. Using 
such messages, advertisers are exposing people to 
material they are not consciously aware of. People are 
therefore being deceived about the intent of the 
advertisement. For this reason, subliminal messages are 
illegal in the Uk and Australia. 
Questions
1 Can you think of other ethical question marks over the 
issue of subliminal messages?
2 What factors would make a subliminal message more 
or less effective?
3 Can you see good reasons to use subliminal messages?
Exploring further take some time to research the history of subliminal advertising. Why do you think its use is 
so controversial?

In this chapter, we have focused on the topic of persuasion. We 
have outlined some of the factors that determine when 
persuasion will be effective, discussed the key models that 
explain persuasion, outlined some of the techniques that 
people can use to be persuasive, and finally, discussed how 
people are able to resist persuasion. Specifically, you will now 
know that:
• Persuasion is the process by which a message changes a 
person’s attitudes or behaviours.
• Persuasion is a function of three features: the source, 
message and target.
• If a message source is seen as attractive, it will be more 
persuasive. Another persuasive feature is the extent to 
which the source is seen as similar to the self. Findings show 
that people are also more persuaded by others whom they 
perceive to be trustworthy.
• In terms of the message, longer messages are not always 
best and there is a complex interplay between the length 
and strength of a message. the consistency between a 
persuasive message and the target’s original attitude is also 
an important factor in determining the message’s 
persuasive effectiveness. Messages can also be persuasive 
by making people feel fearful, bad, or that the item of 
interest is scarce. Sometimes, persuaders arm themselves 
with the objective facts in order to persuade others. two-
sided arguments can also be effective. Further, information 
presented first (primacy effect) or last (recency effect) can be 
the most persuasive. Finally, it is important to consider the 
channel, or mode with which the information is presented.
• In terms of the target, the effectiveness of a persuasive 
message has been found to be influenced by gender, with 
women typically found to be more susceptible to persuasion 
than men, although findings are mixed. Age is also an 
important factor, with late adolescents and young adults 
being the most susceptible to persuasion. Many other social 
contextual variables and personality variables can influence 
persuasion, including a person’s mood. 
• Several models explain the processes involved in 
persuasion. the key models are dual process models, 
asserting that the source of the message and the message 
itself play distinct roles in persuasion and that the outcome 
of a persuasive interaction also depends on the target or 
receiver’s motivation and ability to process information.
• the elaboration likelihood model (eLM) asserts that 
variations in the nature of persuasion outcomes are 
dependent on the likelihood that recipients will engage in 
elaboration of (or thinking about) the arguments relevant to 
the issue. When people think carefully and pay special 
attention to the argument quality, they are attending to the 
central cues of the message and are being influenced via the 
central route to persuasion. on the other hand, when people 
attend to the more superficial characteristics of a message 
instead of the argument quality, they are attending to the 
peripheral cues of the message and are being influenced via 
the peripheral route to persuasion. 
• the heuristic-systematic model (HSM) argues that systematic 
processing occurs when targets actively scan and process the 
arguments put forward in a message. When heuristic 
processing occurs, they resort to cognitive ‘shortcuts’ to 
process the message. 
• various factors influence the processing route to persuasion. 
First, the persuasive target’s ability to focus influences 
whether superficial or deep processing will occur. the 
second key determinant is whether the persuasive target 
has the motivation to process. this can be influenced by a 
recipient’s need for cognition (NFC) – an individual 
differences characteristic that reflects a person’s tendency to 
engage in effortful thought.
• there are several well-known techniques that people can 
adopt to persuade others. First, persuaders can be more 
effective if they make themselves likeable to the target, or 
reciprocate something for them. the door-in-the-face 
technique entails the persuader making a large and 
unreasonable request that is followed by the smaller 
(intentional) request. the that’s-not-all technique entices 
the target with extra for their effort or money. the foot-in-
the-door technique entails the persuader making a small 
request before moving in with the larger (intended) request. 
Finally, the lowball tactic involves the persuader changing 
the terms of the agreement during the interaction by 
introducing hidden costs.
• Sometimes, persuasion does not work. When the persuader 
really puts pressure on, the target can become irritated, 
resentful and can react against the persuasion attempt. 
Further, if people are warned about a persuasive attempt, 
they are less likely to succumb to it. People can also actively 
resist persuasion by addressing and arguing against 
attitude-incongruent arguments directly. the process of 
attitude inoculation demonstrates that weaker arguments 
inoculate people against later stronger influence attempts. 
Avoidance is another resistance tactic, where the target 
simply ignores or filters out information that is inconsistent 
with their pre-existing attitudes. 
this chapter has covered persuasion. In Chapter 7, we turn our 
attention to close relationships.

Persuasion
At the beginning of the chapter, we asked you to consider  
these questions:
1 Ulrich has just bought a new iPod and wants to sell his old 
one on eBay. He is wondering how best to word his 
advertisement to maximize the appeal of the used iPod. 
What suggestions might you have for Ulrich to maximize his 
chances of making a sale?
2 Imogen asks Clare for some relationship advice. She has met 
a new man and cannot decide whether or not to go out with 
him. Clare offers her advice but then Imogen asks if she will 
go on a double date. What is the likelihood that Clare will 
agree to this? Would Imogen have been better off asking 
Clare directly in the first place?
3 Fern watches at her window as a salesman walks around her 
street with a clipboard. When he comes to her house, she 
listens to what he has to say but then politely declines to 
buy the product he is selling. Why do you think Fern was so 
easily able to resist the salesperson’s persuasive attempt?
Having read this chapter, these questions could also be framed 
as the following essay questions, which you can attempt in 
preparation for your examinations:
1 What elements of persuasion does a person need to consider 
when they are trying to sell something (e.g., selling a used 
iPod on eBay)? Discuss the elements of the source, message 
and target that might end with a successful sale.
2 How can a person get another person to comply with a 
significant request? Discuss some of the persuasive tactics 
that people can use to get what they want. 
3 What are some of the factors that enable people to resist 
persuasive attempts?

Applying social psychology
Persuading people to change their ways in order 
to avert or minimize climate change
over 98 per cent of publishing climate scientists agree that 
human beings are causing the world to get warmer. to avert the 
negative consequences of increased warming in the future, 
behaviour change is required. However, a large minority of the 
public in many countries, particularly Western countries, is 
largely unconvinced that there’s a problem.
1 Use an internet search engine or an academic database to 
find out what proportion of the public of your country, and 
around the world, are doubtful that human beings are 
affecting the world’s climate. 
2 Find an article that evaluates the use of fear campaigns to 
persuade people of the climate change hypothesis and the 
need for action. Are they effective? 
3 What alternatives to fear campaigns have been used? Which 
appear to be among the most promising or successful? 
4 A common intuition among environmentalists is that people 
resist environmental messages because of defensiveness 
related to their self-esteem. they feel bad or guilty about 
the possibility that they are part of the problem, and so 
refuse to believe the messages they are getting from climate 
sciences, governments and charities. Can you find any 
experimental evidence suggesting that this intuition may be 
right? (Hint: 2010 is a good year to look in.)
5 Find two examples of climate change advertising campaigns 
(be it tv, newspaper or radio advertising, the internet, social 
networks, or posters). Compare, contrast and evaluate them 
in light of what you have learned in this chapter. How could 
they be improved?
6 In light of what you learned about the relationship between 
attitudes and behaviour in Chapter 4, do you think it is more 
productive to attempt to persuade people that the world is 
warming because of us, or to give up on getting them to 
‘believe in’ climate change, and focus instead on persuading 
them to alter their behaviour? Why?
Blind spot in social psychology 
What is the psychological profile of a persuasive 
communicator?  
In this chapter, we have reviewed a lot of research into the 
factors that make people prone to being persuaded. these 
included externally apparent aspects of a person such as their 
age and gender, but also features of their psychological 
makeup. Motives and personality characteristics such as self-
esteem, and the needs for distinctiveness, (low) cognition and 
(high) cognitive closure have all been shown to shape how 
prone to persuasion people are likely to be.  
As well as knowing who is prone to persuasion, we also 
know quite a bit about who is persuasive. As we have seen, 
research on ‘source characteristics’ has revealed that people who 
are seen by the audience to be attractive, expert, high in status 
or similar to themselves are more likely to be persuasive. the 
message is clear: if you want to persuade other people, then 
seek to develop these characteristics – or at least, seek to look 
like you’ve got them. If you want to recruit someone to persuade 
on your behalf, try to get hold of people with these attributes.
However, although we know a lot about the external 
attributes of persuasive people, very little research has 
addressed their psychological makeup. What motives and 
personality characteristics are likely to help people be 
persuaded? In general, research has focused much more on how 
persuasive messages are processed by recipients, rather than 
on how they are produced. this is an important omission, since 
‘in every day life we are all practicing persuaders, and we must 
rely on verbal communication to get our way with others’ 
(Forgas, 2007, p. 514). 
For this exercise, imagine you are a psychological researcher 
contracted by a large recruitment company to advise on the 
personality characteristics that determine who is able to 
persuade others. the ultimate aim of this company is to propose 
a set of psychometric personality tests that can be used to help 
select effective communicators. 
By all means, your own insights and intuitions may provide 
one source of inspiration for this task, but you should not try to 
rely solely on them. 
one way to think in a psychologically informed way about 
the characteristics that make an effective persuader is to review 
the literature on the features of persuasive messages. People 
are persuasive to the extent that the messages they produce are 
persuasive. So, the effects of their personality characteristics on 
their ability to persuade people must be mediated by features 
of the messages they produce. 
So, for example, what kinds of people are likely to use 
techniques such as the foot-in-the-door, or to produce 

295
Persuasion
consistent messages, or to use fear? variables such as 
Machiavellianism and dogmatism may be important. 
Another psychologically informed way to think about what 
kind of traits characterize persuasive people is to think about 
the personality variables that underpin social skills and the 
ability to influence others in general. In other chapters, you 
will find passages about variables such as self-monitoring and 
narcissism, which are relevant to skills such as being able to 
influence others and to monitor their reactions to your 
communication. 
your specific tasks are:
1 Propose at least one personality variable that may be related 
to effectiveness as a persuasive communicator. explain what 
the variable is, with references, and explain how, specifically, 
it might be related to effective persuasion (e.g., what 
features of the messages will it be associated with).
2 Propose how you might test your hypothesis. you need to 
identify an existing measure of your personality variable, 
specific features of messages that need to be coded in a 
study, and a measure of how much an audience is persuaded. 
Student project 
The extent to which people tailor persuasion 
attempts to ‘fit’ their audience 
oliver Arnold (with the 
collaboration of two fellow 
students) conducted a research 
project in his second year of 
undergraduate studies at the 
University of Heidelberg, 
supervised by Dr tobias vogel. 
His research project explored 
how sophisticated ordinary 
people are when they attempt to 
persuade each other. Specifically, it explored the extent to 
which people tailor persuasion attempts to ‘fit’ their audience, 
in line with the elaboration likelihood model, which we 
discussed in this chapter. 
My topic and aims
According to the eLM, people’s need for cognition (NFC) 
(Cacioppo and Petty, 1982) determines what kinds of messages 
they will find persuasive. For instance, Putrevu (2008) showed 
that only among low NFC participants, products advertised by 
strong sex appeal were rated more positively than products 
advertised by low sex appeal. Conversely, participants high in 
NFC did not simply ignore the sexy ‘peripheral cues’ but even 
felt disturbed and ended up evaluating products more 
negatively. Building on current research on implicit persuasion 
theories (vogel, kutzner, Fiedler and Freytag, 2010), our 
research project examined whether people who have not had 
formal training in the eLM nonetheless follow its principles 
when trying to persuade others. that is, would they use 
peripheral, sexy cues when attempting to persuade people who 
are low in NFC, but more central, informative cues when 
communicating with those who are high in NFC? 
My methods
Forty female students were asked to take the role of a marketer 
and to prepare a video clip that advertises a new yoghurt named 
‘fruit whirl’. they were informed that the product addressed a 
certain target audience, the description of which was derived 
from the NFC scale. Half the students were randomly assigned to 
a ‘high NFC audience’ condition, and were given descriptions of 
the audience that are consistent with high NFC (e.g., that 
concentrated thinking is their idea of fun). the other half were 
assigned to a ‘low NFC’ condition (in which they were told, for 
example, that concentrated thinking is not their audience’s idea 
of fun). We then provided a pretested list of slogans transporting 
either relevant facts (e.g., ‘Does not contain preservatives or 
artificial flavours’) or a sexually appealing message (e.g., ‘A 
single spoon is better than a kiss’) and our participants chose 
slogans they would convey in the clip. 
We were also interested in our participants’ nonverbal 
persuasion behaviour. thus, they were asked to choose gestures 
from a list, which were either rated as sober (e.g., ‘Pointing 
towards the product’) or flirtatious (e.g., ‘Licking lips’). Upon 
returning their questionnaires, we asked if they were willing to 
actually cast the clip. thirty-four participants agreed and were 
handed a camera, a cup of yoghurt and a spoon. 
My findings and their implications 
Participants targeting their advertisement at a high NFC 
audience exhibited a clear preference for slogans transporting 
facts and sober gestures, while participants with a low NFC 
target group selected a mixture of facts and sexually appealing 
messages and planned to mainly employ flirtatious gestures in 
the video clip. Further, independent raters (who did not know 
our hypotheses) rated participants as being more flirty (but not 
less serious) in advertisements designed for low NFC audiences.

rather sophisticated, if unspoken knowledge of the principles of 
persuasion. Although they might not ever have heard of the eLM 
or NFC, they nonetheless use information about NFC to tailor 
their messages, exactly as the eLM suggests they should. 
My journey 
the most valuable thing I gained during my project was the 
motivation to become further involved in attitude and 
persuasion research. this was fuelled by the positive feedback 
we received for our work and the feeling of contributing to a 
hot and fascinating research field. I presented the results of the 
project on a poster at the Congress of the european Federation 
of Psychology Students’ Associations (eFPSA) in 2009, winning 
the award for the best poster presentation. eFPSA is a great 
platform for undergraduate psychology students to become 
involved in international research, annually organizing a 
congress and featuring a peer review journal, the Journal of 
European Psychology Students.
the knowledge and skills I acquired came in handy when I 
started working as a student assistant in the social psychology 
department and during a research internship abroad. It also 
set the ground for my current work as a PhD student. I now 
employ an attitude research paradigm recently proposed by 
kaiser, Byrka and Hartig (2010), that builds upon a formal 
rather than causal conception of the attitude–behaviour 
relationship. It describes individual behaviour as a function of 
a person’s attitude level and the specific behavioural costs. I 
explore how environmental attitudes moderate the efficacy of 
information and technology interventions to reduce energy 
consumption in private households. Both intervention 
strategies usually do not result in the anticipated amounts of 
energy saved. A sufficient level of motivation to engage in 
environmental preservation and energy conservation might 
be a prerequisite for their efficiency.
My advice 
enjoy what you are doing. you are lucky to have the time on 
your hands to address your own research questions. Look 
around you: very likely there are a bunch of other dedicated 
young researchers and a faculty member offering a helping 
hand – all you have to do is to seize the opportunity and be 
creative. If you are bold enough to think out of the box while 
planning the project, there is a good chance you will have fun 
presenting your results afterwards – even if your hypotheses 
may not be supported.

In this chapter, we review the social psychological literature on close relationships, focusing 
primarily on romantic relationships, but also friendships. We outline the factors that deter-
mine when people are attracted to each other. We then review some of the key social psycho-
logical theories of attraction. Our focus then turns to love and romantic relationships more 
specifically and how romantic relationships are maintained. Finally, we focus on the often 
painful process of relationship breakdown.

Close relationships are at the very centre of human existence. Families love, 
support and bring joy to each other throughout life. Romantic partners enable 
people to feel nurtured, needed, important and special. Close friendships provide 
people with support and acceptance, shared interests and shared experiences. 
Having close relationships makes people feel good and as human beings, we have a 
fundamental need to affiliate and bond with others (Baumeister and Leary, 1995; 
Reis and Collins, 2004; Reis, Collins and Berscheid, 2000). Of course, we do not 
bond with everyone we meet. We like some people and can strongly dislike others. 
You may only need to think momentarily about your school days to remember 
how intensely you liked some of your classmates and the dislike you felt for 
others. Most of the time, the feelings were mutual. Interpersonal attraction is a 
powerful thing. So, it is probably not too surprising that a vast proportion of 
songs are about love, relationships and heartbreak. Close relationships are also 
one of the most common themes in movies, television and novels. Turn on the 
radio and it is likely that within a few minutes you will hear someone singing 
about love and relationships, uttering words like ‘I need you’ or ‘you’ve got a 
friend’. Humans seem to be preoccupied with the idea of being ‘in love’ or in 
other kinds of close relationships. 
This preoccupation makes sense. The loss or lack of close relationships can lead 
to negative outcomes such as depression, loneliness and alienation (Buckley, 
Winkel and Leary, 2004). People feel ostracized and sometimes become angry and 
aggressive when they are rejected by close others (Williams, Cheung and Choi, 
2000). People feel deep sadness when relationships come to an end (Simpson, 
1987). Close relationships are therefore necessary for survival and happiness and 
humans strive to seek and maintain these close social bonds with others. For 
example, we spend a lot of time and energy making ourselves attractive to prospec-
tive mates. We spend money on clothes, makeup and exercise equipment to maxi-
mize our physical appeal. We join groups to find others with whom we share 
interests. We do things that our friends also like to do. In short, we need to belong 
with others and will go to great lengths to make close relationships a core feature 
of life. Indeed, evolutionary psychologists have long argued that attraction, rela-
tionships and love are core to human survival and, as we will see in this chapter, 
basic principles of attraction have evolved to ensure the survival of the fittest (e.g., 
Barrett, Dunbar and Lycett, 2002; Buss, 1995, 2000, 2009). 
In Part 3 of this book, we will focus on the many benefits that humans gain 
from being around other humans in groups, but in this chapter we focus on the 
formation and development of close relationships between individuals. Specifi-
cally, why and when people are drawn to each other in the first place, what this 
magical thing is that we call ‘love’, theories of close relationships, how we main-
tain them and how we end close relationships. Much of the research in this chapter 
relates to the development, maintenance and ending of romantic relationships, but 
we also discuss literature related to other close relationships such as friendships. 
As you will see, the factors that influence attraction and many other relationship 
factors are essentially the same for romantic relationships and close friendships.

Close relationships
Interpersonal attraction
We all know from personal experience that we tend to like some people, but not 
others. Indeed, it is possible to take an immediate like or dislike to someone when 
we first meet them. Sometimes, we can articulate the reason why we feel this reac-
tion and at other times we are only aware of a ‘gut’ response to another person 
that influences whether or not we think they are likeable or attractive, and worth 
getting to know better. Social psychologists have identified several key factors that 
influence who we like, or are attracted to, and who we are not. Some are physical 
factors such as appearance and proximity. Others are psychological factors such as 
attitude similarity and mutual liking. 
Physical determinants of attraction
Many of the reasons why we are drawn to others are simple things and they are 
often features of our daily lives we cannot control. For example, we may like 
people simply because they are close by (e.g., Festinger, Schachter and Back, 1950). 
People who we see a lot are familiar and so we like them more than people who 
we see less often, which can influence our friendships and romantic relationships. 
Also, we tend to like people who are similar to ourselves on basic features such as 
looks, and this is particularly important with respect to romantic relationships 
(e.g., Murstein, 1986; Sprecher, 1998). Such factors can be defined as the physical 
determinants of attraction – features of our environment or appearance that influ-
ence our liking for others. The key physical determinant of attraction is a person’s 
physical appearance, which we discuss first. 
Physical appearance 
Probably the most important factor in determining judgements of attractiveness is 
a person’s physical appearance. Like it or not, we judge others (and are likewise 
judged by them) based on looks. This fundamental effect was demonstrated in a 
study by Hatfield, Aronson, Abrahams and Rottman (1966), who asked under-
graduate students to complete a range of personality and aptitude tests before 
matching them up randomly at a social dance. The experimenters also rated the 
physical attractiveness of each participant. The couples spent time together during 
the evening before evaluating their partner and the success of the date. Results 
showed that personality and aptitude factors were poor predictors of participants’ 
ratings. For example, participants did not show preferences for partners with high 
self-esteem or low anxiety, as one might expect. Instead, only the physical attrac-
tiveness of the partner seemed to matter. In other words, the more attractive the 
partner, the more likely it was the participant liked them and wanted to go out on 
another date. 
If a person is physically attractive, this is an asset in other facets of life (Lang-
lois, Kalakanis, Rubenstein et al., 2000). For example, an attractive person is more 
likely to go out on dates (e.g., Berscheid, Dion, Walster and Walster, 1971; Rowatt, 
Cunningham and Druen, 1999), get better marks at university (Landy and Sigall, 

302

1974), be successful in a job interview (Dipboye, Arvey and Terpstra, 1977; Mack 
and Rainey, 1990; Marvelle and Green, 1980) and earn more money once they 
have a job (French, 2002; Frieze, Olson and Russell, 1991; Mobius and Rosenblat, 
2006; Umberson and Hughes, 1987). Attractive people are more likely to win elec-
tions (Poutvaara, Jordahl and Berggren, 2009), attractive university teachers get 
higher evaluations (Hamermesh and Parker, 2005), while attractive people are 
treated more leniently in the legal system (Downs and Lyons, 1991). An attractive 
person is also perceived by participants in studies as more likely to get married 
(Dion, Berscheid and Walster, 1972), to be more honest (Yarmouk, 2000) and to be 
happier (Dion et al., 1972). Research has further shown that small babies prefer to 
look at attractive faces than less attractive faces (Langlois, Roggman, Casey et al., 
1987; Langlois et al., 2000). Further, children tend to prefer attractive children 
(Dion, 1973; Dion and Berscheid, 1974; Langlois et al., 2000), and adults tend to 
think that attractive children are more intelligent and more successful (Clifford 
and Walster, 1973). Clearly, it is good to be good-looking.
These findings show that people often attach positive qualities to attractive 
people. This is sometimes called the physical attractiveness stereotype – the tendency 
for people to assume that attractive people possess other socially desirable traits in 
addition to their looks (Dion et al., 1972; Moore, Graziano and Millar, 1987). To 
some extent, this is true. Some research shows that physically attractive people are 
more popular and outgoing (Langlois et al., 2000). However, these small differ-
ences may be due, in part, to self-fulfilling prophecies: because being physically 
attractive is socially desirable, attractive people may become more confident and 
outgoing and so may be more popular with others. The stereotype thus becomes 
self-fulfilling. Also, it is important to note that physical attractiveness has its 
drawbacks. In particular, more attractive people are often the subject of unwanted 
advances and resentment from less attractive individuals (Hatfield and Sprecher, 
1986). Attractive celebrities are often the victims of stalking (Roberts, 2007). Also, 
attractive, popular adolescents are more likely to engage in aggressive, destructive 
and norm-breaking behaviours (Dijkstra, Lindenberg, Verhulst et al., 2009). Thus, 
being attractive is not always as favourable as it may seem. Nevertheless, attrac-
tiveness is a key variable in the study of relationships. What specific features make 
a person attractive to others?
What is attractive?
Naturally, there is wide variation in what specific features people view to be 
appealing. For example, some people think that tattoos and piercings are attractive 
but others do not. Some women adopt the ‘thin ideal’, whereas others would 
prefer to be more voluptuous. Some men wear facial hair and others prefer to be 
clean shaven. There are, of course, other reasons to adopt these aspects of one’s 
appearance. For example, beards may be worn for religious purposes, a woman 
may need to be thin to be a model, and a person may need to have tattoos in order 
to be part of a gang. However, a lot of the time, people show preferences for 
physical features in themselves that they find attractive. The list of differences in

personal preferences is endless (Perrett, 2010). Likewise, there is a lot of variation 
in people’s preference to see these types of features (e.g., tattoos, beards) in others. 
However, despite these many differences, there is strong consensus both within 
and between cultures about attractiveness (Langlois et al., 2000). Specifically, 
when rating faces, people across the world seem to agree quite closely on who is 
attractive and who is not. For example, Langlois and Roggman (1990) asked 
participants to rate the physical attractiveness of a range of faces from different 
nationalities and ethnic groups. Participants’ ratings agreed to a significant extent, 
with correlations between them reaching up to .93. Perhaps surprisingly, there 
seem to be universal standards of attractiveness. 
Is there some kind of ‘super person’ who everyone finds attractive? The answer 
is no. Interestingly, the most attractive face tends to be the most ‘average’ face 
(Rhodes, 1996; Rhodes, Halberstadt, Jeffery and Palermo, 2005). For example, 
Winkielman, Halberstadt, Fazendeiro and Catty (2006) asked participants to view 
a series of faces. Some faces were normal (e.g., how the person actually looks) and 
others were digitized or combined multiple faces to produce ‘mathematically 
average’ or prototypical faces. Findings showed that, on average, people perceived 
the artificial prototypical faces to be more attractive than the actual faces. 
Winkielman et al. argued that this averageness effect, or preference for prototypical 
faces, occurs because average faces are closer to the mental prototype of a face. In 
other words, they are more ‘face-like’ and therefore more familiar. The authors 
further argued that this familiarity leads to higher ratings of attractiveness because 
the prototypical faces are easier to process. As people are exposed to more and 
more faces, a typical face prototype is developed and new faces are compared to 
this prototype. The closer a novel face is to the prototype, the more quickly it is 
processed and the more it is liked (see Figure 7.1). This is a case where perceptual 
fluency – the relative ease of mental operations – is high (Jacoby, 1983; Mandler, 
1980; Schwarz, 1998). However, it can also be related to the mere exposure effect, 
which we discuss later in this chapter, where repeated exposure to a stimulus 
makes people like it more. In this case, the repeated exposure leads the person to 
create a prototype of ‘face-like-ness’, which is then used as a benchmark from 
which to judge the attractiveness of other faces. 
Other studies have produced similar results. 
For example, Johnston (2000) created an average 
female face by combining 16 female Caucasian 
faces. He then subtly exaggerated the femininity 
of the faces by enhancing the features in which 
women and men typically differ (e.g., bigger eyes, 
fuller lips). Most people tend to find the composite 
female face to be more attractive and familiar

(see also Langlois and Roggman, 1990; Monin, 2003; Rhodes and Tremewan, 
1996; Rhodes, Yoshikawa, Clark et al., 2001). Evolutionary theorists argue that 
this preference for prototypicality in faces has evolved because prototypicality 
is a signal for health and therefore for reproductive fitness (e.g., Symons, 1979; 
Thornhill and Gangestad, 1993). 
It is also the case that averageness is not always best. Perrett, May and Yoshikawa 
(1994) made composite faces from groups of faces that had previously been rated as 
‘average’ and another set of composite faces that had previously been rated as 
‘highly attractive’. A composite of the ‘average’ faces was constructed for both 
Japanese and Caucasian faces and the same was done for the ‘highly attractive’ 
faces, resulting in an average composite of each type of face and for each race. These 
were then shown to a group of participants who were asked to rate the attractive-
ness of the faces. Results revealed that the ‘highly attractive’ composites were rated 
as more attractive than the ‘average’ composites, as one might expect. Further, 
Japanese and British participants showed similar ratings to each other, for both race 
composites, suggesting again that there are universal aspects of attractiveness. 
Another factor to consider is that composite or average faces tend to be more 
symmetrical and people tend to find symmetrical faces more attractive than asym-
metrical faces (Halberstadt and Rhodes, 2000; Penton-Voak and Perrett, 2001; 
Rhodes, 1996, 2006; Rhodes, Sumich and Byatt, 1999). People also rate symmet-
rical faces as healthier, more dominant and more extroverted (Shackelford and 
Larsen, 1997). Within sets of identical twins, the twin with the most symmetrical 
face is rated the most attractive (Mealey, Bridgstock and Townsend, 1999). 
Why is facial symmetry important? Some social psychologists have proposed 
that this preference for average and symmetrical faces has evolved; that is, 
throughout the course of our evolution, people have come to prefer certain dimen-
sions in faces (Langlois et al., 2000; Langlois, Roggman and Musselman, 1994). It 
is argued that this preference comes about because a prototypical face is a good 
indicator of the biological quality of a potential partner. For example, people who 
have more average faces tend to have a more diverse gene pool. Such diversity 
means they are likely to be stronger and more able to fight off diseases. Thus, they 
are more reproductively fit and, essentially, a better choice of mate (Grammer and 
Thornhill, 1994). So, participants in experiments may tend to prefer composite 
faces because they do not have some of the atypical features that make faces asym-
metrical. Interestingly, the averageness effect also extends to people’s judgements 
of the attractiveness of dogs, watches, birds, cars and other non-human objects 
(e.g., Halberstadt and Rhodes, 2000, 2003). If a preference for prototypicality has 
evolved, then perhaps the averageness effect should only be seen for human faces. 
Others argue that, in evolutionary terms, physical attractiveness signals that a 
person is young, healthy and fertile and this is why attractiveness is valued (e.g., 
Jokela, 2009; Swami, Furnham and Joshi, 2008). Evolutionary social psychologists 
also argue that there are biological reasons why heterosexual women tend to find 
high status men attractive and heterosexual men focus more on a woman’s youth 
and beauty. For example, Buss (1989, 2003; see also Mathes and Kozak, 2008) 

305
Close relationships
argued that the characteristics preferred by men signal reproductive fitness and 
the characteristics sought by women in their men signal stability and the ability to 
provide for offspring. 
Evolutionary psychologists have also explained why men almost universally 
prefer women whose waists are in a 30:70 proportion to their hips – this shape is 
associated with fertility, and events that affect fertility such as pregnancy and 
malnutrition also cause changes in shape (Singh, 1993; Singh and Young, 1995; but 
see also Swami, Gray and Furnham, 2007). Interestingly, women show similar 
effects, preferring more masculine features at the time they ovulate or during their 
fertile years of life than at other times (Gangstead, Simpson, Cousins et al., 2004; 
Jones, DeBruine, Perrett et al., 2008; Little, Saxton, Roberts et al., 2010; Macrae, 
Alnwick, Milne and Schloerscheidt, 2002). Incredibly, women prefer the smell of 
T-shirts worn by physically symmetrical men, a finding more pronounced at the 
time of ovulation (Gangstead and Simpson, 2000). Another striking finding is that 
strippers earn more tips when they are at the most fertile time in their menstrual 
cycle (Miller, Tybur and Jordon, 2007). However, this was only the case for 
women who were not taking the contraceptive pill; those who were on the pill 
(and therefore not ovulating, and presumably less interested in mating) did not 
show an increase in earnings via tips. Further, women are rated by men and also 
rate themselves as more attractive at the peak of their menstrual cycle (Röder, 
Brewer and Fink, 2009; Schwarz and Hassebrauck, 2008), while studies have also 
shown that women wear more provocative clothing at the time they are most 
fertile (e.g., Durante, Li and Haselton, 2008; Röder et al., 2009). All this is quite 
fascinating, but what does it mean? According to evolutionary psychologists, 
these findings mean that men prefer women who appear most fertile, and when 
women are at their most fertile, they prefer the ‘fittest’ men to mate with. Mating, 
like other fundamental needs, is driven somewhat by biological factors. Even 
considering some cultural variations – such as in foraging societies, where thinness 
is undesirable because it signifies malnutrition and fatness signifies wealth (e.g., 
Marlowe and Wetsman, 2001) – attractiveness seems to be a sign of reproductive 
fitness. The Critical focus box below presents an evolutionary perspective on mate 
selection and relationships.

Exploring further It is clear that the ‘ideal female shape’ has not 
always been the same. For example, compare the more voluptuous 
marilyn monroe from the 1950s with a super-slim catwalk model of 
today. What does this tell us about the factors that influence what we 
find attractive? Is it all down to evolution? Do you think that 
standards would differ for men and women? Find out more about the 
evolutionary perspective on attractiveness and consider what other 
features influence our view of what is attractive. try to construct 
arguments for and against the evolutionary perspective on 
attractiveness, drawing on other examples such as changes in

Sexual strategies theory 
Evolutionary psychologists construe human attraction 
(and specifically their sexual preferences) as being part of 
a sexual strategy, designed by evolution to maximize 
people’s chances of transmitting their genes. according to 
this perspective, this is why males and females show 
different preferences when choosing a long-term mate. 
Sexual strategies theory (Buss and schmitt, 1993) 
purportedly explains why males show a preference for 
youth, physical health and attractiveness (cues to fertility 
and reproductive value) and why females show a 
preference for status, maturity and resources (cues 
related to the potential ability to provide for mother and 
child). It also attempts to explain why men tend to 
engage in short-term mating more than women. after all, 
men are able to ‘pass on’ more of their genes by mating 
with multiple females. If a man mates with many women, 
there is a good chance he will father more children. the 
same behaviour in women provides no evolutionary 
advantage. she can mate with many men but can only 
produce one child at a time. However, Buss and schmitt 
(1993) argue that women can benefit from short-term 
mating if it gives them access to an exceptionally good 
male. an exceptionally good male may produce an 
exceptionally good child with good genes, thus suiting an 
evolutionary purpose for the woman. successfully 
copying your genes is much more a matter of quality for 
women, since the quantity of offspring that women can 
have is limited. 
according to sexual strategies theory, whether long- or 
short-term strategies are chosen depends on factors such 
as opportunity, personal ‘market value’, sex ratio available 
in the ‘pool’ and other cultural and social features. 
However, when short-term mating is opted for, it is 
predicted that:
1 men will desire more sexual variety (more partners).
2 men require less time to elapse before consenting to 
sex than women.
3 men tend to actively seek more mates than women.
to test this theory, schmitt, alcalay, alik et al. (2003) 
measured the desire for sexual variety of 16,000 
participants in 52 countries. the measures looked like this:
Ideally, how many different sex partners would you like  
to have …
In the next month
In the next six months
…
your remaining lifetime
schmitt et al. also measured the time required before an 
individual is willing to engage in sexual intercourse as 
follows:
If the conditions were right, would you consider sexual 
intercourse desirable if you had known that person for …
1 hour  
(definitely yes +3 + 2 +1 0 –1 –2 –3 definitely no)
…
5 years 
(definitely yes +3 + 2 +1 0 –1 –2 –3 definitely no)
Finally, the researchers measured the degree to which the 
individual is actively seeking short-term mating partners:
not at all    1   2   3   4   5   6   7    strongly
the results were winsorized, which means that 
extreme outliers were removed. For example, anyone 
who said that they wanted more than 100 sexual partners 
was removed so as not to skew the results (for interest’s 
sake, these were men).
the results concerning the ‘number of partners’ 
measure supported the first hypothesis, that across all 
regions of the world, men desired more partners. to test 
the second hypothesis, schmitt et al. (2003) compared 
Time to reflect In the uk, a novel take on the ‘blind date’ tv show formula invites participants to go on dates in 
the dark, supposedly taking the crucial factor of physical attractiveness out of the equation. ‘Dating in the dark’ 
forces contestants to get to know each other without this cue to attraction. at the end of the show, contestants are 
physically ‘revealed’ to each other and decide whether or not they want to go on further dates. Do you think this 
technique facilitates people’s attraction to each other? Or, ultimately, does physical attractiveness always matter? 
What other factors might influence the success of the dates?

Try it yourself If you cannot quite believe these differences, try it out for yourself with some friends. ask a group 
of friends the questions schmitt et al. asked of their participants (described in the Critical focus box above). In other 
words, how many sexual partners do your friends want to have over the next month, the next six months and so on? 
Do you notice the gender difference? 
With almost universal agreement about standards of attractiveness, readers 
may come to the conclusion that everyone seeks the same type of partner. While 
it may be the case that everyone wishes to have a great-looking partner, it is clear 
that this is not possible. Obviously, it is not possible for every heterosexual man 
to end up with an objectively attractive woman and, likewise, every heterosexual 
results for men and women’s required time before 
consenting to sex. again, there was a significant sex 
difference in all regions. By and large, men were happy to 
have intercourse with someone within a month of 
knowing them; women wanted to take longer. Finally, to 
test the third hypothesis, schmitt et al. compared females 
and males on the ‘actively seeking short-term mates’ 
measure. yet again, men were more likely to report 
actively searching for short-term mates, even when they 
were already in a relationship. 
schmitt et al. argued that their results provide evidence 
for the evolutionary basis of mate selection. across 
cultures, males and females show different mating 
preferences, suggesting a deep-rooted biological basis for 
mate selection. the evidence seems compelling. However, 
like any piece of research, it is necessary to critically 
evaluate the claims made from the study: 
1 the methods rely on self-report data, that is, people 
report their sexual preferences in a questionnaire. 
arguably, this is not, therefore, an objective measure of 
actual sexual preferences. In particular, it may be 
socially desirable for men to appear ‘macho’ by 
reporting that they have (and desire) many mates. so, 
do participants’ responses adequately represent 
reality? In defence of sexual strategies theory, schmitt 
et al. (2003) argue that their results mirror those of 
other studies, which have used observational data. For 
example, the prevalence of adultery and use of 
pornography is higher in males than females. 
2 the many student participants may not be 
representative of ‘people in general’ because there may 
be a student subculture across countries and cultures. 
3 One key criticism of the evolutionary approach to 
human mating is that even if we accept that sex 
differences are real, is the evolutionary approach the 
only, or even the best explanation? Is it really 
scientifically viable? 
Eagly and Wood (1999) offer the most thorough, 
concentrated criticism and constructive alternative. First, it 
is important to note that they accept biological differences. 
For example, men are bigger than women, as well as more 
physically powerful. Women are more invested in children. 
Because of the differences observed by schmitt et al., men 
are more likely to have the role of hunter-gatherer and 
women are more likely to have the role of carer. the crucial 
difference between Eagly and Wood’s approach and the 
evolutionary approach is that mate selection is determined 
by social roles and not inherent biological differences. 
there is no necessary or strong genetic influence on sexual 
preferences, which are socially determined. Both theories 
acknowledge social and genetic factors, but to a different 
extent. Debate about these issues is ongoing. One key 
issue is how to distinguish which theory is best to explain 
sexual preferences.

woman cannot pair up with a man who meets the culturally universal standards 
of attractiveness. In romantic relationships, what other factors determine who is 
attracted to whom?
The matching phenomenon 
One key mechanism that determines who people are attracted to is what social 
psychologists call the matching phenomenon. This is where people tend to be 
attracted to people who are about the same level of physical attractiveness as 
themselves. For example, many studies have found a strong association between 
the attractiveness of married and dating couples (Murstein, 1986; Sprecher, 1998). 
Further, other studies show that in dating-type scenarios, people tend to approach 
people whose attractiveness is fairly close to their own (Berscheid et al., 1971; 
Price and Vandenberg, 1979; Stroebe, Insko, Thompson and Layton, 1971; Taylor, 
Fiore, Mendelsohn and Cheshire, 2011). Also, people who are a close physical 
match tend to have more long-lasting relationships than those who are less closely 
matched (White, 1980). 
Does this mean that people never date people who are ‘out of their league’? 
Clearly not. This fantasy of dating people who are more attractive is another 
preoccupation that humans seem to have. It is a common theme in teenage movies 
and TV programmes to ‘catch’ the hottest boy or girl in school. Also, many songs 
and poems speak of coveted others who are out of reach, mainly because they are 
too beautiful or too handsome. Even though the matching phenomenon is 
powerful, this does not mean that people never have successful relationships with 
more or less physically attractive others.
Time to reflect research suggests that people tend to be attracted to others who are their match with respect to 
physical attractiveness. Does this mean that people stop wanting ‘more’? What do you think the processes might be 
that lead people to end up with their own physical matches? Is partner selection like the marketplace? We want 
something we simply cannot afford, so settle for something else instead?
In such cases, social psychologists argue that for less physically attractive 
people, compensatory factors often mean that they can make up for their looks and 
make themselves attractive in other areas. For example, they may be wealthy, 
intelligent and witty, or belong to an attractive social circle. These features are 
attractive. Such compensatory factors increase a person’s appeal to others who 
may be more physically attractive but value these other attributes more than 
looks. In this respect, although it sounds strange, seeking a relationship can be 
compared to the process of going shopping. When we go shopping, we sometimes 
value an item’s specifications over its aesthetic appeal. We weigh up what we value 
most and make a decision based on that process. For example, we might think that 
a phone is clunky and dull, but really value its high specification camera. We do 
the same in relationships and the value of the respective ‘assets’ generates an equal 
match. You will see this phenomenon in action on dating websites and personal 
advertisements. People offer their attributes and hope to meet others who share 
some similarities and complement them in other ways (Cicerello and Sheehan, 
Matching phenomenon the 
tendency for individuals to 
choose as partners people 
who are a similar match to 
themselves in terms of their 
physical attractiveness. 

309

1995; Koestner and Wheeler, 1988). Or, they may seek people who value the traits 
they themselves possess. Interestingly, Morgan, Richards and VanNess (2010) 
explored the online personal advertisements of 294 heterosexual and homosexual 
women and men by comparing the narratives that participants generated about 
themselves and their preferred partner. The self and partner narratives were 
remarkably similar and even though there were some differences (e.g., homosexual 
individuals were more likely to list physical attributes than heterosexual adver-
tisers), the study provides strong support for the matching phenomenon in dating 
websites rather than seeking complementary characteristics. 
However, some research shows that there are some gender differences in what 
men and women offer and seek. Studies have shown that while women tend to 
offer looks and seek wealth and status (e.g., ‘Attractive 28-year-old woman seeks 
professional man’), men tend to offer wealth and status while seeking looks (e.g., 
‘Professional 40-year-old man seeks attractive young woman’) (Baise and 
Schroeder, 1995). This is sometimes called asset matching and allows people to 
exchange what they want from relationships. From an evolutionary perspective, 
this also makes sense. Women may seek high status in men so that they can provide 
for their offspring. On the other hand, men may seek the most sexually attractive 
female mate to increase their reproductive success (Buss and Schmitt, 1993). 
Matching with similar others is not just about physical attractiveness either. As 
we will see later, people tend to seek relationships with others who are also similar 
in terms of attitudes, values and preferences. Thankfully, it is not all about looks, 
despite the powerful influence of physical attractiveness. 
Question to consider reread question 1 at the start of the chapter. What are the chances of matt ending up with 
melissa? From your own experience, think of friendships and romantic relationships between people of different 
attractiveness levels. What brought them together? Did they stay together? What social psychological phenomena 
can you see in practice?
Familiarity and proximity 
In addition to good looks, simply finding someone familiar or being in close prox-
imity to others can facilitate attraction. Familiarity may even influence people’s 
ratings of physical attractiveness. For example, Little and Perrett (2002) found that 
when participants rated the attractiveness of faces, they preferred the faces that 
were most similar to their own. Also, they rated a series of photos of the opposite 
sex – crucially, one of the faces had been ‘morphed’ with their own face. The 
participants rated this morphed, opposite-gender version of their own face as the 
most attractive. Thus, it seems that we like what we see as physically similar to us. 
Further, Little, Burt and Perrett (2006) demonstrated that if a person was said to 
possess a certain (desirable) personality characteristic that is familiar and impor-
tant to the perceiver, the perceiver rated the face as more attractive.
Familiarity influences attraction in other ways. For example, in terms of 
friendships, we are often friendliest with the neighbours who live closest to us 
(see Figure 7.2). At school, we may have bonded with the child sitting next to us

in class. Being close to others makes it more likely that we will form friendships 
or romantic relationships with them (Berscheid and Reis, 1998). This effect of 
proximity (sometimes also called the propinquity effect) was demonstrated in a 
classic study by Festinger et al. (1950), who found that, in a housing complex for 
married couples at a large US university, when people were asked to name their 
friends, they tended to name people in the same building even though the other 
buildings were only metres away. Also, within a building, people tended to 
choose friends who were living on the same floor as themselves, as opposed to 
those who were on other floors or in other buildings. Further, the location of key 
building features such as staircases and mailboxes also had an impact on friend-
ships. In particular, people situated on different floors but directly next to a 
staircase were more likely to become friends than those situated on different 
floors and further away from the staircase. Likewise, the people closest to the 
staircases and mailboxes on the lower floor were more likely to have friends 
upstairs than those who were further away from the building’s key features. 
These important features made people even more proximal; people close to the 
stairs and mailboxes were even more likely to come into contact with each other. 
As a result, they were also more likely to become friends. A similar effect was 
also demonstrated in a study by Back, Schmukle and Egloff (2008), who randomly 
assigned students to sit next to someone, or in the same row as that person, for 
one whole term during a psychology class. A year later, the researchers measured 
the students’ liking for the person. Results revealed that the closer they sat to the 
person, the more they liked them. 
Perhaps these findings seem quite logical. After all, it is easier to get to know 
someone who lives nearby and with whom you anticipate interacting in future. 
But why exactly does proximity make us like people more? Social psychologists 
argue that proximity is effective because we tend to like things (in this case, people) 
that are familiar to us. Further, repeated exposure to another person – particularly 
if the exposure is positive – is likely to lead to more favourable evaluations of that 
person. Even tiny babies tend to smile more at photos they have already seen 
before than those that are unfamiliar (Lewis and Brooks-Gunn, 1981). This is an 
example of the mere exposure effect. Zajonc (1968, 2001) argued that when we 
first encounter a stimulus, which can be anything from nonsense words to people’s 
faces, we feel slightly uncomfortable. It is reasonable that we react this way 
because new and unfamiliar objects (and people) might cause us danger. Again, 
this makes evolutionary sense. To ensure survival, it is important to avoid things 
that may cause us danger.
However, as people are repeatedly exposed to a stimulus, it becomes more 
familiar. Further, if the stimulus has caused no harm, then feelings of uncertainty 
will dissipate and liking will increase. For example, Zajonc (1968, 1980) found 
that people were more likely to say that familiar nonsense words (ones they had 
been exposed to earlier in the experiment) meant something positive. Harmon-
Jones and Allen (2001) found that people smiled more when they saw familiar 
faces rather than unfamiliar faces. In the Festinger et al. (1950) study, people were

more likely to see people who were either close (on the same floor) or function-
ally close (near mailboxes and stairs) in the building. Thus, they became more 
familiar over time and from this familiarity, liking increased and friendships and 
relationships grew. 
Time to reflect If you have ever lived in student accommodation, who did you consider to be your closest friends? 
are there any patterns (e.g., proximity, familiarity and so on) similar to those observed in social psychological research?
The effect of repeated exposure on liking was also demonstrated in a study by 
Moreland and Beach (1992), set in the context of a US college course. In the study, 
one experimental assistant, posing as a student, attended the course 15 times, one 
attended 10 times, one attended 5 times and one did not attend at all. None of the 
assistants ever interacted with the students. At the end of the course, students in 
all the classes were shown photographs of all four individuals and were asked to 
indicate how much they liked each one. As can be seen in Figure 7.3, the more 
times an assistant attended the class, the more the 
students were attracted to them. Strikingly, without 
even interacting with a person, simply seeing them 
more often makes them more attractive to us. 
Familiarity works on other interesting levels too. 
For example, we often associate names with positive 
experiences and other names with negative experiences. 
We may have met a Bob we really liked, or an Adam 
we did not like at all. A kind of stereotype emerges if 
we associate a particular name with positive attributes 
and this stereotype influences our future judgements 
about others who share the name (Macrae, Mitchell 
and Pendry, 2002). Sometimes, stereotypes about a 
name become shared, so that many people will asso-
ciate a certain name with particular traits (Mehrabian and Piercy, 1993). Perhaps 
this is one good reason why most parents do not call their newborn baby boy 
Adolf or Osama, but at least in some parts of the world, Jesus is a relatively 
popular name. More generally, children’s names tend to follow trends. For 
example, in 2011 the top three names for British newborn girls were Amelia, 
Olivia and Lily, and for boys, Harry, Oliver and Jack (ONS, 2011). Contrast these 
names to those that were most popular in 1904 for girls (Mary, Florence, Doris), 
and for boys (William, John, George). One reason for such trends is that familiar 
names from the media, sport and other areas are liked more and so more parents 
choose these names for their own children. 
Proximity to others also increases the anticipation that we will interact with 
them in future. With this anticipation of future interaction, liking also increases 
(Berscheid, Graziano, Monson and Dermer, 1976; Darley and Berscheid, 1967). 
For example, Darley and Berscheid (1967) gave female students some vague infor-
mation about two other women, one of whom the participant was supposed to

interact with immediately afterwards. When asked to rate how much they liked 
each woman, participants rated the woman they were supposed to interact with as 
more likeable. It is argued that this phenomenon helps people form positive rela-
tionships. If anticipating interaction with another person increases liking for them, 
then this anticipatory liking will increase the chance of the relationship’s success 
(Klein and Kunda, 1992; Knight and Vallacher, 1981). This makes adaptive sense 
for us too. An old saying goes that ‘you can choose your friends but not your 
family’ – thankfully, the effect of anticipatory liking means that we are adapted to 
like those with whom we have regular contact. Thus, while we cannot necessarily 
choose our family, we are more or less ‘programmed’ to like them because we 
expect to see and interact with them often. 
The effect of mere exposure can even occur outside the perceiver’s awareness. 
For example, repeated exposure to subliminal stimuli (see Chapter 6) increases 
liking for the stimuli, which even generalizes to other similar stimuli (Monahan, 
Murphy and Zajonc, 2000). Sometimes, mere exposure has an even stronger effect 
on liking when people are not aware they have been exposed to a stimulus (Born-
stein and D’Agostino, 1992). You may be able to remember a time when you ‘just 
liked’ or ‘just didn’t like’ someone you met. In such a case, you may have been 
unaware that you already knew someone who was similar to this person – your 
judgements of the ‘new’ person were clouded by your exposure to the other 
person. Zajonc (1980) argued that, in such a case, emotions are often more instant 
than thinking. So your ‘gut’ reaction to a person, while being a result of some kind 
of exposure, is preceded by a strong emotional response. Again, this reaction has 
adaptive functions. We need to be aware when a new stimulus may cause us 
danger. On the other hand, an automatic negative evaluation of a person may 
explain the way that people occasionally react strongly and negatively to people 
who seem unfamiliar in terms of their skin colour or some other distinguishing 
feature. Such strong immediate reactions can potentially be a source of prejudice. 
Thus, proximity and familiarity do not always lead to liking and attraction. For 
example, you can probably imagine that if a person lives close to an annoying 
neighbour with a dog that barks in the middle of the night, liking is more likely to 
decrease with proximity and familiarity. In general, when a person’s initial reac-
tion to a stimulus is negative, repeated exposure will have the opposite effect than 
when the initial reaction was positive and liking will decrease (Swap, 1977). Prox-
imity can also sometimes lead to hostility. For example, many assaults and murders 
occur among close others. Domestic violence is a significant problem in the UK 
and in many other countries. An old saying goes that ‘familiarity breeds contempt’, 
and in some key respects this is true, with significant consequences. More often, 
however, proximity is associated with liking rather than disliking. We tend to 
associate and form close relationships with people we see on a regular basis, such 
as workmates, classmates and people who live in the same neighbourhood.  
Some modern relationships are, of course, not dependant on physical proximity.

ships with people you have only briefly, or have never met in person. Some of you 
may have used dating websites like www.eharmony.co.uk or www.match.com to 
meet prospective romantic partners. Many of you will keep in touch via email and 
Skype. In such cases, people can be thousands of miles apart and yet still be 
attracted to one another (Chan and Cheng, 2004). They may see each other 
frequently, infrequently or never, and yet still be friends or develop long-lasting 
romantic relationships. People who meet in cyberspace may also meet in ‘real life’ 
or may never meet at all and yet a social bond can be very strong. 
Computer-mediated communication and other electronic means of communi-
cation are, however, limited in some respects. For example, as we discussed in 
Chapter 5, people lack many of the social cues that are typical in face-to-face 
conversations (e.g., Bargh and McKenna, 2004; Tanis and Postmes, 2003; Whitty 
and Gavin, 2001). The absence of such social cues also provides scope for dishon-
esty and people may not, in fact, be all they seem (e.g., Whitty and Joinson, 2008). 
People can conceal aspects of their identity they do not like and instead enhance 
those features of themselves (their looks and personality) that they think will be 
appealing to others (see also Chapter 2 where we discuss the phenomenon of 
narcissism). Also, some findings suggest that people find it difficult to form 
friendships in cyberspace and increased time spent on the internet is associated 
with feelings of depression and loneliness (Kraut, Patterson, Lundmark et al., 
1998). However, on the positive side, the growth of the internet allows people to 
communicate with others who they would not otherwise have had the opportu-
nity to meet. People with similar interests can more easily find each other than 
once was the case, and some findings suggest that people do form lasting friend-
ships with people they meet on the internet (e.g., Bargh, McKenna and Fitzsi-
mons, 2002; McKenna and Bargh, 2000). People also tend to like people they first 
met on the internet more than those they have met in real life (McKenna, Green 
and Gleason, 2002). Crucially, electronic communication and forms of interac-
tion such as internet dating are easy and inexpensive, and people are increasingly 
technologically savvy, so these new means of communication do not necessarily 
seem daunting.

Physiological arousal 
Another situational factor that influences attraction is physiological arousal, 
which can lead to a process called excitation transfer. This occurs when the arousal 
caused by one stimulus is added to the arousal of another stimulus and the overall 
arousal felt is attributed incorrectly to the second stimulus. This phenomenon was 
demonstrated in a classic study by Dutton and Aron (1974). In this study, male 
participants completed a questionnaire and were then asked to cross either a shaky 
or stable bridge to pass the questionnaire to the experimenter (who was either 
male or female). The dependent variable in this study was whether the participants 
called the experimenter with any further queries about the study. While the 
participants were generally unlikely to call the male experimenter, the shakiness or 
stability of the bridge significantly influenced 
the likelihood that they would call the female 
experimenter (see Figure 7.4). Specifically, the 
participants were much more likely to call a 
female experimenter if they had crossed the 
shaky bridge than if they crossed the stable 
bridge. It was argued that the arousal felt by 
the participants who crossed the shaky bridge 
was transferred to the female experimenter, to 
whom the participants then felt more attracted. 
Several other studies have demonstrated the 
misattribution of other types of arousal for 
attraction (e.g., Allen, Kenrick, Linder and 
McCall, 1989; White, Fishbein and Rutsein, 
1981; Zillman, 1972). 
Psychological determinants of attraction
Physical determinants of attraction are very powerful. However, in social 
psychology it is rare that one or two factors explain the whole picture. In this case, 
one’s attraction to another person cannot solely be explained by their physical 
attractiveness, otherwise everyone would want to have relationships with the most 
attractive people and many would be left alone. Also, proximity alone cannot 
explain attraction, otherwise everyone would be best friends with their neigh-
bours, which, of course, is not always the case. TV programmes such as Neigh-
bours from Hell will certainly attest to this. Typically, a combination of factors is 
important in determining who is attracted to whom. This is where psychological 
factors also become important. First, we will consider how the basic human need 
to affiliate with others influences our attraction to others. 
Need to affiliate
Psychologists argue that a desire to seek and maintain interpersonal relationships 
with others – that is, the need to affiliate – is as fundamental to our psychological 
wellbeing as food and water are to our physical wellbeing (Baumeister and Leary, 
Excitation transfer a

1995). Essentially, affiliation keeps us alive. Some evidence suggests that people 
respond to facial cues of satisfaction and dissatisfaction in others (Hassin and 
Trope, 2000) and even that we process faces and facial information differently from 
less biologically important stimuli (Ro, Russell and Lavie, 2001). Thus, we process 
others’ reactions to us and even show a preference at an early age for faces over 
other stimuli (e.g., Valenza, Simion, Cassia and Umiltaa, 1996). Our attraction to 
others is driven by a psychological need to be involved in social relationships.
Of course, people differ in their need to affiliate. Like many other social 
psychological constructs, there are broad variations in the extent to which people 
seek out human contact. Some people are predisposed to want a higher level of 
affiliation than others (e.g., Craig, Koestner and Zuroff, 1994). For example, some 
people seek many relationships, whereas others would prefer to be alone for much 
of the time. There are also situational factors that influence the extent to which 
people seek relationships with others. For example, making people aware of the 
inevitability of their own death leads them to want to be around others more 
(Wisman and Koole, 2003). There is also a common wisdom that people like to be 
around others in times of trouble, especially when they are anxious or frightened. 
In a classic study, Schachter (1959) demonstrated that in a situation where experi-
mental participants were expecting to be given electric shocks, the participants 
wanted to be around others who were also facing the situation rather than being 
alone. It is possible to consider examples of this phenomenon in everyday life. For 
example, people come together during major disasters. Recall the 33 trapped 
Chilean miners in August 2010 and the rallying of their families and the commu-
nity to maintain the physical and psychological wellbeing of the men. Families 
also rally together after the passing of a loved one. One reason they do this is 
because being around others helps people to understand their feelings and compare 
them with people who are sharing the same experiences and feelings. Working 
from social comparison theory, Schachter argued that comparing one’s feelings 
with those of others reduces anxiety and makes a person less fearful of events 
because their feelings are shared. There is often safety in numbers. 
Therefore, affiliation satisfies some fundamental psychological needs. 
However, if people’s need to affiliate is not satisfied, this can result in negative 
consequences, such as feelings of rejection, sadness and anger (Williams et al., 
2000; see also the discussion of social ostracism in Chapter 8). At a more extreme 
level, an unsatisfied need to affiliate can result in less effective cognitive func-
tioning (Baumeister, Twenge and Nuss, 2002). Studies of social deprivation, 
which we discuss later, allow us to better understand some of the consequences 
of an unfulfilled need for affiliation.

Emotions 
Attraction to others is also influenced by affect, or emotions. Positive feelings lead 
people to evaluate others positively, and negative affect is more likely to lead to 
negative evaluations (Byrne, 1997). This effect can work very simply. For example, 
imagine if you met someone for the first time and that person complimented you 
on your new bag. You are much more likely to form a positive impression (and be 
attracted to) that person than another who said they thought your bag was 
hideous. Research suggests that we like people who make us feel good (e.g., 
Shapiro, Baumeister and Kessler, 1991). This effect can be explicit, as in the above 
example, or it can work in a less obvious way. Specifically, some research suggests 
that simply being around someone when something good happens to us can make 
us more attracted to that person (e.g., Olson and Fazio, 2001). Through a process 
like classical conditioning, we associate the positive feeling with the person who is 
present, which makes us like them more even though they have nothing to do 
with it. Perhaps you fondly remember people you met on holiday or at a music 
festival. Maybe the positive emotions you experienced at these events are some-
what responsible for the positive feelings you experience now. We will discuss this 
effect in more detail when we discuss the theories of attraction later in the chapter. 
Similarity of attitudes, interests and values 
Research suggests that people find others more attractive when they are similar to 
themselves in ways other than their level of physical attractiveness. In particular, 
one of the most important psychological determinants of attraction is similarity of 
attitudes, interests and values. Sir Francis Galton ([1870]1952) provided the first 
empirical evidence of this. He obtained correlational data from married couples, 
which indicated that the wives’ and husbands’ attitudes were quite similar. Addi-

tional findings suggest that these similarities are greater than would occur by 
chance (Hunt, 1935). Further, Newcomb (1956, 1961) asked a sample of male US 
college students to complete a series of questionnaires about their attitudes and 
values, in exchange for free accommodation. The students completed one set of 
questionnaires prior to their arrival at university and then throughout the year. 
They were also asked to rate the attractiveness of their fellow students. Newcomb 
found that early on in the year, proximity was the key predictor of attraction. 
Echoing Festinger et al.’s (1950) study, students tended to like their classmates 
who lived closest to them. However, after the initial settling-in period and as the 
academic year progressed, attraction was more closely related to similarity of atti-
tudes and values, as measured before the students met each other (see also Gaunt, 
2006; Lee and Bond, 1998; Luo and Klohnen, 2005). 
The importance of attitude similarity was further reinforced by Byrne (1971), 
who argued that attraction towards a person is directly – and linearly – related to 
the proportion of attitudes that one shares with that person. This ‘law of attrac-
tion’ (Clore, 1976; Clore and Byrne, 1974) also works to reinforce existing attrac-
tion, such that the things people do can make them even more attractive. For 
example, imagine you have a friend you like because you share similar values and 
interests. If you then find out that your friend loves a particular music group (they 
are your absolute favourite group), you will probably find your friend even more 
attractive. People tend to match themselves with others who share interests such 
as these, as well as leisure activities (Sprecher, 1998). Of course, it is also the case 
that we often choose to be around people who have similar interests to ourselves 
in our basic everyday choices. For example, everyone in your class chose to study 
social psychology, so you all have some interests in common even before you 
begin to interact (see Figure 7.5). Thus, the effects of similarity can work in quite a 
subtle way – people seek out situations where they will be able to interact with 
similar others. However, even given these subtle effects, a significant body of 
research points to the importance of attitude similarity in determining attraction 
(e.g., Byrne, 1997; Byrne and Nelson, 1965; Condon and Crano, 1988; Koestner 
and Aube, 1995; Moreland and Zajonc, 1982). 
Similarity may be important for a number of reasons. First, some theorists argue 
that similarity helps people find balance in relationships. According to balance 
theory (Heider, 1958a; Newcomb, 1961), people compare their attitudes with those 
of others and if they are similar in some key respect, then balance is achieved. 
Balance enhances positive feelings, which makes people attracted to each other. 
Attitude dissimilarity, on the other hand, causes imbalance. Such imbalance 
produces negative feelings and makes attraction less likely. In such a case, people 
are more likely to be indifferent to one another. In the first place, however, attitude 
similarity needs to mean something. Why does it matter that others’ attitudes are 
similar to our own? The answer is perhaps social comparison (Festinger, 1954; see 
also Chapter 2). One way that people evaluate the validity of their own attitudes 
and beliefs is by comparing them to others’ attitudes and beliefs. Finding out that 
other people share our beliefs means that the beliefs must have some basis, and this

makes us feel good. Of course, another reason for the importance of similarity, like 
proximity and familiarity, may be that, from an evolutionary perspective, it is adap-
tive to like similar others. Dissimilar others may present a danger to survival. 
Exploring further the research we have discussed with respect to balance theory seems a bit old. What is new (if 
anything) for balance theory? use this as a search term on google scholar to find new papers related to this theory 
from the 1950s. Write down one novel finding that has emerged in the past 10 years. note that you may need to 
narrow the search by including additional search terms such as ‘relationships’.
People who are similar in personality and interpersonal skills are also more likely 
to be attracted to one another (Sprecher, 1998; Stevens, Owens and Schaefer, 1990). 
For example, in a study of gay male relationships, Boyden, Carroll and Maier (1984) 
found that men sought men with similar personalities. Specifically, men who scored 
high on masculinity desired other men with masculine traits. On the other hand, 
men who scored high on femininity sought other men with more feminine traits. 
The same preference for similar personality traits applies in heterosexual romantic 
relationships and friendships (Acitelli, Kenny and Weiner, 2001). Even in children as 
young as three years old, similarity (e.g., on dimensions such as food preferences 
and toy preferences) predicts liking (Fawcett and Markson, 2010). Also, Sprecher 
(1998) found that personality factors such as warmth and kindness were more 
important to people in relationships than interests, values and attitudes. 
Further, people who have a similar communication style are more compatible 
(Burleson and Samter, 1996), whereas those who have different interpersonal 
styles are less likely to have successful relationships (Burleson, 1994). Specifically, 
some people are more willing to disclose information about themselves than other 
people. This willingness – called self-disclosure – is an important factor in deter-
mining long-term relationship success. People tend to like people more who reveal 
more about themselves and their thoughts (Collins and Miller, 1994). Also, people 
tend to reveal more to the people they like and trust. Self-disclosure is important 
for building trust in a relationship and making people feel safe (Cvetkovich and 
Löfstedt, 1999). Self-disclosure also encourages the other person in the relation-
ship to disclose information, which builds further trust and rapport (Joinson and 
Paine, 2007; Reis and Shaver, 1988). Mutual disclosure (or disclosure reciprocity) 
increases attraction and can deepen intimacy in an existing relationship (Baumeister 
and Bratslavsky, 1999). A relationship with mutual self-disclosure tends to be 
happy, satisfied and enduring (Sprecher, 1987). 
People from similar backgrounds are also more likely to be attracted to one 
another (Watson, Klohnen, Casillas et al., 2004). In the study by Newcomb (1961) 
described earlier, men who were from similar demographic backgrounds (e.g., they 
were both from a rural area) were more likely to be friends. Also, findings show that 
people desire people of a similar level of attractiveness, and who are similar in other 
features such as wealth (Buston and Emlen, 2003). This basic effect of similarity is 
quite far-reaching. Findings in one study even showed that people were more 
attracted to others who had similar names to themselves, whose arbitrary experi-
mental code numbers resembled their own birthday numbers, and whose surnames

shared letters with their own surnames (Jones, Pelham, Carvallo and Mirenberg, 
2004). Going back to what we said earlier about the matching hypothesis, it really 
does seem to be the case that people like others who are similar to themselves on 
some dimension, and not just the dimension of physical attractiveness. 
But, what about the popular saying ‘opposites attract’? This is commonly 
portrayed in movies and on TV when seemingly polar opposites who think and 
behave completely differently pair off and walk away into the sunset. Does this 
really happen? Indeed, there are some interpersonal contexts in which complemen-
tarity leads to liking (e.g., Sadler and Woody, 2003). For example, in one study, 
Amodio and Showers (2005) found that when people wanted a stable, long-lasting 
relationship, similarity was important and people sought partners who were 
similar to themselves in key respects. However, when people were looking for a 
‘fling’, dissimilarity was more important. Perhaps the adventure of being with 
someone completely different to oneself provides excitement in a short-term, low 
commitment relationship. However, on the whole, social psychological research 
suggests that rather than ‘opposites attract’, ‘birds of a feather flock together’. 
When considering attitudes, values, intellect, ability and many minor preferences, 
similarity is a key predictor of attraction (Byrne, 1971). Of course, we may think 
of pairs who are ‘opposites’ in one important respect, but in general, these pairings 
are likely to be similar in many other fundamental respects. Similarity increases 
liking, and dissimilarity in attitudes, interests and preferences can lead to disliking 
and avoidance (Chen and Kenrick, 2002; Norton, Frost and Ariely, 2007; Singh 
and Ho, 2000; Tan and Singh, 1995). In particular, if people are dissimilar on key 
important attitudes and moral convictions, avoidance may be even stronger. You 
can probably think of many examples such as dislike for opposing political parties 
(Rosenbaum, 1986) or even people from different religious or ethnic backgrounds 
(Biernat, Vescio and Green, 1996). 
Like judgements of attractiveness, the effect of similarity on liking seems to be 
consistent across cultures. For example, Brewer (1968) interviewed an extensive 
sample of people from African tribal groups and found that perceived similarity 
was a strong determinant of attraction between tribes. People tended to avoid 
contact with other tribes whose attitudes were thought to be different, but when 
attitudes were perceived to be similar, it was possible to have close contact with 
the other tribe. 
Mutual liking 
A person’s attraction to another person is often determined by reciprocity. Does the 
other person like them too? This effect of mutual liking is also called the reciprocity 
principle. In general, we like people who like us and dislike people who dislike us. 
Dittes and Kelley (1956) demonstrated this effect in a now classic study. The 
researchers put student participants into small discussion groups and told them that 
their fellow group members either liked or disliked them. The students who thought 
that they were liked were more attracted to their group. Mutual liking can even 
overcome some important differences. In the previous section we discussed how

important similarity, especially similarity of attitudes, is in determining attraction. 
However, Gold, Ryckman and Mosley (1984) found that when a young woman 
expressed interest in male participants (by use of nonverbal cues such as attentive 
listening), she was liked more than when she expressed no interest – even when the 
male participants knew that she disagreed with them on central issues. The percep-
tion that a person likes us is therefore a significant determinant of our liking for 
them (Berscheid and Walster, 1987; Kenny and Nasby, 1980; Montoya and Insko, 
2008). Discovering that someone likes you may also awaken romantic feelings that 
might not ordinarily have been apparent (Berscheid and Walster, 1987). Again, this 
is another common feature in popular films. Best friends, having difficulties in their 
current relationships, suddenly realize that they have loved each other all along. The 
mutual liking they had for each other awakened their underlying attraction. 
However, it is not all good news. Eastwick, Finkel, Mochon and Ariely (2007) 
used a speed dating paradigm to study mutual liking. They found that people who 
were selective in their liking, that is, they did not like everyone, generally experi-
enced more reciprocal liking. However, those who were unselective, that is, they 
wanted to date everyone, were perceived as less desirable partners. Therefore, the 
belief that a discerning person thinks that one is special can facilitate liking, but a 
less discerning person inhibits liking. This suggests that who likes us might be as 
important as whether we are liked at all. You can probably remember a time when 
someone liked you and you simply did not like them back. Stambush and 
Mattingly (2010) showed that people’s self-esteem, mood and ratings of their own 
attractiveness can actually drop if they think that an unattractive person expressed 
interest in them. This effect was particularly marked for female participants. This 
reflects the complexity of mutual liking, and at this point, it is good to reflect back 
upon the ‘beauty is good’ stereotype we discussed earlier (Dion et al., 1972). It 
seems that attraction is influenced even by being liked by attractive others rather 
than those we find less appealing. 
Culture 
We have mentioned culture throughout this discussion and many of the findings 
discussed suggest that several aspects of attraction – in particular what is deemed 
physically attractive – are universal. In other words, there seems to be little varia-
tion across cultures in terms of what constitutes an attractive face. Also, there is a 
large set of personality traits that are, perhaps unsurprisingly, seen as universally 
attractive, such as friendliness, happiness and likeability (Wheeler and Kim, 1997). 
However, this is not to say that culture is irrelevant in determining who is 
attracted to whom. This is far from the truth. For example, Liu, Campbell and 
Condie (1995) found that heterosexuals of four different ethnic groups in the USA 
(African, Asian, Latino and European) preferred to date within their own group, 
despite all groups rating European Americans as either more attractive or of higher 
status than members of their own group. Cultural similarity is therefore important. 
Further, it is possible that other social factors, such as the approval of one’s family 
and friends, help determine who people are most attracted to. It is perhaps not

surprising that even in multicultural societies, people tend to form romantic rela-
tionships more with people from their own culture. Preference for one’s own culture 
when finding friends and partners tends to occur in the closest realms of society. 
Theories of attraction
Now we know something about the physical and psychological factors that deter-
mine attraction, we move on to theories of interpersonal attraction that attempt to 
link these factors together. There are two key theories of attraction. The first – 
social exchange theory – is based on an economic approach to human behaviour, 
arguing that relationship satisfaction depends on the ‘costs’ and ‘rewards’ of the 
relationship. The second – equity theory – follows a similar line of logic, arguing 
that relationship satisfaction depends on the extent to which the outcomes that 
people receive from a relationship are proportional to their contributions. The key 
difference between the two is that social exchange theory argues that in relation-
ships, people are after the most rewards for the least cost they have to put in. On 
the other hand, equity theory posits that people are not simply after rewards with 
little cost – they also need equity and fairness in relationships. We review these 
theories in turn. We also discuss less prominent theories of attraction arguing that 
attraction is based on reinforcement.
Social exchange theory
Generally speaking, it is rewarding to be in a relationship. For example, it is 
rewarding when someone validates our attitudes or shares our values. Also, it is nice 
to be liked by an attractive person who we like too. It follows that the more social 
rewards a person offers, the more we will be attracted to that person. On the other 
hand, if we perceive the costs as outweighing the benefits of being in a relationship 
with a person, then we will be less attracted to that person. In a way, this is like 
drawing up a mental ‘pros and cons’ list, which people often do when they make 
important life decisions. If the ‘pros’ outweigh the ‘cons’, the likelihood is that the 
relationship will be a success. If the opposite is the case, the relationship is less likely 
to succeed. You may remember friendships that were ‘more give than take’. This can 
be unsatisfying and jeopardize the chances of the relationship’s success. 
The basic idea that relationships work like economic exchange, much like a 
marketplace, has been expanded by psychologists and sociologists to form 
complex theories of social exchange that mainly deal with close relationships such 
as romantic relationships (e.g., Homans, 1961; Kelley and Thibaut, 1978; Thibaut 
and Kelley, 1959). Social exchange theory posits that people’s evaluation of such a 
relationship depends on their perception of:
1 the rewards they gain from the relationship
2 the costs they incur from the relationship
3 the relationship they deserve and the likelihood that they could have a better 
relationship with another person.
Social exchange theory 
How we feel about our 
relationships depends on our 
perception of the rewards we 
gain from the relationship 
and costs we incur. We also 
evaluate whether or not 
we could have a ‘better’ 
relationship. 

322
Relating
People are sensitive to the rewards and costs of their rela-
tionship. The relationship ‘marketplace’ is all about maxi-
mizing profits and minimizing losses, so we want to 
interact with people who offer the best profit. That is, 
people evaluate their relationship and judge whether or 
not this is the best they could have. Are they getting 
adequate reward for what they put in? Is there something 
better to compare it to? However, there is another person 
in the relationship, so there is an exchange of rewards and 
costs, as the name of the theory suggests. The other person 
in the relationship is also making their own cost–reward 
analysis of the relationship, which may be similar to – or 
completely different than – their partner’s. Thus, social 
exchange theory proposes that the outcomes for the two people in the relationship 
are jointly dependent on their actions. This kind of exchange occurs constantly in 
relationships and sometimes people do not even realize that social exchanges are 
being made. For example, we might put up with a partner’s bad habits (e.g., talking 
with their mouth full of food, leaving worn socks around the house – most defi-
nitely costs) because they are kind and loving (a benefit). Likewise, our partners 
may put up with our bad habits and awkward friends (costs) because we are 
incredibly good-looking, have a lot of money and have a good sense of humour 
(benefits). Thus, there are many different types of costs and rewards and many 
levels on which exchanges are made (Foa and Foa, 1975). Many are trivial and 
short-lived but some are exchanges that have long-term, important consequences. 
Whatever the exchange, we can think of the outcome of a relationship as being 
determined by a mathematical formula: outcomes = rewards – costs.
Relationship satisfaction also depends on one’s comparison level. Specifically, 
over the years, people have plenty of relationships with others, so they have come 
to expect certain costs and benefits of being in a relationship. From these expecta-
tions, people have an idea of what their future relationships will be like (Kelley 
and Thibaut, 1978; Thibaut and Kelley, 1959). Some people expect more rewards 
than costs from relationships, and if a relationship fails to meet their expected high 
standards, they will be disappointed. On the other hand, some people expect 
fewer rewards and more costs and they may be pleased with less rewarding rela-
tionship because at least it is what they expect. 
It is important to note that people may also have a comparison level for alterna-
tives. In other words, they may have the perception that they could be in a better 
relationship than the one they are currently in. This concern with alternatives – or 
the idea that there are indeed ‘plenty of fish in the sea’ – may mean that people 
leave relationships because they feel there is something better out there. On the 
other hand, people who expect that the alternatives could be worse than they 
already have, that is, they have a low comparison level for alternatives, may be 
more likely to stay in a costly relationship (Simpson, 1987). For such people, it 
may be a case of ‘better the devil you know’. It is also important to consider that

what is a cost for one person may not seem so costly to another. Further, what is 
seen as rewarding for one person may not be so rewarding to others. Social 
exchange theory therefore allows for quite a bit of variation in relationships.
Social exchange theory has gained much support in social psychological 
research. For example, Le and Agnew (2003) conducted a meta-analysis of over 50 
studies demonstrating that relationship breakdown is strongly related to a lack of 
commitment. Over time, relationship partners become interdependent (Rusbult 
and van Lange, 2003), fulfilling the needs of each other (Le and Agnew, 2003). 
Rewards, costs and comparison levels are crucial in determining relationship satis-
faction and commitment (Rusbult, Martz and Agnew, 1998).

this is a scale often used to measure relationship equity, which you will read about in the next section. 
Equity theory
Perhaps social exchange theory does not quite capture an essential factor in deter-
mining relationship success – the notion of equity or fairness. Equity theory posits 
that people are not simply after the most rewards and the least costs. They also 
need equity and fairness. In other words, the cost–reward ‘payoff’ should be 
approximately the same for both parties in the relationship (Adams, 1965; 
Hatfield, Walster and Berscheid, 1978). In a similar way to social exchange, equity 
can be seen as a mathematical formula (Adams, 1965). Equity exists when: (A’s 
rewards – costs) ÷ A’s inputs = (B’s rewards – costs) ÷ B’s inputs. When a relation-
ship is equitable, the party’s outcomes (rewards – costs) are roughly equal to the 
other person’s. In this respect, distributive justice (Homans, 1961) has been 
reached and outcomes are fair, based on what both parties have put in and what 
they have got out. 
According to equity theory, people are happiest in equal relationships. Equi-
table relationships are also the most stable. On the other hand, some relationships 
suffer an imbalance in the cost–reward ratio for each party. One person may take 
more than they give; the other may give more than they take. This can lead to 
tension and dissatisfaction. For example, Schafer and Keith (1980) surveyed a 
sample of married couples across a wide age range, taking note of those who felt

that their relationships were unfair (e.g., one spouse did not contribute enough to 
the cleaning or cooking). Findings revealed that people who perceived their rela-
tionships to be inequitable felt more unhappy and distressed. 
Underbenefited partners will seek to restore balance to the relationship so that 
they no longer feel like the relationship is too costly. Alternatively, they may 
attempt to restructure their perceptions of their own costs and rewards so that the 
ratios do not feel inequitable. If a balance cannot be reached, the relationship is 
less likely to succeed (Adams, 1965). However, perhaps surprisingly, overbenefited 
partners also typically seek to restore equity. Why do they do this? Social exchange 
theory is less able to describe why low-cost, high-gain partners also attempt to 
rebalance inequitable relationships. Instead, theorists explain this effect as a result 
of a powerful social norm prioritizing equity. Even the most profitable partners 
will eventually come to feel guilty for taking too much away from a relationship. 
Equity is a pervasive social norm and deviations from such norms, where situa-
tions are unfair, make everyone feel uncomfortable. Having said this, research 
shows that restoring equity is more of a concern for partners who benefit less 
from relationships (Buunk and Schaufeli, 1999; Sprecher, 2001; Sprecher and 
Schwartz, 1994; van Yperen and Buunk, 1990). Also, people may not always prefer 
an equity norm (Deutsch, 1975). Further, men prefer an equity norm more than 
women. Instead, women tend to prefer an equality norm, where everyone receives 
the same no matter what (Major and Adams, 1983; Major and Deaux, 1982), to an 
equity norm where outcomes are equal based on costs. It is important to note that 
people do not go about their daily business calculating what they have done for 
others and what they have received in return (Clark, 1986). In most close relation-
ships, people do not always keep score of their costs and rewards – this would be 
time-consuming and perhaps a bit sad – and, indeed, many relationships succeed 
with one selfless partner (Buunk and van Yperen, 1991). However, there is gener-
ally a strong norm of equity in close relationships. Another key norm in relation-
ships is the norm of reciprocity – to receive, we must also give.

Reinforcement and rewards
Other approaches propose that attraction is a result of direct reinforcement. As we 
mentioned earlier, we sometimes like people who are present when something 
good happens to us, even though they sometimes have no relation to the reward 
(Lott and Lott, 1972). In particular, instant reinforcement is powerful. For example, 
Lott, Aponte, Lott and McGinley (1969) found that children liked a person who 
they saw after immediately receiving a reward, rather than after a few seconds’ 
delay. In a variation of the reinforcement model, Byrne and Clore’s (1970) reinforce-
ment affect model posits that people can be liked (or disliked) depending on their 
association with positive (or negative) feelings. To illustrate this effect, Lewicki 
(1985) asked an experimenter to be unfriendly to a sample of participants. At the

end of the study, participants were asked to hand their responses to one of two 
experimenters: one who looked like the unfriendly experimenter and one who did 
not. Overwhelmingly, the participants chose the person who did not resemble the 
original unfriendly experimenter. In an opposite condition, the experimenter was 
friendly. In this case, the students chose the person who resembled the experi-
menter. In a more recent study, Berk and Andersen (2000) asked participants 
(perceivers) to interact with a naive target who either did or did not appear to 
resemble the perceiver’s own (positively or negatively regarded) significant other. 
Independent judges rated the positive affect expressed in the targets’ behaviours. It 
was found that the targets expressed more positive affective behaviours when they 
resembled the perceiver’s own positively valued significant other rather than when 
the significant other was negatively valued. This suggests that the positive feelings 
of the perceiver transferred to the naive target, suggesting a means by which present 
relationships may resemble past relationships. 
Further, Clore and Byrne (1974) argued that people associate others with 
features of the environment. If the features are positive, this evokes positive 
emotions and a positive response (liking) is likely to emerge. However, if the 
features are negative, this evokes negative emotions and a negative response 
(disliking) is more likely. This type of effect is sometimes called liking by associa-
tion, or the reward theory of attraction. 
Other experiments confirm that reinforcement is important in determining 
liking. For example, Griffitt (1970) asked students to evaluate a person while 
either sitting in a pleasant, comfortable room or an unpleasant, hot room. As 
above, people rated others more positively if they were in a pleasant environment 
(Maslow and Mintz, 1956). One message from these findings is that it is good for 
relationships to be associated with positive experiences such as romantic candlelit 
dinners and holidays (Hatfield and Walster, 1981). The findings also help explain 
why, in general, people are attracted to warm and trustworthy individuals 
(Fletcher, Simpson, Thomas and Giles, 1999; Wojciszke, Bazinska and Jaworski, 
1998). The rewards are rather pleasant. 
Love and romantic relationships
Thus far, our discussion has been about the factors that influence people’s attrac-
tion for each other. Much of this is related to liking. Although many people believe 
in ‘love at first sight’, many would argue that attraction is what immediately draws 
a person to another, or what makes them like the other person. In this section, we 
distinguish the process of attraction and liking from that of loving. Many would 
agree that loving someone is quite different to simply liking them. We may not be 
able to work out exactly how to express it, but we know that love is something 
more than liking and is not simply a matter of quality. Social psychologists have 
taken great strides in understanding what love is, and how close, loving relation-
ships work (e.g., Dion and Dion, 1988). Studying love is difficult. For example, it

is not possible to experimentally manipulate love in the laboratory, as it is to 
manipulate variables such as proximity and good looks. However, through survey 
and interview methods, social scientists are learning more about love. 
So, what is love? Is love really just a lot of liking? Is romantic love just a lot of 
liking, but with sexual attraction? Unsurprisingly, it is difficult to define love. 
Love is often seen as an inexplicable and magical thing and something that is diffi-
cult for people to articulate. Sometimes love is desperately passionate, giddy and 
overwhelming and sometimes love just makes us feel warm and contented. What 
is it? Are there different kinds of love? 
Researchers have distinguished liking as being different from loving. In partic-
ular, Rubin (1970) developed two questionnaires to measure what he argued to be 
two different constructs. He asked 198 undergraduate students to complete ques-
tions related to what he theorized to be about liking (e.g., ‘I feel that _____ is a 
very stable person’, ‘I have confidence in _____’s opinions’) and others that meas-
ured loving (e.g., ‘I feel strong feelings of possessiveness towards _____’, ‘I would 
do almost anything for _____’). Crucially, Rubin asked participants to complete 
the scale based on how they felt about their romantic partner and a good friend. 
The results showed that good friends scored highly on the liking scale, but only 
romantic partners rated highly on the items related to loving. Also, analyses of 
different kinds of love, such as familial and romantic love, have distinguished 
between two distinct types of love that entail a combination of emotions that 
occur in intimate relationships: passionate and companionate love (Fehr, 1994; 
Hatfield and Walster, 1981). We focus first on the differences between these two 
types of love, with a primary focus on romantic relationships because this is what 
most of the research is about.
Passionate and companionate love
The love that people have for their friends and family members is obviously 
different from the love that people have for a romantic partner. However, even 
within romantic relationships, love can appear and feel different. Think of your 
close friends and you will see examples of people passionately in love and 
completely absorbed with each other. On the other hand, if you consider many 
elderly people, such as your grandparents, the passionate, all-consuming love has 
typically given way to a calmer, more stable and secure kind of love. Although 
both are referred to as love, they are clearly different (Berscheid and Meyers, 1996; 
Fehr and Russell, 1991; Vohs and Baumeister, 2004). Psychologists call the first 
type ‘passionate love’ and the second ‘companionate love’ (Hatfield, 1987; Hatfield 
and Sprecher, 1986) (see Figure 7.7). 
Passionate love is the type of love that involves intense feelings, uncontrollable 
thoughts and deep longing for another person. Passionate love often involves 
physical arousal, a rapid beating heart and shortness of breath among other physi-
ological ‘symptoms’. You will be familiar with the notion of love as a ‘drug’ in 
songs, or a ‘bug’ that affects people and makes them do silly things. They are 
referring to what social psychologists call ‘passionate love’. In the presence of the 
Passionate love love 
characterized by intense 
emotional and physical 
feelings for another person.

Close relationships
object of affection, a person experiencing passionate love will feel happy and 
elated if the affection is reciprocated, but sad, desperate and jealous if the feelings 
are not returned (Fisher, 2004; Hatfield, 1987; Hatfield and Sprecher, 1986; Regan 
and Berscheid, 1999). Passionate love is the feeling of loving someone but also 
being ‘in love’ (Berscheid, 1994). Passionate love is heightened by physiological 
arousal. For example, physical exercise, watching horror films and going on scary 
rides increase our romantic responses to people we find attractive (Foster, Witcher, 
Campbell and Green, 1998). Aron, Fisher, Mashek et al. (2005) have found that 
passionate love involves a strong biological element. Specifically, being in love 
engages dopamine-rich areas of the brain that are generally associated with reward. 
There is also a lot of evidence demonstrating the role of the hormone oxytocin in 
love and desire (e.g., Carter, 1998; Diamond, 2003, 2004; Gonzaga, Turner, Keltner 
et al., 2006; Porges, 1998). Also, fMRI studies have shown that viewing pictures of 
romantic love activates parts of the brain’s reward system that coincide with areas 
rich in oxytocin and vasopressin receptors (Bartels and Zeki, 2004). These overlap 
with, but are also different to, the regions of the brain that are activated when 
mothers view pictures of their children. Both types of relationships (romantic and 
maternal) deactivated regions of the brain associated with negative emotions. 
On the other hand, companionate love involves deep, secure feelings that are not 
accompanied by the frenzied, passionate and physical feelings that are associated 
with passionate love (Hatfield, 1987). Theorists argue that this kind of love is 
common in relationships that once were passionate, such as marriages that last a 
long time. The partners may still be in a sexual relationship but without experi-
encing the level of intensity or ‘spark’ they once had (Argyle and Henderson, 
1985). Even in the closest, most loving relationships, the spark does not neces-
sarily last and some findings support this idea; for example, long-term married 
couples express affection much less than newlyweds (Hustin and Chorost, 1994). 
Romantic relationships that last seem to depend more on the secure, stable, loving 
feelings that people have towards one another rather than the intense feelings 
experienced during the fiery first stages of a relationship. Findings show that 
Companionate love love

companionate love activates different areas of the 
brain (Aron et al., 2005). Also, outside romantic 
relationships, companionate love is characteristic 
of non-sexual close friendships. The key charac-
teristic of companionate love is a deep caring and 
affection for the other person – the kind of love 
that makes us feel warm, happy and nurtured. 
Sternberg (1988) argued for a slightly more 
complex conceptualization of love based on 
three key factors: passion, intimacy and commit-
ment, and that the type of love can be mapped 
onto a triangle of these factors, as in Figure 7.8. 
Other research has distinguished even more 
specifically between several different kinds of 
love in romantic relationships (Hendrick and Hendrick, 1995). Six love styles 
were identified by Lee (1973, 1976), who referred to these love styles as ‘colours 
of love’ (see Table 7.1). Findings suggest that there are gender differences in who 
displays the different types of love, with men scoring higher on eros and ludus 
than women, who were more pragmatic, storgic and manic (Hendrick, Hendrick, 
Foote and Slapion-Foote, 1984). Findings also suggest that there are cross-cultural 
differences in attitudes related to love. In particular, the factors of pragma, storge 
and ludus, which arguably involve social rules and norms, are dependent on 
cultural influences, whereas the factors of mania, eros and agape, which arguably 
involve strong personal feelings, are relatively free of cultural influences (Neto, 
Deschamps, Barros et al., 2000).

Time to reflect think of the different types of love identified by Hendrick and Hendrick (1995) and lee (1973, 
1976). We know there are gender differences, in that men tend to score higher on ludus and eros than women. 
Complex cultural influences are also important. Can you think of any explanations why these differences might exist? 
What might an evolutionary social psychologist infer from these gender differences?

Romantic love and culture
As is the case for attraction, some aspects of love are fairly universal. For example, it 
seems that most cultures have a conception of passionate or romantic love, as indi-
cated by behaviours such as flirting and feelings such as physiological arousal, and 
the idea that love is a condition for marriage (Jankowiak and Fischer, 1992). 
However, cultures also differ on this dimension, as can be seen in the example of 
arranged marriages (see Figure 7.9). In such cases, love is not viewed as a precondi-
tion for marriage, instead, love is seen as something that grows once people are 
married (Dion and Dion, 1993). A study by Gupta and Singh (1982) demonstrates 
the difference in reported love over time between ‘love’ marriages and arranged 
marriages in an Indian sample. The researchers asked 50 couples to complete Rubin’s 
(1970) love scale, where they were asked to answer questions about their partner 
such as ‘I would do anything for _____’ (see earlier) and found that respondents 
who married for love reported decreased love over the years. On the other hand, 
respondents from arranged marriages reported increased love (see Figure 7.10).

Divorce rates differ across countries. For example, in August 2011, the USA 
had the highest divorce rate in the world (4.95 per 1,000 people), with the UK 
(3.08) and Australia (2.52) not far behind. On the other hand, in China, the divorce 
rate was only 0.79 per 1,000 people, it was 0.37 in Turkey and 0.15 in Sri Lanka 
(data from www.nationmaster.com). Some theorists argue that this is due to 
cultural differences in the focus on personal feelings versus the focus on the more 
practical aspects of a relationship. It may also relate to individualist versus collec-
tivist perspectives on obligations and duties. Specifically, US samples have been 
shown to focus on the former, while Asian cultures are generally more focused on 
the latter (Dion and Dion, 1988; Sprecher and Toro-Morn, 2002) and are less indi-
vidualistic (Dion and Dion, 1991), which may also be a factor in increasing 
Western divorce rates. 
Love and gender
There is some evidence to suggest that women and men experience passionate love 
differently. Perhaps surprisingly, men tend to fall in love more quickly than

women (Dion and Dion, 1985). Men are also less likely to initiate breakups. On 
the other hand, women are more likely to focus on emotional rather than physical 
intimacy and are typically more emotionally invested in a relationship than men 
(Hendrick and Hendrick, 1995). As we mentioned earlier, women and men also 
rate the experience of love quite differently, as evidenced by their different love 
styles. As we saw earlier in the Critical focus box, it seems that women and men 
even approach the basics of mate selection quite differently. According to popular 
thinking and some popular writers, men are from Mars and women are from 
Venus (Gray, 1992), but evidence suggests that this is overexaggerated and cultural 
differences in perceptions of romantic love are more powerful than gender differ-
ences within cultures (Sprecher and Toro-Morn, 2002). 
Attachment and bonding
As we discussed earlier, the need for affiliation is a fundamental human require-
ment for psychological wellbeing. Studies of social deprivation in infants provide 
some indication of the consequences of an unfulfilled need for affiliation. In a 
series of controversial studies in the 1950s and 60s, Harlow separated rhesus 
monkeys from their mothers and placed them in isolation chambers for a period 
of up to 24 months. Social isolation caused the monkeys both psychological and 
physiological stress, suggesting that early maternal contact is vital to wellbeing 
(Harlow, 1958; Harlow and Harlow, 1965). Similar effects occur in humans. For 
example, Bowlby (1969) observed the behaviours of infants and their mothers. 
When separated, infants would seek to be reunited with their mothers and would 
use a variety of behaviours (crying, smiling) to reunite with the mother, or other 
behaviours (e.g., clinging) to stay close to her. Bowlby argued that these attach-
ment behaviours are all indicators of the fundamental need to affiliate. Deprived of 
affiliation with others, children often become fearful, withdrawn and silent 
(Bowlby, 1980). Bowlby argued that intimate attachment to others is a necessary 
means of drawing strength and enjoyment from life. Further, Bowlby argued that 
attachment behaviours are not confined to child–carer interactions, but continue 
throughout the life span in different types of relationships. In other words, the 
nature of attachment in babies and children is similar to the attachments people 
display in later life with friends, family members and in romantic relationships. 
Theorists have argued that people’s relationship experiences later in life are 
determined by their experiences with parents or carers during childhood and 
infancy (e.g., Feeney and Noller, 1990; Hazan and Shaver, 1994; Shaver and Hazan, 
1993). That is, good and stable adult relationships are likely to be a consequence of 
early experiences, specifically with carers (Berscheid, 1994). Relationships between 
children and carers are important because these typically form the first contact 
with another person. Babies come into the world and immediately begin inter-
acting with others. Of course, there are differences in the ways that carers interact 
with their children and differences in infants’ own preferences for interaction. 
Attachment behaviours the 
behaviours an infant will 
exhibit to stay close to, or be 
reunited with, a primary carer.

331
Close relationships
These differences appear to have important implications for relationships with 
others – family relationships, friendships and romantic relationships alike – later 
in life. This research focuses on attachment styles (Ainsworth, Blehar, Waters and 
Wall, 1978; Bowlby, 1969, 1973, 1988). People can be classified as exhibiting one of 
three main attachment styles in their relationships.
To examine attachment styles, Mary Ainsworth (1973, 1979) set up a paradigm 
known as the strange situation. In the strange situation, a child is observed playing 
for 20 minutes while their carer leaves and re-enters the room. The rationale is that 
the situation varies in the extent to which it is stressful to the child and the child’s 
different ways of coping can be observed and used as an index of their attachment 
to their carers. The child experiences the following events:
1 The carer and infant enter the room. 
2 The carer and infant are alone. The carer does not participate but the infant 
explores the room. 
3 The stranger enters, talks to the carer, and then approaches the infant. The carer 
leaves inconspicuously. 
4 The carer and child are now separated. The stranger’s behaviour is geared to 
that of the infant. 
5 The carer re-enters the room. S/he greets and comforts the infant, then leaves again. 
6 The carer and child are therefore separated again. This time, the infant is left alone.
7 The separation episode continues. The stranger enters and gears their behaviour 
to that of the infant. 
8 The carer re-enters the room. S/he greets and picks up the infant. The stranger 
leaves inconspicuously. 
Four aspects of the child’s behaviour are observed:
1 The amount of exploration (e.g., playing with new toys) throughout the situation. 
2 The child’s reactions to the departure of their carer. 
3 The stranger anxiety (when the baby is alone with the stranger). 
4 The child’s reunion behaviour with their carer. 
Using this procedure, results reveal that somewhere between 55–70 per cent of 
infants (and adults) display a secure attachment style (Hazan and Shaver, 1987; Jones 
and Cunningham, 1996). Beginning in infancy, when placed in the strange situation, 
securely attached infants play with their carer and are happy to explore the environ-
ment. When the carer leaves, the child becomes distressed and is comforted when 
the carer returns. After the carer returns, the child begins to explore and play again 
(Ainsworth, 1973, 1979). This secure attachment style is characterized by trust, high 
self-esteem and a secure feeling of being loved (see Table 7.2). Theorists argue that 
this attachment style is the basis of secure adult relationships, characterized by 
commitment and trust. Specifically, during difficult times such as separation or 
conflict, the underlying trust helps maintain the relationship (Miller and Rempel, 
2004). Research also demonstrates that secure attachment leads to satisfying and 
enduring relationships (Collins and Read, 1990; Feeney and Noller, 1990).

Infants displaying an avoidant attachment style show little distress when being 
separated from a carer and also have little reaction to the carer returning to the 
room after separation. People exhibiting an avoidant attachment style in adult-
hood tend to avoid close relationships altogether or become involved in unhappy 
relationships. They are also less likely to be invested in relationships and are 
more likely to leave them. They are also likely to have more one night stands 
and sexual relationships without love (Tidwell, Reis and Shaver, 1996). In 
general, it appears that avoidant individuals have a less positive perception of 
others than of themselves. 
Finally, in the strange situation, an anxious/ambivalent infant will cling closely 
to the carer. When they leave the room and return, the infant may be indifferent or 
even hostile towards the carer. In adulthood, this attachment style is characterized 
by possessiveness, jealousy and a lack of trust. Anxious/ambivalent adults tend to 
become emotional and angry in conflicts (Cassidy, 2000; Feeney and Noller, 1990). 
In general, such people seek close relationships but are fearful they will eventually 
be rejected; that is, they have a positive perception of others but a rather negative 
view of themselves. 
There is some additional research to support the argument that infant–carer 
attachments are associated with the nature of attachments in adult relationships. 
For example, Rholes, Simpson and Blakel (1995) studied the relationship between 
a mother’s feelings towards her children and her 
own attachment style in her adult relationships. 
It was found that mothers who were avoidant in 
their close adult relationships were less close to 
their children than securely attached mothers. 
Further, studies show that secure individuals are 
often paired with other secure people (Feeney, 
1994), demonstrating that attachment styles 
during childhood do seem to have an influence 
on later relationships. Also, attachment seems to 
be a key feature of relationships across the life 
span. In particular, relationship quality is often 
determined by adult attachment style, with 
securely attached adults having better quality relationships and enjoyment of 
affection, compared to avoidant adults who have difficulty forming relationships, 
and anxious adults who fall in love easily but generally feel unhappy (Brennan and 
Shaver, 1995). It is important to note that attachment levels can change (Kirk-
patrick and Hazan, 1994), but that a secure attachment style provides the best 
hopes for relationship success. Hazan, Gur-Yaish and Campa (2004) argued that, 
in general, early attachment experiences shape the ways in which people think 
about relationships. Sensitive, trustworthy carers encourage a sense of trust in 
their offspring and this example helps mould the way people view their own rela-
tionships with others later in life.

Note: Collins and read’s (1990) adult attachment scale was designed to measure three components of attachment that underlie attachment styles. 
these are known as ‘comfort with closeness’, ‘comfort with dependency’, and ‘anxiety about being abandoned or rejected’. the scale was not designed 
to capture secure, avoidant and anxious/ambivalent attachment styles. nonetheless, since each item was taken from descriptions of these attachment 
styles as labelled here, the average of your responses will give an informative estimate of your secure, avoidant and anxious/ambivalent tendencies.

Other family relationships
So far, we have focused on how early experiences with a primary carer can influ-
ence romantic relationships later in life. In studies, this primary carer is typically 
the mother. However, some work suggests that interactions with other family 
members (e.g., fathers and grandparents) are also important in shaping future 
relationships (Lin and Harwood, 2003) and can compensate for shortcomings in 
the relationship with the primary carer (Clark, Konchanska and Ready, 2000). 
Relationships with siblings are also important (Dunn and McGuire, 1992). For 
example, some research suggests that having siblings makes children more liked 
by their peers in school, presumably because interacting with other children helps 
children understand the rules of social interaction (Kitzmann, Cohen and Lock-
wood, 2002). On the whole, siblings tend to get along well, especially if the parents 
also get along (McGuire, McHale and Updegraff, 1996). Siblings who relate well

Relating
to each other, especially those who share an even closer bond such as identical 
twins, are more likely to maintain a strong relationship through adolescence and 
into adulthood. However, if the relationship with the sibling is not so good, this 
may have consequences in later life. People judge their relationships with others 
compared to their sibling relationships, and the positive or negative feelings asso-
ciated with a sibling relationship are likely to influence interactions with others. 
For example, one study showed that school bullies are more likely to have had a 
negative relationship with a sibling or siblings (Bowers, Smith and Binney, 1994). 
Maintaining relationships
Relationships often go through rough patches and there are many factors that can 
influence relationship satisfaction. For example, many relationships experience 
conflict and married couples report an average of two to three arguments per 
month (McGonagle, Kessler and Schilling, 1992). How people handle conflict is a 
strong predictor of relationship satisfaction. Jealousy is a common problem in 
relationships because people are predisposed to be wary of any threats (e.g., Parrott 
and Smith, 1993). How do people keep their relationships strong in the face of 
trouble? How do people stay satisfied with their relationships? Research suggests 
that several factors are important. Perhaps the most important is commitment.
Commitment is defined as a person’s wish or intention to stay in a relationship. A 
person’s level of commitment to a relationship is primarily dependent on their 
attraction to the partner and the perceived negative consequences of exiting the 
relationship (Johnson, 1991). More specifically, Adams and Jones (1997) noted 
that there are three factors that motivate people to stay in a relationship. First, a 
person’s dedication to the partner is important. If they have a positive attraction to 
their partner and the relationship, they are more likely to be committed. Second, 
many factors make is costly to exit a relationship. For example, there may not be 
many attractive alternatives available. Third, the longer a relationship continues, 
the more likely people are to share friends, money and property – ties that are 
difficult to break (Kurdek, 1998). According to Rusbult’s investment model of 
commitment (Figure 7.11), people’s commitment to a relationship is not only 
predicted by the level of investment they feel they have put into the relationship, 
but also what they feel they would lose if they left the relationship.

Close relationships
However, a person’s values are also important. Specifically, the extent to which 
people have a moral commitment to the relationship influences their motivation 
to maintain the relationship (Adams and Jones, 1997). For example, religious 
values may encourage people not to leave a partner, or people may simply feel an 
obligation to keep a promise, especially in the case of marriage where a legal 
contract has been made. 
The higher the commitment, the more likely a couple will stay together (Adams 
and Jones, 1997). Commitment also predicts marital satisfaction and trust (Kurdek, 
2000; Wieselquist, Rusbult, Foster and Agnew, 1999). In turn, trust also predicts 
relationship success. As we mentioned earlier, an insecure attachment style is asso-
ciated with a lack of trust.
Other factors help maintain relationships. For example, forgiving a partner’s 
transgressions can keep a potentially difficult relationship going (McCullough, 
Worthington and Rachal, 1997) and provides an alternative to breaking up. Also, 
some research suggests that people use cognitive strategies to maintain relation-
ships. Specifically, when a relationship is less ideal, people can lower their expec-
tations to more closely match the benefits they gain from their partner (Fletcher, 
Simpson and Thomas, 2000). People can also think more about the positive 
aspects of their partner and less about their faults (Murray and Holmes, 1999). 
Another alternative is to directly act upon the partner to make them a closer 
match to the ideal. Specifically, Overall, Fletcher and Simpson (2006) argued that 
people can engage in partner regulation, where they actively attempt to change the 
partner to be closer to what they would like. For example, if a partner is not 
living up to one’s expectations in terms of their earnings, one way might be to 
suggest that they go back to university and train to get a better job. Overall, 
Fletcher, Simpson and Sibley (2009) examined the success of different communi-
cation strategies that partners used when trying to produce changes in each other. 
Partners were videoed while trying to bring about changes in the partner and 
were later asked about the success of their attempts, both immediately and at 
three-month intervals in the following year. Results revealed that direct strategies 
(positive and negative) were not perceived as immediately successful but predicted 
increased change over the following 12 months. On the other hand, indirect 
strategies (especially those that were positive) were immediately rated as 
successful but did not predict later change. In summary, people can attempt to 
mould their partner to be what they want them to be and some communication 
strategies can be more effective than others. 
Time to reflect knowing what you know about similarity, attraction and relationship success, what do you 
think might be the advantages and pitfalls of trying to ‘mould’ a relationship partner to make them who you want 
them to be?

Same-sex relationships: ‘the love that dare

you may be 
wondering what 
social psychologists 
have to say about 
homosexual 
relationships. Do 
they differ from 
heterosexual 
relationships in any 
way? to date, there 
is little research 
concerning how 
gay and lesbian 
relationships form, 
are maintained and how they break up. Of course, this 
has much to do with the social stigma that has historically 
been associated with homosexual relationships. after all, 
until relatively recently in human history, homosexuality 
was illegal. But as society is changing and homosexual 
relationships are legally recognized in many countries, 
more researchers are studying homosexual relationships. 
For example, Peplau and Fingerhut (2007) reviewed the 
current empirical work on same-sex couples in the usa. 
they found many similarities between homosexual and 
heterosexual relationships, but also some differences.
What is similar between gay and straight relationships? 
• Both value affection, dependability, shared interests 
and similarity of religious beliefs.
• relationship satisfaction is largely driven by similarity 
in backgrounds, attitudes and values.
• For men, physical attractiveness is of key importance, 
whereas women place more emphasis on personality.
• relationships commonly form through proximity and 
familiarity (e.g., knowing friends or being in the same 
neighbourhood). 
• the internet is a key tool for establishing new 
relationships.
• High emphasis on equity within the relationship.
• Commitment is a strong predictor of relationship 
success.
What is different?
• lesbian relationships are more likely to originate from 
pre-existing friendships.
• gay and lesbian couples are more likely to stay friends 
after relationship breakup.
• Division of labour within the household is more 
equitable.
• Controlling for demographic variables, homosexual 
relationships are more likely to break up.

When relationships end
Not all relationships stand the test of time. In 2010, there were 119,589 recorded 
divorces in England and Wales (ONS, 2010). The consequences of relationship 
breakdown can be alarming, even for people who are not part of the relationship. 
For example, Tucker, Friedman, Schwartz et al. (1997) found that adults who had 
experienced their parents breaking up were more likely to be involved in marital 
breakups themselves. In Figure 7.12, you will see the reasons people cite on their 
divorce papers. Most people report that ‘falling out of love’ is the key reason for 

337
Close relationships
the breakup. How do things go so wrong that people choose to end their relation-
ships? In this section, we discuss the process of relationship breakdown, again 
with a specific focus on romantic relationships. 
Factors influencing relationship breakdown
People who enter into relationships with the view that the relationship should be 
long-lasting tend to have more satisfying and enduring relationships (Arriaga and 
Agnew, 2001). Further, feelings of obligation to a relationship, as well as a lack of 
consideration of alternatives, can keep a relationship together (Adams and Jones, 
1997). This may also be influenced by culture, as norms of obligation and commit-
ment differ across individualist and collectivist societies. As we saw earlier, divorce 
rates differ significantly across countries and there seems to be a general trend for 
high divorce rates within individualist cultures and lower rates in collectivist 
cultures (Triandis, 1994). Perhaps individualists tend to expect relationships to 
provide more fulfillment for the self, including passion, which exists to a lesser 
extent in collectivist cultures where the focus is more on the concerns of others 
(Dion and Dion, 1993). 
Relationships also tend to last longer if the individuals share similar back-
grounds and experiences. For example, couples of a similar education level, age 
and religious commitment are more likely to stay together (Fergusson, Horwood 
and Shannon, 1984). If factors such as these are absent, relationships have a lower 
likelihood of success. Another important factor seems to be the extent to which 
partners are similar in terms of their love attitudes, disclosure, investment, 
commitment and relationship satisfaction (Hendrick, Hendrick and Adler, 1988). 
This is not to say that relationships are doomed if people do not have these 
specific factors in common. However, from other research discussed in this 
chapter, we know that similarity and common experiences are important. They 
are important for attraction in the first place, and they are also important for 
relationship survival. 
Felmlee, Sprecher and Bassin (1990) demonstrated a range of factors associated 
with relationship breakdown, such as comparison level for alternatives, the 
Business problems

amount of time spent together, dissimilarity in race, support from partners’ social 
network, and duration of the relationship. Again, similarity in many ways is 
important to relationship survival. However, factors related to social exchange can 
also influence people’s decision to terminate or remain within a relationship. This 
was also demonstrated in a study by Rusbult (1983), who showed that relation-
ship satisfaction and the level of investment in a relationship significantly predicted 
how committed a person felt to their relationship and the decision to break up (see 
Figure 7.13). You will notice that comparison level for alternatives was the stron-
gest factor in the decision to break up, whereas both satisfaction and investment 
predicted relationship commitment.

In general, research suggests that people are likely to feel that a relationship is 
coming to an end if there is a lack of commitment to the relationship (Levinger, 
1980). Also, people may begin to consider alternative partners (Arriaga and 
Agnew, 2001) and expect that the relationship is going to fail. 
How do people end relationships?
Once a decision has been made that a relationship is ending, people can choose to 
react in several different ways. For example, Rusbult and Zembrodt (1983) argued 
that people can react actively or passively to the crisis. In other words, they can 
either work at improving the relationship and remain loyal to their partner 
(constructive) or choose to end it (destructive). Alternatively, they can wait for 
the relationship to improve (constructive) or simply ignore the situation and 
hope that things will get better (destructive) (see also the additional work of 
Rusbult, Johnson and Morrow, 1986; Rusbult, Morrow and Johnson, 1987; 
Rusbult et al., 1998, 2001). 
If a person chooses to actively detach from the relationship, this is not an easy 
process. Severing ties with a close other takes time, and even removing emotional 
factors from the equation, there are many practical factors to consider, such as

children, property and other binding factors. Some theorists (e.g., Baxter, 1984; 
Duck, 1998; Hazan and Shaver, 1994; Rollie and Duck, 2006), argue that the 
process of detachment from a long-term relationship follows a series of stages, 
including the following types of events:
 o An individual thinks about the problems in the relationship. They hope to 
repair the relationship and often seek advice from others about how to do so. 
The focus is largely on the partner’s behaviour and an evaluation of their 
‘performance’ in the relationship. The pros and cons of staying in the relation-
ship are considered. 
 o The two parties discuss their differences and potentially argue about who is 
responsible for the differences. They negotiate with each other and consider 
breaking up or reconciliation. At this stage, it is possible for the partners to talk 
through their problems and repair the relationship. If only one person wishes 
to end the relationship, they can differ in their strategy (compassionate vs. non-
compassionate) to do so (Sprecher, Zimmerman and Abrahams, 2010; see also 
Fehr and Sprecher, 2009). 
 o If the two parties are not able to solve their problems, they acknowledge that 
the relationship is coming to an end. Each party seeks social support and vali-
dation of their position. Each party tries to save ‘face’ to others.
 o The two parties separate and perform the functional aspects of the breakup 
including dividing property and agreeing custody arrangements. Social support 
is again important, as well as presenting a positive ‘face’ to others. The two 
parties attempt to ‘get over’ each other, return to normal life and gain a renewed 
sense of self, ready for new relationships.
In general, the process of relationship breakup is fraught and, depending on the 
length of the relationship and the level of intimacy involved, can cause a great deal 
of pain and sadness, distress and trouble with coping (Fine and Harvey, 2006; 
Orbuch, 1992; Simpson, 1987; Sprecher and Fehr, 1998; Vangelisti and Perlman, 
2006). Feelings of guilt can be powerful for people who leave relationships 
(Baumeister and Wotman, 1992). However, for many people, the benefits of 
leaving a relationship outweigh the costs and so divorce rates remain high. If a 
relationship is characterized by disagreement, criticism and conflict, then people 
are unhappy and, perhaps unsurprisingly, they are also more likely to break up 
(Noller and Fitzpatrick, 1990). Successful relationships are less likely to be charac-
terized by these types of destructive behaviours within relationships (Notarius 
and Markman, 1993; Yovetich and Rusbult, 1994). This is not to say that successful 
couples do not fight – they do – but there is evidence to suggest that successful 
couples are able to reconcile their differences and find a balance between conflict 
and affection (Gottman, 1998).

Student samples in relationships research
many studies of relationship breakup, as well as other 
aspects of close relationships, have been conducted with 
university students as participants. this is a practical 
choice for the most part – students in many institutions 
are required to participate in research to earn credit for 
their course, and this presents an easy source of 
participants for researchers. 
In many cases of social psychological research, student 
samples are appropriate. For example, there is no reason 
to believe that basic social cognitive processes like many 
of those we discussed in Chapter 3 would vary between 
people of different ages or levels of education. However, 
the choice of sample may be important in other aspects of 
social psychology. In the questions below, we would like 
you to consider the study of close relationships and 
whether (and when) student participation is appropriate. 
as a researcher, it is important to consider the research 
question being asked and the type of study being 
conducted. When reflecting on the suitability of a sample, 
and especially when criticizing a study or area of research 
based on choice of sample, it is important to go beyond 
the criticism that ‘this sample was not representative of 
society’. It is important to be clear about why it is not 
representative, how the sample may differ systematically 
from the population as a whole, and specifically, how 
results may have been affected. 
Questions
1 Do you think that relying on student samples to study 
relationship phenomena is a problem?
2 Can you find any evidence that undergraduates’ and 
non-students’ relationships are different? If so, in what 
ways are they different? 
3 How might any differences influence the study of 
relationships?
4 On balance, are students a suitable sample to study 
relationships? Why/why not? this final question is 
something you can ask in most chapters of this 
textbook and will help you understand more about 
sampling in social psychology. 
In this chapter, we have focused on the physical and 
psychological determinants of attraction and have outlined the 
major theories of attraction. We have outlined what social 
psychologists know about love and romantic relationships and 
their link to attachment processes in childhood. We have 
discussed how people maintain relationships and, finally, how 
people end relationships. you will now know that:
Exploring further sprecher et al. (2010) demonstrated that people differ in their choice of strategy to end 
romantic relationships. some strategies are compassionate (e.g., honestly conveying one’s wishes to a partner, 
finding time to talk face to face) and some are less so (e.g., asking a third party to break the news, breaking up via 
text or email). Of course, this depends on the length of the relationship and various other factors, but take some time 
to reflect on the different consequences of using these diverse strategies to end relationships. Do you think women 
and men might choose different strategies? Find a copy of sprecher et al.’s paper to find out more.

school? How might he be able to overcome the discrepancy 
in physical attractiveness?
2 kay and leigh live on different continents. they met one day

3 leila feels that her husband takes more than he gives, and 
that she does all the hard work to make their marriage a

situation to? What are the likely consequences of this 
relationship imbalance?
4 Once deeply in love, Jenna and kate now argue constantly 
and both feel that their relationship is over. What factors will 
determine where they go from here?
Having read this chapter, these questions could also be framed 
as the following essay questions, which you can attempt in 
preparation for your examinations:
1 Outline the factors that influence attraction and discuss, with 
reference to social psychological research, the factors that 
influence the likelihood of a person entering a relationship 
with a more attractive individual.
• the most important factor in determining judgements of 
attractiveness is a person’s physical appearance.
• there is strong consensus both within and between cultures 
about what features are attractive.
• One key mechanism that determines attraction is called the 
matching phenomenon – people tend to be attracted to 
others who are about the same level of physical 
attractiveness as themselves. However, less attractive 
individuals can compensate by making themselves 
attractive in other areas.
• In addition to good looks, people are attracted to others 
who are familiar, or those who are close by. Proximity is 
effective because we tend to like things that are familiar to 
us. repeated (positive) exposure to another person is likely 
to lead to more favourable evaluations. this is called the 
mere exposure effect.
• attraction is also determined by psychological factors, key to 
which is the need to affiliate – the motive to seek and 
maintain interpersonal relationships with others.
• attraction to others is also influenced by emotions.
• attraction is also influenced by similarity of attitudes, 
interests and values. People who are similar in personality, 
interpersonal skills and communication style are also more 
likely to be attracted to one another.
• People from similar social backgrounds are more likely to be 
attracted to one another.
• a person’s attraction to another person is also determined 
by reciprocity – does the other person like them too?
• social exchange theory argues that the more social rewards 
a person offers, the more we will be attracted to that person. 
People weigh up the rewards and costs to determine 
whether to enter into a relationship. they also consider their 
relationship alternatives.
• Equity theory proposes that people are not simply after the 
most rewards and the least costs. they also need equity and 
fairness so that the cost–reward payoff is the same for both 
parties in the relationship.
• Other approaches propose that attraction is a result of direct 
reinforcement or reward. 
• Passionate love is the type of love that involves intense 
feelings, uncontrollable thoughts and deep longing for 
another person. there are physiological ‘symptoms’ to 
passionate love.
• Consummate love involves deep, secure feelings that are 
not accompanied with the physiological arousal of 
passionate love.
• People’s experiences of love and relationships in later life 
are determined by their attachment experiences with 
parents or carers in childhood and infancy. 
• maintenance of relationships is largely driven by the level of 
commitment – a person’s wish or intention to stay in the 
relationship. the higher the commitment, the more likely a 
couple will stay together. similarity and common 
experiences are also important. 
• the process of ending a relationship is said to progress 
through a series of stages and is determined by a variety of 
factors, such as the length of the relationship and the level 
of intimacy involved.
In this chapter, we have focused on the close, intimate 
relationships that are formed between individuals. In Chapter 8, 
we turn our focus to the broader relationships and 
commitments that people make to their groups.

Abusive relationships
We have spent little time on the ‘dark side’ of close 
relationships in this chapter. But relationships can go 
disastrously wrong. For most people, relationships are a source 
of love, support and strength, but for all too many, they are 
primarily a venue of danger, abuse and dominance. What does 
social psychology have to say about why relationships become 
abusive, and how the problem of abuse and violence within 
close relationships might be addressed? to think about these 
questions, it is necessary to read beyond just this chapter, and to 
tie together different strands of social psychology. In answering 
these questions, keep an eye out for material in other chapters. 
1 What causes some people to be abusive in relationships? 
(Hint: check out the chapters on aggression, intergroup 
relations and justice.)
2 Why do so many people who find themselves being abused 
fail to leave the relationship?
3 apart from physical or sexual violence, what other, more 
subtle forms might abuse within close relationships take? 
4 Do you think that self-verification theory (Chapter 2) may 
play a role in intergenerational cycles of violence? Consider 
why people who were raised in the context of abusive 
relationships between parents may be more likely to find 
themselves abused in relationships as an adult.

Blind spot in social psychology 
The politics of sexual variety
In the Critical focus box in this chapter (see also the student 
project below), we encountered the research of schmitt et al. 
(2003), who investigated worldwide gender differences in 
sexual preferences. their key finding was that men, compared 
to women, report wanting more sexual partners, requiring 
less time to know a person before being prepared to have sex 
with them, and more actively pursuing short-term mating 
opportunities.  
schmitt et al. (2003) interpret their findings as evidence for 
sexual strategies theory – over millennia, men and women 
have evolved different mating strategies. However, as we have 
seen, others have suggested different interpretations of such 
results (e.g., Eagly and Wood, 1999). these alternative 
interpretations often surround the gender roles and norms that 
have developed among human cultures.
One variable that could be associated with sexual preference 
is political conservatism (recall the social psychology in real life 
box in Chapter 4). Politically conservative people tend to have 
more traditional preferences for long-term partners. 
Conservative, rather than left-wing, women are more likely to 
desire high status men, for example, whereas liberal, rather 
than right-wing, men are more likely to desire younger, 
attractive but not necessarily high status women. Heterosexual 
couples comprising an older, higher status man and a younger 
woman symbolize traditional gender ideals associated with 
political conservatism (see Doosje, rojahn and Fischer, 1999; 
Johannesen-schmidt and Eagly, 2002).
What about the number of partners desired? One could 
argue that the well-known sexual double standard, by which 
promiscuity is more acceptable among men than women, is 
associated with traditional views of gender, in which chastity 
and sexual prudence are valued more among women than 
men. thus, men who report wanting several partners and 
women who want fewer partners may, to some extent, be 
playing out the traditional status quo and, in so doing, 
reaffirming a conservative worldview.  
1 Propose a study to test whether conservatism is indeed 
associated with the traditional sexual double standard, 
whereby sexual promiscuity is perceived to be more 
acceptable for men than it is for women. Outline it in 300 
words or so. How would you measure (or manipulate) 
political conservatism? How would you measure the 
perceived acceptability of promiscuity for men and women?
2 Propose a second study to test whether the gender 
differences in the desire for sexual variety observed by 
schmitt et al. (2003) are moderated by political orientation. 
In particular, is the gender difference larger among 
conservatives than liberals? If findings showed that political 
orientation was indeed shown to be associated with the 
gender gap in the desire for sexual variety, what would this 
mean for schmitt et al.’s (2003) evolutionary ‘sexual 
strategies theory’? Would this theory be falsified? 
Student project 
Attachment style, disclosure and relationship 
quality 
rosabel tan studied as an 
honours year student at the 
university of auckland, 
supervised by Dr nickola 
Overall. Her research on 
attachment style, relationship 
quality, and communication 
between intimate partners 
touches on many of the issues 
we considered in this chapter.
My topic and aims
my research examined the links between attachment style, 
disclosure during ‘normal’ or routine discussions in 
relationships, and relationship quality over time. 
my interest in attachment theory was sparked when we 
covered it at undergraduate level. I had a lot of fun secretly 
analysing my friends’ (and my own) relationships. In the 
summer before my final year, I completed a studentship with Dr 
nickola Overall, which involved coding video-recorded 
interactions of couples discussing everyday events over their 
past week. these discussions were the warm-up exercise for a 
series of interactions examining conflict and support behaviour. 

344
Relating
nearly all prior research examining the impact of attachment 
insecurity focused on the destructive behaviours enacted by 
people during threatening relationship events, such as hostility 
or withdrawal during conflict. We hypothesized that attachment 
anxiety and avoidance would also influence the way people 
related and disclosed during more routine interactions. We 
thought that how couples behaved in ‘normal’ interactions 
would be just as important as how people resolve conflict, and 
would shape relationship quality over time.
My methods
my project was part of a larger study involving observational 
and longitudinal data. Couples completed questionnaires 
assessing attachment anxiety and avoidance and relationship 
quality, and took part in a series of videotaped discussions. they 
also reported their relationship quality one year later.
I coded the warm-up exercise where couples discussed 
recent events. this was done with another student to ensure 
our coding was reliable. We rated (a) the degree to which 
people disclosed to their partners, (b) how intimate these 
disclosures were, and (c) whether their discussions were self-
focused or relationship-focused. this built on prior research 
conducted by Bradford, Feeney and Campbell (2002) that 
examined the links between attachment insecurity and these 
two types of disclosure as assessed using self-report measures. 
We also coded general behaviours, like how warm and 
responsive partners were.
My findings and their implications
I made predictions based on attachment theory – for instance, 
because highly anxious people are driven by a desire to create 
and maintain high levels of intimacy, I expected them to talk to 
their partner more about themselves and their relationship.  
I also expected this would have a positive impact on 
relationships one year later, since disclosure has been found to 
increase intimacy and commitment. I expected attachment 
avoidance to predict the opposite since avoidant people are 
motivated to maintain their autonomy and independence. 
the predictions were partially supported. First, more 
anxious people engaged in more relationship-focused 
disclosure, and this type of disclosure was associated with 
better quality relationships over time. this is interesting 
because prior research has focused mostly on the destructive 
behaviours that result from anxious attachment, and here we 
found a positive effect.
second, avoidant people were less likely to disclose about 
their relationship, and they experienced declines in relationship 
quality over time. this suggests that one of the reasons 
avoidance is associated with less stable relationships is because 
avoidant people are generally less involved in their relationships.
these patterns show that talking about your relationship 
during routine interactions plays an important role in 
maintaining your relationship. therefore, relationship research 
shouldn’t just focus on the tough interactions, like conflict 
resolution, but pay attention to how couples are talking to each 
other day to day.
My journey
my work was accepted in 2011 for publication and published in 
2012 (tan, Overall and taylor, 2012).
after my honours year I went on to do two masters degrees – 
one in psychology at the university of auckland, focusing on the 
psychological benefits of reading fiction, and the other in 
creative writing at the International Institute of modern letters, 
where I wrote a collection of short stories. 
afterwards, I was offered a two-year contract at the liggins 
Institute as a research assistant within their education network, 
which is where I am now. It’s a great job with a lot of variety, 
which is ideal for someone like me with such different interests.
I found honours to be a steep learning curve. For the first time 
in my academic life I found myself struggling with the workload, 
and as a result I had to figure out how to manage it all. I’d never 
worked on a big project before, so I had to break down this huge 
task into smaller tasks to ensure I stayed on track – and this was 
a huge help in my masters and for life in general. 
I also learned a number of valuable research skills during my 
project – from coding observational data to using structural 
equation modelling to writing everything up in journal article 
format. these are all skills that I’ve been able to apply in my 
current career, where I’m designing and executing studies in a 
completely different field.
My advice
Don’t expect to change the world with your first research 
project – the value of this project lies in developing skills that 
are essential for a researcher and which you might not have had 
the opportunity to develop before. keep your focus small. you 
don’t have much time to do it and you need to be realistic about 
what you can achieve in that time. make the most of it – ask 
questions, be proactive in learning the skills you need to learn, 
and manage your time well. make sure you’re doing something 
you’re genuinely interested in – otherwise it won’t be a fun 
ride. Be prepared for disappointment. If your findings aren’t in 
line with your hypotheses, don’t despair – this is a natural part 
of research and the important thing at this point is to learn from 
it. Back up your work regularly.

Belonging
Groups are a central part of human existence. We are members of a wide variety 
of groups in almost every facet of life, from our daily work (e.g., project teams, 
research groups) to our social lives (e.g., peer groups, sports clubs) and our 
personal lives (e.g., the family unit). Our groups define who we are. We often 
refer to ourselves in terms of our group memberships, such as ‘I am a woman’, ‘I 
am Chinese’ or ‘I am a member of the hockey club’, so that when we think about 
ourselves, we think about the social groups that come together to make us who 
we are. But groups not only define who we are, they also influence how we live. 
The groups we belong to determine some of the most basic aspects of our lives, 
such as our attitudes and beliefs, our cultural practices and the language we use to 
talk to one another. Our groups can also determine where we live and who we 
know. Groups influence what we do in specific situations too. As we will see 
throughout Part 3, groups can influence our behaviour in a variety of ways, both 
good and bad. Even the groups we are not part of can influence what we do. In 
general, it appears that groups have a strong power over us and we cannot func-
tion properly without them. 
But why is this the case? Why do people need groups? In this chapter, we will 
explain why group membership is important to humans as social beings. We will 
examine how and why groups form, what groups mean to individuals’ sense of 
their own identity and feelings of self worth, how the norms or ‘rules’ of group 
behaviour develop, and what happens when people violate these rules. Finally, we 
will turn to the often distressing processes of group breakup or division, and how 
being left out of, or rejected from, groups can be painful, psychologically and 
physically. In short, we will explain why people cannot live without groups. 
What is a group?
‘What is a group?’ may seem to be a simple question, but it is more complex than 
you think. Groups are so diverse that we need to have ways of describing how they 
differ, as well as a core definition that can encompass groups of all types. Among 
many other dimensions of groups, researchers have differentiated between them 
according to whether they are big or small, structured or unstructured, specific and 
general, physically close or scattered (Deaux, Reid, Mizrahi and Ethier, 1995). For 
example, it is easy to differentiate between groups that are big (e.g., religious groups) 
and small (e.g., families). Although such groups may share features in common – for 
example, a family group may share the same religion – they are easily distinguish-
able because of their sheer size. In a similar way, an online self-help group for people 
who wish to lose weight can be distinguished from a weight loss group that meets at 
the local village hall every week – this difference relates to physical proximity. You 
can probably think of many dimensions on which groups can differ. 
Groups are also distinguished in terms of their entitativity – the degree to which 
they appear to be a distinct unit that is bound together in some way (Campbell, 
1958; Castano, Yzerbyt, Paladino and Sacchi, 2002; Gaertner and Schopler, 1998;

The social group
Hamilton and Sherman, 1996; Hamilton, Sherman and Lickel, 1998). Groups that 
are highly entitative tend to be homogeneous, with a clear structure, purpose or 
boundaries, whereas groups that are less entitative tend to be more heterogeneous 
and unstructured. Lickel, Hamilton, Wieczorkowska et al. (2000) argued that 
entitativity is highest for intimacy groups, such as family groups, and lower for task 
groups, such as those brought together temporarily to achieve a particular goal. 
Lickel et al. also argued that groups are less entitative if they are simply deter-
mined by social category memberships, such as religions, or if they are transitory, 
such as a group of people waiting for a train. 
There are other ways to distinguish groups. For example, some social psychol-
ogists separate groups into those based on groupings of similarity between 
members, and those that are interaction based (e.g., Arrow, McGrath and Berdahl, 
2000; McGrath, Arrow and Berdahl, 2000). Others categorize groups as either 
common bond groups, which depend on attachment among group members, or 
common identity groups, which depend on members’ direct attachment to the 
group itself (Postmes and Spears, 2000; Prentice, Miller and Lightdale, 1994; 
Sassenberg, 2002). Any social group can be described by a variety of features that 
define it and set it apart from other groups. But what are the common features 
that define groups? To understand groups and group life, we first need to under-
stand what a group is. We know what makes groups different from each other, 
but what makes them the same thing? What are the typical characteristics of 
groups? Can we isolate particular qualities that are common to all groups? This is 
not a straightforward task.

At face value, the question ‘What is a group?’ looks simple. After all, everyone 
can think of many examples of groups they belong to and can describe them very 
well. We think we know what groups are. However, it is difficult to define what a 
group is. Specifically, it is not easy to tease apart the common features of groups 
that separate them from collectives that look like groups but in fact are not. 
Indeed, you may find that what you consider to be a group does not fit with a 
social psychological definition of a group (see Figure 8.1). For example, are 
students in a lecture theatre a group? Is a pair of jogging partners a group? Do all 
people who have blonde hair qualify as a group? Most social psychologists would 
say not. These examples would perhaps be better classified as instances of collec-
tives or aggregates but not groups. This is because they are not related, psychologi-
cally, in any particular way. They have things in common but there is nothing 
uniquely psychological that binds them together. For example, they may simply 
be in the same place at the same time, doing similar things. They may share a 
physical characteristic that makes them look different to others who do not have 
that characteristic. They are collectives without necessarily being groups. Even so,

it is often difficult to define what distinguishes such collectives 
from groups themselves and thus one clear definition of a group 
is difficult to find.
According to some theorists, group members must feel that 
they have a common fate (Lewin, 1948; Campbell, 1958; Rabbie 
and Horwitz, 1988). Using this definition, Jewish people in 
Nazi Germany would be considered a group because they 
shared the same tragic fate of stigmatization and genocide – so 
long as they felt that their likely fate as individuals was shared 
by other group members (Brown, 2000). For other social 
psychologists, groups must have a defined and accepted social 
structure consisting of status hierarchies and social roles (e.g., 
Sherif and Sherif, 1969). A company with a CEO, managers and workers is a good 
example of this. However, for others, groups must interact face to face to qualify 
as groups (e.g., Bales, 1950). Johnson and Johnson (1987, p. 8) provided a defini-
tion encompassing these features and thus produced an account of what many 
social psychologists would agree makes up a group:
two or more individuals in face-to-face interaction, each aware of his or her 
membership in the group, each aware of the others who belong to the group, 
and each aware of their positive interdependence as they strive to achieve 
mutual goals. 
According to this perspective, groups possess several key features. In particular, 
group members are said to be interdependent, follow norms or rules of behaviour, 
and typically join together to meet a common objective. This makes good sense 
for the small groups we are used to in everyday life, such as work teams, families 
and friendship groups. However, the utility of this kind of definition is signifi-
cantly compromised when we consider large groups. We mentioned the example 
of Jewish people in Nazi Germany as a group, but using the definition above they 
would not qualify as a group. They do not all interact face to face for a start. Many 
large groups such as gender, religious, social class and ethnic groups do not interact 
face to face. Nor do they necessarily have a joint need or goal. But are they still 
groups? Do people need these features to feel part of a group? Many social 
psychologists argue that they do not. Indeed, as we will see in Chapters 9–12, 
larger group memberships can influence people’s behaviours as much, if not more 
than the smallest, most powerful, face-to-face group. People do not even need to 
be in the presence of other members of the group to be influenced by it – the 
group still strongly defines who the person is, how they live, who they associate 
with and what they do. Thus, even the most accepted definitions of group 
membership are limited. 
This issue has led some theorists to propose a more general definition of the 
group to include larger groups. According to Turner (1982, p. 15), a group exists 
when: ‘two or more individuals … perceive themselves to be members of the same 
social category’. The key to this definition, then, is the extent to which people

identify with groups. This concept is at the heart of social identity theory (Tajfel 
and Turner, 1986), to which we shall return later in this chapter (also see Chapter 
11). The utility of this definition lies in its inclusiveness. Indeed, it is difficult to 
think of a group whose members, at least at some point in time, have not classified 
themselves as belonging to the group. Nevertheless, Brown (2000) thinks that the 
inclusiveness of the description is also its main problem. He argues that an impor-
tant feature of groups is that others who are not members still recognize them as 
groups. Brown argues that social psychologists would have little interest in people 
who secretly decide to define themselves as a group when the group’s existence 
remains hidden to everyone else. To understand groups and group behaviour, it is 
important to consider groups in relation to other groups. Therefore, Brown (2000, 
p. 3) extended the definition of groups, stating that a group: ‘exists when two or 
more people define themselves as members of it and when its existence is recog-
nized by at least one other’. 
Adding slightly to this definition, we draw on Turner’s argument that groups 
perceive themselves as ‘us’ compared to ‘them’. In seeing themselves as a group, 
people naturally compare themselves to groups they are not a part of. Thus, a 
group can be defined as:
two or more people who define themselves, and are recognized by others, as a 
group and have a sense of ‘us’, which can be compared to ‘them’. 
This is the definition we use in the remainder of this chapter and beyond. You 
will also notice that we use the terms ingroup and outgroup throughout the book. 
Here, we are using the social psychological convention to differentiate between 
and name groups we are members of (ingroups) and groups to which we do not 
belong (outgroups).

Formation of groups
You will be able to think of many different kinds of groups that make up who you 
are. Obviously, many of your group memberships are chosen for you by birth. 
However, one common feature of many groups is that you can choose to join 
them. Likewise, you can choose to leave them. For example, if you do not like

your hockey club or project group, you are more often than not free to leave. So, 
groups can be flexible, dynamic structures where people come and go. The move-
ments of others and the makeup of the group at any given time can influence the 
nature of the group. Likewise, the group can influence its members, as we will see 
throughout Part 3. However, it is surprising that this aspect of groups is given 
little attention in social psychology. Social psychological examinations of group 
phenomena and intergroup relations deal with a wide range of processes and 
influences but the effects of time are often neglected (Levine and Moreland, 1990; 
Tuckman, 1965; Worchel, 1996). 
Nevertheless, Tuckman proposed a well-known stage model of the develop-
ment of groups over time. Tuckman (1965) recognized the distinct phases that 
groups go through and argued that groups need to experience each stage (up to 
stage four at least) before they can achieve maximum effectiveness. The stages are 
as follows:
1 Forming: Here, individuals hope to be accepted by others and avoid conflict or 
controversy. People focus on busying themselves with routines such as group 
organization, structure and roles. Individuals learn about each other and their 
task. Little gets done in this stage, which is mainly concerned with orientation 
and gathering information.
2 Storming: Everyone in the group now knows one another and so the group 
begins to address issues (see Figure 8.2). This phase is characterized by conflict. 
Group members question the role of the work of the group and the roles/
responsibilities within the group. Some group members will wish to retain the 
security of phase 1. Conflict in the group may be suppressed in the interests of 
harmony and the group task, or will be addressed in this phase.
3 Norming: The rules of engagement are established, roles and responsibilities are 
agreed and conflict has been addressed. People in the group understand each 
other better and can appreciate the skills and experience that others bring to the 
group. This stage is characterized by listening, support and flexibility. People 
feel they are part of a cohesive, effective group. A common sense of identity 
and purpose emerges.
4 Performing: This stage is characterized by a state of interdependence 
and flexibility. Not all groups reach this phase. Here, everyone in the 
group knows each other well enough to trust one another and work 
together or independently. Roles and responsibilities change according 
to needs in a flexible and harmonious manner. People feel comfortable 
and have good morale. Because relations within the group are good, 
the group can be directed towards the task.
5 Adjourning: This phase was added later (Tuckman and Jensen, 1977). 
Here, the group completes the task and disengages. People in the group 
come to terms with the task having been completed and the group now 
ends. Sometimes, adjourning can occur if group members lose interest 
or motivation and the group dissolves (van Vugt and Hart, 2004).

The social group
Group socialization
Moreland and Levine devised a model of group socialization to describe and explain 
the dynamic nature of the group over time (Levine and Moreland, 1994; Moreland 
and Levine, 1982, 1984, 2001). In this model, the interrelationships between the 
group and its individual members are important. Specifically, group members 
come together to meet each other’s needs and accomplish goals. Thus, group 
socialization is not simply a one-way process in which groups influence what 
individuals do. Members coming into (and 
leaving) a dynamic and changing group can be a 
powerful source of influence on the group itself 
and may change the way the group communi-
cates and functions. 
According to Moreland and Levine’s model, 
individuals and the group are constantly evalu-
ating one another to determine how rewarding 
or worthwhile the interrelationships are. These 
evaluations bring about feelings of commitment 
that can change (go up and down) over time. If 
the changes are significant, the group may cross a 
‘decision criterion’, bringing about role transi-
tion. In other words, individuals within the 
group can occupy different roles within the 
group at different times. More specifically, Moreland and Levine argue that there 
are five membership phases, as shown in Figure 8.3. These are:
1 Investigation: Here, an individual is a prospective member of the group. The 
individual engages in reconnaissance and the group engages in recruitment. If an 
‘entry criterion’ or level of commitment is met by both the group and the indi-
vidual, the individual enters the group and socialization begins. There are many 
forms of investigation in everyday life. If you are looking for work (and are 
therefore a potential new member of an organization), you will examine employ-
ment advertisements and investigate – if you can afford to be choosy – whether 
the company looks good to work for. If the company is looking for new 
members, it will typically advertise a job, and will then scrutinize the CV and 
the character of applicants. The processes in friendship, special interest and 
political groups may look different but they have the same basic structure of 
reconnaissance by new members and recruitment and scrutiny by the group. In 
an interesting study of clubs on university campuses, Cini, Moreland and Levine 
(1993) found that clubs’ recruitment behaviour changed markedly depending on 
whether they already had enough, too many or too few members. Groups who 
were understaffed – who lacked members – were more interested in recruitment, 
were more likely to allow people to join their group at any time, and were less 
fussy about who could join the group. Thus, the logic of supply and demand can 
influence investigation – groups that already have more members, and prospec-

tive group members who have more choices, may be choosy and use more elabo-
rate investigation techniques than those who have fewer. Surprisingly, groups 
who were understaffed used fewer, not more, recruitment methods. Cini et al. 
(1993) noted that this finding may reflect the practical or emotional effect of 
understaffing on groups – the stress of being overworked and overlooked, and 
the sheer lack of time for group members who are working hard to keep the

2 Socialization: The individual is now a new member of a group and the group 
attempts to assimilate the person into the group. During this phase, the group 
member attempts to accommodate to the group. For successful socialization to 
occur, the individual and group need to reach a critical level of commitment. If 
so, the ‘acceptance criterion’ is reached and acceptance occurs. The maintenance 
phase of group membership begins. This phase was investigated by Ashforth, 
Sluss and Saks (2007), in a survey of business and engineering graduates in their 
first seven months of work. They found that the more companies invested in 
proactive, formal socialization (e.g., special occasions to welcome and train new 
employees), and the more new employees acted independently to socialize 
themselves, the better the outcome. When the company and the employee both 
committed like this to socialization, the employees learned more, they were 
better psychologically adjusted, and indicated more desire to stay with the group 
(that is, not to leave the company). Importantly, joining the group does not 
necessarily mean losing one’s original identity. Groups that try to strip away too 
much of an individual’s previous identity – a process called divestiture – risk 
exposing individuals to stress and uncertainty. On the other hand, groups that 
embrace and value their employees’ previous identities – a process called investi-
ture – may create a sense of ‘psychological safety’ (Edmondson, 2004). In their 
study, Ashforth et al. (2007) found that investiture did not affect employees’ 
learning but helped boost their wellbeing and commitment to the group.

3 Maintenance: The individual is now an accepted member of the group. Role 
negotiation occurs between the individual and the group regarding the specific 
duties the individual might engage in, such as leadership, for rewards. The 
maintenance phase can last for a long time but sometimes commitment on both 
sides can fall. For example, the individual may not agree on their assigned role, 
or may deviate from what is expected of group members. In one study, workers 
identified several kinds of deviance in the workplace, including theft, destruc-
tion of property, misuse of information, time or other resources, unsafe behav-
iour, poor attendance, poor work quality, abuse of alcohol or drugs, and bad or 
hostile language (Gruys and Sackett, 2003). On the other hand, groups may fail 
to value or invest in their members properly. Some group members may be 
unfairly favoured over others by the leadership of the group (Kacmar and 
Baron, 1999). If these kinds of failures occur on either side, the ‘divergence 
criterion’ is reached and the group member becomes marginalized. The process 
of resocialization begins.
4 Resocialization: The group makes efforts to reassimilate the individual and the 
individual attempts to accommodate to the group. If this process is successful, 
commitment increases and convergence may occur (the reverse of divergence). If 
not, and commitment falls further, the ‘exit criterion’ may be met and the indi-
vidual exits the group. The individual becomes an ex-member and the process of 
remembrance (5) begins. Processes of resocialization of established group 
members are often harsher and less forgiving than those of socialization of new 
members, as was demonstrated in a set of experiments by Pinto, Marques, 
Levine and Abrams (2010). Portuguese high school and university students 
evaluated full members more harshly than new members of their student group 
when they deviated from its norms (e.g., by saying ‘I think university students 
are not mature enough to know what’s best for them’). They were also more 
strongly in favour of harsh responses to full members (e.g., forcing or threat-
ening them to adopt the group’s normal perspective). In contrast, they were 
more willing to adopt gentle persuasion with new members (e.g., using rational 
arguments to convince them of the merit of the group’s position). Apparently, 
more is expected of full than new members. Thus, if you break the normative 
‘rules’ of a group you’ve just joined, the socialization processes may be relatively 
gentle and educative. Resocialization may be less pleasant (but is not always 
harsh or punitive; for a review, see Moreland and Levine, 2001).

5 Remembrance: The individual reminisces 
about being a member of the group and the 
group remembers the individual as part of its 
tradition. Levels of commitment eventually 
become low for both the individual and the 
group. Although the individual has left the 
group, there are continued feelings of obliga-
tion and loyalty. Moreland and McGinn (1999) 
demonstrated this point by having groups of 
students work together on an art poster. The 
groups were then dissolved. Participants were 
later exposed to criticism of the poster their 
group had made. This was rated as more upset-
ting, and was more likely to be rejected, when 
participants believed it came from former members of their group than former 
members of another group (Figure 8.5). 
Similar theories from a communication perspective argue for slightly different 
stages of socialization. For example, Anderson, Riddle and Martin (1999) proposed 
that socialization goes through a series of stages:
 o antecedent phase: people share their beliefs and attitudes 
 o anticipatory phase: individuals decide what they want from the group and any 
pre-existing group norms influence individuals 
 o encounter phase: individuals come together to establish group goals and roles 
 o assimilation phase: involves new group members accepting the established 
group culture and beginning to identify with the group. Successful assimilation 
occurs when group members see their own values and interests coinciding with 
those of the group (but fails when they do not)
 o  exit phase: the task comes to an end and the group diffuses. 
Although it is argued that these basic processes are common to most groups, they 
can mean different things for different groups. Take, for example, the divergence 
that occurs in Moreland and Levine’s model. This may be unexpected, such as 
when someone within a group is dissatisfied with their role and chooses to leave. 
Resocialization might be possible in such a case if the individual and the group can 
reconcile their differences and negotiate a new role for the individual. But, some-
times divergence is not entirely expected. For example, a student leaves school to 
enter university. This is a case of role transition, and the process of resocialization 
into the current group (school) is not possible. Indeed, role transitions such as this 
are important aspects of group life. Brinthaupt, Moreland and Levine (1991) and 
Moreland and Levine (1989) have investigated these sorts of role transitions in 
some detail. These transitions can often become ritualized events, rites of passage, 
and occasionally involve initiation rites. They can be pleasant and marked with 
ceremony and gifts (e.g., a wedding), but can often be unpleasant and involve 
humiliation (e.g., the associated ‘stag do’). Such events, although sometimes

The social group
painful, can serve to publicly recognize the role transition, help individuals 
become accustomed to their new role, and enhance commitment to the new group. 
Social psychologists explain people’s acceptance of unpleasant initiation rituals in 
terms of cognitive dissonance (Festinger, 1957) (see also Chapter 4). An unpleasant 
initiation creates dissonance – feeling unpleasant about undergoing an embar-
rassing initiation rite, and feeling negative about the group – which can be reduced 
by focusing on the positive rather than the negative aspects of the group. This is a 
way of maintaining loyalty towards the group.

or if he was not asked to perform any task?
This cognitive dissonance effect was demonstrated in a study by Aronson and 
Mills (1959). The researchers recruited female participants to take part in a group 
discussion about the psychology of sex. They were about to join the discussion 
but were first asked to read a boring excerpt of the discussion. Participants were 
then divided into three groups. One group performed a mild initiation task to read 
out five words with vague sexual meaning. One group performed a much more 
embarrassing initiation task to read out sexually explicit passages. Finally, a 
control group had no task. Results revealed that the group asked to perform the 
extreme initiation rated the discussion as much more interesting than the other 
two groups. Arguably, the embarrassing and uncomfortable task of reading out 
sexually explicit passages created a state of dissonance, increasing commitment to 
the group discussion. Interestingly, this effect seems to be specific to situations 
where the unpleasant task is perceived to be an initia-
tion. Gerard and Mathewson (1966) replicated 
Aronson and Mills’ study, including a condition 
where the more unpleasant task (receiving a severe 
electric shock in this case, compared to only a mild 
shock) was perceived to be unrelated to the later task. 
Evaluation of the group was not affected in this 
condition, arguably because the task was inde-
pendent of the group task. However, the unpleasant 
experience enhanced the evaluation of the group 
(compared to the less unpleasant experience) when it 
was perceived to be an initiation for the group (see 
Figure 8.6).

Groups can therefore benefit from positive socialization. Socialization outcomes 
describe how members and the group as a whole feel about how they functioned 
to reach the group objective. The most prominent of these outcomes, for social 
psychology, is group cohesion. 
Group cohesion
Once a group is operating, one of its main features is group cohesion – the degree to 
which it holds together as an entity. A group’s level of cohesion depends on group 
members’ mutual support for one another and consistency of conduct or behav-
iour. As such, it is similar to the concept of entitativity discussed earlier, where 
entitative groups appear to be coherent and ‘bound’ together as a unit. Of course, 
cohesion differs between groups. Some groups are not at all cohesive and from the 
outside, some groups can look very little like groups. On the other hand, some 
groups are highly cohesive and appear almost impenetrable from the outside. So, 
what makes a group cohesive? What psychological processes draw people together 
to form cohesive units?
Festinger, Schachter and Back (1950) argued that the key ingredients deter-
mining a group’s level of cohesion are its attractiveness (both of the group and its 
members) and how much the group satisfies individual goals. These forces are 
depicted in Figure 8.7.

Cohesion
Cohesion is, however, difficult to measure. How can a social psychologist test 
the degree to which a group ‘hangs together’ as a whole? Also, groups that are 
cohesive in one time and context may not necessarily be cohesive across time and 
in different contexts. How is it possible to examine these differences? 
Festinger et al. (1950) asked people to list the individuals they see the most in 
social contexts – the rationale being that how much people are attracted to one 
another largely determines the extent to which a group is cohesive. Indeed, much 
of the research examining cohesion has dealt with attractiveness – specifically, how 
much people within the group are drawn to one another and are drawn to the 
group (for a review, see Dion, 2000). However, others argue that quantifying 
group cohesion by measuring attractiveness is not always appropriate. Specifically, 
some theorists argue that if social psychologists measure individual-level attrac-
tiveness, they are not capturing a process that is unique to groups (Hogg, 1992; 
Turner, 1984, 1985). They are simply examining interpersonal attraction. These

The social group
researchers argued and, indeed, found that group-level variables such as group 
prototypicality and norms are significantly related to group-based social attrac-
tion but not individual-based social attraction (e.g., Hogg and Hardie, 1991). 
Thus, some of the basic structural features of groups, and not simply interpersonal 
attraction, can determine how groups hang together to form a cohesive unit. We 
examine some of these structural features of groups in the next section.

group structure
As we mentioned earlier, groups vary in many simple ways, such as in their size 
and composition. Groups also exist for many different purposes. Subsequently, 
they tend to have organizational systems that enable them to meet their objectives. 
Here, we discuss some of the structural features of groups that enable them to 
perform their purposes. We outline the important role of norms in defining group 
structure and determining group members’ behaviour. We also discuss how social 
roles and social status shape the nature of groups.
Norms
Have you ever been in a situation where you unintentionally (or intentionally) 
offended someone with your behaviour? Perhaps you laughed at a funeral or 
shouted in a library. Perhaps you pushed into a long queue at your local super-
market. On your travels, you may have said or done something that angered 
someone from another country. What happened in these situations? How did you 
feel? These are examples of basic social norm violations, which can often have 
disastrous effects. Indeed, sometimes when we violate social norms, we are 
shunned by and excluded from the group, as we will see later (Marques, Abrams 
and Serodio, 2001). 
Social norms such as these are strong determinants of our behaviours. Norms are 
defined as the uniformities of behaviour and attitudes that determine, organize 
and differentiate groups from other groups. They are the formal or informal rules 
unique to specific groups, which are adopted to regulate its members’ behaviours. 
Some norms are basic rules that everyone is supposed to obey (e.g., being quiet in 
a cinema) and others are dependent on the culture of the group (e.g., what colour 
clothing is appropriate to wear at a funeral). Much of the time, social norms are 
written, formalized or spoken openly and indeed this is often effective. A study 
by Cialdini, Reno and Kallgren (1990) demonstrates how the open expression of 
expected behaviour has a strong influence on people’s actions. Cialdini et al. placed 
flyers on the windows of cars parked in a university car park. Some flyers 
expressed a clear anti-littering message: ‘April is Keep Arizona Beautiful Month. 
Please Do Not Litter’, while others carried a message irrelevant to littering: ‘April

is Arizona’s Fine Arts Month. Please Visit Your Local Art Museum’. The 
researchers observed the car owners’ behaviour and counted the number of each 
type of flyer that had been thrown on the ground. They found that 25 per cent of 
people who had received an irrelevant message threw the flyer away before getting 
into their cars, compared with only 10 per cent of those who had received the 
anti-littering norm message (see also Chapter 9). Thus, direct communication of 
norms can be effective. 
However, some norms are more subtle and seldom explicitly stated; but these 
implicit or ‘hidden’ norms still have a powerful influence on people’s behaviour. 
Even when we violate the most implicit and unspoken of norms, we often find out 
when we have transgressed. Garfinkel (1967) developed a technique called 
ethnomethodology to uncover and understand some of these hidden norms. 
Ethnomethodology is the study of the everyday methods that people use for the 
production of social order. It is done by documenting the methods and practices 
through which people make sense of their social world (Garfinkel, 2002). One of 
the techniques involves people violating social norms (e.g., norms of familial inter-
actions) so that attention is drawn to them. It is intended that the violation of the 
norm would uncover the true norm underneath. This technique is commonly 
known as a breaching experiment, in that it seeks to examine people’s reactions to 
the breaching of common social norms or rules. Indeed, in Garfinkel’s original 
work, students who were asked to behave differently than they normally would at 
home (e.g., to behave like polite, formal boarding students instead of their parents’ 
children) were met with shock and surprise from their parents. Here, it was argued 
that the normative conduct of behaviour had been revealed and its violation elic-
ited a strong reaction from the parents. Another example can be found in a study 
conducted on the New York subway in the 1970s. In this study, Milgram asked 
able-bodied graduate students (posing as passengers) to board a train and ask able-
bodied and seated passengers, without explanation, to give up their seats. As you 
will learn in Chapter 9, people quite easily comply with such requests and, in this 
case, 68 per cent of passengers gave up their seat willingly. However, the students 
making the requests felt deeply uncomfortable doing so (Luo, 2004). One student 
reported that she felt like she was going to throw up. Milgram said in an interview 
for Psychology Today in 1974 that even he ‘froze’ when he attempted to make the 
request himself. These reactions point to the power of social norms in guiding our 
behaviour. These often invisible rules of social behaviour help maintain social 
order but go largely unnoticed until they are violated (see Blass, 2004). 
Further, norms do not have to be explicit in order to influence our behaviour. 
In another study, Cialdini et al. (1990) placed participants in either a clean or 
dirty (littered) setting and observed the participants’ littering behaviour. More 
people littered the dirty environment. Also, it was found that the percentage of 
people who littered was highest when participants saw someone littering in an 
already dirty environment but lowest when people saw someone litter a clean 
environment. Cialdini et al. explained this apparent contradiction in terms of 
norm accessibility – the littering person’s behaviour drew the participant’s atten-

tion to the norm (to litter or not to litter), which subsequently influenced their 
behaviour (see Figure 8.8). In another condition where only one piece of rubbish 
was visible, people littered even less, supporting the idea that implicit and envi-
ronmental cues lead people to really think about what behaviours are normative 
and anti-normative. 
As we will see in Chapter 9, norms strongly influence our behaviour. In partic-
ular, they can determine what we say and do when we are unsure of how to 
behave. In this respect, they can provide us with useful frames of reference from 
which to judge (and recalibrate) our own behaviour (Sherif, 1935, 1937; Jacobs 
and Campbell, 1961). By establishing the normative behaviour of others in the 
group, we obtain a useful guide for our own responses. 
However, group norms can also change what we do and what we think even 
when we have already established our own internal frame of reference. Siegel and 
Siegel (1957) randomly assigned students entering a US college to different types 
of student residences. Some were assigned to sorority accommodation (where a 
conservative culture was dominant) and others were assigned to dormitory 
accommodation where they were exposed to more liberally minded norms. Siegel 
and Siegel measured students’ levels of conservatism at the beginning of the year 
and again at the end of the year. In Figure 8.9, you can see that although the atti-
tudes of both groups were similar at the beginning of the year, exposure to liberal 
norms significantly reduced conservatism at the end of the year. 
As we can see, norms are powerful. But why do they work so well? Why do 
norms guide people’s behaviour so strongly? Going back to Cialdini et al.’s 
littering example, it is possible to highlight several reasons:

1 Norms are sometimes enforced so that people are motivated to adhere to them 
in order to receive rewards and avoid punishments. For example, if we litter, we 
may be fined, which is unpleasant – putting rubbish in the bin helps us to avoid 
the negative consequences of norm violation. Likewise, we adhere to written 
rules and laws because we do not want to suffer the consequences. 
2 We often internalize norms and believe that they are right. For example, we do 
not litter (most of the time) because we know that throwing rubbish on the 
ground is not a nice or prosocial thing to do. 
3 Norms can become fixed during the process of socialization so that when we 
become part of a group, its norms become part of us – we have been socialized 
not to litter. 
4 Consensus influences the power of norms to determine our behaviour. Seeing 
others perform a particular behaviour makes the behaviour look like the appro-
priate thing to do. If people consistently behave in a normative manner, you 
will also know that they expect you to do the same. As we saw in Cialdini et 
al.’s (1990) study, watching other people litter made people more likely to do 
the same. Likewise, if others are doing something normative, they will support 
you in the face of threats from people who do not share the same norms. 
5 Norms are often activated. The more we interact with members of the group, 
the more we are exposed to group norms. Just being reminded of our group 
membership makes us think about the group and its norms. 
6 Norms act as useful heuristics that make our lives easier. When we are busy or 
in a complex situation, awareness of group norms gives us something to fall 
back on so that we know how to behave.

Norms are also useful to the group’s overall function and can often help a group 
achieve its purpose. This is particularly useful in organizations, as a study by Coch 
and French (1948) demonstrated. In this study, the researchers compared pyjama 
factory workers’ responses to three different ways of changing production 
routines. In this factory, the female workers were paid a set amount of money per 
unit of work they completed and any changes to the working routine would have 
an impact on their income. Workers in a control group were simply informed that 
new routines had to be adopted and were told about corresponding changes to 
their pay scheme. A second group were given the same information but were also 
told why the changes were being made and were given the freedom to choose who 
would teach them the new routines. The third group received the same informa-
tion as the second, but this time each participant was given the freedom to estab-
lish for themselves the best way to learn the new practices and was also allowed to 
establish their own norm of what was an acceptable productivity level. Which 
group had the best productivity? Which group do you think was the happiest? 
Results showed that the productivity of the final group, after immediately drop-

ping slightly, became 15 per cent better than before the changes were introduced. 
Their morale also remained high. In fact, people who did not adopt the norm were 
often ostracized or had their work sabotaged by other group members. Thus, the 
norm became strong and people deviating from the norm were seriously dealt 
with. There are often significant consequences for people who violate norms, and 
we will discuss some of these consequences with respect to group deviance and 
ostracism later in the chapter. Going back to the factory study, it was not surprising 
that the first group responded most negatively to the changes. In this group, 
morale dropped and workers even started to leave the factory. A study by Marks, 
Mirvis, Hackett and Grady (1986) demonstrated similar results – here, members 
of small work groups in a factory were more productive and were absent from 
work less than a comparison group. Generally, research findings suggest that 
norm formation with respect to goal setting in organizations has positive conse-
quences for productivity, work rates and satisfaction. 
Permitting groups to form their own norms is one useful way to increase the 
effectiveness of a group. This practice has been successfully adopted in many 
different contexts, and countries such as Japan have long used techniques such as 
participative decision making and quality circles (small groups who meet regularly 
to discuss productivity) to increase efficiency in industries. Likewise, Swedish car 
companies such as Saab and Volvo have utilized cooperative work groups and have 
a strong reputation for high-quality cars. The positive effects of permitting group 
members to form their own norms can last even after people have left the group. 
For example, a self-help group for weight loss can assist an individual to develop 
their own norms of healthy living. In fact, allowing groups the freedom to produce 
their own norms might be a way to facilitate important social change. For example, 
if people in a neighbourhood establish norms encouraging pro-environmental 
behaviour (e.g., recycling, lower energy use), how might these norms influence 
surrounding neighbourhoods? Could this type of norm formation potentially 
establish a more far-reaching positive norm of pro-environmental behaviour? 
In general, norms provide the standards for group behaviour and guiding prin-
ciples for group attitudes. It is through norms that groups exert their influence on 
individual group members. We spend more time discussing the power of norms in 
Chapter 9, when we discuss the core topic of social influence and the power of the 
group above and beyond the norms and standards of the individual. We discuss 
how norms form and develop in the first place, and highlight more of the impor-
tant ways that norms influence our social behaviour. 
Roles and status
In addition to social norms, many groups have well-defined social roles, or shared 
expectations of how particular people are supposed to behave in groups. The 
distinction between norms and roles is fairly simple. Whereas norms determine 
how all groups members should (or do) act, roles specify how people who hold 
particular positions within a group should behave. For example, a work team will 
usually consist of a boss or line manager and workers. These roles have clearly

defined standards of behaviour and a line manager and their workers are expected 
to behave in different ways to make the group function appropriately. Likewise, 
students working on a collaborative group project will often establish clear roles 
such as assigning one person to write the introduction, one person to write the 
method and so on. Each group member therefore has a prescribed role that helps 
the group meet its purpose. Roles emerge in groups so that members have a clear 
idea of what they need to do, how they should behave, and what their place is 
within the group. In general, findings suggest that when people in a group stick to 
a set of well-defined roles, they are more satisfied and perform better (Barley and 
Bechky, 1994; Bettencourt and Sheldon, 2001). 
However, clearly defined social roles are not always a good thing. As we will see 
in Chapter 9, being too embedded in social roles can sometimes have seriously 
negative consequences. In particular, you will read about the Stanford Prison 
Experiment where young men were assigned to the role of prisoner or guard in a 
simulated prison environment at Stanford University (Haney, Banks and Zimbardo, 
1973). In this study, the guards became embedded in their roles and performed 
role-consistent behaviour – such as brutality and intimidation towards the pris-
oners – to such an extent that the study had to be ended prematurely. Rigid adher-
ence to roles can have other types of negative consequences. Gersick and Hackman 
(1990) describe the example of an Air Florida pilot (arguably accustomed to typi-
cally warm weather) automatically responding ‘yes’ to his team member’s routine 
question ‘anti-ice off?’ despite the snowy weather at Washington DC airport. 
Nobody checked and the plane crashed shortly after take-off, resulting in the death 
of crew and passengers. Do social roles sometimes ‘take over’ our personal identi-
ties and make us lose sight of some of the things we would normally do? We 
examine this issue in more detail in the Critical focus box in Chapter 9. Social roles 
might also become problematic when they are, or seem, illegitimate or arbitrary. In 
the Critical focus box below, we examine the case of gender roles.

Thus, social roles can often cause us conflict. Interestingly too, they can change 
who we are. A study by Twenge demonstrates how changing gender roles can 
influence our personalities. Twenge (2001) tracked women’s social status in the 
USA between 1931 and 1993. She compared this with women’s own reports of 
their assertiveness. In general, women’s self-ratings of assertiveness followed the 
same pattern as their social status. For example, with the improvements in social 
status between 1931 and 1945 (e.g., more women gaining university degrees and 
more women in the workforce), women reported feeling more assertive. Likewise, 
after 1968, when the feminist movement took hold and women’s social status 
improved, they again reported greater levels of assertiveness. The period in 
between (1946–67), where more women stayed at home and less went to univer-
sity, was marked by a decrease in self-reports of assertiveness. This striking effect 
is shown in Figure 8.10. In general, the roles that people occupy in groups (and 
society) are powerful in forming their behaviour, feelings and even their person-
ality (Eagly and Steffen, 2000; Wood, Christensen, Hebl and Rothgerber, 1997).

The social group
Of course, roles are often closely linked to one’s status in general and the above 
example shows how gender roles and women’s status in society are similar. Gender 
roles mean that women and men are not always treated equally. In many other 
groups too, the roles that people occupy are not equal. Thus, our discussion of 
roles naturally leads us into the issue of status. 
Some roles within a group are more valued than other roles and are associated 
with higher status. Generally, the leader of a group is accepted as the highest status 
position, but within groups we often see a hierarchy of roles, and subsequently a 
‘ranking’ of the people who occupy the roles, which tends to be accepted by 
others both within and outside the group. Indeed, for a group role or individual 
member in a group to be seen to have status, the perception of status needs to be 
shared by others. There is little point in assuming that one has status if nobody 
around recognizes it.

status roles and gender roles of a society and what may happen to individuals if those norms are violated. 
Group members who are seen to have status within a group display a tendency 
to initiate activities and suggest ideas – these suggestions are more likely than 
others’ suggestions to be taken up by the group. For example, a person chairing a 
meeting may be more likely to make a suggestion that is agreed upon by the rest 
of the group because they are seen as having a certain level of standing or authority. 
However, a person’s status within the group is not set forever and status differen-
tials within a group can change over time. For example, a person chairing a meeting 
may not always do so and duties such as these may be shared between members of 
the group over time. Similarly, the head of an academic department at a university 
will typically serve a set amount of time before someone else is elected to do the 
job. One’s status within a group can also differ across contexts. For example, an 
academic department head will have less status in a university-level meeting than 
in a departmental meeting. While they are ‘in charge’ in one context, they may be 
a regular group member in others. 
How do status differentials emerge within groups? One explanation comes 
from Festinger’s social comparison theory (Festinger, 1954). According to this 
account, status hierarchies reflect social comparisons within the group. Being in 
groups presents people with relevant others with whom to compare themselves. 
We look at others, their opinions and their abilities and ‘place’ ourselves within 
the group according to certain valuable characteristics. Sometimes, this process 
happens quite naturally and everyone in a group is happy with their position. 
Frequently, however, status in a group is contested. One example is group leader-
ship, a role that is often toughly contested (Figure 8.11). A group role such as this 
is a high status and desirable one because it brings with it a lot of power and influ-
ence. Thus, the process of social comparison with others is often competitive and

role assignment is dependent on how people compare with 
others on status-relevant dimensions. One prospective 
leader may run a stronger and more convincing election 
campaign. Another candidate may simply impress their 
group with a demonstrated capacity to take the group 
forward. Obviously, not everyone can become the leader, 
so once the allocation of status is resolved within a group, 
people must be content with their own position. This is 
one way that status becomes a shared or consensual 
phenomenon within the group – people who do not win 
and become followers naturally feel – in some way – infe-
rior to the emergent leader. In short, they have to learn to 
deal with it and one way to do this is to legitimize the 
status-relevant differences between themselves and the 
leader. In doing so, the prestige of the high status position is reinforced and 
perpetuated over time and as new leaders emerge or are elected. These types of 
processes also occur between groups when one group is perceived as having higher 
status than the others. We will cover this topic in more detail in Chapter 11 on 
intergroup relations. 
Sometimes, people simply accept that other people in a group are of a higher 
status than themselves. Some research by Strodtbeck, James and Hawkins (1957) 
demonstrated this status institutionalization in newly formed status hierarchies. 
They established mock juries whose role was to read transcripts of actual trials and 
produce verdicts based on the transcripts. They found that the high status role of 
jury ‘foreman’ was typically assigned to a person with higher status in real life. 
More specifically, the groups awarded the higher status positions in the experiment 
to people who held occupations outside the experiment such as teachers and other 
professionals rather than people who occupied working-class occupations like 
cleaners or mechanics. It may be that people simply expect some individuals to be 
associated with higher status roles in general because they occupy a high status role 
(or roles) in society. Such diffuse status characteristics may not be directly associated 
with the group task at hand but they are generally positively evaluated and there-
fore generate favourable expectations. For example, a professional individual such 
as a doctor or lawyer may know very little about making quality judgements about 
music (a specific status characteristic). Nevertheless, they may be more likely to be 
chosen as a band manager because they are seen as having status in another domain 
(Berger, Fisek, Norman and Zelditch, 1997; Ridgeway and Berger, 1986). 
As we will see in Chapters 11 and 14, the legitimization of status differences 
between groups means that people often support systems that are unfair to them 
personally. System justification theory (Jost and Banaji, 2004) posits that people depend 
on social systems for wealth and security and are therefore motivated to justify 
those social systems, seeing them as fair and functional. When they come across 
inequality or unfairness, low status group members tend to internalize the negative 
stereotypes of their group that serve to justify their low status position, to believe

that authorities act in their interests, and that economic inequality is legitimate or 
even necessary (Jost, Pelham, Sheldon and Sullivan, 2003). In Chapter 14, we discuss 
how this system-justifying tendency of low status group members influences 
women’s feelings of their own entitlements in employment settings (Bylsma and 
Major, 1994; Callahan-Levy and Meese, 1979), and for people to endorse inequality 
in their own society (Kay, Whitson, Gaucher and Galinsky, 2009).
People’s expectations about ability and status can explain how status roles 
emerge within groups. These expectations may help people to deal with their posi-
tion within the group if they are not the leader. People may not always simply 
‘deal with it’ though. Often, the process of losing out on an important status 
dimension can make people feel uncomfortable and unhappy. People can deal with 
this dissatisfaction in other ways besides simply accepting or internalizing the idea 
that they are inferior. They may choose to emphasize the things they are good at 
and downplay the features on which they fall short. Again, these processes occur 
between groups too and group members often redefine the important features of 
their group on which they prefer to be evaluated. Dimensions that favour the 
ingroup (e.g. ‘we are good at sport’), rather than disfavour the group (e.g., ‘we are 
a poor country’), tend to be the preferred means of comparison for low status 
groups, especially if alternative groups (high status groups) are impermeable. This 
process, called social creativity, serves to maintain group members’ self-esteem 
(Tajfel and Turner, 1979). By engaging in comparisons on unorthodox dimensions 
that tend to favour their own group, people are able to feel good about their group 
even if they are low status on other dimensions (see also Haslam, 2001). 
Further, research from the system justification theory perspective suggests that 
people justify a system – regardless of their own position in the system – using 
complementary stereotyping. The idea is that if people are ‘poor’, they may be 
okay because they are probably ‘happy’. On the other hand, the ‘rich’ may be 
‘miserable’. This line of reasoning implies that low status has its rewards and high 
status has its drawbacks (Kay and Jost, 2003). Also, if people think they can 
improve their status by leaving the group, they will do so, whereas if they cannot 
leave the group, they will seek to improve its status (see the discussion of social 
identity and intergroup relations in Chapter 11). It is clear that people will not 
always simply accept an inferior status position, or if they do, they have system-
justifying mechanisms to make themselves feel reasonably good about it.

what happens to individuals when they deviate from group standards, when they 
do not quite fit the prototype of the group, and when they are seen as ‘impostors’ 
within a group. We will consider the effects that such marginal group members 
can have on the group as a whole. We also consider how group deviance can some-
times lead to ‘breakoff’ groups being formed within the larger group. 
Marginal group members (‘deviants’)
People who do not embody the group’s most important attributes or who ‘deviate’ 
too far from prototypical group members are known as marginal group members or 
deviants. Whereas some group members have the capacity to exert influence over 
the group, deviants typically do not. On the contrary, they are often seriously 
disliked by the group. Research on the black sheep effect demonstrates how strongly 
groups can react to marginal group members (Abrams, Rutland, Cameron and 
Ferrell, 2007; Castano, Paladino, Coull, and Yzerbyt, 2002; Doosje and Brans-
combe, 2003; Marques, Yzerbyt and Leyens, 1988; Pinto et al., 2010; Shin, Freda 
and Yi, 1999). We are all familiar with the term ‘black sheep’ – a person who goes 
against the standards of their family (or other important group) and is subsequently 
shunned by the group in some way. In an early study of this effect, Marques and 
Yzerbyt (1988) presented Belgian law students with taped speeches that had alleg-
edly been made by other students. One of these speeches was good, and the other 
was truly bad. In the ‘ingroup’ conditions of the experiment, the law students were 
told that the speech was by another law student. In the ‘outgroup’ conditions, they 
were told that it was by a philosophy student. Participants rated the speeches, and 
the speaker (e.g., ‘In your opinion, this person’s capability to express ideas is …’)  
(1 = weak, 7 = strong). As one might expect, the apparently competent speaker was 
rated more favourably when they 
were a member of the ingroup, 
that is, another law student (Figure 
8.12). This is standard ingroup 
favouritism – in general, we tend 
to be biased towards our own 
‘kind’ (see also Chapter 11). 
However, Marques and Yzerbyt 
found that if the speech was bad, 
the ingroup speaker was appar-
ently rated less favourably than 
the outgroup speaker.

Why do you think this happens? Marques 
et al.’s explanation is that deviant ingroup 
members are threatening to the positive image 
of the ingroup (Marques et al., 2001). As we 
see later in this chapter when we consider 
social identity theory, people want to perceive 
their group in positive terms. In particular, 
they value its positive distinctiveness – its 
superiority, on valued dimensions of judge-
ment, to other groups. A group member who 
deviates from the perceived high standards of the group threatens this perception 
of ingroup superiority. This threat causes ingroup members to treat such ingroup 
deviants harshly. The theoretical model that Marques et al. (2001) developed to 
explain the black sheep effect, based on the principles of social identity and self-
categorization theories, is termed ‘subjective group dynamics’. 
Research generally supports the subjective group dynamics model. Marques et 
al. (2001) showed that when participants felt certain about the superiority of their 
group on the dimension in question, they did not derogate ingroup deviants any 
more than outgroup equivalents. Apparently, under these conditions, they did not 
find the ingroup deviant to be threatening to the positive image of the ingroup. 
Only when they felt uncertain about the superiority of the group – and thus found 
the ingroup deviant disturbed it – did they exhibit the black sheep effect. Abrams 
et al. (2007), in a study of British school children attending a summer school, 
provided further evidence of subjective group dynamics. Participants who were 
accountable to the ingroup – who thought their responses would be seen and 
discussed by other summer schools – were more likely to derogate deviant ingroup 
members and valorize ingroup members who followed the norms. One of the 
functions of the derogation of ingroup members, then, seems to be to ensure that 
ingroup members ‘stay in line’ by adhering to group norms, and that other 
ingroup members play their part in enforcing group norms. 
This can sometimes be unfortunate for the group. Specifically, deviance from 
group norms can often be useful in pointing out things that are wrong within the 
group (Packer, 2008; Packer and Chasteen, 2010). Indeed, deviants can be impor-
tant to the group in bringing about positive social change and allowing the group 
to grow and change. In Chapter 9, you will read more about special cases of 
minorities holding different views from the majority who are able to make posi-
tive social changes. A good example of this from social psychological research 
comes from the body of work on the intergroup sensitivity effect that we will revisit

in Chapter 9. Hornsey, Oppes and Svensson (2002; see also Hornsey and Imani, 
2004) have shown that people are more ready to accept criticism from within the 
group than from outside the group. Ingroup critics are naturally ‘deviant’ members 
of the group because they are speaking ill of their own kind. However, because 
they are perceived to be constructive, at least compared to outgroup members, 
ingroup members agree with their comments more and believe that they are less 
threatening and harmful. Ingroup critics therefore have the potential to point out 
problems within the group so that the group can work on its mistakes and change 
for the better. Other research has shown that even from outside the group, when 
people have no vested interest in the criticism being made, ingroup criticism is 
seen as more acceptable (Douglas and Sutton, 2011; Sutton, Elder and Douglas, 
2006). The deviant ingroup critic is therefore viewed as more constructive than an 
outgroup critic even from an impartial observer’s perspective. Of course, in real-
life situations, the ingroup critic may not find their task very easy. Voicing one’s 
negative opinions about the group can be risky, especially if the group sees the 
critic as a deviant member. Sometimes, it may be necessary for the critic to find 
like-minded others and form a minority group within the group. As we will see in 
Chapter 9, minority groups often show great capacity to influence larger groups.

Impostors
We now know that group members often deal harshly with people who deviate 
from group norms. The need to protect the identity and integrity of the group is 
indeed powerful. There is another interesting case of deviant group membership 
we have not yet dealt with – occasionally members of a group ‘pose’ as legitimate 
group members when they are not. Instead, they fail to fulfil important criteria for 
group membership. How groups deal with these group members – called impos-
tors – is a fairly new area of enquiry in social psychology. In the laboratory, several 
studies examined group members’ reactions to people who pose as legitimate 
members of the group (Hornsey and Jetten, 2003; Jetten, Summerville, Hornsey 
and Mewse, 2005; Warner, Hornsey and Jetten, 2007).

In one study, Jetten et al. (2005) presented vegetarians (ingroup members) and 
meat eaters (outgroup members) with a person claiming to be a vegetarian, but 
caught eating meat. It was found that ingroup members were more displeased with 
the target than outgroup members. Ingroup members also derogated the target 
more than outgroup members. This impostor threatens the distinctiveness of the

group by claiming to be a member and is, like deviant 
ingroup members, dealt with harshly. Indeed, the nega-
tive reactions towards the impostor were greatest when 
people perceived vegetarians and non-vegetarians to be 
highly distinctive groups. It also appears that vegetar-
ians who ‘eat meat occasionally’ are harshly perceived 
by ingroup members (Hornsey and Jetten, 2003). In 
another study, Schoemann and Branscombe (2011) asked younger adults what they 
felt about an older adult target who was attempting to look younger. Participants 
read a description of a person who was (or was not) trying to ‘pass’ as younger and 
were asked to rate them on several dimensions such as likeability and deceitfulness. 
Following the logic of Jetten et al.’s research, it was predicted that participants 
would like an older adult attempting to look young less than an older adult who 
does not attempt to look young. This is exactly what they found (see Figure 8.14). 
Participants rated an older person trying to ‘pass’ as younger as less likeable and 
more deceitful than an older person not attempting to ‘pass’.

Belonging
Schism and subgroups
Sometimes, smaller factions within a group are a positive and necessary feature of 
group life, as we will see in the next section. Occasionally, a small number of 
ingroup members ‘break off’ and form a minority; when this occurs, we have what 
is known as a schism. More specifically, a schism occurs when the group divides 
into subgroups that differ in some crucial respect, such as having different attitudes 
or values. This sometimes happens in religious or political contexts and can result 
in extreme and destructive conflict for the larger group (Sani and Reicher, 1998, 
2000). Also, in organizational contexts, mergers between companies can result in 
two subgroups coming together that differ and disagree on fundamental issues or 
values (Terry, Carey and Callan, 2001; Terry and O’Brien, 2001). Again, as we will 
see in Chapter 9, active minorities within a group can sometimes be valuable addi-
tions to the group that can exert positive social change. 
Smaller groups within a large group can, of course, also occur without a schism. 
Natural subgroups occur in many groups simply because of the group’s structure. 
For example, companies are divided into different departments that have different 
functions to perform. One part of the company might be responsible for finance, 
one for production, one for human resources and so on. Also, within a national 
Olympic team, there are separate teams for swimming, gymnastics, athletics and 
so on. Even smaller and more specialized groups can exist within groups that are 
ultimately part of a larger group. For example, an Olympic team is made up of the 
various different sporting groups but even within the sporting groups there are 
smaller divisions for specific purposes such as the ‘track’ athletes and the ‘field’ 
athletes. Further still, cross-cutting categories are subgroups that represent catego-
ries that have members outside the immediate larger group (Crisp and Hewstone, 
2007). For example, a group of athletes may belong to a national Olympic team 
but also to an international association for athletics. Many groups have complex 
structures of nested groups and cross-cutting categories but nevertheless define 
themselves ultimately as one large group. 
Subgroups can significantly influence the dynamics within the larger group. As 
we will see in Chapter 11, subgroups often engage in competition and conflict that 
can be harmful for the larger group. One obvious example is the conflict between 
the Catholic and Protestant groups in Northern Ireland (Hewstone, Cairns, Voci 
et al., 2006). Intense conflict and rivalry between these subgroups contribute to 
extremely negative intergroup dynamics in society. 
What do groups do for us?
Now that we know what groups are, how they are structured and how people ‘fit 
in’ to groups, we turn our attention to the functions of group membership. Of 
course, the purpose of belonging to groups and the meaning of group member-
ships differ depending on whether or not people have the choice to join groups. In 
many of our social groups such as our race and gender, we cannot simply opt in

The social group
and out, whereas in other groups we are free to come and go as we please. It is 
likely that the question ‘what do groups do for us?’ is not the same, say, for our 
ethnic group (where we might learn norms and customs of behaviour) and our 
student union group (where we have the opportunity to air our opinions about 
important student matters). However, even when we cannot opt out of a group 
such as our ethnic group, we can nevertheless determine what this group member-
ship means to us. For example, we have a choice about what norms we follow and 
we can decide the extent to which we adopt our ethnic customs and rituals. Thus, 
even when we cannot choose our group memberships, we can still control what 
our group membership implies for us as individuals. But, there are several reasons 
why people belong to groups, and we will now outline these reasons, beginning 
with interdependence.
Interdependence
Groups allow people to achieve more and sometimes better things than individuals 
would be able to do on their own. At a simple level, some tasks depend upon 
people working interdependently and to get these tasks done, people join groups. 
For example, one person could not have built Stonehenge or the Great Wall of 
China. The task and outcome depended on the contributions of many people 
working together. Also, how groups do things is often quite different from how 
individuals perform tasks on their own. People are influenced by their interactions 
with other group members, causing them to form goals and behave differently than 
they would alone. In short, coordinated group action allows people to achieve 
things that would not be possible by an individual acting alone. Many social 
psychologists argue that interpersonal interdependence is the essential defining 
feature of groups (e.g., Rabbie and Horwitz, 1988; Thibaut and Kelley, 1959).
Similarity, support and the need for affiliation
Others join groups when they find people who share their attitudes and opinions. 
For example, many political and activist groups centre around specific opinions or 
attitudes. In social psychology, these groups are often known as opinion-based 
groups. Membership of such groups can allow people to achieve the things they 
want to achieve. For example, Bliuc, McGarty, Reynolds and Muntele (2007) 
demonstrated that when people identify with opinion-based groups, they are 
more likely to display intentions for political action. For the groups we already 
belong to, such as our ethnic group, we share a wide range of customs, norms and 
beliefs. Thus, we tend to share a lot of important features of ‘who we are’ with 
members of our most important groups. Also, at an even more basic level, people 
tend to join together with, and have more liking for, people who are in close prox-
imity with themselves (Festinger et al., 1950). 
From their group memberships, people can also receive social support. In times 
of hardship or stress, groups can provide a foundation for individuals and insulate 
them from the harmful effects of stress (Cohen and Wills, 1985). Indeed, people 
often actively seek support groups for their specific problems. One good example

Belonging
is Alcoholics Anonymous groups that provide people with social support and 
encouragement to beat alcohol addiction. 
By being in groups people satisfy their basic need for affiliation and to belong. 
According to sociometer theory (Baumeister and Leary, 1995; Leary and Baumeister, 
2000), it is adaptive for people to be included in groups and build relationships with 
others because social inclusion enhances our self-esteem (see our review of sociom-
eter theory in Chapter 2). In support of this view, Leary, Tambor, Terdal and Downs 
(1995) demonstrated that people’s self-esteem was higher in situations where they 
felt themselves to be included than when they felt excluded (where levels of self-
esteem were depressed). Leary et al. argue that self-esteem is therefore a measure of 
the effectiveness of our social relationships. If self-esteem is high, this means that 
our group memberships are stable; but if it is low, we seek ways to improve it such 
as attempting to improve our inclusion in groups. Ultimately, we do not want to be 
excluded from desirable groups, or be left to feel lonely, so we attempt to ‘repair’ 
our group memberships to enhance our personal self-esteem. 
Terror management
Another social psychological reason for people to affiliate with others derives 
from terror management theory (Greenberg, Pyszczynski and Solomon, 1986; 
Pyszczynski, Greenberg, Solomon et al., 2004). According to this theory, human 
awareness of the inevitability of one’s own death (mortality salience) creates a 
continuous source of ‘existential anguish’. People therefore attempt to reduce this 
terror by organizing, structuring and giving meaning to their lives. They can do 
this in a variety of ways, as we discussed in Chapter 2, and the central mechanism 
for managing this terror of death appears to be one’s self-esteem. According to 
this account, joining with others and being in groups raises one’s self-esteem and 
feelings of self-worth. Our views are validated and our anxiety about death is 
reduced. In short, we feel good (and sometimes even immortal) when we affiliate 
with others and this helps us manage the idea, always in the back of our minds, 
that our lives are finite. 
Greenberg, Pyszczynski, Solomon et al. (1990) demonstrated how this makes 
us feel about people in general. They found that when people are reminded of 
their own death, their feelings of attraction to people to consensually validate their 
own beliefs increases and their attraction to those who threaten their beliefs 
decreases. Thus, mortality salience may not only enhance our desire to affiliate 
and join groups but may also mean that we develop a strong preference for our 
own groups and, in particular, our larger ‘ideological’ groups (Hogg, Hohman and 
Rivera, 2008). This may also have implications for how ingroup members deal 
with deviants who do not uphold the values of the group. It may also influence 
how we feel about other groups, therefore having implications for ingroup favour-
itism, prejudice and intolerance. We discuss some of these aspects in more detail in 
Chapter 11 on intergroup relations. 
Research by Wisman and Koole (2003) highlights quite another response to 
mortality salience. Students from two Dutch universities were exposed to a

The social group
standard manipulation of mortality salience, being 
asked to describe the emotions they feel when thinking 
about their own death, and what happens to them when 
they physically die. In the control group, participants 
were asked much the same questions about watching 
TV, with no mention of mortality. After this manipula-
tion, students were invited to take a seat, and told that 
other students were about to join them in a discussion 
group. These (fictional) students did not necessarily 
share participants’ own worldview: half the participants 
were told that the other students opposed Dutch values 
such as tolerance and democracy. Regardless of whether participants believed 
other students opposed or supported their own worldviews, participants were 
more likely to sit in a clustered chair, rather than an isolated chair, following the 
mortality salience manipulation (see Figure 8.15). Thus, it would seem that under 
threat of mortality, people do not want to be alone; they prefer company. As we 
have seen, groups provide us not only with a shared worldview, but also satisfy 
our deep human need to belong. As we shall see in Chapter 11, one of the func-
tions of a shared worldview may be precisely to satisfy our need to belong, since it 
provides us with a common understanding of the world within which we can 
relate to each other. Wisman and Koole’s (2003) findings suggest that when the 
two needs are placed in conflict, the need to belong may sometimes actually over-
ride the need to validate our worldviews. 
The need for social identity
Another function that groups perform is to provide us with a social identity. 
According to social identity theory (Tajfel and Turner, 1979; Turner, Hogg, Oakes et 
al., 1987), there are two broader types of identities that make up the self. These are 
one’s personal identity (defined by one’s personal characteristics and relationships) 
and one’s social identity (defined by one’s group memberships). While personal 
identity is associated with our own personal behaviour and close personal rela-
tionships, social identity is associated with our behaviour within (and between) 
groups. As we saw in Chapter 2 our personal identity is important to our self-
concept. However, our social identities are also important to us. For example, we 
often label ourselves and identify strongly with our national groups, our peer 
groups and our sporting groups. Therefore, according to this perspective, we need 
to be part of groups to complete our definition of who we are. In different circum-
stances, we see ourselves in terms of our personal and social identities to the extent 
that one is more salient than the other. For example, in a meeting on gender rela-
tions in the workplace, we might be more likely to consider ourselves as a man or 
a woman, but when watching a cricket match, we might be strongly aware of our 
national identity. 
We identify groups as ‘fuzzy’ sets of characteristics and attributes that define 
what one group is and differentiate it from other groups. We can do this in many

Belonging
different ways, perhaps by first grouping people together in terms of familiar 
categories that we use regularly (e.g., based on what people look like, how they 
behave) and then more complex ways if familiar and readily accessible categories 
do not work. Once we have worked out a category, we then recognize additional 
information about the category that we ‘store’ as a prototype. This prototype 
describes the group’s characteristics but also determines how people within the 
group are expected to behave and think. The process of identifying with a group 
involves self-categorization of oneself as a group member (Turner et al., 1987). 
Once we do this, we see ourselves as group members whose attitudes, feelings and 
behaviours are driven by the group. In other words, our perception of ourselves 
becomes depersonalized and we consider ourselves through the perspective of the 
group prototype and its associated behaviours and attitudes. It has been argued 
that categorization as a group member is a precondition for determining group 
membership itself and that interdependence is a product of the process of social 
categorization (Platow, Grace and Smithson, 2012). Social categorization is also 
argued to be a necessary precondition for any affective feelings that go with group 
membership (McGarty, 1999). 
The content of the prototype also determines how we feel about ourselves 
personally. When we identify with a group, we identify with the characteristics of 
that group, including its values, prestige and status. It is therefore in our interests 
to categorize ourselves as members of esteemed groups because if our self-concept 
derives in part from our social identities, then so too may our self-esteem (Abrams 
and Hogg, 1988; Long and Spears, 1997). We will all be able to remember times 
when we felt good about our favourite sports team winning a major competition – 
being associated with positively valued groups makes us feel good. It is also in our 
interests to protect or enhance the esteem of the groups we belong to and cannot 
leave (e.g., our gender or ethnicity). In general, we need to feel good about 
ourselves and one way to do this is to feel good about the groups we belong to. As 
we will see in Chapter 11, people’s motivation to derive positive self-esteem from 
being members of groups is an important factor in determining ingroup favou-
ritism. Showing a preference for the ingroup is a way of feeling good about the 
group and also a way of feeling good about the self. For example, it has been found 
that people who are given the opportunity to discriminate against an outgroup 
show higher levels of self-esteem (Lemyre and Smith, 1985). In summary, groups 
are self-defining and determine important aspects of our self-concept. Social iden-
tity is implicated in a wide range of social psychological phenomena and so we 
will revisit social identity theory many times throughout this book. 
A related idea about what groups can do for us also derives from social identity 
theory. This argument proposes that group membership delivers people from a 
state of subjective uncertainty. Too much uncertainty about who we are and what 
we are supposed to do can feel uncomfortable (Hogg, Hohman and Rivera, 2008). 
Because identifying with groups tells us a lot about who we are and how we are 
supposed to behave, group memberships remove a lot of uncertainty from our 
everyday lives (Hogg, 2007). We then know how to behave and we can also predict

how people are likely to behave towards us. Hogg, Sherman, Dierselhuis et al. 
(2007) found that people identify with groups when they feel themselves in a state 
of uncertainty and the group is able to reduce that uncertainty, as may be the case 
for highly entitative groups.

Optimal distinctiveness
Identifying with groups can make people feel positive about themselves even when 
the groups do not help relieve uncertainty. Also, the groups do not have to be posi-
tive. This is partly because we do not just want to achieve a positive view of 
ourselves, but also a clear, coherent view of ourselves as a person who is distinct 
from others (e.g., see self-concept clarity in Chapter 2). The idea of optimal distinc-
tiveness is that people generally like to distinguish themselves from others and see 
themselves as unique individuals. At the same time, they also feel the need to affil-
iate with others. Group membership helps people meet both these needs. People 
can distinguish themselves from others who belong to different groups, and they 
are also connected or affiliated with others who are similar to themselves (Brewer, 
1991). Finding this optimal distinctiveness satisfies two fundamental needs. 
Following optimal distinctiveness theory and deriving ideas from social iden-
tity theory, Hornsey and Jetten (2004) identified eight strategies that people can 
adopt in order to meet the balance between the need to be different and the need 
to belong:
1 Identify with a numerically distinct group: Small groups tend to command more 
loyalty because they satisfy the need for belonging and affiliation/inclusion 
without sacrificing a person’s sense of distinctiveness. This is the basic argu-
ment formed from optimal distinctiveness theory (Brewer, 1991, 1993; Brewer 
and Weber, 1994). The assumption here is that smaller groups (e.g., minority

Belonging
political parties, smaller work groups) will offer more distinctiveness than 
larger groups but still satisfy people’s need to belong. 
2 Identify with a subgroup: Sometimes we identify with subgroups and subcate-
gories in order to achieve numerical distinctiveness. For example, political 
parties often contain formalized subgroups or factions that reflect different 
opinions or ideologies within the overarching ethos of the party (e.g., moderate 
and hard-line Republican groups). 
3 Identify with a ‘non-mainstream’ group: Some groups pride themselves on 
being ‘different’ from the mainstream group. People can join these types of 
groups to maintain their sense of belonging to a group while keeping their 
distinctiveness from other groups. An example of this might be the punk move-
ment in the 1970s. People looked different, behaved differently and had 
different attitudes from the mainstream – even though they shared these things 
in common (so in some ways they were less distinctive than they thought), they 
still maintained their distinctiveness from the mainstream. 
4 Enhance the distinctiveness of one’s group: People can maintain the distinctive-
ness of the group by perceptually enhancing the group’s distinctiveness. This 
strategy draws on social identity theory and the notion that people are motivated 
to accentuate the similarities within their group and the differences between 
their group and other groups (Tajfel and Wilkes, 1963; Turner et al., 1987). 
5 Differentiate oneself within a group through roles: People can achieve distinc-
tiveness within a group by adopting a specific role. Having a specific role within 
a group (e.g., mother in a family, IT specialist in a small company) means that 
the need for distinctiveness is met while the person still feels that they belong in 
a group. 
6 Identify with a group that prescribes individualism: Many groups are character-
ized by norms of individualism and independence (e.g., national groups such as 
being British). In this case, what it means to conform to the group’s norms is 
changed, so that the conformity essentially becomes an expression of distinc-
tiveness or differentiation. 
7 See oneself as loyal but not conformist: Using this strategy, people rationalize their 
own conformist behaviour. Instead of seeing one’s behaviour as conformist, it is 
possible to see the behaviour as the actions of a loyal group member. In doing so, 
they feel part of the group but also maintain their need to be independent. 
8 See oneself as more normative than other group members: People show a general 
tendency to consider themselves to be more normative or typical than other 
group members. For example, when cooperativeness is considered to be group 
normative, people see themselves as more cooperative than other group 
members (Codol, 1975, 1984). This bias reflects an attempt to maintain the 
unique self while still being a part of a group and behaving in a manner that is 
socially acceptable to the group. 
Recently, Spears, Ellemers and Doosje (2009) demonstrated another process 
that helps people balance their need for distinctiveness with their need for connec-
tion with others. They showed that people tend to like a majority to share their 

381
The social group
ideological opinions (e.g., on the importance of the environment), but prefer to be 
a member of a minority with respect to matters of taste, such as preferences for 
TV channels. Thus, sharing one’s opinions with others helps people to feel they 
belong and have social support, but sharing tastes with a smaller number of others 
helps people to maintain an optimal level of distinctiveness from others.

Ostracism and social exclusion
So far we have discussed mostly positive aspects of group life. However, another 
significant drive to our need for groups is that we simply do not want to be left 
out. When we are not part of a desired group, we feel lonely, are deprived of 
social interaction, miss out on achieving important goals, lose a sense of how we 
should behave and of who we are. Social psychological research on social ostra-
cism demonstrates some of the negative consequences we suffer when we are left 
out of groups. 
Exploring further Many uS high school comedies and dramas depict the phenomenon of ‘cliques’ and how being 
left out of cliques and ostracized by particular groups can be painful. Some recent examples are Mean Girls (2004), 
Never Been Kissed (1999), 10 Things I Hate About You (1999) and American Pie (1999).
In a significant body of research, Kip Williams and colleagues have investigated 
the many ways in which social ostracism can affect people (Gonsalkorale and 
Williams, 2007; Smith and Williams, 2004; Williams, 2009; Williams, Cheung and 
Choi, 2000; Williams, Govan, Croker et al., 2002; Williams and Sommer, 1997; 
Zadro, Williams and Richardson, 2004). Many of these studies have used a unique 
computer program (the Cyberball program) to simulate a ball-tossing game. In a 
typical experiment, a person sits behind a computer where they believe themselves 
to be playing a ball-tossing game with two other participants. In fact, these 
supposed other participants are not ‘real’ participants but are created by the 
program. The participant starts playing the game and at first the ball throwing is 
equitable – everyone has the ball thrown to them an equal number of times. 
However, after a few trials, the experiment changes and participants might find 
themselves in a condition where they are no longer thrown the ball. In this condi-
tion, they are ostensibly being ostracized from the game by the other two partici-
pants. How does this make them feel? Williams’ findings suggest that people who 
are ostracized feel sad, angry and psychologically distressed. These responses are 
similar to the effects of physical ostracism or when someone gives us the ‘cold 
shoulder’ or ‘silent treatment’ in real life. Interestingly, ostracism seems to hurt 
even when it comes from a despised outgroup. For example, Gonsalkorale and 
Williams (2007) showed that people felt the negative effects of social ostracism 
even when people who were supposedly members of the Ku Klux Klan would not 
involve them in the Cyberball game.

ETHICS AND rESEArCH METHODS
Further, ostracism has also been found to cause us physical pain. 
In a study where participants played the Cyberball game while lying 
in an MRI scanner, Eisenberger, Lieberman and Williams (2003) 
showed that the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex – a region of the 
brain activated when physical pain is experienced  – was activated 
during Cyberball ostracism. Further, activation of this brain region 
was significantly related to later self-reports of psychological distress. 
These studies demonstrate that the psychological pain people experi-
ence when they are ostracized is closely related to real physical pain. 
MacDonald and Leary (2005) offer a theoretical perspective 
concerning the pain of social exclusion and argue that social exclu-
sion is perceived as painful because the way people react to rejection 
is directly influenced by aspects of the physical pain system.

The social group
Chapter summary
In this chapter, we have explored why groups are so important 
to people. We have explained how and why groups form and 
what they mean to individuals who belong to them. We have 
also discussed how the norms or ‘rules’ of group behaviour 
develop, and the consequences of violating group norms. We 
have also outlined some of the negative aspects of group 
membership, such as when groups break up and the negative 
consequences for people who are left out of groups. 
Specifically, you will have learned that:
•  There are many different definitions of a group. However, it 
is generally agreed that the minimum requirement for a 
group to exist is that people perceive themselves to be part 
of the group. However, we have also argued that groups can 
only really exist if they can be compared to other groups. So, 
with a sense of ‘us-ness’ (our ingroups) there must also be a 
sense of ‘them-ness’ (our outgroups). 
•  There are many different types of groups and groups vary on 
several dimensions, such as being big, small, structured and 
unstructured. They may be cohesive or ‘bound together’ as a 
unit, or they may not. They may form differently – some 
groups may be a part of our self from birth (e.g., our ethnicity) 
or we may join a group to get a specific task done. These latter 
groups are said to go through stages of development or 
socialization over time so that they achieve maximum 
effectiveness. However, despite these differences between 
groups, a common feature of groups is that they determine 
important features of our selves. Our groups determine who 
we are, how we behave and our attitudes and beliefs. 
•  One key feature of groups is that they almost always have a 
set of rules or norms that specify how group members are 
supposed to be behave. These may be implicit or explicit. 
They may be enforced or not enforced. either way, norms are 
strong determinants of our behaviours. They can also 
influence or even change what we think. 
•  In addition to social norms, groups often have well-defined 
social roles or shared expectations of how particular 
individuals in the group are supposed to behave. Like norms, 
these are powerful determinants of our behaviour. 
Sometimes, roles are good for the group – they keep people 
focused on the task and a division of labour is established that 
helps the group function to its potential. However, sometimes 
people can be ‘locked’ inside a role and its rigid behaviour, 
which can have negative consequences and cause us conflict. 
•  We have also discussed what happens to people when they 
do not quite fit into groups. Deviant or marginal group 
members who stray too far from group norms are often 
disliked and shunned by the group. These people can 
become ‘black sheep’, who are disliked more by their own 
groups even than outgroup members. Likewise, impostors 
who illegitimately claim ingroup status are rejected and 
spurned by the group. Sometimes, however, breakoff groups 
can emerge via a process of schism, or natural subgroups can 
exist effectively under the umbrella of a larger group. 
•  Finally, we discussed what groups do for us. First, groups 
help us to achieve things that we would struggle to achieve 
without others – interdependence is often a key to success. 
People also join or identify with groups to satisfy their needs 
for social support and affiliation. Group memberships are 
also helpful to us in coping with the inevitability of our own 
death. Groups provide us with a social identity. They also 
help us balance our need to be distinctive or different with 
our basic human need to belong. As we saw from the 
research on ostracism, being excluded from groups, and 
therefore being deprived of the opportunity to fulfil those 
needs, can have negative social and even physical 
consequences. In short, it is clear that people need groups to 
satisfy some basic needs.
Our concern in this chapter has been on the nature of the 
group and the relationship between the individual and the 
group. In Chapter 9, we turn to the study of how groups are

identifying with them, helps us meet several needs – the need 
for self-esteem, to belong, and yet to be distinctive. Groups also 
provide us with opportunities for successful social interaction, 
by helping put us in contact with other people with whom we 
have a shared identity and a shared set of values and 
understandings. Recently, researchers have been examining the 
consequences of social identity for our physical health. In so 
doing, they are working at the overlapping boundaries of social 
psychology and health psychology. Findings reveal that social 
identity brings with it a range of significant health benefits 
(Haslam, Jetten, Postmes and Haslam, 2009). 
Traditionally, social identity theory (and self-categorization 
theory) have been concerned with simple identities – what 
happens to us as a result of belonging to a single group? For the 
first two or three decades of research in this tradition, 
researchers paid little attention to the fact that each person 
belongs to multiple social groups. Indeed, the theories tended

The social group
to assume that, psychologically speaking, only one group 
membership can be prominent in our minds at any given time. 
This claim, known as functional antagonism, holds that being 
aware of one group membership tends to suppress awareness 
of the other groups to which one belongs. Thus, in a given 
moment, our social world is reduced to the people, history, 
norms, values and traits of the ingroup versus the outgroup. 
However, over time, this claim became less plausible, and 
increasingly out of touch with several meaningful and 
important effects that were emerging in the study of social 
identity and intergroup relations. For example, as we shall see 
in Chapter 12, one of the most promising and often-tested 
methods of reducing prejudice involves making people aware 
of more than one group identity. For example, ethnic prejudice 
may be reduced when people are aware that they do not just 
belong to a given ethnic group, but also to another group such 
as the identity ‘university student’. On balance, intergroup 
relations appear to be improved when people have a 
multifaceted, complex social identity. 
A recent line of research explores the importance of having 
multiple social identities on our ability to cope with stress and 
illness. The theoretical idea behind this research is that since it 
boosts the clarity and value of our self-concept, social identity is 
a psychological resource that boosts our resilience in the face of 
stress and adversity. In a longitudinal study, Iyer, Jetten, 
Tsivrikos et al. (2009) found that British students coped better 
with the transition to university when they started out with 
more social identities – when they could recount, in other 
words, a higher number of groups to which they belonged. In a 
study of patients at a hospital in Devon, Jones, Williams, Jetten 
et al. (2012) found that patients were less likely to develop 
post-traumatic stress symptoms after a brain injury if they 
formed new group memberships at the time of their injury. 
While these studies are longitudinal, and therefore are able 
to suggest that multiple social identities lead to improved 
coping rather than the other way around, it is always desirable 
to run experiments to gain a more convincing picture of cause 
and effect relationships. This was precisely the aim of Jones and 
Jetten (2011), who asked Australian students to categorize 
themselves in terms of one, three or five social group 
memberships. They were then asked to do the cold pressor 
task – to submerge their nondominant hand in a bucket of ice-
cold water and keep it in there for as long as they could stand it. 
By the way, this task hurts. And it is not to be tried at home, 
since there is a risk of injury if not professionally conducted and 
supervised (Mitchell, MacDonald and Brodie, 2004). Results 
showed that participants in the latter group, who defined 
themselves in terms of five group membership, were able to 
keep their hands in water for roughly twice as long (44.5 
seconds) as those who had defined themselves in terms of one 
group membership (22.9 seconds). The experimental findings 
offer striking support for the idea that being aware of our 
multiple social identities helps us to cope with life’s challenges. 
These are clearly important results from the point of view of the 
theory of social identity and its application to wellbeing.

severe budget cuts. It is proposed that funding for social and

above, write an argument for the value of the social and club 
activities of your school/university (max. 300 words). 
2 In a major study (Barber, eccles and Stone, 2001; eccles and 
Barber, 1999; eccles, Barber, Stone and Hunt, 2003), it was 
found that children who were involved in team sports 
tended to go on to like school more, gain higher grades in 
their final year of school, attend university, stay at university 
for longer, and then get a job that gave them autonomy and 
a meaningful career path. (On the risky flipside, they tended 
to binge drink more, no doubt because of the drinking 
culture often associated with team sports.) On the basis of 
the studies you have read about in this section, do you think 
these benefits would apply, to the same extent, for 
individual sports or other extracurricular activities? Finally, 
how do you think team sports might be beneficial to 
wellbeing, leaving aside the fact that belonging to a team 
gives you an additional social identity? In other words, how 
else might team sports boost your wellbeing? 
3 Jones and Jetten (2011) note that apart from providing us 
with social identity, groups do us good in other ways. For 
example, many groups provide friendship networks and 
social support. Jones and Jetten (2011, p. 242) were 
interested in the ‘mere salience of an increasing number of 
groups’, rather than these additional benefits. Thus, they 
deliberately asked people to categorize themselves in terms 
of memberships of social categories, rather than list the 
friendship, family and other more intimate social groups 
that they belong to. But going further, if their argument is 
right – and belonging to many groups gives us a purely 
existential identity boost that is independent of other 
benefits that groups bring – then we would expect variables 
such as ‘self-evaluations, and/or self-knowledge’ (p. 243) to 
mediate their effects. That is, listing a higher number of 
groups helps us cope because it increases variables such as 
self-esteem and self-concept clarity (see Chapter 2). 
However, by their own admission, they did not test for this 
pattern of mediation. So, it remains unclear why awareness 
of multiple group membership is a boon to coping. If you 
were replicating their study, but wanted to measure 
variables that might mediate their effects, what would you

Laura Crookston studied as an 
undergraduate student at the 
university of york and her

considered how our perceptions and 
evaluations of people – including 
ourselves – do not always take their 
unique individual characteristics into 
account. Instead, we often see ourselves and others in terms of 
social categories. Laura’s project explored the extent to which 
people’s perceptions of weight are categorical.  
My topic and aims
Body image is a key interest of mine, especially after having 
done a lot of work with eating disorders through volunteering 
for the charity Beat. I believe everyone at some point has seen 
someone walking down the street and either thought or said 
out loud that they thought the person was too skinny or 
overweight. I wanted to examine if people just used these two 
categories or instead judged people’s weight on a continuum. 
Women’s weight is a much more salient cultural concern than 
men’s, and women are much more accustomed to thinking 
about weight. I was therefore interested in whether men and 
women are judged differently, and whether male and female 
observers judge weight differently.  
My methods
To examine whether body size was perceived in terms of 
categories, I adapted a method used by cognitive psychologists 
to assess categorical perception, which is when a continuous 
dimension, like the colour spectrum, is perceived as consisting 
of categories, like ‘green’ and ‘blue’. To adapt this method for 

387
The social group
body size, images of two male and two female bodies were 
morphed so that they ranged on 11 points from apparently 
lightest to heaviest. On a computer, participants were shown 
one body on its own and then two bodies that were 20 per cent 
different in size. Participants had to identify which of the two 
images matched the one shown on its own. Categorical 
perception would be indicated if participants were more 
accurate at choosing between bodies perceived as belonging to 
different size categories than when choosing between bodies 
perceived to belong to the same size category. 
Two further tasks were administered. In the first, participants 
were shown each image one at a time and had to classify each 
as ‘overweight’ or ‘not overweight’. In the second, the largest 
and smallest bodies were shown on either side of the screen 
and in the centre one of the remaining nine bodies was shown. 
Participants had to indicate whether the central body looked 
most like the large or small body. These tasks measured the size 
at which male and female bodies were judged to be 
overweight, allowing us to assess whether female bodies were 
held to stricter standards than male bodies.
My findings and their implications
Categorical perception was found for male but not for female 
bodies. That is, participants were better able to discriminate 
male bodies on the border between overweight and not 
overweight, relative to male bodies that were more clearly 
overweight or not. This was not found for female bodies. These 
results suggest that male bodies are perceived in terms of 
simple categories, as either overweight or not overweight, 
whereas female bodes are perceived as varying along a 
continuum. Another finding was that female bodies were 
judged as ‘overweight’ sooner than male bodies, suggesting 
female bodies are held to stricter criteria. There were no 
significant differences between results from the male and 
female participants.
The differences in the way male and female bodies are 
perceived may be due to the way society treats male and 
female bodies differently. For instance, male clothes sizes are 
generally ‘small’, ‘medium’ and ‘large’, whereas women’s 
clothes are sized in a much more gradual way. A greater focus 
on women’s bodies relative to men’s may lead to more detailed 
cognitive representations of female bodies, and stricter 
standards. On the other hand, that male bodies were perceived 
categorically suggests overweight men may be more prone to 
being stereotyped. Further research is needed to explore these 
possibilities, but the results of this study suggest that the way 
society perceives male and female bodies may influence the 
way individuals perceive them at a fundamental level.

In this chapter, you will learn about social influence – the effect that others have on our 
thoughts, feelings and behaviours. Through an analysis of classic research, you will learn how 
people respond to social influence in different ways depending on their own personal charac-
teristics and the characteristics of the situation. You will learn about the ways in which people 
resist social influence, and how minorities are able to influence majorities. By the end of the 
chapter, you will have a comprehensive understanding of this core topic in social psychology.

1 Imagine you are in a room with 10 of your peers,  
voting on who will be the next president of the tennis 
club. everyone before you votes for Jo but you really 
want Malika to get the job. Who will you vote for?  
What conditions would make it easier for you to vote  
for Malika?
2 How would you explain the actions of an rAF pilot who, 
when asked to drop bombs on an Iraqi village, does so 
without question?

Belonging
No doubt in your recreational reading, watching TV or chatting with your friends, 
you have come across a tale or two about social influence – the effect that others 
have on our thoughts, feelings and behaviours. There is a good chance that some 
of these tales were cautionary, for example about the evils of peer pressure or the 
perils of falling in with ‘the wrong crowd’. People in Western countries are accus-
tomed to seeing social influence as a bad thing, partly because of the value they 
place on the independence and freedom of the individual (McAuliffe, Jetten, 
Hornsey and Hogg, 2003). Indeed, social influence clearly leads people to harm 
themselves or others, and academics, policy makers and law enforcers have 
recently become interested in radicalization, a special type of social influence in 
which people are encouraged to strike out at a society they are led to believe is 
fundamentally wrong or immoral (e.g., Ryan, 2007). 
Although social influence can be harmful, it is easy to think of any number of 
cases in which social influence is beneficial. Through social influence processes 
such as conformity, compliance and obedience, human beings adhere to social 
norms that make peaceful coexistence and cooperation possible (see Chapter 8). 
Imagine what the drive to university or work would be like if everybody 
completely ignored the rules of the road, or getting your lunch at a busy cafeteria 
if no one had any respect for queues. One of the reasons these social norms are 
adhered to is that people enforce them. People are inclined to criticize and punish 
those whom they see violating the norms of the group (e.g., Marques, Yzerbyt and 
Leyens, 1988; Rucker, Polifronti, Tetlock and Scott, 2004). It is no coincidence 
therefore that many violent crimes occur in places that cannot be surveilled by 
members of the public, such as poorly lit streets, large crowds and, indeed, private 
homes. Just as they dislike and punish deviants, people are inclined to like and 
reward those who behave prosocially and thus enhance the lives of others (e.g., 
Wedekind and Milinski, 2000). 
Conformity is the most widely studied and general form of social influence. 
Conformity is defined as the convergence of one’s thoughts, feelings and behaviours 
with an external standard. One form of conformity is compliance, where people do 
as they are asked and as they are required to act by formal regulations. For 
example, everyone tends to pay their taxes. 
Another type of conformity is obedience, where people do as they are told by a 
powerful or authoritative figure. For example, children tend to do things when 
instructed to do so by their parents. However, conformity is possible when no 
one is around to ask or tell you what to do, to give you orders or scrutinize what 
you are doing. Specifically, people often conform to norms, which allow others to 
influence them even when those others are not present in the here and now. Most 
important are the injunctive norms of the group – the norms that are perceived as 
being approved of by other people. These norms prescribe what we should do and 
proscribe what we should not do (see Chapter 8). 
Much of our understanding of social influence has developed from a number of 
classic 20th-century studies. These studies demonstrate the power of norms to 
guide behaviour and the command that groups have over individuals’ thoughts

and actions. We will begin by outlining some of the important findings from these 
studies and consider some of the key elements of social influence. We will then 
discuss when, why and how social influence takes place and outline the processes 
that occur when people resist social influence. Finally, we will consider the unique 
case of minority social influence, where small groups or individuals bring about 
social change against the odds. 
Classic studies of social influence
Sherif’s studies of emergent group norms
Sherif (1935, 1937) provided one of the first compelling demonstrations of social 
influence in his study of the emergence of social norms. Sherif investigated the 
emergence of social norms in now classic laboratory experiments. He argued that 
because people have a basic need to feel that they are thinking and acting appro-
priately in social situations, they will probably use other people as frames of refer-
ence to guide their own thoughts and actions. In particular, people use others as 
social comparators under conditions of uncertainty or ambiguity; that is, when 
they are unsure how to respond, they will look to others for examples, informa-
tion and guidance. Because they do this, people also have a tendency to prefer 
moderate or ‘average’ positions because they are the most frequent and are hence 
perceived as the most appropriate or correct. Sherif argued that this basic prefer-
ence for moderateness explains how norms emerge in groups and how the conver-
gence of group members to the emergent norms can intensify consensus within 
groups. If people use others as a frame of reference, their behaviours should 
converge over time and people will also use that information to guide future 
behaviours and judgements. 
Sherif (1935) carried out experiments in which he asked two or three partici-
pants to sit in a darkened room and observe a pinpoint of light. A visual illusion 
called the autokinetic effect makes the light look as though it is moving in the 
dark – this illusion is a result of eye movements occurring when physical objects 
are not present to act as frames of reference. At this point in the study, the light 
suddenly disappeared and participants (who were unaware of the visual illusion) 
were asked to estimate how much the light had moved. Using this technique, 
Sherif capitalized on the fact that participants would be uncertain about their 
judgements and would need to establish their own internal frame of reference. 
Over 100 trials, Sherif discovered that participants did just that – as time passed, 
their estimates converged to a small range of responses, so that each participant 
adopted their own personal frame of reference. 
Later, Sherif (1935) asked participants to perform the same task, but instead of 
making their estimates on their own, they were asked to call out their responses in 
a group of two or three other participants. Here, the results showed that partici-
pants quickly started to agree with each other, and responses converged, so that a 
group normative estimate evolved after only a short number of trials. By the third 

392
Belonging
and fourth testing session, a strong group norm had developed and everyone’s 
estimates had become similar (see Figure 9.1a). Sherif argued that in this task, the 
group members questioned the internal frame of reference they had developed 
earlier and instead used each others’ estimates to guide their own responses. So, 
gradually, a joint frame of reference was established, which informed future judge-
ments. Indeed, further testing demonstrated that this norm persisted over time, 
even when participants were asked again to provide their own individual estimates. 
After three group testing phases, participants’ individual responses relied strongly 
on the group normative estimates that had been established earlier (see Figure 
9.1b). When the participants saw how others had responded, they modified their 
responses and, as a group, converged on a consistent answer. 
Time to reflect Sherif’s work demonstrates that people use the attitudes and behaviours of others to guide their 
own responses. In particular, people tend to do this when they are unsure of their own position. Can you think of a 
time when this happened to you? Was this a good or bad thing?
Subsequent investigations corroborated Sherif’s findings. For example, Jacobs 
and Campbell (1961) conducted the same experiment but this time used only one 
participant. The other group members in the study were confederates who had 
been asked to respond in a predetermined (and often extreme) manner. Again, 
results revealed that the majority norm influenced individual participants’ esti-
mates (see also MacNeil and Sherif, 1976). Rohrer, Baron, Hoffman and Swander 
(1954) demonstrated that people retested individually a year later were still influ-
enced by the group norm. Overall, these experiments provide a cogent demon-
stration of the power of the group to influence individuals’ judgements, even 
when those judgements are trivial, meaningless and even false. In these studies, 
conformity to the group’s norm was a rational response to ambiguity. The norm 
provided a framework for individuals to judge the most appropriate response 
when they were unsure of their own individual judgements. The norm also guided 
behaviour even in the absence of the group (see Turner, 1991). In essence, the

norm was contagious. There are many real-life 
examples of norm formation and contagion. 
For example, some behaviours become more 
socially acceptable over time, such as talking 
on a mobile phone while using public trans-
port. Also, think of the language and symbols 
you use to email and text message your friends. 
Accepted ways of expressing emotion such as 
the use of emoticons have emerged among 
users and these have caught on in such a big 
way that most users are familiar with these 
norms of communication and use them (see 
Chapter 5). For new users who are uncertain 
how to communicate using these methods, the 
norms help guide their own behaviour.

people’s behaviour. What social norms can you see in action? Can you see any examples of norm violation and, if so,

Asch’s studies of conformity
Asch argued, along a similar vein to Sherif, that people look to others to help them 
decide how to act themselves, and that it is logical to do so in ambiguous situa-
tions when they are uncertain about how to behave. However, Sherif argued that 
when people are confident that their own judgements and behaviours are appro-
priate, they should not necessarily be affected by the norms of a group. In partic-
ular, when the appropriate judgement is unambiguous and one would expect no 
disagreement in judgement, individuals should resist group influence. 
Asch (1951, 1952, 1956) invited a group of male participants to take part in 
what was said to be a perceptual judgement task. They were seated around a 
table in a group of seven or nine. Only one man was a true participant; the rest 
were confederates who, as in Jacobs and Campbell’s (1961) study, had been 
asked to respond in a predetermined manner. The group was presented with a 
diagram of a standard line (see the left of Figure 9.3) and three comparison lines 
(see the right of Figure 9.3). The participants’ task was to choose which 
comparison line matched the standard line. Confederates and the participant 
were asked to call out their answers to the rest of the group, and the participant

was asked to respond second to last in the group. In the first trial, 
the judgement was easy – it was obvious which one was the correct 
line and everyone agreed. The participant took his turn and confi-
dently gave the correct response. In the second trial, everyone was 
again able to correctly identify the line that matched the target 
line. However, something more interesting happened on the third 
trial. As in the previous trials, it was obvious which one was the 
correct line, but this time all the confederates responded incor-
rectly. It was then the participant’s turn and he was faced with a 
confusing situation. How should he respond? He knew his peers 
were wrong but responding differently would make him stand out 
from the crowd. There were 18 trials altogether and the confeder-
ates were asked to give an incorrect response on 12 trials. There 
was also a control condition in which participants gave their 
responses privately, as individuals. 
Results revealed that, in the control group, where everyone gave their responses 
individually, 99 per cent of participants chose the correct line. This task was easy 
and unambiguous, and so there was no reason to expect that the norm formation 
observed by Sherif would occur. However, in the experimental group, where 
participants made their judgements alongside a group who gave clearly incorrect 
responses, approximately half the participants conformed to the group’s incorrect 
judgements in 6 or more of the crucial trials. Further, approximately 5 per cent of 
the participants conformed to the erroneous group decision in all 12 key trials. 
Indeed, the ‘average’ conformity rate across participants and trials was around 32 
per cent, and only one-quarter of participants showed no conformity at all. Asch 
(1955, p. 6) concluded:
That we have found the tendency to conformity in our society so strong that 
reasonably intelligent and well-meaning young people are willing to call white 
black is a matter of concern. It raises questions about our ways of education 
and about the values that guide our conduct. 
Such is the power of the group over the individual. 
Question to consider knowing what you now know about group influence, reread question 1 at the start of the 
chapter. Who do you think you would vote for, Jo or Malika? Why?
On the face of it, the participants in Asch’s experiments were under no obvious 
pressure to conform; that is, there were no consequences for conforming, being 
sensitive to group norms or for dissenting against them. Team players and indi-
viduals alike were not rewarded or punished for what they did. As such, these 
results are quite fascinating. In a situation where the consequences for participants’ 
actions are minimal, they should make their own choices, should they not? When 
participants in Asch’s studies were asked about how they felt, they reported expe-
riencing self-doubt and uncertainty. They reported a variety of feelings and

reasons for conforming, such as fear of disapproval, not wanting to stand out and 
feeling anxious. However, because the task itself was relatively trivial, researchers 
questioned the power of the findings to explain behaviour in more meaningful 
situations. In particular, if people react to such a trivial task in this way, how might 
they behave in a task that does have important consequences associated with the 
decision to conform or dissent? Also, if people conform so clearly on such a trivial 
task, how might they respond to an authority figure who is directly trying to 
coerce them? Are people blindly obedient to the orders of others, even when they 
are asked to perform cruel acts? Stanley Milgram wanted to know more about 
these processes. He sought to investigate specifically what happens if the social 
pressure to conform conflicts with the pressures of conscience. 
Milgram’s studies of obedience
Milgram (1965, 1974) was deeply concerned about the psychological properties of 
people who commit atrocities. Specifically, he was influenced by the 1961 trial of 
Adolf Eichmann (Arendt, 1963), who, as one of Hilter’s primary officers during 
the Second World War, sent millions of Jewish people to their death in Nazi 
concentration camps. Contrary to public expectation, Eichmann did not display 
the characteristics of an evil, cruel ‘monster’ when on trial. Instead, he presented 
as a normal, everyday, perhaps even boring, family man. When questioned about 
his actions, he stated that he had nothing in particular against Jewish people, he 
was merely ‘following orders’. The question raised by Eichmann’s trial is 
intriguing and addresses one of the fundamental aspects of human nature – if 
placed in a situation where the behaviour you were being asked to perform went 
against your conscience, how would you behave? If you were asked to hurt 
another human being, would you simply follow the order?
These questions inspired Milgram to conduct some of psychology’s most 
famous and controversial experiments (Blass, 1992, 2004). To begin his programme 
of research, Milgram placed an advertisement in a newspaper for male participants 
aged 20–50 to participate in a scientific study on memory and learning at Yale 
University. Once they arrived in the laboratory, they were informed that their 
task was to teach another person (the ‘student’) a series of paired words, and then 
test their memory for those words. The student was, in fact, a confederate who 
was trained to respond in a predetermined manner. If their partner made any 
errors, participants (‘teachers’) were required to punish them by giving electrical 
shocks. At this point, it is important to emphasize that no shocks were actually 
given to the students. The crucial aspect of this experiment is that the teachers all 
believed that they were going to administer painful shocks to students when they 
responded incorrectly. 
To begin, the teacher watched as the student was strapped into a chair and had 
paste and an electrode attached to his wrist (Figure 9.4a). The experimenter explained 
that the paste was to prevent blistering and burning. The experimenter also explained 
that although the shocks are painful, they would cause no permanent tissue damage. 
At this point in the experiment, the student explained to the experimenter that he 

396
Belonging
had a slight heart condition. Then the teacher was separated from the student and 
was seated in a room in front of a machine called the ‘shock generator’ (see Figure 
9.4b), while the experimenter was seated at a desk behind the teacher. 
The shock generator consisted of 30 switches, each incrementally rising by 15 
volts; so, voltage labels ranged from 15v (‘slight shock’), 75v (‘moderate shock’), 
135v (‘strong shock’), right through to 450v (‘XXX’). Underneath each voltage 
value and label was a push-down button that allowed the experimenter to admin-
ister the shocks. The teacher was given a small (real) sample shock of 45v, and the 
experiment began. The teacher began to teach the words to the student and then 
test their memory for the pairs. For each error, the teacher was instructed to 
administer the next level of shock to the student. The first error was ‘punished’ 
with a shock of 15v, the second with a shock of 30v and so on. If the 450v mark 
was reached, the teacher was asked to keep administering this shock every time 
the student made an error. 
As mentioned earlier, the student was a confederate, and so he was asked to 
respond in the same scheduled manner for every experimental participant. This is 
an important aspect of the study as it means that every participant had as close to 
the same experience of the experiment as possible. The script he was asked to 
follow is presented in Figure 9.5. He got some of the answers correct, but also 
made some incorrect responses, which were punished at a higher level of shock 
every time. After receiving a shock of 75v, he grunted ‘Ugh!’ At 180v he shouted 
that he could take no more and continued to cry with pain after each shock until 
he screamed with agony at 270v and then ceased to respond at all after 330v. The 
teacher was instructed to treat this non-response as an incorrect answer and keep 
flicking the switch to punish the student. 
Unsurprisingly, this was an extremely uncomfortable situation for the teachers 
and this was reflected in their behaviours. They often asked to stop the experiment 
and check that the student was okay. However, in response, the experimenter, like 
the confederate student, responded with a scripted set of four responses starting 
with ‘please continue’, followed by (after a further request to stop the experiment) 
‘the experiment requires that you continue’ and then, ‘it is absolutely essential that 
you continue’, and finally the most coercive instruction, ‘you have no other choice,

you must go on’. Milgram described his experiment to psychiatrists, middle-class 
adults and students, and asked them to predict how far people would be prepared 
to go in this experiment. What shock level would they go up to? People in all three 
groups thought they themselves would disobey at about 135v. None predicted that 
they would go above 300v. Similarly, people predicted that normal everyday people 
in general would never reach the XXX mark on the shock generator. The experts 
also agreed that probably only around 10 per cent of normal people would ever 
exceed 180v and that virtually nobody would persist to the conclusion of 450v 
(XXX) – maybe about one in a thousand people might do so. But were they 
correct? As can be seen from Figure 9.6, the 
reality differed significantly from the experts’ 
and others’ predictions. As predicted, obedi-
ence decreased as shock intensity increased. 
However, 63 per cent of teachers went up to 
and beyond the 450v XXX maximum shock 
level. Even after the four prompts to continue 
the experiment, some participants continued to 
punish the student and eventually the experi-
menter had to stop the participant from 
continuing with the study.

These results are significant for many reasons. First, we must remember that 
people were administering what they thought were extremely dangerous and 
painful shocks to another human being who had been screaming with pain to be 
let out and had complained that his heart was bothering him. This is surprising 
behaviour by any standards. Participants’ persistence with the task is even more 
surprising, given the obvious distress they were under. Many of the participants 
pleaded to stop the experiment, trembled, stuttered when they spoke, laughed 
nervously and even offered to take the student’s place. 
Exploring further There are several demonstrations of Milgram’s experiment online, including an example 
shown on the BBC in 2009. Take some time to watch an example and note the participants’ response to the task. You 
will notice that some were deeply uncomfortable with their task, so why did they continue?
Milgram’s results are also significant because they suggest that people’s attitudes 
often fail to determine their behaviour, especially when external influences over-
ride them. In this case, the experimental context, on the whole, had a greater influ-
ence on participants’ behaviour than their own wishes to go no further. 
ETHICS AND RESEARCH METHODS 
Ethics and the Milgram studies
For obvious reasons, Milgram’s studies sparked a great 
deal of debate about the ethics of conducting studies with 
the potential to cause psychological distress to 
participants; so much so that his application to join the 
American psychological Association was delayed for a year 
(for coverage of the ethical debate, see Baumrind, 1964, 
1985; Marcus, 1974; Miller, 1986, 2009). After all, it is not 
every day that participants in university research believe 
they are administering painful shocks to other people. In 
particular, critics pointed out that the participants 
experienced severe distress and that this distress could 
have lasting effects beyond leaving the laboratory. 
Further, they argued that the nature of the debrief, 
revealing that the participants had been the subjects of a 
huge hoax, could have a significant impact on participants’ 
self-esteem and future trust in others (Baumrind, 1964; 
Schlenker and Forsyth, 1977). 
In response to these criticisms, Milgram argued that he 
was concerned about the welfare of his experimental 
participants. He argued that his debrief was carefully 
constructed and delivered and that upon being debriefed, 
participants were actually relieved (not angry or upset) 
when they discovered that they had not been delivering 
painful shocks to another person. Further, in follow-up 
interviews and questionnaires administered to over 1,000 
experimental participants, Milgram found that over 83 per 
cent of participants said they were glad to have taken 
part, while just over 1 per cent were sorry to have taken 
part; 15 per cent reported neutral feelings (Milgram, 1992, 
2009). Interviews conducted with the aide of a psychiatrist 
indicated that there were no psychological ill effects for 
the participants. However, some critics have argued that 
these data are not enough to establish that his studies 
were ethical. If no participants suffered enduring distress, 
this may be a matter of good luck more than good 
management. The point is, these critics argue that Milgram 
took risks with the welfare of his participants that may not 
have been warranted. 
Milgram’s experiments have had a great impact on 
how social psychologists carry out their research today. In 
particular, these studies largely provided the rationale for 
introducing informed consent procedures in psychological 
experiments, where participants are informed of any 
potential negative impact (e.g., stress) they may 
experience and are fully debriefed about the purpose of 
the research once the study is concluded. If they are 
deceived in any way about the ‘true nature’ of the study, 
participants are fully informed of the purpose of this 

399
Social influence 
deception. Codes of ethics are in place to protect research 
participants from undue harm in doing psychological 
experiments. A discussion of research ethics in social 
psychology is presented in Chapter 1. 
Despite the controversy about ethics, we know much 
about conformity based on Milgram’s work and the classic 
studies of conformity. It is important to note that the 
experimental settings designed by Milgram, Asch and 
Sherif are very different from many real-life contexts 
requiring conformity (Darley, 1992). It is unclear whether 
obedience in Milgram’s laboratory task will extend to real-
life situations. Context matters, as we will see. For this 
reason, some have argued that continued replication of 
Milgram’s studies is needed (Burger, 2009; Miller, 2009). A 
specific unanswered question about Milgram’s research, 
for example, is whether the group memberships, or social 
identities, of the experimenter, teacher and victim 
influence obedience. Would there be even more 
obedience if the victim was a member of a disliked 
outgroup – as was the case in the Nazi atrocities that the 
Milgram studies were designed, in part, to simulate? For 
these reasons, Burger (2009) replicated the Milgram 
studies, with an important modification. He capped the 
shocks that could be delivered at 150 volts. He found that 
obedience up to this level was comparable to that 
observed by Milgram. The 150 volt level is important, 
since the majority of participants who disobeyed the 
experimenter in the original studies tended to do so at 
this point (Miller, 2009; packer, 2008). At the same time, at 
the 150 volt level, the teacher does not necessarily think 
they are delivering a dangerous, even lethal, dose of 
electricity to the student. Thus, many of the ethical 
difficulties surrounding the original Milgram study were 
averted. overall, the depressing conclusion is that we 
have no compelling reason to suppose that obedience 
levels would have declined in the decades separating us 
from Milgram’s studies. And in Burger’s (2009) results, we 
have evidence to suggest that they have not declined. 
Questions
1 There are two crucial questions to ask: Do you think 
Milgram’s study should have been conducted? Does the 
information gained outweigh the potential stress 
caused by the participants? This is one of the main 
considerations for people who are asked to review 
research ethics applications. Write down some points 
to justify your answer. There is plenty of commentary 
on the ethics of the Milgram studies, on the internet 
and in academic journals. Locate these sources by 
following the references cited in this section (eg., 
Miller, 2009), and also try searching for ‘Milgram 
ethics’. How do your views compare with those 
expressed by others? 
2 Imagine that Milgram had found – as his panel of 
bystanders had predicted – that few, if any, participants 
had obeyed the experimenter’s instructions. Do you 
think that people would be as likely to view the 
experiment as unethical? 
3 By today’s standards, Milgram’s procedure was rather 
extreme. For ethical reasons, it is unlikely that a 
researcher today would be permitted to conduct a 
study where participants believe themselves to be 
administering dangerous shocks to another person 
(but for partial replications, see Burger, 2009; and for a 
replication in a virtual reality environment, see Slater, 
Antley, Davison et al., 2006). What other methods 
might an experimenter use to elicit conformity? 
reading further in this chapter where we discuss some 
of the factors that influence conformity may help you 
answer this question. 
Importantly, the classic studies of social influence show that conformity often 
predominates over common sense. In the case of Milgram’s studies, conformity 
also clashes with the demands of conscience. These results have had a significant 
impact on many areas of social psychology and have provided the foundations for 
the study of social influence. However, before we turn our attention to some of 
the mechanisms underlying conformity, we need to discuss one last study that has 
significantly shaped how we view social influence. 
Question to consider reread question 2 at the start of the chapter. knowing what you know about obedience, 
how would you explain the action of the rAF pilot?

Try it yourself It is difficult to come to terms with Milgram’s findings. In lectures, we often show original footage 
of the Milgram study and students watch with muted giggles. We ask them what they think they would have done 
themselves if in the same situation and most respond with answers such as ‘I would never do that’, or ‘I could never 
give someone electric shocks’. It is difficult to believe that this behaviour is possible. But the reality is that many of 
them would do exactly what Milgram’s participants did. It is easy to demonstrate the powerful norm of obedience. 
For example, try standing by a doorway at university and tell students who try to go through the door that they 
cannot use it (you do not need to say any more than this). Count how many people turn away and find a different 
door, simply because they are told to do so. How does the number you counted map onto the figures observed by 
Milgram? Can you think of other demonstrations of conformity?
The Stanford Prison Experiment
Perhaps the results of Milgram’s experiments are not enough to shake your faith 
in the decency of ordinary men and women. After all, the participants in these 
experiments were only doing as they were told and they did not appear to enjoy 
it. Certainly, no participant went above and beyond the call of duty by, say, 
administering stronger than instructed shocks, or taunting their victims. Surely, 
we should not expect a group of ordinary people to engage in wilful, extensive and 
improvised tyranny while at close quarters with their victims? Well, they did, 
according to a famous study by Philip Zimbardo and his colleagues (Haney, Banks 
and Zimbardo, 1973). In the summer of 1971, this group of researchers posted a 
newspaper advertisement asking for male university students to participate in a 
‘psychological study of prison life’ for a period of one to two weeks. The study 
was to take place in Stanford University, situated in the San Francisco Bay area; 
ironically, well known as an unusually liberal region of the USA. Respondents 
were screened to ensure they were free of medical or psychological problems and 
did not have a criminal or violent past. The 24 eligible respondents were assigned 
randomly into ‘prisoner’ or ‘guard’ roles. 
A few days later, the ‘prisoners’ were surprised to find themselves arrested on 
criminal charges by officers from the local police force. Much like ‘real’ suspects, 
they were cuffed, searched, read their rights, bundled into a police car and taken to 
the police station for processing. The prisoners were then taken to the prison, 
which had been constructed in the basement of the psychology department. Here, 
they were extensively searched, stripped naked and sprayed with insecticide, again 
much as ‘real’ prisoners would be. They were further humiliated by virtue of 
being clothed in smocks – that is, uniforms that looked like dresses – as well as 
noisy, uncomfortable ankle chains and stockings on their heads meant to approxi-
mate the head-shaving that was often imposed on prisoners. Each prisoner was 
assigned a number, to be used in place of their name throughout their time in the 
prison. The guards were briefed by Zimbardo, who played the role of superin-
tendent of the prison, and his co-researchers, who played warden and lieutenant 
roles. They were dressed in a khaki-coloured uniform, carried a truncheon and 
wore mirrored sunglasses, which were meant to deindividuate them (see Chapter 
10 for more on this topic). They were given no specific training for the roles, but 
were charged with maintaining law and order in the prison. They made up a set of 
prison rules and were responsible for enforcing them.

Social influence 
The first day of the prison simulation passed without major incident, but a 
prisoner rebellion unexpectedly broke out the next day. This rebellion provoked a 
sharp and immediate lurch towards authoritarianism. Guards stripped prisoners 
of their privileges and, indeed, their clothes. This marked the beginning of an 
orchestrated campaign of harassment, degradation and intimidation visited by the 
guards upon the prisoners, although by no means all the guards played an enthusi-
astic role in this campaign. Prisoners were even denied the use of the toilet facili-
ties at night, being forced to urinate and defecate into buckets. They were also 
forced to clean the toilets with their bare hands. Eerily reminiscent of the abuse 
that was to occur over 30 years later in the US-run Abu Ghraib prison for Iraqi 
POWs, prisoners were also forced to simulate homosexual acts. Conditions 
became so filthy, oppressive and distressing that the experiment had to be stopped 
after only six days. By that stage, one prisoner had already left after suffering acute 
psychological distress, becoming irrational, incoherent and paranoid.
Time to reflect Accounts of uS military abuse and torture of prisoners held at Abu ghraib prison in Iraq arose in 
2004 after the release of photographs that appalled people around the world. How can Zimbardo’s Stanford prison 
experiment help us to understand these events?
It is rare to find a study in which so much care has been taken to create an 
emotionally impactful situation, one that seems real to participants and involves 
them completely. It is also rare to find a study that produced such incendiary and 
important results. Milgram had already shown that, in the right circumstances – 
indeed, circumstances that mimic the settings of many historical atrocities – ordi-
nary people can do extraordinarily appalling things. In contrast to the reluctant, 
morally conflicted obedience of Milgram’s participants, Zimbardo’s guards applied 
initiative, creativity and even some enthusiasm to the tasks demanded by the roles 
they had been given. 
Exploring further It is worth watching the 2007 film Die Welle (The Wave), where we see the influence of 
Milgram’s and Zimbardo’s work on the power of the situation. In this film, a high school teacher runs an experiment 
with his class to demonstrate to his students what life would be like under a dictatorship. The students become 
gripped by the new ‘fascist’ social order and the experiment spirals out of control.
CRITICAL FOCuS 
The Stanford Prison Experiment and the 
psychology of ‘evil’ 
Arguably, the Stanford prison experiment and Milgram’s 
studies are among the most important in social 
psychology. Their impact has been felt well beyond the 
disciplinary boundary of social psychology. In his recent 
book about the life and legacy of Milgram, Thomas Blass 
(2004) refers to him as the ‘man who shocked the world’. 
The media regularly mention Milgram’s work, and 
‘rediscover’ the studies periodically in response to topical 
examples of social influence and obedience. Many 
professions have taken note of his work – for example the 
uS army teaches Milgram’s findings to officers in training 

402
Belonging
in order to educate them about issues surrounding 
obedience (persaud, 2005). political scientists, sociologists 
and historians have drawn on Milgram’s and Zimbardo’s 
findings in their accounts of the appalling conflicts of the 
20th century and beyond (e.g., Browning, 1992). These 
experiments have also had an effect on the popular 
imagination. Some films are actually about fictional 
versions of these experiments, such as the german films 
Das Experiment (The Experiment) and Die Welle (The 
Wave). Milgram and Zimbardo’s influence can also be seen 
in the successful TV series, Lost, in which survivors of a 
plane crash are stranded on an remote and uncharted 
island and appear to be unwitting participants in a vast 
psychological experiment. Here, the power of the 
experiment over social behaviour and perception appears 
literally to be magical.
For most social psychologists, including Zimbardo and 
Milgram themselves, their experiments showed that evil 
arises from the power of the situation. According to the 
general form of this idea, if you want to explain social 
behaviour, you are more likely to find the answers in the 
situations that people find themselves in, rather than in 
their personality profiles. More specifically, some 
situations are ‘evil’, placing normative pressure on people 
to perform evil deeds. In these situations, people enter a 
psychological state in which moral judgement and 
personal responsibility are suspended in favour of 
conformity, whether to the commands of a leader or the 
norms of the group. Zimbardo (2007), in a book of the 
same title, calls this the ‘Lucifer effect’ and argues that the 
power of the situation is sufficient to cause good people to 
do bad things. 
Along similar lines, historian Hannah Arendt (1963) 
coined the term ‘the banality of evil’. For Arendt, even the 
most atrocious historical evils are banal, meaning that 
they are committed by individuals without malice, but 
also without reflection. Arendt was inspired by attending 
the trial of Adolf eichmann – the apparently normal, timid, 
rather dull, but spectacularly murderous official who had 
been responsible for the administration of the Nazis’ ‘final 
solution’, in which millions of european Jewish people 
were killed. recently, however, historians have 
questioned the banality of evil. Later in eichmann’s trial 
(interestingly, after Arendt had left), some witnesses 
testified that far from being mild-mannered, he was a 
fanatical bully who expressed vehement hatred for Jewish 
people (Cesarani, 2005). These historians argued that far 
from being led into evil by the Nazi regime, as if sliding 
down a slippery slope (Haslam and reicher, 2008), people 
like eichmann strived towards increasingly evil objectives 
in pursuit of their careers, their ideology and the extreme 
prejudices that ensued. They were, in the words of the 
Holocaust archivist Yaacov Lozowick (2003, p. 279), the 
‘alpinists of evil’. 
The key point that Lozowick and other critical 
historians make is that evil does not arise only from 
situations. This same essential point underlies some of 
the recent criticisms by social psychologists of the 
standard interpretation of Milgram’s and Zimbardo’s 
studies. one such critique is that it is not normally the 
case that people are randomly allocated to situations. 
people seek out situations that suit them, that speak to 
their values and preferences (Ickes, Snyder and garcia, 
1997; Larsen, Diener and emmons, 1986). It is difficult to 
blame a situation entirely for the behaviour of people 
who have chosen to put themselves in that situation 
(Blass, 1991). 
Carnahan and McFarland (2007) ran a study that 
elegantly demonstrated the relevance of this point to 
Zimbardo’s prison experiment. In the campus newspapers 
of several universities in southern uSA, they posted one of 
two advertisements for a psychological study. The 
‘experimental’ advertisement was modelled closely on 
the original from the Stanford prison experiment, asking 
for male college students to participate in a ‘psychological 
study of prison life’. The ‘control’ advertisement was 
largely identical except the last three words – ‘of prison 
life’ – were deleted. The first thing that Carnahan and 
McFarland found was that many fewer students 
volunteered for the ‘prison life’ than the ‘control’ study. It 
was even necessary to rerun the ‘prison life’ version of the 
advertisement just to get the numbers up to an acceptable 
minimum. Finally, after screening participants for 
criminality and health problems, as Zimbardo and his 
colleagues had done, they ended up with 30 volunteers 
for the ‘prison life’ study and 61 for the ‘control’ study. 
Apart from the difference in numbers, the young men 
were also psychologically different. Specifically, they were 
more aggressive, authoritarian, Machiavellian, narcissistic, 
higher in social dominance orientation, less empathic and 
less altruistic. This is quite a list of traits, all related to the 
kinds of abuse and tyranny observed in the Stanford 
prison experiment. Thus, although Carnahan and 
McFarland did not go on to replicate the Stanford prison 

403
Social influence 
experiment, there is reason to believe that its findings 
might be explained, in part, by the characteristics of those 
who volunteered to take part in it.
There are other reasons to doubt that the bulk of the 
blame for evil actions can be laid at the feet of ‘evil 
situations’. As well as choosing what situations to place 
themselves in, people create and modify these situations. 
Indeed, both Milgram and Zimbardo carefully constructed 
the situations in which their participants were placed. In 
other words, the situations that promoted evil behaviour 
in these experiments were human creations, designed 
precisely to give evil every chance to flourish. of course, 
the ‘evil situations’ that one encounters in the real world – 
concentration camps, organized death squads and 
shadowy interrogation centres – are similarly designed 
precisely to facilitate acts that we would normally call 
‘evil’, such as torture and murder. purely situational 
explanations for evil actions leave the creation of evil 
situations unexplained. 
evil situations are not only designed by people, they 
are typically commanded by people who have been 
granted or who assume a leadership role. Milgram’s 
studies of obedience were designed to explain the 
psychology of those who follow, rather than give, orders. 
In contrast, Zimbardo’s study seemed to show that people 
would act in evil ways even in the absence of orders to do 
so. Certainly, the specific forms of tyranny exercised by 
guards were not explicitly ordered, such as the frequent 
demand that prisoners do press-ups, the confinement to 
cells or forcing prisoners to clean toilets with their bare 
hands. But Haslam and reicher (2007) point out a telling 
passage in Zimbardo’s instructions to the guards at the 
beginning of the experiment: 
We can create in the prisoners feelings of boredom, a 
sense of fear to some degree, we can create a notion of 
arbitrariness that their life is totally controlled by us, by 
the system, you, me … They’ll have no freedom of 
action, they can do nothing, or say nothing that we don’t 
permit. We’re going to take away their individuality in 
various ways. In general what all this leads to is a sense 
of powerlessness. (Zimbardo, 2007, p. 55)
It is clear from this passage that the guards had been 
provided with a set of general instructions that we would 
normally call ‘evil’, being extremely authoritarian, 
creating a strong sense of ‘us’ and ‘them’ and thus tending 
to motivate and legitimize the kinds of behaviours that 
the guards went on to perform. As Haslam and reicher 
(2007) point out, in many cases of real-world tyranny, not 
least in the Nazi Holocaust, orders are often in this 
general, strategic form. Those on the front lines are 
responsible for interpreting these orders and working out 
how to implement them. This often requires considerable 
initiative and ingenuity. They are seldom given orders in a 
step-by-step form that they could mindlessly follow as if 
they were machines. 
There is other evidence that the experimenter and his 
assistants – who also played leadership roles inside the 
prison environment – actively contributed to the 
tyrannical climate of the prison. In their report on the 
Stanford prison experiment, Haney et al. (1973, p. 78) 
admit that ‘over time, the experimenters became more 
personally involved … and were not as distant and 
objective as they should have been’. What does this mean? 
Further insight is to be found on the excellent, official 
website of the Stanford prison experiment. Here, 
Zimbardo recounts how gordon Bower, his friend, former 
college roommate and eminent psychologist in his own 
right, dropped by to see the experiment in progress 
(http://www.prisonexp.org/psychology/27):
I briefly described what we were up to, and gordon 
asked me a very simple question: ‘Say, what’s the 
independent variable in this study?’ 
To my surprise, I got really angry at him. Here I had a 
prison break on my hands. The security of my men and 
the stability of my prison was at stake, and now, I had 
to deal with this bleeding-heart, liberal, academic, 
effete dingdong who was concerned about the 
independent variable! It wasn’t until much later that I 
realized how far into my prison role I was at that 
point – that I was thinking like a prison superintendent 
rather than a research psychologist. 
Thus, Zimbardo and his colleagues, by their own tacit 
admission, had a role – a leadership role – in the events 
that transpired in their prison. one way of thinking about 
this limitation of their research is that the experiment is 
rife with demand characteristics (Banuazizi and 
Movahedi, 1975). While true, this point may not 
completely undermine the value of this particular 
experiment, given the surprising level of brutality that 
emerged. After all, as Thayer and Saarni (1975) pointed 
out, what are demand characteristics but a form of social 

404
Belonging
pressure – much like the pressures that might be expected 
in many real-life prisons?
The most telling point about these demand 
characteristics is not that the brutality that occurred is 
somehow unrepresentative of violence and brutality in 
‘real’ prisons and other oppressive institutions. rather, the 
crucial point is that the brutality of the Stanford prison 
experiment may not have been an inevitable outcome of 
the guards conforming to their role. Further, it may not 
have occurred without the moral support and active 
encouragement of the experimenter and his assistants 
who played a leadership role. 
Haslam and reicher (2006a, 2006b, 2007, 2008) 
demonstrated this point in their replication of the Stanford 
prison experiment. This was funded and broadcast by the 
BBC in 2002, in a series called The Experiment, now known 
as the BBC prison Study. Just like the original Stanford 
prison experiment, this has its own website (http://www.
bbcprisonstudy.org/). In this version of the experiment, 
the experimenters did not give the prisoners and guards 
the same authoritarian instructions. They did not play an 
internal role in the prison, such as ‘superintendent’, as 
Zimbardo had. Much like the original experiment, the BBC 
prison Study had to be stopped short because of concerns 
about the wellbeing of the participants. But these 
concerns were not aroused by the tyranny of the guards on 
hapless prisoners. In fact, the prisoners had instigated a 
revolution, and at one point had effectively taken over the 
prison. No clear leadership had emerged among the 
guards and their sense of identity and cohesion as guards 
had declined through the first few days of the experiment. 
In contrast, the prisoners tended to have clear leadership 
structure, provided by a dominant personality in the 
prison and a trade union negotiator who had been 
introduced by Haslam and reicher (2006a, 2006b, 2007, 
2008), precisely to provide leadership and promote 
cohesion. This strong and effective leadership appeared to 
bolster the social identity of the prisoners and gave them 
the capacity to outmanoeuvre the divided and ineffective 
guards. After the ‘revolution’, the participants 
experimented with a liberal, egalitarian commune in 
which the prison/guard distinction was erased. However, 
this social structure did not appear to be effective and at 
the time the experiment terminated, the climate was 
becoming increasingly authoritarian. 
In sum, the value of Milgram’s and Zimbardo’s studies 
is undeniable, and they deservedly rank among the most 
important social psychological studies of all time. They 
remind us that evil actions such as mass murder are not 
the exclusive preserve of mentally disturbed or 
psychopathic individuals who come out of the woodwork 
when the opportunity arises. Their ‘moral’ is incredibly 
important – we should be careful not to complacently 
assume that we ourselves, or those we love, would refrain 
from evil actions when ordered or pressured to do so. 
However, we should not overdo the extent to which we 
blame the evils that these studies documented, and those 
in history, on the situation. people create, command and 
change situations, just as they themselves may be 
changed by them (Haslam and reicher, 2006a, 2006b, 
2007, 2008). The greatest acts of evil arise from these 
interactions between people and situations (Carnahan 
and McFarland, 2007; Haslam and reicher, 2007). 
Questions
1 As we saw in Chapter 1, experimenter bias – effects 
observed in experiments because of the expectations 
and behaviours of the experimenter – can be powerful 
and operate without the consciousness of either 
experimenters or participants. of course, researchers 
can also influence their results by setting up 
experiments in ways that favour their hypotheses. 
Based on your reading here and, if possible, your 
reading of the original papers, to what extent do you 
think that each side may have obtained results they 
‘wanted’ to obtain? (Note: it is crucial to point out there 
is absolutely no suggestion that these biases operated 
consciously or that the researchers had any intention of 
obtaining misleading findings.) What reasons are there 
to believe that the effects are not entirely due to 
experimenter bias? 
2 In the ethics and research methods box in Chapter 3, 
we considered the importance of replication in social 
psychology and the reproducibility project. To what 
extent do you think a risk confronting this project is 
that null findings may emerge from these replications 
because, at some level, the researchers ‘want’ to 
obtain them?

405
Social influence 
Exploring further Another film related to the concept of ‘the power of the situation’ is The Reader (2008), in 
which kate Winslet plays an ex-Nazi guard in a concentration camp. She is facing trial for war crimes and is forced to 
face the atrocities in which she participated and her own personal responsibility in these situations. The film 
explores the ambiguities surrounding the notion of the banality of evil. Watch the film, and consider where you 
stand in relation to kate Winslet’s character, given what you have learned in these pages. To what extent is she evil 
or blameless? Can you find other films related to the themes of Milgram’s and Zimbardo’s experiments?
But why exactly do people conform? What specific psychological mechanisms 
are at play? What specific features of people and situations can breed this sort of 
unlikely behaviour? Thinking specifically about Milgram’s studies, the fact that 
participants were so uncomfortable about their predicament makes it unlikely that 
they conformed because they were cruel people. Perhaps the power of the situa-
tion and the power of the instructions were more influential. Perhaps Zimbardo’s 
results may create a cloudier picture, suggesting the importance of an interaction 
between the person and the situation. In the sections that follow, we break down 
these issues to examine when people conform, why, and if certain people are more 
likely to do so. 
When are people influenced?
Milgram ran many different variations on his conformity experiments. Likewise, 
social psychologists have used different variations of Asch’s paradigm to further 
examine the psychological antecedents and consequences of conformity. Unsur-
prisingly, Zimbardo’s work has only been replicated on a couple of occasions, 
including the BBC Prison Study. However, from replications of studies using a 
similar paradigm to Milgram and Asch, social psychologists have a clearer under-
standing of the factors that influence when people conform and when they do not. 
These appear to fall under two broad headings – contextual factors and group-
related factors.
Contextual factors
In one version of his experiment, Milgram manipulated the proximity of the 
experimenter, or authority figure, to the teacher and found that obedience to 
authority dropped significantly the further away the experimenter was from the 
participant. For example, if instructions were delivered by phone, obedience 
dropped to 21 per cent (Milgram, 1974). When no instructions were given at all, 
only 2.5 per cent of participants continued with the experiment until the end, 
although this is still surprising, given that participants were completely free to do 
as they wished. Studies in other domains suggest that the closer the person making 
the request is to the subject, the more likely the subject is to conform. For example, 
in field studies, Kleinke (1977) showed that people are more likely to conform to 
requests on the street if the requester looks at them and touches them. 

406
Belonging
Milgram also manipulated the proximity of the student to the teacher. In one 
condition, the teacher could not see the student and was unable to hear his cries of 
pain. Instead, the student could only be heard pounding on the wall at 300v and 
315v, then falling silent. In this condition, nearly all participants shocked the 
student up to 255v and 65 per cent of participants went up to, and beyond, the 
maximum voltage. In another condition where the teacher was also unable to hear 
the student’s pounding, nearly 100 per cent of teachers were obedient and 
continued to the maximum voltage and beyond. On the other hand, obedience 
dropped significantly when the student was closer to the teacher. For example, in 
one condition where the teacher was in the same room as the student, obedience 
dropped to 40 per cent. In yet another condition where the teacher was asked to 
force the student’s hand down onto an electrode, obedience was reduced (but was 
still high) at 30 per cent. Thus, the immediacy or emotional distance of the victim 
was an important predictor of compliance in Milgram’s experiment. This is 
consistent with research on the moral dilemma commonly known as the ‘trolley 
problem’ (Greene, Sommerville, Nystrom et al., 2001). In this task, people are 
asked to save the lives of five people lying on train tracks, and findings show that 
people are less willing to do so by actively pushing someone onto the tracks to 
stop the train than by pulling a switch that diverts the train to another track on 
which one person is lying. As in the case of Milgram’s participants, the immediacy 
of the victim was a key determinant of the participants’ behaviour. It is easier to 
pull a switch to end someone’s life than throw them directly to their death. 
This immediacy effect may have something to do with the fact that being 
physically closer to someone makes us more aware of their humanity – being apart 
from them makes it less possible to hear their cries or witness their emotional 
expressions. Being closer to someone also allows us to empathize with them. 
These ideas relate to the concept of dehumanization, which you will come across 
again in Chapter 11. This is the phenomenon whereby groups are sometimes seen 
as less than human, typically by being described with an animal metaphor 
(Haslam, 2006). Research has shown that dehumanizing a group and stripping 
them of their humanity allows people to justify atrocities against them (Haslam, 
2006; Haslam, Loughnan, Kashima and Bain, 2008). In Milgram’s and Zimbardo’s 
studies, perhaps the distance created between the ‘teacher’ and ‘student’, or the 
‘guard’ and ‘prisoner’ made participants feel that they were dealing with someone 
less than human, thus justifying extra levels of shock, or prison brutality.
Everyday life examples demonstrate that it is easier to be cruel to someone if 
they are emotionally distant. For example, orders for pilots to bomb cities during 
wartime are rarely disobeyed. At a less cruel but still significant level, people often 
feel little empathy towards the victims of large-scale disasters in faraway countries, 
but feel more compassionate when the disaster happens on their own doorstep. In 
these situations, the victims are perhaps dehumanized to some degree, and it is 
therefore easier to forget that they feel pain like everyone else. 
Further, the perceived authority of the situation can influence compliance. You 
will remember that the original Milgram experiments were carried out in a labora-

a group as less than human – 
typically with an animal or 
machine metaphor.

tory at the prestigious Yale University. Likewise, the Stanford Prison Experiment 
was conducted under the auspices of the renowned university bearing the same 
name. For everyday people, these are situations that command authority and 
respect for status. When Milgram reran his experiment in the much less prestigious 
setting of a modest office building, compliance dropped significantly, but was still 
high at 48 per cent. Similarly, the perceived authority or status of the experimenter 
is important in inducing compliance or not. People are sensitive to the legitimacy 
of the authority figure and use this information to determine whether or not it is 
the right thing to conform. In one rather alarming study, 22 nurses were called by 
an unknown physician to administer an obvious drug overdose to a patient 
(Hofling, Brotzman, Dairymple et al., 1966). All but one of the nurses did as they 
were told, until they were intercepted en route to the patient. Another group of 
similar nurses said that they would never do such a thing. Again, you will 
remember that the experimenter in Milgram’s original studies was dressed in a 
white lab coat, looking very much the authoritative and knowledgeable scientist. 
In another condition where an ordinary person was giving the orders, compliance 
dropped significantly to around 20 per cent (Milgram, 1974). These results illus-
trate the power of status in predicting conformity. In general, higher status people 
tend to elicit more conformity (Driskell and Mullen, 1990). People will sometimes 
go so far as to openly reject the influence of lower status or stigmatized 
individuals (Swim, Ferguson and Hyers, 1999). These results also 
demonstrate the influence of everyday symbols and situations that 
people use to guide their behaviour. Authority figures wear uniforms 
to encourage adherence to rules and regulations. Doctors often wear 
lab coats and carry stethoscopes so that we appreciate their position 
and knowledge of medical matters (Figure 9.7). Universities bear crests 
to display their established status as centres of knowledge. Even the 
neatness of a person’s appearance affects their power to influence 
others. For example, in one study, people were more likely to accept 
the opportunity to take a survey from a well-dressed person on the 
street than someone who was dressed poorly (Walker, Harriman and 
Costello, 1980). It is also not surprising that Zimbardo chose to dress 
his guards in uniforms reflecting their ‘job’. These types of symbols of 
authority and status for both people and institutions are important in 
promoting compliance. Authority is challenged when these important 
markers are not present. 
Group-related factors
In another version of his classic experiment, Milgram found that group pressure 
was an important predictor of conformity. In particular, if two disobedient peers 
were present in the experiment, who refused to go past a certain voltage point on 
the shock generator, complete compliance to the task was reduced to a much lower 
10 per cent. On the other hand, two obedient peers raised complete obedience to 
92.5 per cent. Presumably, the presence of obedient and disobedient others

provides people with a frame of reference to judge the legitimacy of going along 
with the experimenter’s instructions. If others around them are obeying the 
instructions, then it feels like this is the legitimate and appropriate thing to do. On 
the other hand, if others have ceased administering the shocks, then this is prob-
ably perceived to be the most acceptable course of action. Similarly, Asch (1955) 
demonstrated the importance of the unanimity of the group. He found that unani-
mous groups breed conformity, whereas if just one person in the group dissents, 
conformity only occurs one-fourth as often.
Time to reflect Can you remember a time when you were asked to do something you thought was wrong? What 
did you do? What contextual factors influenced your behaviour? Can you see parallels between your experiences and 
the social psychological research on social influence? Can you think of other factors (not discussed in this chapter) 
that may determine whether people are influenced? 
Unanimity was also shattered when the dissenter was more obviously incorrect 
than the majority, when they were undecided and changed their mind (Shaw, Roth-
schild and Strickland, 1957) and this was even the case when they said that they 
could not see properly (Allen and Levine, 1971). In general, a single dissenter can 
drastically reduce conformity, but it is difficult for individuals to dissent when the 
group is unanimous (see also Nemeth and Chiles, 1988). In a similar vein, group 
cohesion, or the extent to which people feel like they are bound together as a group, 
also influences the extent to which people conform. Specifically, the more cohesive a 
group is, and the more group members are attracted to each other, the more power 
the group has over its individual members. For example, people who are attracted to 
their group are more likely to be influenced by it than those who are less attracted to 
the group (Berkowitz, 1954). In general, groups who are unanimous and closely 
bound together are difficult to resist. But why might this be the case? Why is it so 
difficult to go one’s own way in the face of a unanimous and cohesive group? 
Exploring further Think about this question with respect to the British system of trial by jury. Are twelve heads 
really better than one? Are their judgements really independent? This is what richard Dawkins (1997) has to say on 
the topic: ‘There is also strong pressure to conform to a unanimous verdict, which further undermines the principle 
of independent data. Increasing the number of jurors doesn’t help, or not much (and not at all in strict principle). 
What you have to increase is the number of independent verdict-reaching units.’
One obvious explanation of the power of unanimous groups is that group 
members risk group disapproval by dissenting. Fear of this disapproval can force 
people to go along with decisions they would not normally agree with, and perform 
behaviours they would not normally endorse. As we briefly mentioned earlier, 
Asch questioned participants as to why they conformed to the group when they 
obviously knew that the group’s judgements were wrong. Overwhelmingly, 
compliant participants reported that they feared the group’s disapproval and did 
not wish to stand out. This fear of social disapproval is very powerful. Indeed, 
Asch (1951) demonstrated in another experiment – where 16 participants faced one 
erroneously responding confederate – that participants openly mocked and laughed 
at this single dissenting individual. The desire to avoid such ridicule and discomfort 

409
Social influence 
is one explanation for Asch’s findings. In another experiment Asch asked partici-
pants to write their own responses privately after hearing the incorrect judgements 
of the group. In this study, conformity decreased significantly, to 12.5 per cent. The 
fear of disapproval is therefore very potent but the presence of dissenting others 
can empower people with the moral courage to be independent. It is much easier to 
stand up for oneself and one’s opinions in private than in front of a group. 
However, once a person has made a prior commitment to a decision or 
response, the presence of the group will rarely make them change their mind. In 
other words, people are much less likely to succumb to the pressure of a group if 
they have already vocalized a response (Deutsch and Gerard, 1955). How many 
times have you seen a football referee change their mind after issuing a yellow 
card to a player? Probably none (see Figure 9.8). People rarely go back on their 
decisions even when they are under pressure to do so (Saltzstein and Sandberg, 
1979). This is more than just plain stubbornness. After making a commitment to 
a particular course of action, people lose face by reversing their decision to 
conform to a majority decision, even if they lose out by keeping to their original 
choice (Fox and Hoffman, 2002). So, more often than not, they accept the ‘sunk 
cost’ and move on. In a way, this is a means of avoiding another form of disap-
proval from the group – that of being perceived as weak or easily pushed around. 
Of course, in the example of the football referee, this issue may be enhanced by 
the status of the referee as the main authority in the game. If they lost authority, 
the entire match could seriously collapse. This responsibility alone may make it 
difficult for the referee to change their mind. However, it is interesting to note 
that even though people tend to stick to their public commitment, they may still 
moderate their judgements in later situations, so that they are more aligned with 
the group. For example, the referee may be reluctant to issue a yellow card next 
time, and a judge of a scored sporting event such as gymnastics may provide more 
moderate scores after noticing that their own scores are misaligned with the 
scores of the other judges. 
As we discussed in Chapter 6, people tend to like others with whom they share 
similar characteristics (Byrne, 1971). This similarity–attraction link can explain 
why people tend to conform more in settings where they like others within their 
group, or if they like the group as a whole. For example, when people within the 
group are similar (Abrams, Wetherell, Cochrane et al., 1990), and when there are 
friends within the group (e.g., Thibaut and Strickland, 1956), conformity increases. 
Perceived interdependence is another determinant of conformity. Specifically, 
when people perceive that their fates depend upon other people (and others’ fates 
likewise depend upon them), and that they need to work together to reach a 
common goal, then conformity increases (Allen, 1965; Deutsch and Gerard, 1955). 
This works in a similar way to group performance effects that we will discuss in 
Chapter 10. Specifically, people will exert more effort on the part of a group if 
they perceive that their own and others’ contributions to the group are important 
and indispensable (Karau and Williams, 1993). We also know from Sherif and 
Sherif’s (1953) work that interdependence can increase cooperation within groups.

Group size is also important in predicting whether or not someone will 
conform, but a group does not need to be large to have a significant effect. For 
example, Asch (1955) found in variations of his experiments that participants who 
were confronted with groups of three to five people conformed more rather than 
when just one or two other people were present. On the other hand, Milgram, 
Bickman and Berkowitz (1969) ran an interesting experiment where they had a 
crowd of varying size (either 1, 2, 3, 5, 10 or 15 people) pause on a busy New York 
City street and look up. What did passers-by do? Results revealed that the 
percentage of people passing by who also looked up increased with the size of the 
stimulus crowd. However, compliance only increased up to a stimulus crowd of 
five. Groups of five or more individuals 
tend made no difference to conformity, as 
illustrated in Figure 9.9. 
Wilder (1977) argued that the effect of 
group size has less to do with the number 
of people present and more with the 
number of perceived independent sources 
of influence within the group. For example, 
you may come across four people who all 
express the same opinion, but who do so 
independently. Or, you may come across 
the same four people who together convey one collective opinion. Findings 
suggest that a group perceived to be a single information source is less influential 
than a group in which the sources of information are perceived to be independent. 
Further, Campbell and Fairey (1989) argued that group size influences conformity 
differently depending on the person’s motivations and the type of judgement 
being made. Specifically, with matters of taste, group size has a linear effect, that 
is, as group size gets bigger, people conform more. This may be because on matters 
of taste, there is no objective standard and deviating from the group means not 
‘fitting in’. On the other hand, on judgement tasks where there is an objectively 
correct response, smaller group sizes are enough. More voices agreeing does not 
increase confidence or influence decision making. 
Why are people influenced?
Now that we have a clearer understanding of the conditions under which people 
are more likely to conform, we can begin to consider why people conform. When 
people behave differently than they ‘normally’ would, why do they do it? Social 
psychologists argue that there are two general reasons why people fold under 
group pressure. First, they sometimes conform to avoid rejection and second, they 
often conform in order to be correct and accurate. Deutsch and Gerard (1955) 
named these factors normative influence and informational influence. 
Normative influence is akin to ‘going along with the crowd’. It is the pressure to 
conform to the positive expectations of other people, and the perceived ‘norms’ of 
Normative influence Social 
influence that comes about 
because people wish to gain 
the social approval (or avoid 
disapproval) from others.

Social influence 
the group (Deutsch and Gerard, 1955; Kelley, 1952). Individuals have a general 
need to gain the approval of others and, at the same time, avoid their disapproval. 
When normative influence is at play, people more often than not actually disagree 
with the influence attempt, they may not change their mind, or any influence that 
takes place may be short-lived (Nail, 1986). However, people suppress their 
dis agreement so that they will be liked (and avoid being disliked) by others. Thus, 
in general, normative influence is the public agreement or compliance with an 
influence attempt, when private views do not change. An important requirement 
for normative influence is that the individual believes that they are being watched 
or monitored by a powerful group. The group has the power to hand out rewards 
and punishments, so it is important for the individual to display commitment to 
the group and not stand out with a nonconformist opinion or behaviour. Going 
back to the classic studies discussed earlier, it is reasonable to assume that norma-
tive influence was at play in Asch’s (1955) experiments. Participants’ behaviours 
were being observed by the group, eliciting the pressure for them to avoid the 
group’s disapproval. Further, we know that people conformed less readily in Asch 
studies when they were asked to make their responses in private. Presumably, 
normative influence is not as strong when individual behaviour is not being moni-
tored by the group, and individuals are then more at liberty to make their own 
decisions about how to behave. 
On the other hand, informational influence is the type of influence that comes 
from the desire to be correct. This type of influence typically occurs when a task is 
ambiguous and people are uncertain about how they should respond. It can also 
occur when there is disagreement among a group about the correct response or 
behaviour. To resolve this uncertainty or ambiguity, people look to others as a 
useful source of information, and compare themselves with others to learn the most 
appropriate way to act (Festinger, 1950). Because they are uncertain, people there-
fore rate the judgements of others as more credible and superior to their own 
judgements, which can lead people to accept that the majority view is correct and 
accurate. As such, informational influence is akin to ‘conversion’ or ‘acceptance’, 
where people come to accept the influence attempt and not simply go along with 
it – that is, their private views do change. With regard to the classic studies discussed 
earlier, informational influence was probably at play in Sherif’s (1935, 1937) studies 
involving the autokinetic effect. The task was ambiguous – the light did not, in fact, 
move at all and so there was no means of participants knowing what the ‘correct’ 
response ought to be. Participants therefore compared their responses with those 
of others and responses converged upon a group norm so that participants ‘infor-
mationally influenced’ one another. Alexander, Zucker and Brody (1970) followed 
up Sherif’s study but instead informed participants that the autokinetic effect was a 
visual illusion. Interestingly, compliance did not occur, probably because others’ 
responses were no longer useful as benchmarks for the correct response. The reality 
was that there was no correct response, so people had no reason not to believe their 
own responses above those of others. Thus, informational influence was not effec-
tive (see also Levine, Higgins and Choi, 2000).

Belonging
Deutsch and Gerard (1955) attempted to eliminate both normative and infor-
mational influence in order to identify how much people will comply when there 
is very little pressure to do so. They argued that if a task is unambiguous, the 
participant responds privately (and anonymously) and they are not being moni-
tored by the group in any way, there is no reason to conform to an erroneous 
decision. If there is no apparent reason to comply, then why should anyone do it? 
Deutsch and Gerard ran an experiment where, in the first condition, a participant 
was placed face to face with three other people. These people were confederates 
who had been asked to make unanimous (incorrect) judgements of the length of 
lines in focal trials – in much the same manner as in Asch’s original studies. As you 
have probably gathered by now, confederates are used quite a lot in this type of 
research. In the second condition, the participant was asked to provide responses 
privately and anonymously. In a third condition, the participant remained face to 
face with the confederates but was given the group goal to try and be as accurate 
as possible. Thus, in one condition group pressure was minimized and in the latter 
condition it was maximized. Deutsch and Gerard also manipulated the partici-
pants’ uncertainty surrounding the task. For this manipulation, half the partici-
pants responded while the stimuli were visible, and for the other half the stimuli 
were removed before participants made their judgements. As expected, when 
uncertainty decreased, so did conformity (see 
Figure 9.10). Also, when participants were 
allowed to give their responses privately and 
anonymously, they conformed less than 
when they were face to face with the group, 
which in turn invoked less conformity than 
the same face-to-face interaction with the 
added pressure of a group goal. However, 
when both certainty and group pressure were 
largely eliminated, people still conformed on 
over 20 per cent of responses. 
This raises an interesting question. Why 
was conformity not completely eliminated 
when both normative and informational 
influence were kept to a minimum? Perhaps there is another ‘type’ of social influ-
ence that needs to be considered, which goes beyond the ‘desire to be liked’ 
(normative influence) and the ‘desire to be right’ (informational influence). Do we 
need a different perspective that uniquely describes conformity within groups? 
Social identity theorists have attempted to provide such a perspective.
Social identity theory and referent informational influence
Social identity researchers (e.g., Tajfel and Turner, 1979; see also Chapter 8) argue 
that the basic distinction between normative and informational influence, which 
Turner (1991) refers to as a dual process dependency model of social influence, is 
inadequate for explaining social influence within groups. In particular, social iden-

Social influence 
tity theorists have challenged this type of model because, they argue, it underplays 
the crucial importance of belonging to groups and the importance of belonging-
ness in predicting adherence to the norms and standards of the group. That is, we 
adhere to the norms of the group because we feel that the group is part of us (see 
also David and Turner, 2001). To address this issue, Turner coined the term referent 
informational influence, where he argued that people conform to the group norm 
simply because they are group members. This is the only precondition necessary. 
More specifically, people are not looking for information from others in order to 
be correct. Nor are they striving to gain the approval (or avoid the disapproval) of 
the group. In fact, they are not conforming to other individuals at all – they are 
conforming to a group norm and can do so when they are not even being moni-
tored by the group. People conform because they have internalized the group 
norm as the appropriate way to act as a member of that group. 
The utility of referent informational influence to explain conformity in groups 
has found support within the social identity tradition (e.g., Abrams et al., 1990; 
Hogg and Smith, 2007; Turner and Oakes, 1989) and in studies of crowd behav-
iour (e.g., Reicher, 1984a, 1984b). It has also been nicely demonstrated in a study 
by Platow, Voudouris, Coulson et al. (2007). Platow et al. – in this case, several of 
his undergraduate students – were interested in how referent informational 
responses might influence the way we react to physical pain. 
Time to reflect Before you read on, consider this question. How might a researcher elicit pain ethically and safely in 
the laboratory? Try to think of three or four different ways and then read on to learn about how platow et al. did this. 
Platow et al. used the cold pressor task, in which participants were asked to 
immerse their hand in a bucket of ice-cold water and keep it there for as long as 
they can. After a while, this really begins to hurt. Incidentally, this is in the ‘don’t 
try this at home’ category, because after too long, it can actually be dangerous. 
Platow measured participants’ physiological response to pain using the galvanic 
skin response (GSR). This involved placing electrodes on the participants’ skin 
(not the submerged part). The more each participant sweats – a measure of physi-
ological arousal – the more their skin conducts electricity, which is what GSR 
captures. An advantage of this technique is that it is non-reactive, that is, it is hard 
for participants to deliberately alter how much they sweat. 
After the participants had done the cold pressor task once, they were asked to 
dry their hands and wait to do it again. At this point, a confederate appeared, 
posing as another participant who had already done the study and was returning a 
form. This confederate reassured the participant: ‘Well, don’t worry, the second 
time’s much easier.’ You will remember the terms ingroup and outgroup from 
Chapter 8 – the independent variable in this experiment was whether this confed-
erate posed as an ingroup member (a science student) or an outgroup member (an 
arts student). To achieve this manipulation, separate boxes were placed in the 
laboratory for arts and science students. The confederate conspicuously placed 
their form in one of these two boxes. The upshot is, if participants thought the 
Referent informational

to conform to a group norm 
because adherence to the 
group norm defines the 
person as a group member.

reassuring confederate was an ingroup rather than an outgroup member, they 
showed a significantly less dramatic physiological response to the pain of having 
their hand immersed in cold water. The reassurance of the outgroup member had 
no effect on GSR. This was the same as in a control condition where no reassur-
ance was given by anybody.
The principle of referent normative influence is also consistent with the inter-
group sensitivity effect, first shown by Hornsey, Oppes and Svennson (2002; see 
also O’Dwyer, Berkowitz and Alfeld-Johnson, 2002). The intergroup sensitivity 
effect is the tendency, when confronted with criticism of one’s group, to express 
relatively low levels of emotional sensitivity and high levels of agreement and 
goodwill towards the critic – if the critic belongs to your ingroup. If the critic is 
an outsider, chances are you will be more sensitive, less liable to agree, and less 
charitable in your assessment of the critic’s character. This effect holds even when 
the criticism is identical, word for word (Hornsey, Trembath and Gunthorpe, 
2004). Apparently, the views of insiders are more influential than outsiders, even 
when they are expressing critical views of their group. In further support of the 
concept of referent informational influence, insiders who criticize the group are 
especially influential when they have a history of adherence to the group’s norms 
(Tarrant and Campbell, 2007). If a person seems to embody the group’s norms, 
then they are likely to seem like a good candidate to develop a shared sense of 
social reality with. 
However, there is also evidence that the intergroup sensitivity effect can occur 
in the absence of referent informational influence. We respond more favourably to 
a critic who belongs to the group they are talking about, even if we do not belong 
to the group ourselves. For example, British participants express more agreement, 
less sensitivity and more favourable evaluations of a critic who voices negative 
opinions of Australians if they are an Australian (Sutton, Elder and Douglas, 
2006). Likewise, British participants prefer criticisms of Chinese people that are 
voiced by Chinese critics, and Spanish people by Spanish critics (Sutton, Douglas, 
Elder and Tarrant, 2007). People also prefer criticism of the mentally ill – a typi-
cally stigmatized group – to come from within the group (Douglas and Sutton, 
2011). Apparently, reactions to criticism of groups are informed not just by 
referent informational influence but by social ‘codes of conduct’ that determine 
who can say what about whom.
Exploring further In the literature, can you think of other factors that might determine people’s preference for 
criticism to come from ‘inside’ a group? Are there particular social psychological factors that you have read about in 
this text so far?
Who is influenced?
Personality 
Many social psychologists have attempted to understand whether there are 
certain ‘types’ of people who are more likely to conform than others. Such 

415
Social influence 
investigations have been largely prompted by the existence of vast individual 
differences in conformity and have focused on personality characteristics as 
factors that make people more susceptible (or open) to social influence. 
However, there is little research to support the proposal that personality factors 
predict conformity. In particular, there are only weak associations between 
specific acts of conformity and personality characteristics (Mischel, 1969). 
Indeed, Milgram (1974, p. 205) himself concluded: ‘I am certain that there is a 
complex personality basis to obedience and disobedience. But I know we have 
not yet found it.’ 
In some studies, however, a handful of individual differences have been linked 
to conformity behaviours (Elms and Milgram, 1966). Indeed, going back to 
Milgram’s studies, he found that the person who was the recipient of the request 
responded differently depending on their status. ‘Blue-collar’ workers were 
more influenced by the experimenter than ‘professional’ participants in his 
experiment, arguably because they felt less able to express themselves in the 
presence of the higher status individual. Also, an authoritarian personality 
profile displaying traits such as conventionalism, submission to authority and 
aggression (Adorno, Frenkel-Brunswik, Levinson and Sanford, 1950) has been 
linked to higher levels of conformity (Elms and Milgram, 1966). In Chapter 11 
we will explore this same personality type as a predictor of prejudice towards 
social groups. However, many contradictory findings bring into question the 
presence of a meaningful link between individual differences, personality char-
acteristics and conformity. People often conform in one situation but not in 
another. It is likely that the issue of whether or not a person conforms is more 
about contextual rather than personality factors. Further, theorists are generally 
in agreement that while internal factors (e.g., attitudes and traits) sometimes 
predict behaviour, they seem to be better predictors of a person’s average 
tendency to behave in a certain way across different situations rather than how 
they will behave in a specific situation. In other words, personality factors may 
predict susceptibility or openness to social influence across a variety of different 
situations, but not be so good at predicting how a person will respond in a 
specific experiment. It is also the case that personality is a better predictor of 
behaviour when social influences are weak. One could argue that personality has 
little effect on behaviour in the Milgram studies because the social influence to 
conform was strong. 
Try it yourself Mehrabian and Stefl (1995) devised a scale to measure individual differences in conformity. Are 
some people more predisposed to conform than others? Complete the scale for yourself. Here, conformity is measured 
on a nine-point scale from –4 (very strong disagreement) to +4 (very strong agreement). A total score is computed by 
summing participants’ responses to seven positively worded items measuring higher tendency to conform (+) and by 
subtracting this value from the sum of responses to four negatively worded items indicating lower tendency to 
conform (–). Higher values indicate a greater disposition towards conformity. responses on this scale have been used 
in investigations to measure relationships between conformity and variables such as societal standards of 
attractiveness (Vartanian and Hopkinson, 2010), acceptance of cosmetic surgery (Swami, Chamorro-premuzic, Bridges 
and Furnham, 2009) and belief in extraterrestrial life (Swami, pietschnig, Stieger and Voracek, 2011).

Gender
Research findings are also inconclusive with respect to gender differences in 
conformity. On average, studies into gender differences tend to reveal that women 
are somewhat more susceptible or open to conformity than men. However, 
Milgram (1974) found little evidence for this in his own work. He found that the 
same percentage of women obeyed as men. Further studies (e.g., Eagly, 1987; 
Eagly and Carli, 1981) also found no gender differences in conformity. It has since 
been argued that the experimental task is important in predicting female and male 
conformity behaviour. Many conformity tasks may be more familiar to men than 
women, meaning that women may be more uncertain about the task, and hence 
may conform more because of the increased importance of informational influ-
ence for them. This could be a simple explanation for why women on average 
conform more than men. To test this idea, Sistrunk and McDavid (1971) ran an 
experiment in which the type of conformity task was manipulated. In this task, 
women and men were subjected to group pressure while being asked to rate their 
agreement with a series of traditionally feminine items (e.g., family, fashion), 
masculine items (e.g., mathematics, mechanics) or neutral issues. Results revealed 
that women conformed more to group pressure for the traditionally masculine 
issues, whereas men conformed more on the traditionally feminine issues. There 
was no difference on the neutral trials. These results suggest that even gender 
differences in conformity are context specific and that expertise and uncertainty 
are more likely to be the proximal predictors of conformity than gender. 
However, it should be noted that women do tend to conform more than men in 
public settings such as experiments utilizing the Asch paradigm. Eagly (1978) 
argued that this may occur because women are more concerned with maintaining 

417
Social influence 
agreement within the group than men, but a further study by Eagly, Wood and 
Fishbaugh (1981) found evidence contrary to this argument. If interpersonal 
concerns explain gender differences in conformity, then women’s greater 
conformity ought to be limited to circumstances in which they believe that their 
opinions are being monitored by others. Only under these conditions should 
conformity influence interpersonal relations. In this experiment, a pretest was 
conducted to obtain participants’ opinions on various university campus issues. 
Participants were then asked to take part – in groups of two males and two 
females  – in a study supposedly about impression formation in groups. The 
participants interacted with each other while seated individually in cubicles and 
for each of four issues they:
 o read the opinions supposedly indicated by the other three group members 
 o gave their impressions of the others’ knowledgeability 
 o gave their own opinions on the issues.
To make participants believe that their responses were being monitored, their 
names were indicated on their answer sheets, which were ostensibly distributed to 
the other group members. In the no surveillance condition, participants were told 
that their responses would not be distributed. The results were consistent with the 
hypothesis that women would conform more than men under surveillance condi-
tions. However, Eagly and Wood (1985) also found that men were particularly 
resistant to influence in public settings, and argued that, for males, public noncon-
formity may be perceived to be a way of winning social approval.
Culture
Examinations of cultural differences have revealed fairly robust and significant 
differences in conformity. In particular, studies have shown that conformity (as 
measured using variations of the Asch paradigm) tends to be higher in ‘tight’ 
cultures such as those displaying strong traditions (Huang and Harris, 1973; 
Meade and Barnard, 1973), communal social organization (Boldt, 1976) or author-
itarian structure (Chandra, 1973). Further, more sedentary, agricultural groups 
appear to exhibit higher levels of conformity than other cultures where there are 
heavy punishments for nonconformity (Whittaker and Meade, 1967). Also, a 
meta-analytical study has shown that individualistic cultures, such as Britain, 
Australia and the USA, tend to show lower levels of conformity than collectivistic 
cultures, such as Asian and non-Western cultures (Bond and Smith, 1996). In a 
study of 133 replications of the Asch experiment across 17 countries, Bond and 
Smith showed that participants who scored high on the collectivism scale, meas-
uring the degree to which individuals are integrated into groups (Hofstede, 1980), 
conformed more than people who scored low on this scale. In general, conformity 
was highest among collectivistic cultures than individualistic cultures such as the 
USA and northern Europe (Smith, Bond and Ka˘gıtçıba¸sı, 2006). 
Markus and Kitayama (1991) argue that these findings point to the fact that 
conformity acts as a kind of ‘social glue’ that binds a culture together. In collectiv-

418
Belonging
istic or interdependent cultures, this closeness is important and social norms and 
relations govern behaviour. This is less important for individualistic cultures, so 
this is another reason why we perhaps see less conformity in individualistic 
cultures where the individual self is the primary guide to behaviour (see also Heine 
and Ruby, 2010; Oyserman, Coon and Kemmelmeier, 2002; Vignoles, Chrysso-
choou and Breakwell, 2000). Markus and Kitayama’s argument also brings into 
question how different cultures view conformity and what it means to be 
‘conformist’. In collectivistic cultures, conformity is seen as a positive factor 
promoting cohesion and harmony within the group, whereas individualistic 
cultures value independence and making one’s own behavioural choices, and so 
conformity is often viewed as sheep-like behaviour to be avoided. Who is right? 
Of course, both conformity and independence are important. Following the 
majority is essential for social cohesion. On the other hand, resisting the majority 
is crucial for innovation and social change. We now turn our discussion to situa-
tions when people resist social pressure to conform.
Resisting social influence
Obviously, we do not always conform to social pressures. In fact, we often react 
strongly to attempts to influence our opinions and behaviours and deliberately 
(but sometimes also unconsciously) react in the opposite direction to the influ-
ence. This kind of negative reaction occurs in particular when influence attempts 
are blatant or obvious. In such situations, we feel that our personal freedom is 
being violated or challenged, so we react against the attempt in order to protect 
our freedom. People in general do not like to be manipulated. Reactance against 
influence is a way to maintain our uniqueness, uphold our own opinion, or behave 
in a way that we want rather than what someone else wishes to impose on us 
(Brehm, 1966). Reactance can lead to acts of rebellion, for example a child who is 
ordered to tidy their room may react by doing the opposite and making an even 
bigger mess. A young teenager warned about the effects of smoking may smoke 
simply to defy parents or guardians (Figure 9.11). When our freedoms are chal-
lenged, we often defy convention and do the opposite (see also Chapter 6). 
Ironically, reactance against blatant attempts to limit our personal freedom can 
be used against us. For example, some persuasive sales methods capitalize on reac-
tance by manipulating a consumer into choosing a product they might ordinarily 
not have chosen, or might have casually overlooked. One neat example of this was 
in the successful launch campaign of South African Destiny magazine, where the 
professional female target audience was encouraged not to buy the magazine 
because of its ‘dangerous content’. In lay terms, this process is referred to as ‘reverse 
psychology’, which can often be an effective technique. Another everyday example 
is how parents sometimes attempt to persuade their noncompliant children. Parents 
would probably agree that one way to get a child to eat their broccoli might be to 
tell them: ‘Whatever you do, do not eat your broccoli.’ In an act of defiance, the 
child may do the opposite, at least on some occasions.

Social influence 
Another way to resist social influence is by asserting uniqueness. It is clear that 
people feel uncomfortable when they stand out from everyone else, but they also 
feel uncomfortable when they see themselves as too similar to others. Snyder and 
Fromkin (1980) found that people like to find a happy medium, that is, they like 
to feel moderately unique. They ran an experiment demonstrating how asserting 
uniqueness is one way to resist social influence. They led university student 
participants to believe that their attitudes were either nearly identical to or distinct 
from the attitudes of a group of other students. Participants then participated in a 
conformity experiment. Results revealed that participants whose feeling of 
uniqueness was threatened were less likely to conform. In this way, they were able 
to reclaim their individuality that had been previously lost. In a recent study, 
Imhoff and Erb (2009) presented participants with a message that was said to be 
either a majority viewpoint (that is, most people agree with it) or a minority view-
point (that is, very few people agree with it). They also manipulated participants’ 
need for uniqueness by issuing a personality test and informing one-third of the 
participants that they were ‘average’ and one-third that they were ‘different’. 
There was also a control condition with no manipulation of uniqueness. Results 
revealed that, in the control condition, participants showed a preference for the 
majority message, as did participants who were informed they were ‘different’. 
However, participants whose uniqueness was threatened showed a strong prefer-
ence for the minority message. Imhoff and Erb argued that people seek out a level 
of uniqueness from others, and one way to restore that uniqueness when it is 
threatened is to express a preference for a message that is endorsed by a smaller 
group of people. An everyday non-experimental example of how people assert 
their uniqueness is in their personal dress style. For example, if everyone wore a 
white T-shirt and jeans every day, it would not only be a dull world to live in, but 
people would also feel uncomfortable with their lack of uniqueness. 
Time to reflect Can you think of social psychological reasons why people might not wish to assert their uniqueness? 
As we discussed earlier, features of the situation can also enable people to resist 
social pressure. For example, conformity in the Asch paradigm is drastically 
reduced with the addition of just one dissenting participant. Perhaps this gives 
people the social support they require to resist influence. In other words, the addi-
tion of an individual sharing an isolated person’s viewpoint helps them resist the 
majority’s influence and present their own opinion or behaviour and there is less 
risk of negative consequences. However, when a person is a minority voice within 
a group and stands alone, it is difficult for them to dissent. This might lead to the 
assumption that it is even more difficult for the lone or minority voice to attempt 
to convince the unyielding majority that they are wrong, yet this type of social 
influence does occur. Many instances in history demonstrate that an individual 
with unique views, behaviours or perspectives (e.g., Galileo, Sigmund Freud) or a 
numerical minority (e.g., the suffragette movement) can influence majority 
opinion and bring about significant social change. Indeed, social change would be

impossible without the innovations of such people and groups. Everyone would 
yield to the majority’s views and practices and society would be practically homo-
geneous and static. But how do minorities execute this innovation? How do they 
bring about social change? These questions are answered in the next section (see 
also the section in Chapter 10 on leadership).
Minority social influence 
The possibility that small and/or seemingly powerless minorities can influence 
large and/or powerful majorities was not investigated until the 1960s, when 
Moscovici began his work on minority social influence. Can a minority in a group 
bring about changes in the opinions of a majority? As we know from our earlier 
discussions, this is a difficult task. One person or a small group of people against a 
large and cohesive majority can be a daunting and intimidating position to occupy. 
Indeed, as discussed earlier, Asch (1951) exposed a large group of participants to 
one erroneously responding confederate – these participants openly mocked and 
laughed at him. Thus, the minority faces the prospect of some harsh treatment 
from the group if they choose to air their opposing views. It is also the case that 
groups try to socialize and include people who deviate from the group in order to 
maintain power and unanimity (e.g., Levine and Moreland, 1994). However, single 
people and minority groups are not completely powerless. It is clearly the case 
that small minorities influence larger groups. Indeed, Asch also showed that a 
larger minority (nine) of erroneously responding confederates against a correct 
majority of eleven participants was no longer openly 
mocked. The majority did not conform but as a cohesive 
group, the minority was a more serious force to be reck-
oned with. At the very least, minorities can force majori-
ties to stop and think. They can raise questions about 
what the group is about. If they are influential enough, 
they will cause others to ‘break off’ from the majority 
group, orchestrating a schism (e.g., Sani and Reicher, 
1999). But how can they achieve these things?
How can minorities be influential?
How can minorities exert more influence than they realistically ought to? The 
study of minority social influence was advanced significantly by the work of 
Moscovici and his colleagues. He argued that the influence of minorities cannot be 
accounted for by the same principles that explain majority influence (Moscovici, 
1976). After all, they are but a few people, and they have little control compared to 
the majority. Instead, he argued that the impact of minority groups lies in their 
behavioural style. In particular, they must propose a clear position from the outset, 
stick to it, and resist social pressure to change it. In short, they must be consistent to 
exert influence over the majority. Moscovici broke this down into two components:
Minority social influence

terms of numbers or power)

majority group.

Social influence 
1 diachronic consistency: they must display intraindividual consistency (that is, 
each individual must not waver in their opinion) and therefore show stability 
over time. 
2 synchronic consistency: they must display interindividual consistency (that is, 
individuals within the minority should show the same opinion) and therefore 
show stability across the group. 
Moscovici and colleagues ran experiments to test this idea. 
In one study, Moscovici, Lage and Naffrechoux (1969) showed groups of six 
participants 36 coloured slides. The slides were all blue and only differed in their 
intensity. Participants were asked to state aloud what the colour of each slide was. 
Moscovici et al. manipulated the consistency of a minority within the group. In the 
consistent condition, two confederates always answered ‘green’ so that they were 
both diachronically and synchronically consistent. In the inconsistent condition, 
the confederates answered ‘blue’ on 12 trials and ‘green’ on 24 trials (the incon-
sistent condition). There was also a control condition where there were no 
confederates. Results revealed that participants committed practically no errors in 
the control condition and almost always correctly identified the slides as blue or 
green. In the inconsistent minority condition, only 1.25 per cent of participants 
gave an incorrect answer, which was only marginally higher than the control 
condition. However, in the consistent minority condition, 8.42 per cent of partici-
pants gave an incorrect answer (see Figure 9.13). Although not a huge increase in 
influence, this is significant considering the minority status of the confederates. 
The fact that they were consistent in their responding was enough to convince 
some people some of the time.

In a refinement of Moscovici et al.’s study, Nemeth, Swedlund and Kanki (1974) 
included two additional conditions where confederates responded ‘green’ on half 
the trials and ‘green-blue’ on the other half. The confederates either responded 
‘green’ or ‘green-blue’ randomly, or ‘green’ on the brighter of the slides and 
‘green-blue’ on the duller slides – the latter condition being the consistent minority 
condition – consistent because there was a logical pattern to their responses. In 
this study, the random condition had no effect. However, the consistent condition 
led to 21 per cent of responses being aligned with the influence attempt. Interest-

ingly, results did not replicate Moscovici et al.’s (1969) ‘green minority’ condition. 
Nemeth et al. argued that this was probably because their participants were 
permitted to respond with more than one colour. In Moscovici et al.’s study, the 
minority showed no flexibility when the context clearly allowed it. Perhaps they 
did not influence the group because they were perceived as rigid and unrealistic 
(see also Mugny and Papastamou, 1982). Other research shows that people often 
interpret the actions of minorities in terms of psychological peculiarities (Papas-
tamou and Mugny, 1990). Consistency within the minority is therefore important 
but a minority’s influence is also dependent on how their consistency is inter-
preted by the majority. 
Time to reflect Have you ever found yourself in a situation where you needed to change the opinions or 
behaviours of a majority group? What did you do? If you were with other people, what did they do? Was the attempt 
successful? Thinking about Moscovici’s work on minority influence, did the minority do the right things in order to 
influence the majority?
Majority and minority influence
Moscovici believed that minorities do not exert influence in the same way as 
majorities, and the influence mechanisms are not the same. In particular, he 
argued that it is less likely that minorities induce normative influence because 
there is no normative pressure from the majority to conform to the minority 
position. Also, minorities are sometimes disliked (Moscovici and Lage, 1976), so 
why would the majority want to follow them? Further, Moscovici argued that 
minorities influence majorities in a different way, that is, the influence that 
occurs is quite different. Instead of the influence occurring on a public, surface 
level, he argued that minorities exert their influence at a more private, deeper 
level. Majority influence, according to Moscovici, activates a social comparison 
process where the participant compares their response to that of others without 
attending very much to the issue itself. They therefore conform to the normative 
response of the group and any private acceptance will be short-lived. Minorities, 
on the other hand, he argued, evoke a validation process. Here, the participant 
attempts to understand why the minority consistently holds its position. This 
process leads the participant to think more closely about the issue (process the 
information more systematically) and, in turn, they may become more privately 
influenced (see also Martin, 1996; Peterson and Nemeth, 1996). The processes of 
minority influence are depicted in Figure 9.14. However, this puts the partici-
pant in an awkward position – do they publicly change their mind, or keep it to 
themselves? Moscovici believed that people will often do the latter. In other 
words, even when the majority pressure may prevent people from showing their 
attitude (or behaviour) change openly, they may still privately accept the posi-
tion of the minority. Thus, Moscovici and others have argued that majorities are 
more likely to induce compliance with no acceptance, but that minorities are 
more likely to achieve acceptance with no compliance. This is the basic tenet of 
conversion theory (Moscovici, 1980) and much research has supported this posi-

tion (see also Maass and Clark, 1984, 1986; Nemeth and Wachtler, 1974). Using a 
slightly different argument, Nemeth (1986, 1995) also argued that minority (but 
not majority) influence allows divergent thinking and innovation. According to 
this account, the stress that is induced when people realize that they disagree 
with the majority restricts divergent thinking compared to the realization that 
one agrees with the minority. Social identity theory offers a perspective on 
minority influence too. Here, it is argued that the minority will be most influen-
tial if they can somehow frame themselves as part of the ingroup (David and 
Turner, 2001). In particular, a shared ingroup allows people to consider the 
minority as part of the group and think closely about their qualifications and 
credentials. Research supports this view. For example, David and Turner (1996, 
1999) demonstrated that ingroup minorities achieved greater attitude change 
among a majority than outgroup minorities.

These perspectives argue for a dual process approach to social influence. 
Minorities and majorities exert their influence in different ways. However, 
Latané and Wolf (1981) proposed that a single process model can explain both 
minority and majority influence. They argued that influence is a unitary process 
regardless of its source (minority or majority). They proposed that social impact 
is a multiplicative function of the strength (power, expertise), immediacy (prox-
imity in space and time) and size (number) of the source. In particular, impact 
decreases with each additional input. For example, the 20th person in a group 
will make less of a difference than the 19th person. Further, influence is divided 
across targets. This is why, they argue, minorities have less influence than 
majorities. They are smaller in number and their power is diffused across many 
targets. There is an ongoing debate between proponents of these two perspec-
tives. Some theorists argue that the two perspectives can be integrated into a 
common theoretical framework. For example, de Dreu and de Vries (1996) 
offered a differential processing model of persuasion, arguing that stable attitude 
shift, regardless of the source, will occur if arguments are perceived to be 
convincing, people have the ability to process information and they are also 
motivated to process information. 
Other studies have shed more light on the conditions under which minorities 
and majorities are influential, enabling us to better understand the different proc-
esses that might be at work for majorities and minorities to exert their influence. 
For example Erb, Bohner, Hewstone et al. (2006) showed that actual consensus 
within the minority is an important predictor of influence. But this also depends 
on the consensus that group members perceive to exist. In particular, Erb et al.

The suffragette movement
until the early 20th century, British women were not 
permitted to vote. Members of parliament believed that 
women would not understand how parliament functioned 
and should therefore take no part in electoral procedures. 
A minority group of women disagreed. Founded in 1903 
by emmeline pankhurst, the Women’s Social and political 
union (aka the ‘suffragettes’) began their fight for social 
change. Their task was not easy – they needed to convince 
a large and established majority to change the law. How 
did they do this? The suffragettes are a classic example of 
minority influence in action. Consistent and unwavering in 
their commitment to the cause, they were prepared to 
perform extreme acts, go to prison and risk their lives to 
earn women the vote. Slowly, the suffragettes forced 
parliament to reconsider their views. After the First World 
War, the representation of the people Act was passed in 
1918 by parliament, giving the right to vote to women of 
property over the age of 30. All women over the age of 21 
were granted the right to vote in 1928.
Questions 
1 Many assume that the success of the suffragette 
movement was a ‘reward’ for the vital work done by 
women during the First World War. However, women in 
France (who were also instrumental in the war effort) 
were not similarly rewarded. Do you think this is a 
good explanation? 
2 What might be another reason for their success?
3 Many of the suffragettes’ activities were violent (e.g., 
arson, vandalism). Thinking about how minorities are 
influential, would these activities have helped or 
hindered their cause? 
4 What other influences might the suffragettes have had? 
Think also about our discussion of status and roles in 
Chapter 8. 
found that telling people there was 20 per cent consensus among a minority had 
more influence if this was more than expected (e.g., if participants expected only 
10 per cent consensus), but less if actual consensus was less than expected (e.g., if 
participants expected 30 per cent consensus). Thus, it is not only the actual features 
of the minority that are important, but also how people see it (see also Erb and 
Bohner, 2007). Overall, it is clear that minorities can be influential just like majori-
ties, but social psychologists agree less on the exact processes that make this 
happen (see de Dreu and de Vries, 1996; for reviews of minority influence, see 
Martin and Hewstone, 2008; Martin, Hewstone, Martin and Gardikiotis, 2008).

Social influence 
In this chapter, we have learned that people respond to social 
influence in different ways depending on who they are and the 
situation in which they find themselves. people are sometimes 
influenced because they do not want to stand apart from the 
group and risk rejection, ridicule and other negative responses 
from the group. Sometimes, however, this social influence can 
have negative consequences, as is often the case when people 
‘blindly’ follow rules and orders. Here is a brief summary of the 
points covered in this chapter:
• Several conditions increase the likelihood of social 
influence, such as being confronted with an authority 
figure, experiencing group pressure and fearing disapproval 
from the group. Cultural factors also affect social influence, 
with some cultures showing greater levels of conformity 
than others. 
• people are not always easily influenced and some conditions 
will actually reduce the likelihood of social influence 
occurring. For example, being in a group that is not 
unanimous or having made a prior commitment to a 
decision will make an individual less likely to be influenced 
by the group. 
• There are said to be two different types of social influence. 
Normative influence occurs when people are influenced 
without changing their attitudes. Informational influence 
occurs when people are outwardly influenced and their 
attitudes also change. research findings suggest that our 
attitudes and behaviours are more likely to be influenced by 
the groups we belong to – a process called referent 
informational influence. 
• of course, people often resist social pressure because they 
want to be unique or uphold their own opinions. people can 
react against group conventions or assert their uniqueness 
in other ways such as dressing or talking differently to other 
members of the group. 
• Finally, minorities (individuals and group) can innovate and 
change people’s attitudes and behaviours in order to force 
social change. They can do so by being consistent, clear and 
unwavering in their attempts to influence the majority.
our concern in this chapter has been how social groups can 
exert an influence on the behaviour of the individuals who 
belong to them. In Chapter 10, we turn to how individuals can 
exert an influence on the behaviour of the groups they belong 
to. Individuals often collaborate in ways that mean they are 
effectively thinking, feeling and acting as a unit. How do they 
work together to solve problems, identify and pursue common 
goals, and even experience emotions? 
Essay questions
At the beginning of the chapter, we asked you to consider  
these questions:
1 Imagine you are in a room with 10 of your peers, voting on 
who will be the next president of the tennis club. everyone 
before you votes for Jo but you really want Malika to get the 
job. Who will you vote for? What conditions would make it 
easier for you to vote for Malika?
2 How would you explain the actions of an rAF pilot who, 
when asked to drop bombs on an Iraqi village, does so 
without question?
3 A small political party holds only 5 per cent of the seats in 
parliament. It has a strong position on environmental issues 
and its main agenda is to influence governmental policy on 
these matters. What options are open to this party to 
achieve its goal?
Having read this chapter, these questions could also be framed 
as the following essay questions, which you can attempt in 
preparation for your examinations:
1 What are the factors that influence conformity within 
groups? Discuss with reference to relevant research on social 
influence processes.
2 everyone is capable of ‘evil’ – it all depends on the situation. 
Do you agree with this statement? Why/why not?
3 With reference to relevant research, explain how minorities 
can influence majorities.

Applying social psychology
Can conformity decrease antisocial behaviour?
Have you ever walked down the streets of a big city and 
wondered how to stop people throwing their litter all over the 
place? Well, making people aware of social norms is one way of 
reducing such antisocial behaviour. For example, seeing 
another person pick up litter in a car park reduces the 
percentage of people who throw leaflets from their car’s 
windscreen onto the ground (kallgren, reno and Cialdini, 
2000). Also, reno, Cialdini and kallgren (1993) ran a study in a 
dirty car park that had litter strewn all over the place. A 
confederate walked by and either threw litter on the ground, or 
picked up and appropriately disposed of some litter. There was 
also a control condition where there was no confederate. In 
each case, the experimenters had put a leaflet on people’s cars 
and observed their behaviour when they got back to their car. 
The results revealed that in the control condition, 38 per cent of 
the car owners threw the leaflet onto the ground. In the 
condition where the confederate littered, 30 per cent of car 
owners littered too. However, in the condition where the 
confederate disposed of their litter, only 4 per cent of observed 
car owners littered. These studies demonstrate that making 
people aware of prosocial norms may be a useful technique for 
decreasing littering behaviour.
In this exercise, we would like you to think of another 
example of a common antisocial behaviour and devise an 
intervention against this behaviour. Base your intervention  
on the concept of norm awareness and write down the 
following things:
1 A statement of the problem.
2 A description of the intervention you would introduce (e.g., 
what would you manipulate?) and the theoretical basis for 
this intervention.
3 An outline of how you will measure the outcomes. In other 
words, how will you know if your intervention has worked?

Referent informational influence
Several studies have shown that people are more likely to 
laugh at TV comedies that are accompanied by prerecorded or 
‘canned’ laughter (e.g., Cialdini, 1993). platow, Haslam, Both et 
al. (2005) built on these findings to design a clever 
experimental test of the concept of referent informational 
influence. They had participants watch, alone, a stand-up 
comedy routine on video. The tape either contained no 
laughter, or canned laughter inserted after each joke. 
participants were led to believe that the audience comprised 
either ingroup members – fellow students at La Trobe university 
in Australia – or outgroup members, in this case members of an 
Australian far-right political party. The results were
• ingroup audience and canned laughter: participants laughed 
for an average of 3.92 minutes 
• ingroup audience with no laughter: participants laughed for 
0.90 minutes 
• outgroup audience and canned laughter: participants 
laughed for 0.94 minutes 
• outgroup audience with no laughter: participants laughed 
for 0.79 seconds.

Australia known as one Nation. These people are likely to 
have radically different values and worldviews than your 
average, relatively liberal, psychology student at La Trobe 
university in Melbourne. Imagine if participants had been 
told that the audience had comprised an outgroup that 
shared the same basic beliefs and values as the ingroup. Can 
you think of an example of such an outgroup? In this case, do 
you think that participants would have been indifferent to 
whether the outgroup was laughing? Why/why not? (Back

8 In light of your answers to question 7, how convincing do 
you think this experiment is as a demonstration of referent 
informational influence? 
9 Now that you have completed this exercise, think about a 
potential application of the logic of this experiment on 
referent informational influence. recently, there has been 
controversy over sexist and racist humour. According to 
some people, a joke is a joke, and people should not worry 
too much about racist and sexist jokes. According to others, 
humour and our reactions to humour are important, partly 
because they define social norms about the acceptability of 
representations of social groups. There is some support for 
the latter, pessimistic view of humour. Male participants 
exposed to sexist jokes subsequently show increases in rape 
proclivity – the self-reported willingness to rape (romero-
Sánchez, Durán, Carretero-Dios et al., 2010). However, this 
effect was moderated by how unpleasant (aversive) these 
jokes were perceived to be. Men who found sexist jokes to 
be highly aversive did not show any increase in rape 
proclivity. The experiment by platow et al. (2005) suggests 
that the emotional reactions of the audience – especially an 
ingroup audience – will affect a man’s emotional reactions 
to sexist humour. The worst combination of circumstances 
we can imagine is a large audience of people laughing at 
sexist jokes, which may lead men to find jokes less aversive 
than they would when alone. This has led to media debate 
on the rise of ‘rape humour’ by stand-up comedians such as 
ricky gervais and Jimmy Carr. Indeed, a show by Carr was 
called Rapier Wit, apparently in a gruesome pun (see, e.g., 
Logan, 2010). Design an experiment to examine this blind 
spot. What kind of study would you conduct to examine 
whether men do find sexist jokes less aversive when there is 
an audience laughing than when either alone or when an 
outgroup audience laughs, and whether this has knock-on 
effects on rape proclivity. You might want to research briefly 
how rape proclivity is measured using internet search 
engines or academic databases.

Student project  
Social influence and prejudice 
Nikita Woodcock studied as an 
undergraduate student at Sheffield 
university, and her final-year 
dissertation supervisor was Dr 
Thomas Webb. Her work is an 
innovative extension of the 
research on social influence as a 
function of who the source of 
influence is. As a study of implicit 
prejudice, it also speaks to many of the issues we consider in 
Chapters 4 and 11.
My topic and aims
prejudice cannot be measured simply by asking people about 
their attitudes towards particular social groups (e.g., Do you 
like Asian people?). Although a number of measures of implicit 
prejudice exist, such as the Implicit Association Test (IAT) 
(greenwald, Mcghee and Schwartz, 1998), they tend to reflect 
people’s attitudes, rather than their actions. The main focus of 
my project was on designing an unobtrusive measure that was 
better able to predict prejudiced behaviour.  
I selected this area of research due to my personal 
experience that most people seem to identify themselves as 
non-prejudiced. It logically follows that prejudiced attitudes 
and behaviours should be declining. However, there is of course 
still a significant amount of prejudice and discrimination in 
society. I was interested to find out whether people are aware 
that they hold prejudiced views, and whether these beliefs 
influence people’s behaviour. 
My methods
participants undertook two measures of implicit prejudice, the 
first being the IAT. They then completed an advice-taking task 
which was the new measure of prejudice. The advice-taking 
task is a computer task in which participants have to find 
tokens hidden in either a blue or red box. Before they select a 
box, however, a face appears on the screen offering advice 
(e.g., ‘choose the red box!’). There were six Asian faces and 12 
White faces – a total of 54 trials with each face offering advice 
three times – twice correct and once incorrect. We compared 
the proportion of advice taken from White versus Asian 
advice-givers. 
To measure discriminatory behaviour, participants received 
an incorrectly addressed email one week after taking part in the 
computer tasks (a technique borrowed from Stern and Faber, 
1997). The ‘lost email’ was addressed to Irfan patel (a typically 
Asian name) and referred to coursework which had been 
incorrectly submitted and required resubmission within 24 
hours or they would be penalized. I measured whether 
participants replied to this email or not.
My findings and their implications
We found that the proportion of advice taken from Asian and 
White faces correlated with the results of the IAT, suggesting 
that responses to the advice-taking task reflected implicit 
prejudice. However, only the advice-taking measure predicted 
whether participants responded to the lost email they received. 
Around 90 per cent of participants explicitly stated that race 
would have no impact on whether they would take advice or 
not, suggesting that they were unaware of any racial 
discrimination during the advice-taking task, and, thus, that the 
task was unobtrusive.  
The results highlight that not only do we have attitudes we 
may be unaware of, but these attitudes can influence our 
behaviour in a way contrary to how we believe we would 
behave. This has implications for understanding why, despite 
self-reported prejudice declining, there is still prejudice and 
discrimination in society. It is not that people are lying about 
being prejudiced but that they may hold prejudiced attitudes at 
an unconscious level and it is these which can influence actions 
towards others.
My journey
I am currently working as a gCSe, AS and A2 psychology teacher 
in kent. This allows me to continue to learn about psychology 
and, hopefully, enthuse young people about psychology. I enjoy 
teaching and have found my understanding of human 
behaviour very beneficial in this career. I have to deal with a 
wide variety of different students with a range of different 
needs and I frequently find myself drawing on my knowledge 
of psychology to help me with this. I always saw myself moving 
into educational psychology and this is still an option for the 
future. However, at the moment, I am enjoying my job too 
much to consider moving on.
Through undertaking my research project, I learned a 
substantial amount about the challenges that researchers face 
and exactly what goes into completing psychological research. I 
also learned a lot about myself and what I am able to achieve 
when I put my mind to it. I developed confidence in my ability 
to undertake a challenge and succeed at it. I found it daunting 
at first but remember immersing myself in the project, spending 
hours in the labs and the library not just because I had a 

429
Social influence 
deadline, but because I enjoyed it. one of the most useful skills 
that I gained in terms of my current career was time 
management. With a relatively short timeframe to complete 
the project, I learned to prioritize and manage my time 
efficiently, a skill that is vital for teaching.
The data and findings from my research project formed part 
of a paper written by my supervisor. The paper consisted of four 
experiments developing the advice-taking task as an 
unobtrusive measure of prejudice. My data are described in 
experiment 3. 
My advice
My advice for anyone embarking on a research project is first 
and foremost to select an area that you are truly interested in. 
The project will consume a lot of your time and if it is not 
something you are interested in, you will struggle to give it the 
dedication it requires. Students should also remember that 
their supervisor is there to help and offer guidance and support. 
It is a big challenge and one which any student would struggle 
to undertake alone. Be organized, and finally, enjoy it.

In this chapter, we consider the factors that facilitate and hinder collective human behav-
iour. We examine how group members are influenced by each other through the processes 
of social facilitation, social loafing and deindividuation. We also discuss how groups make 
decisions and how they cooperate, experience conflict and avoid conflict. Finally, we discuss 
leadership in groups. By the end of this chapter, you will have learned about the factors that 
facilitate and obstruct collective human achievement.

Questions to consider
1 diana is learning to tap dance and has been practising 
for a forthcoming recital. she practises in front of a 
mirror and makes all the right moves. However, when 
the recital comes along, she makes many mistakes and 
cannot understand why she messed up so badly. all her 
family and friends were watching her. How might we 
explain this?
2 Faiza is working with a group on an assignment about 
stereotypes of the British. everyone has agreed to 
collect five references on the topic for the group to 
share. Faiza does not try very hard and only provides 
two references, letting the group down. What social 
psychological processes (intentional and unintentional) 
might lead Faiza to do this?
3 Ben is at a concert. It is his favourite band and he is very 
excited. the audience is huge and everyone is dancing. 
Quite spontaneously, Ben moves up to a female stranger 
in the audience and grabs her by the wrist. Why would 
he do such a thing?

Groups do great and terrible things that individuals cannot. Our everyday 
language reflects the wisdom that groups do things. For example, we effortlessly 
speak of how the Ancient Egyptians built the pyramids of Giza, Ancient Britons 
Stonehenge and Ancient Chinese the Great Wall. We also talk of the wrongs 
perpetrated by one group upon another – how one group suppresses, tyrannizes 
or even commits genocide upon another. Thus, we appear to assume that groups 
are capable of bearing collective responsibility for their actions (Branscombe and 
Doosje, 2004). Sometimes, they are even punished collectively, as when countries 
are forced to pay reparations, or companies are sued for their wrongdoings. 
Groups are perceived to be more than merely the sum of their parts.
In this chapter, our focus is on group behaviour and, in particular, how groups 
do things. In so doing, it is important to think about what it means to say that 
groups do things. When we say ‘group X did something’, we do not mean exactly 
the same thing as when we say ‘person X did something’. For one thing, although 
a person may sometimes have conflicting goals, and selfhood may not be quite as 
unitary as we normally imagine (see Chapter 2), a person is clearly a moral unit in 
a way that a group is not. A given member of group X may have contributed 
nothing to its actions, and may even have tried to obstruct them (Lewis, 1948). 
For example, women may have achieved the right to vote despite many barriers, 
even from within their own group. A member of group X may not have even been 
born when it committed atrocities (van den Beld, 2002). For example, although 
Germans committed many atrocities during the Second World War, most Germans 
alive today were not alive when these events occurred. It is a much debated point 
whether such people should receive any blame (or credit) or accept any responsi-
bility for their group’s actions. In contrast, we cannot choose to punish or reward 
only part of a person for their actions. An interesting example is how serial killers 
such as Ted Bundy use as their defence the argument that they have multiple 
personalities and that just one personality was responsible for the murders. How 
does one punish a personality? 
Another important point is that the human brain is the most complex structure 
in the known universe (see Chapter 3). Having one makes it possible for individuals 
to form aspirations and goals, experience emotions, have thoughts and memories, 
and plan and execute behaviour. Of course, groups also have means of storing and 
processing information, as in books, public archives, through information sharing 
and discussion. But these are nowhere near as sophisticated as the operations 
permitted by the human brain. Even if we were to allow that groups can have a 
mental life – an idea scotched by many scholars – it would be a much simpler and 
less coherent life than that experienced by individuals. Thus, when we speak of 
groups’ mental, emotional and motivational states, we are either talking metaphori-
cally or about states that are widely shared by their members. The behaviour of a 
group cannot be spurred by its mental states in the same way that a person’s can. 
Nonetheless, when we refer to many group behaviours, as in ‘The Ancient 
Chinese built the Great Wall’, we are not just saying that a number of individuals 
from this group built it. We are saying that those individuals were influenced by

Group behaviour
their interactions with other group members, causing them to form goals and act 
differently than if they were alone. In particular, these group members adopted 
common goals and worked together in a coordinated fashion in order to achieve 
them. This coordinated group action is the kind of group behaviour we are most 
interested in here. It is what allows human beings to achieve together what they 
cannot do alone. In this chapter, we will consider the factors that facilitate and 
obstruct collective human achievement. In particular, we shall examine how 
groups influence their members through the processes of social facilitation, social 
loafing, deindividuation, decision making, cooperation, conflict and leadership.
Social facilitation
One way in which groups can achieve more than the sum of their individual parts 
is by influencing the efforts and achievements of their members. Gordon Allport 
(1954, p. 46) asked: ‘What changes in an individual’s normal solitary performance 
occur when people are present?’ In other words, how does the group influence the 
individual? Does the group help or hinder individual performance? Triplett (1898) 
was the first to investigate these sorts of questions. He observed that cyclists’ 
racing times were faster when racing against the clock than when racing without 
being timed. However, he also found that cyclists made better time when racing 
alongside other cyclists than when racing alone against the clock. Intrigued by this 
observation, he set out to examine the phenomenon experimentally, where he 
asked children, either alone or co-present with others, to wind string onto a fishing 
reel as quickly as possible. He found that the children who worked alongside 
others wound faster than the children who completed the task alone. 
Why did this happen? Why would children perform this task better in the pres-
ence of others rather than when they acted alone? Triplett thought that competing 
with others ‘energizes’ people and enhances their task performance. Many other 
experiments followed Triplett’s studies, demonstrating that the co-presence of 
individuals improves the speed with which people perform simple mathematical 
and motor tasks. To this day, social scientists investigate how the presence of 
others improves performance on tasks such as solving anagrams and puzzles 
(Flynn and Amanatullah, 2012); and Gardner and Knowles (2008) demonstrated 
that the person present does not even need to be real – being in the ‘presence’ of a 
fictional TV character can facilitate performance on simple tasks. 
Floyd Allport (1920) called this phenomenon social facilitation – the process by 
which the presence of others can facilitate behaviour. However, unlike Triplett, 
Allport did not assume that the context needed to be competitive. Instead, he 
argued that the mere presence of others could facilitate behaviour. In other words, 
all that is necessary is that other people are around, either doing the same thing (as 
co-actors) or simply watching passively. Allport also argued that this phenomenon 
is not just present in human beings, and research suggests he was right. 
Studies have demonstrated examples of social facilitation in other animal species,

specifically in the feeding behaviour of rats (Harlow, 1932), dogs (James, 1953) and 
chicks (Tolman, 1964). Other studies have demonstrated that a variety of creatures 
such as kangaroos, monkeys and horses eat more and run faster and perform other 
behaviours better when other members of their species are doing the same thing 
(Dindo, Whiten and de Waal, 2009; Pays, Dubot, Jarman et al., 2009; van Dieren-
donck, de Vries and Schilder, 1995). 
However, not all studies demonstrated results that were consistent with the 
idea of social facilitation. Shortly after the initial discovery of the social facilitation 
effect, some studies showed that the presence of others actually impairs perform-
ance, for both animals and humans (for a review, see Bond and Titus, 1983). The 
presence of others can sometimes be so inhibiting that the phenomenon can actu-
ally become a case of social inhibition rather than social facilitation. For example, 
men take longer to urinate when someone is standing immediately beside them at 
a urinal than when they are alone (Middlemist, Knowles and Matter, 1976). Other 
findings have shown that people who are asked to perform a complex task, such as 
typing their name backwards, do so more slowly in the presence of other people 
than when they are alone (Schmitt, Gilovich, Goore and Joseph, 1986). The pres-
ence of others can sometimes be helpful but at other times is a hindrance. So, what 
kind of social presence is important and for what kind of task? 
Zajonc (1965) argued that the presence of others makes people alert and 
sometimes anxious (see Mullen, Bryant and Driskell, 1997). Drawing on a well-
established principle from experimental psychology research, Zajonc argued 
that this arousal enhances whatever response tendency is the dominant one – in 
particular, when people are anxious, they tend to do better on easy tasks (tasks 
they are already good at) and 
worse on difficult ones (tasks 
where 
they 
may 
normally 
struggle). Zajonc argued that 
this phenomenon enables us to 
understand why the presence 
of others is sometimes helpful 
but sometimes harmful to task 
performance. 
For 
example, 
when they are being watched, 
people perform well on simple 
mathematical 
tasks 
because 
they are easy, whereas by comparison, they do poorly on complex mathematical 
tasks because they are difficult. Whether social facilitation or inhibition occurs for 
people depends on the nature of the task they are doing (see Figure 10.1).

Group behaviour
Tasks such as learning mazes are naturally difficult for people, so being 
watched does not help – it makes people anxious and they perform worse. On the 
other hand, completing a simple addition is easy and the presence of others ener-
gizes people to do well on these easy tasks. They look good in front of others and 
therefore feel good. Thinking back to our earlier example, if you were learning 
how to perform a difficult task like play the piano, it would probably help not to 
be aroused by the presence of watchful eyes. This is likely to make you feel 
anxious and perform badly. However, if you were an experienced pianist, the 
arousal produced by the presence of others is likely to be exhilarating and 
performance enhancing. In sports, the presence of an audience may provide 
athletes with that extra something to perform to their best, or beyond their 
ability. For the less skilled athlete, however, this may trigger a ‘choking under 
pressure’ response. 
Try it yourself try to design a simple study to test Zajonc’s principles of social facilitation. For example, ask friends 
to complete either a simple or complex crossword in a room with other students, or watch them do it by themselves. 
do they complete the task more quickly in a group if the task is simple? Perhaps you can think of other tasks where 
the findings would be different. this is a good exercise in designing a study to test a hypothesis. 
Exploring further Look on the internet for examples of so-called ‘choking’ in sporting events. For example, what 
happened to rory McIlroy in the Masters golf tournament in the usa in augusta in 2011 when his skills seemed to 
abandon him? Why did John terry slip on the penalty spot and miss his shot in the 2008 Champions League final? 
Write down a list of 5–10 of these events and think about how they display some of the characteristics of social 
inhibition. Is this something that also affects teams of people rather than just individuals within groups? Was the 
highly favoured us women’s soccer team loss to Japan in the 2011 World Cup an example of social inhibition?
Later studies have supported Zajonc’s theory. To give one interesting example, 
Michaels, Blommel, Brocato et al. (1982) studied the performance of pool players 
in a student union. They found that skilled pool players (who made over 70 per 
cent of successful shots while being observed secretly) performed better (perform-
ance increased to 80 per cent) when four observers came to watch them. On the 
other hand, poor players (averaging less than 40 per cent of shots under normal 
conditions) performed worse (making only a quarter of their shots) when they 
were being watched. For skilled players, the dominant response was to success-
fully sink the balls and the presence of others facilitated their performance (Figure 
10.2). However, for the less skilled players, the dominant response was to fail 
(they failed most of the time), so the scrutiny of others made them even worse. 
Other examples are plentiful. People and cockroaches learn simple mazes quicker 
in the presence of others but learn complex mazes more slowly (e.g., Zajonc, 
Heingartner and Herman, 1969). 
More recently, Blascovich, Mendes, Hunter and Solomon (1999) found physi-
ological evidence supporting Zajonc’s theory. Here, the presence of others trig-
gered arousal in people who were performing a task and heart rate patterns were

consistent with findings of improved performance on familiar tasks and impaired 
performance on unfamiliar tasks. There are other interesting effects too. For 
example, gambling intensity (among people who already gamble) is intensified 
when people think they are in the presence of others (Rockloff and Dyer, 2007). 
In other words, people gamble more and lose more money when they think they 
are not gambling alone. Some researchers have also shown that there are indi-
vidual differences in receptivity to the presence of others. For example, some 
research suggests that people who are extraverted and have high self-esteem are 
more likely to be facilitated when behaving alone rather than in the presence of 
others. Further, a meta-analysis by Oviatt and Iso-Ahola (2008) found that the 
presence of others generally has moderate effects on many different kinds of 
motor behaviours. 
But why does this happen? Why are we aroused when others are present? It 
was generally assumed that the presence of others increases drive, which facilitates 
more dominant responses, but the finer grained processes were less clearly articu-
lated. Research evidence suggests that there are three possible ways in which the 
presence of others can influence our behaviour. These are mere presence, evalua-
tion apprehension and distraction. 
Exploring further Zajonc’s work has been influential in social psychology in many areas other than the study of 
social facilitation. read more about his life and work. a good starting point may be The Selected Works of Robert 
Zajonc (2003). 
Mere presence
Zajonc argued that nothing else about the presence of others was necessary to 
influence behaviour – simply the mere company of others is enough to increase 
drive and facilitate or hinder behaviour. This seems plausible in some examples. 
Specifically, why do joggers run faster in the presence of others when there is no 
direct competition or evaluation? They appear to be energized by the mere situa-
tion of performing their task in the presence of others. Indeed, people choose to 
jog with others because they know it helps their behaviour. Also, on tasks where 
there are no ‘right’ and ‘wrong’ answers, people make stronger judgements in the 
presence of others rather than when they act alone. For example, people show 
stronger colour preferences when they are with other people (Goldman, 1967) – 
merely being with others makes a difference on such simple, trivial tasks.
However, in some situations, the presence of others comes with additional 
features such as competition and evaluation. For example, sports are often played 
with others in competitive contexts and an audience is often present too, watching 
players’ every move. Other social psychologists have therefore argued that the 
mere presence of others, while being important in some situations, cannot fully 
explain how behaviour changes in other situations. The picture is much more 
complex. The research we have discussed so far also does not explain exactly how 
the presence of others makes a difference to people’s behaviours. The concept of 
evaluation apprehension helps to explain this further. 
Drive a negative state of 
tension associated with

Group behaviour
Evaluation apprehension
Cottrell, Wack, Sekerak and Rittle (1968) observed that the enhancement of domi-
nant responses is strongest when people think they are being watched. In an 
experiment, they asked participants to complete three tasks they had practised and 
therefore generally performed well, that is, the dominant response would be 
successful task performance. They were asked to complete the tasks in front of an 
audience who were either blindfolded, co-present but inattentive, or fully atten-
tive. Results revealed that the fully attentive audience produced the strongest 
social facilitation effect. People performed best when the members of the audience 
were paying close attention. 
Cottrell et al. (1968) argued that this occurred because the participants were 
concerned about how the audience were evaluating their performance. The blind-
folded and inattentive audience made no difference to performance presumably 
because their presence did not make the participants anxious – the audience were 
not scrutinizing their performance so their presence mattered little. On the other 
hand, the attentive audience were closely watching and this made the participants 
apprehensive about their performance. Wanting to perform well for their audi-
ence, this evaluation apprehension worked in their favour and they performed even 
better. Thus, evaluation apprehension can be invigorating and a positive influence 
on task performance. In general, the evaluation apprehension hypothesis argues 
that performance is determined directly by how people think they are being evalu-
ated rather than the fact that others are there. For example, if you are a talented 
piano student, you may still be worried that your teacher, family or friends will 
laugh at you or tell others that you are a hopeless case. At this point, however, 
your dominant performance will prevail and you are likely to perform at your 
best, facilitated by the observation of others (Butler and Baumeister, 1998; Kors, 
Linden and Gerin, 1997; Wallace, Baumeister and Vohs, 2005). 
The evaluation apprehension hypothesis can explain other findings too. For 
example, it has been found that the people who are most concerned about what 
others think (and therefore are dispositionally more concerned about evaluation) 
are most influenced by the presence of others (Geen, 1983, 1991; Geen and Gange, 
1983). Also, people perform better on tasks when they are co-present with 
someone they perceive as superior to themselves (Muller, Atzeni and Butera, 
2004), arguably because they are predisposed to compare themselves with people 
who perform slightly better than themselves (Festinger, 1954). Thus, the self-
consciousness we feel in the presence of others can sometimes be our friend.
Of course, evaluation apprehension is not always our friend. Some research has 
shown that when people are performing tasks, the presence of others can, unfor-
tunately, become their enemy. For example, Markus (1978) asked participants to 
perform the task of undressing and dressing in their own clothes or undressing and 
dressing in unfamiliar clothes. Participants performed this task alone, in the pres-
ence of an inattentive audience, or in the presence of an attentive audience. Markus 
found that social facilitation only occurred when the task was easy (participants

dressed in their own clothes). In the pres-
ence of an attentive audience, participants 
performed this task faster than in the presence 
of an inattentive audience or when they were 
alone. On the other hand, when the task was 
difficult (dressing in unfamiliar clothes), the 
presence of any kind of audience was detri-
mental to behaviour (see Figure 10.3). 
In another study, de Vet and de Dreu 
(2007) found that thinking aloud can hinder 
creativity and the generation of ideas – a 
finding that was particularly pronounced for 
individuals who are highly sensitive to what 
others think of them and have a lower ability 
to adapt to others’ expectations. Further, Schmitt et al. (1986) asked participants to 
type either their name or a code backwards on the computer. The mere presence 
of others made people perform the simple task quicker and the difficult task 
slower. The introduction of an evaluation apprehension condition (an attentive 
audience, as in Markus’s study) made little difference to participants’ typing speed. 
From these findings, it seems that evaluation apprehension is sometimes helpful 
but sometimes not necessary for social facilitation. Even more interesting, evalua-
tion apprehension can sometimes be harmful. 
Distraction
Further expanding on these findings, Sanders, Baron and Moore (1978; see also 
Baron, 1986) argued that self-conscious evaluation apprehension facilitates behav-
iour on simple tasks but hinders performance on complex tasks because people 
become too concerned about what others are doing and how these others are evalu-
ating their behaviour. As such, people become distracted and perform worse. This 
is more likely on difficult or unfamiliar tasks than simple or familiar tasks because 
when people are distracted, drive occurs and, as we know, drive facilitates 
performance on simpler tasks rather than complex activities. 
Sanders et al. (1978) ran an experiment in which participants performed either 
an easy or difficult digit task. They did so either alone or with someone who was 
performing the same or a different task. Distraction was therefore operationalized 
by what the co-actor was doing. Sanders et al. argued that people should be more 
distracted by the presence of someone else if they are doing the same as them-
selves. They will be busy watching what the other person is doing and comparing 
the person’s behaviour to their own. People should perform worse on the same 
difficult task because the potential for distraction to become a problem is maxi-
mized. Indeed, this is exactly what happened. People performed worse when 
someone else was doing the same thing as them. Other studies support Sanders et 
al.’s theory. For example, compared to more experienced drivers, younger drivers 
tend to have more accidents when they have passengers in the car than when they 
are driving alone (Chen, Baker, Braver and Li, 2000).

Group behaviour
It is important to note that these kinds of effects can arise not only from the 
presence of others. Sanders (1981) showed that nonhuman distractors such as 
bursts of light can have similar effects on social facilitation. Thus, it could be argued 
that there is nothing uniquely ‘social’ about social facilitation. Distraction effects 
can also explain social facilitation in animals when the evaluation apprehension 
explanation is not as plausible. For example, it is plausible to argue that animals are 
distracted in the presence of other animals and that this simple distraction affects 
their behaviour rather than something ‘social’ about the presence of other animals. 
Other explanations for social facilitation
Not all explanations of social facilitation involve the notion of arousal. For 
example, the concept of self-awareness (Carver and Scheier, 1981; Duval and 
Wicklund, 1972) has been suggested as another mechanism. Specifically, if people 
compare their actual performance on a task with their ideal performance (how they 
would like to do), there will be a small discrepancy for easy, well-practised tasks. 
On the other hand, the discrepancy will inevitably be larger for difficult or non-
learned tasks. For example, people will generally perform as well as they would 
like to perform on an easy maths task but may fall short of what they would like 
to achieve on a complex or difficult maths task. This self-discrepancy (Higgins, 
1987) can motivate people to perform better, but only if the discrepancy is small. 
If it is too large, motivation will decrease – people will simply give up because 
they cannot attain their ideal. Being watched by others can increase awareness of 
self-discrepancy. This is another explanation for why performance on easy tasks 
improves but performance on difficult tasks actually gets worse. You can probably 
think of examples from your own experience – when performing slightly below 
your standard, you may feel energized and try harder. However, when you fall 
short of your desired standard, perhaps you give up and move onto something else. 
Interestingly, drawing attention to the self and making a person self-conscious 
can also interfere with behaviours that people perform automatically. For example, 
Mullen and Baumeister (1987) found that basketball players who are asked to 
monitor their body movements were more likely to miss than those who were not 
asked to do so. Thus, even in the case of well-practised (although still difficult) 
behaviours, attention to the self is not always a good thing. It has been argued that 
the embarrassment caused by failing in front of others impairs performance (Bond, 
1982). Because people are generally worried about how they appear in front of 
others, the anticipation of failure, especially on difficult tasks, can be a hindrance 
to performance.
Another explanation for social facilitation phenomena is the notion that people 
feel ‘overloaded’ in the presence of an audience and this distracts them from cues 
they need to attend to (Baron, 1986; Mansted and Semin, 1980). This does not 
matter much for simple tasks and can be advantageous because attention is 
narrowed to a small set of cues, thus minimizing distraction. On the other hand, 
performance on difficult tasks – where broader attention is required – is impaired. 
Of course, these are quite varied explanations for social facilitation. Because 
findings are varied too, it is clear that there is no one ‘true’ explanation for why 

440
Belonging
this phenomenon occurs – many factors may be at play. 
It is likely that all these factors contribute to the impact 
that the presence of others has on our behaviour. Bond 
and Titus (1983) conducted a meta-analysis of 241 
studies on social facilitation, enabling them to examine 
the key factors in driving social facilitation effects. They 
found that the mere presence of individuals in these 
experiments accounted for only small variations in 
behaviour, so many other factors are probably respon-
sible for social facilitation phenomena (see also Uziel, 
2007). In particular, instead of drawing the simple 
distinction between ‘easy’ and ‘difficult’ tasks deter-
mining social facilitation phenomena, it has been 
proposed that researchers should pay closer attention to 
the nature of the task itself. Steiner (1972, 1976) 
attempted to devise a ‘list’ or taxonomy of types of 
group tasks, highlighting how people performing 
different types of tasks may respond differently to the 
presence of co-actors and audiences (Table 10.1). 
Classifying tasks on these dimensions allows us to 
take a closer look at how the presence of others might 
influence behaviour. Steiner believed that group 
performance is naturally worse than the sum of a 
group’s individual potential. This process loss, or deteri-
oration of group performance, is said to occur because 
of various factors, such as the time taken to coordinate 
the group, distractors and the presence of dominant group members. However, 
using the taxonomy given in Table 10.1, one can see that groups will arguably 
perform better on some tasks than on others. In particular, social facilitation 
occurs when people work towards goals individually and when their effort can be 
individually evaluated. 
But what happens in other kinds of tasks where people ‘pool’ their efforts 
towards a common goal and where individual effort cannot be evaluated? For 
example, in a tug-of-war (a unitary, maximizing and additive task), will everyone 
pull as hard as they can? On a group assignment where four students are working 
on a psychology report and each member of the group will receive the same grade, 
will everyone work as hard as they can? Steiner thought not. He suggested that 
instead of many hands making light work, or strength in unity, certain tasks would 
promote laziness and decreased effort as people lose motivation to perform. 
Time to reflect think of some examples of social facilitation. Which explanation of the phenomenon works best 
for each example and why? Before you read on, can you think of any examples where people might ‘slack off’ in 
groups? Why do you think they might do this? you can use your own experiences to answer this question.

Group behaviour
Social loafing
Ringelmann (1913) investigated how efficient people are in performing tasks in 
different group sizes (Kravitz and Martin, 1986). In one task, he asked people to 
pull horizontally on a rope (in a similar way to a tug-of-war) while the rope was 
attached to a device measuring the force of the pull of the participants. Participants 
performed the task either alone or in groups. Ringelmann found that the amount 
of pull exerted by participants decreased as the size of the group increased. In 
larger groups, individuals exerted the least amount of force to pull the rope, such 
that the collective effort of the group was around half the sum of the potential 
individual efforts (Figure 10.4). This is known as the ringelmann effect.
Why does it occur? Perhaps people are not coordinating their efforts optimally 
when they are in a group. For example, process loss could occur because people 
pull on the rope differently and their efforts are therefore occasionally antago-
nistic. Or, perhaps there is not enough 
room for people to pull to their full 
strength. Maybe their timing is slightly 
off. On the other hand, it might be the 
case that people ‘slack off’ when they 
know they are not accountable for their 
own individual performance. In other 
words, they somehow lose the motivation 
to do their best. To test these explanations, 
Ingham, Levinger, Graves and Peckham 
(1974) conducted an experiment. In one 
condition, they blindfolded participants 
and put them in the front position of the 
tug-of-war. The crucial aspect of this condition is that participants believed that 
other people were doing the task with them, but they were in fact the only person 
doing the pulling. Ingham et al. made participants think that others were pulling 
on the rope by introducing confederates standing close by who made exertion 
noises as if they were physically pulling on the rope. In the second condition, the 
groups were real. Participants were pulling and the other members of the group 
were doing the same. Participants performed the task either alone or in groups.
Results revealed that in the artificial groups, individuals showed a significant 
decrease in performance as group size increased. Remember, there were no coordi-
nation difficulties because no other people were pulling on the rope. Thus, decreases 
in effort could not be due to problems associated with pulling, shoving and bad 
timing. Instead, these decreases appear to be down to a loss of motivation. The real 
groups showed a further deficit in individual performance due to coordination loss, 
but this experiment was the first to show the real effect produced by a loss of moti-
vation within the group. So, do many hands make light work? It appears not.
This phenomenon has been named social loafing and is defined as the tendency 
for people to put in less effort when they pool their efforts towards a group goal

than when they are individually accountable for their 
efforts. This is a form of group behaviour, where the 
group produces less than the sum of its individual 
parts. Latané, Williams and Harkins (1979) examined 
social loafing in different ways, for example demon-
strating that the noise produced by six people 
shouting or clapping (with an instruction to do so as 
loud as they could) was less than three times the noise 
produced by one individual alone. In a condition 
where participants were asked to complete the tasks 
in groups of six, the amount of noise produced per person was reduced by a stag-
gering 60 per cent. However, this could also be due in part to coordination loss. 
To examine the effects of motivation loss above and beyond this general group 
inefficiency, Latané et al. ran the experiment in a similar way to Ingham et al.’s 
(1974) study. Here, they blindfolded six people and sat them in a semi-circle. They 
wore headphones and listened to loud clapping and shouting. On a number of 
trials, the participants were asked to clap and shout as loud as they could, either 
alone or with the group. The results were similar to Ingham et al.’s. There was a 
significant reduction in effort for participants in the artificial groups, with an extra 
significant decrease (coordination loss) for real groups (see Figure 10.5). 
Thus, social loafing is a general tendency for people to take a ‘free ride’ when 
they feel that others in the group are taking on some of the task too. It has been 
demonstrated, even in recent years, in many domains such as in technology-
supported groups (e.g., Alnuaimi, Robert and Maruping, 2010), work teams (e.g., 
van Dick, Tissington and Hertel, 2009), undergraduate classrooms (e.g., Jassa-
walla, Sashittal and Malshe, 2009) and handball team performance (Høigaard, 
Fuglestad, Peters et al., 2010). Social loafing is also related to another phenomenon 
known as the free rider effect, where a person takes advantage of a shared resource 
without making their due contribution to the resource (Kerr, 1983; Kerr and 
Brunn, 1983). For example, someone who cheats the taxation system is a free rider 
because they enjoy the benefits of society without having paid any of the costs. 
The main difference between a loafer and a free rider, however, is that the loafer 
does put in some effort – just not as much as they should. The free rider completely 
exploits a situation without making any effort at all. Interestingly, the participants 
in Latané et al.’s (1979) experiment did not think they had been loafing – they 
thought they had put in the same effort in both conditions. This points to another 
difference between the loafer and the free rider. The loafer may lose motivation 
without really realizing it, but the free rider knows exactly what they are doing.

tions. It happens in a range of experimental tasks from laughing and clapping, 
generation of ideas, cheerleading, swimming, maze learning and evaluative tasks 
such as rating poems. It is also a phenomenon that occurs across many different 
cultures, although see later for some key cultural differences. But why does it 
happen? We know from the studies on social facilitation that the presence of 
others can often energize us to perform better. So what is going on here? Why 
does the presence of other people sometimes mean that we ‘slack off’ and 
perform below our abilities? 
The main explanation for social loafing is an interesting variation on evaluation 
apprehension – the predominant explanation for social facilitation. Instead of 
increasing evaluation apprehension, the tasks associated with social loafing actu-
ally decrease evaluation apprehension. In social loafing experiments, individuals 
believe that their efforts are only being judged when they perform alone. Specifi-
cally, in group tasks, people are not accountable for their efforts and therefore 
concerns about being scrutinized decrease. Also, individuals find it difficult to 
monitor or evaluate their own efforts. Taking both factors into account, it is easy 
to see how responsibility is diffused across all group members and how social 
loafing occurs. In general, any situation where being in the presence of others 
increases evaluation apprehension, social facilitation will occur. On the other hand, 
if being in the presence of others decreases evaluation apprehension, social loafing 
will occur (Jackson and Harkins, 1985; Sanna, 1992; see also Harkins and 
Szymanski, 1987) (see Figure 10.6).

Time to reflect there seems to be a fine line between situations where people will perform better in the presence 
of others and when they will not. some researchers (e.g., sanna, 1992) argue that evaluation apprehension is the 
key explanation for both effects. What other factors might be important in determining whether people will loaf or 
not? think about this before reading on. 
However, the picture is more complex, as the difficulty of the task must also be 
taken into account. When the presence of others increases evaluation concerns, 
performance on easy tasks will be enhanced and performance on difficult tasks 
will be impaired. When the presence of others decreases evaluation concerns, 
performance on easy tasks may be impaired because the individual is demotivated 
or uninspired, whereas performance on difficult tasks may be enhanced because of

the social support provided by others (e.g., Karau and Williams, 1993; Lea, Spears 
and Rogers, 2003). 
There are other explanations for social loafing that implicate different psycho-
logical processes. For example, people may generally feel that others loaf in social 
tasks and if they do not do so too, they will feel like a ‘sucker’. This output equity 
explanation is also about motivation – when people learn that others are not 
pulling their weight, they too can lose motivation and put less effort into tasks. 
For example, if people perceive that a working relationship is unjust, this can 
influence the extent to which social loafing occurs (e.g., Murphy, Wayne, Liden 
and Erdogan, 2003). Perhaps you can think of a time when you worked with 
someone who did not sufficiently contribute to a task. Perhaps you felt so annoyed 
by this that you withheld your full participation from the task. Nobody would 
blame you because nobody likes being taken advantage of. Sometimes, people 
might loaf because they have no clear standard to work with – they simply do not 
know how hard they need to work. The presence of a clear standard should reduce 
social loafing, and findings suggest this is the case (Geen, 1991; Harkins and 
Szymanski, 1987; Szymanski and Harkins, 1987). 
Whatever the exact mechanism (or combination of mechanisms) responsible for 
social loafing, one obvious strategy to combat it is to make individual group 
performances identifiable. This increases evaluation apprehension, makes everyone’s 
output transparent and makes the standard clear. Indeed, it has been found that 
swimmers perform faster in relay races when someone closely monitors and 
announces their individual times (Williams, Nida, Baca and Latané, 1989). The 
swimmers are accountable and therefore responsible for the amount of effort they 
put into the team (Figure 10.7). They also know what the general standard is from 
the performances of their teammates. Finally, they know how much effort other 
members of their team are putting into the task. These all mean good things for team 
performance. People raise their game and perform as well as they possibly can.
Another option is to take responsibility and accountability out of the equation 
altogether. For example, you may have noticed that many restaurants now charge 
large groups of diners a fixed gratuity rate rather than allowing everyone to tip 
individually. Presumably, this strategy has been put in place because it is expected 
that diners in a large group will engage in social loafing and tip disappointingly 
(Boyes, Mounts and Sowell, 2004). 
Evidence suggests that people will also loaf less when the tasks themselves are 
challenging, appealing or involving (Karau and Williams, 1993). When tasks are 
challenging, people may feel that their own individual efforts are indispensable. 
Also, if they feel that others are not putting in the required amount of effort, 
people may even compensate for their shortcomings by putting in even more 
effort to make up the gap (Williams and Karau, 1991). Further, if a task is 
appealing and there is the possibility of a reward in exchange for effort, people 
tend to work harder (Harkins and Szymanski, 1987; Shepperd and Taylor, 1999). 
It therefore makes a lot of sense that social loafing is not a big problem in high-
level competitive team sports. The task is too engaging and the outcome too

important to loaf. Thinking back to the example of the swimmers, there are many 
reasons for high-level athletes to strive for excellence rather than pure accounta-
bility for their performance. 
Values, personality, gender and culture
Research has also demonstrated that people loaf less when they value the group 
with whom they are interacting. In particular, loafing is reduced when group 
members are friendly with or identify with one another (Karau and Williams, 
1997; Worchel, Rothgerber, Day et al., 1998). Thus, perhaps one way to ensure 
that a university group assignment runs as smoothly as possible would be to work 
with friends, or at least with people who share things in common. This example 
parallels findings demonstrating that people work harder when there is a general 
spirit of commitment to the ‘team’ (Hackman, 1986). Other interesting findings 
have emerged in relation to values and personality differences. For example, Smrt 
and Karau (2011) have recently shown that social loafing is moderated by partici-
pants’ level of Protestant work ethic (PWE). The researchers pretested partici-
pants’ PWE and then asked them to work either coactively (in the presence of 
others, but independently) or collectively on a task of generating ideas. It was 
found that the higher participants were in PWE, the less likely they were to loaf 
when working collectively. This suggests that people who have a strong personal 
work ethic are less likely to engage in social loafing. Other findings suggest that 
people who score high on conscientiousness and feelings of responsibility are less 
likely to loaf (Hoon and Tan, 2008). Social loafing is also influenced by narcissism. 
In particular, Woodman, Roberts, Hardy et al. (2011) showed that high narcissists 
were less likely to loaf, especially when their behaviour was being explicitly moni-
tored. Presumably, the narcissists put in more effort when they knew their 
performance was going to be identified and they would be personally credited for 
their contribution. 
There are also cultural differences in social loafing phenomena. Some studies 
have demonstrated the cultural generality of social loafing after conducting studies 
in countries such as Japan, Thailand and India (e.g., Gabreyna, Wang and Latané, 
1985). However, many later studies have shown that Western cultures (e.g., the 
UK, the USA, Australia) tend to show more social loafing in laboratory tasks than 
Eastern cultures (e.g., China, Japan) (Karau and Williams, 1993; Kugihara, 1999). 
In an organizational setting too, Earley (1989) asked American and Chinese 
management trainees to perform a task under conditions of low or high accounta-
bility and low or high responsibility. It was found that the Chinese sample exhib-
ited less social loafing than the American sample. Perhaps these results are not 
surprising if we consider the importance of social bonds and social cohesion in 
collectivist versus individualist cultures. Letting one’s friends and family down is 
simply not part of the mindset of collectivist cultures, so it stands to reason that 
less ‘slacking off’ might be witnessed in such cultures. 
With respect to gender, women generally tend to exhibit social loafing less than 
men (Karau and Williams, 1993; Kugihara, 1999). Gabrenya et al. (1985) found 

446
Belonging
consistent gender differences – with women exhibiting lower social loafing than 
men – in both Chinese and American samples. They also found that while males 
tended to increase their tendency to loaf as they got older, females’ social loafing 
remained constant. Thus, while loafing appears to exist in both genders, it is lower 
for women, and for men, the tendency may be dependent on the situation. It is 
argued that this difference occurs because women are generally more collectivist 
than men (e.g., Earley, 1989, 1993) and therefore social loafing is against their 
values, at least compared to men (Gabrenya et al., 1985). 
To sum up our discussion of social loafing, groups sometimes perform poorly 
compared to individuals, but this is not always the case. If the conditions are right, 
group task performance can be ideal. In an open, accountable group engaging in a 
challenging, appealing and involving task, groups can be arousing and exciting and 
will often outperform individuals. In such a case, the group really does function 
effectively. But let us now consider another common situation for groups. From 
the social loafing research, we know about the importance of accountability 
within groups for completing tasks effectively. We also know from the social 
facilitation research that groups can arouse people. What happens when both these 
features of group interaction are put together? For example, how do people behave 
in crowds when they are often in an intense situation with a large number of 
people? How might people behave with the reduced level of accountability expe-
rienced when they communicate on the internet? We now turn our discussion to 
the phenomenon of deindividuation.
Try it yourself If you talk to people about social loafing, most will say they have been at the receiving end of it but 
few will admit to being responsible for it themselves. this is an example of a classic self–other bias discussed in 
Chapter 3. Of course, everyone has, at some time, ‘slacked off’ in a group task. the existence of social loafing can be 
demonstrated in a simple task you can try on your friends. ask a group of friends to divide into two groups of four/
five people and get each group to sit in a tight circle so that they cannot see or hear what the other group is doing or 
being told. Give each person in each group a copy of something mundane to copy down, such as entries from a 
phone book. each person also receives a number of slips of paper and a pen. tell each group they have 10 minutes to 
write down as many entries as possible. at this point, the group task differs. One of the groups is to hand their 
completed slips into the middle and the group’s number will be counted – no individual tallies will be known to the 
group (group condition). the other group’s members are to keep their own personal slips, which will be tallied at the 
end, so that each person is accountable to the group for the number of responses they produce (individual 
condition). It is important that each group is not aware of the instructions given to the other group. at the end of the 
task, you would expect participants in the individual condition to have produced more slips than those in the group 
condition, as evidence of social loafing occurring when group members are not accountable for their input. did this 
happen? How did your friends feel if they found out that they were, indeed, social loafers? (note: this task was 
adapted from the everton social loafing task, http://siopwiki.wetpaint.com.) 
Deindividuation
Crowd behaviour
The first ideas generated about groups, accountability and selfhood came through a 
consideration of crowd behaviour. It was thought that crowds were a unique kind 

447
Group behaviour
of group that arouse people (the same as other groups) but at the same time diffuse 
people’s sense of responsibility. Putting these aspects together, what might be the 
consequences? The outlook could appear to be quite grim. Many examples of crowd 
behaviour come immediately to mind that help us think about this issue. Looting, 
rioting, lynching and bystander apathy are all examples of crowd behaviour. Why 
would people do such things? Why do people think it is appropriate to act in these 
negative ways when they are part of a large group or crowd? No doubt some of the 
features of human aggression (as we will discuss in Chapter 13) come to play in such 
situations. But is there something fundamental about groups that can bring about 
this kind of behaviour? Also, it is important to note that we should not focus only 
on the bad things that crowds do, even though this is largely the focus of research on 
deindividuation. Indeed, gentle protests and demonstrations, festivals and celebra-
tions are also examples of large group behaviour. Why do people do these sorts of 
things? What is the common theme shared by all these behaviours?
One of the earliest theories of crowd behaviour, or collective behaviour, was 
proposed by French researchers Gabriel Tarde (1890) and, more notably, Gustave 
Le Bon ([1908]1986). Le Bon’s ideas have been instrumental in the formation of 
the theories of crowd and collective behaviour that we know today (e.g., Reicher, 
1987, 1996, 2001; Reicher, Spears and Postmes, 1995). Le Bon observed and read 
stories of revolutionary crowds in the 1848 revolution in France and during the 
Paris Commune of 1871. He was deeply disturbed by the seemingly primitive 
behaviour of these crowds, akin to the instinctive behaviour of animals and the 
antisocial behaviour of barbarians. Le Bon argued that people in crowds behave in 
a primitive, base manner because they are anonymous and in being anonymous, 
they lose personal responsibility for their actions. Further, through a process 
known as contagion, ideas spread unpredictably (and quickly) through the crowd. 
Finally, Le Bon argued that while everyone has antisocial motives at some stage, 
much of the time they remain in the unconscious, but, unleashed by a process of 
suggestion (similar to hypnosis), these antisocial tendencies are expressed in the 
crowd. Freud took this last idea further by proposing that the crowd unlocks the 
unconscious and that a powerful leader can become a ‘hypnotist’, controlling 
people’s unconscious impulses and turning them into a horde of savages. Similar 
ideas were put forward by McDougall (1920), who argued that the crowd was 
suggestible and easily swayed by emotional impulses such as fear and anger. 
More recently, social psychologists have drawn upon Le Bon and McDougall’s 
ideas to devise a theory to explain the unrestrained and deregulated behaviour that 
occurs within groups. Relying less on emotional explanations, much of social 
psychological thinking about collective behaviour focuses on the loss of account-
ability presented by the group situation. According to this perspective, being ‘lost’ 
in a group means a loosening of constraints on behaviour. Festinger, Pepitone and 
Newcomb (1952) argued that when people behave one way in groups and another 
way as individuals, they do so because they are in a state of deindividuation. This 
state is defined as the tendency for people in groups to abandon normal constraints 
on their behaviour, lose a sense of their individuality and responsibility, and 
Contagion Le Bon argued that 
this process leads to ideas 
being ‘spread’ unpredictably 
and rapidly through crowds.

consequently behave in ways they normally would not. The term ‘deindividua-
tion’ implies that this kind of behaviour is the opposite of individuation or the 
process of differentiation between people. People lose their sense of self or their 
identity and succumb to other influences.
Zimbardo (1970) further developed the concept of deindividuation. He focused 
on the effects of the so-called ‘cloak of anonymity’ provided by the group. He 
argued that being shielded by this cloak takes away individuals’ responsibility for 
their actions. They lose a sense of their identity and also lose their concern for 
social evaluation. This state of deindividuation leads them to behave in impulsive 
and deregulated ways; that is, they behave differently within the group than how 
they would act alone. 
Research suggests that large groups elicit more deindividuated behaviour than 
smaller groups. Mullen and colleagues’ research on lynch mob atrocities is a good 
example of this. Mullen (1986) examined newspaper accounts of 60 lynchings of 
African American people occurring between 1899 and 1946. He found that as the 
lynch mob got larger, the more willing its members became to commit the worst 
kinds of atrocities against their victims. Leader, Mullen and Abrams (2007) also 
demonstrated that as the size of the group increases, so does its level of violence. In 
a different vein, Mann (1981) found that when a crowd gathers to watch a person 
threatening to jump off a building, the crowd are more likely to jeer and taunt the 
individual and yell ‘jump!’ when the crowd is larger – a disturbing finding indeed. 
Interestingly, this phenomenon is intensified at night-time when people are made 
more anonymous by the darkness. Apart from being immersed in a group, what 
specific factors influence this state of deindividuation? According to Prentice-
Dunn and Rogers (1982, 1983), there are two types of environmental cues that 
contribute to this state. These are attentional cues and accountability cues. 
Exploring further Les Miserables is a 1998 film directed by Bille august and based on the novel by Victor Hugo. It 
tells the story of Jen Valjean who, after being convicted for stealing bread, spends his life on the run from the police 
officer Javert. this pursuit consumes the lives of both men and Valjean becomes involved in the student 
revolutionary crowds in early 19th-century France. take a look at how the crowds were depicted in this film for an 
interesting take on crowd behaviour. similarly, emile Zola’s masterpiece Germinal, written in 1885, tells the story of 
a coalminer’s strike in France in the 1860s. angered by poverty and frustration, the miners and their families are 
driven into a violent riot. the crowds are eventually confronted by the police and the workers return to the mine. 
Germinal provides another example of people’s behaviour in crowds. 
Attentional cues
The first kind of cue identified by Prentice-Dunn and Rogers (1982, 1983) are 
attentional cues – features of the environment that draw attention away from the 
self. Drawing on Duval and Wicklund’s (1972) theory of objective self-awareness 
(awareness of the self as an object of attention), Diener (1980) argued that features 
of the environment that shift attention away from the self are deindividuating. 
When people’s self-awareness is reduced, they find themselves in a ‘deindividuated 
state’, where they respond less to established standards of conduct and instead react 
to the immediate situation (Diener, 1980). Normal standards slip and people act on 
individuation the process 
of differentiating between 
people. this is essentially the 
opposite of deindividuation.

impulse. So, in a crowd, for example, people may become absorbed in the environ-
ment and attend less to themselves and their behaviour within it. As we have noted, 
this impulsive behaviour need not always be negative, but, according to this 
perspective, deindividuation does make the path clear for antisocial behaviour. 
A good example of an attentional cue is intense environmental stimulation. 
Studies have shown experimentally that groups of people who were placed in 
highly stimulating environments (with features such as loud music and colourful 
video games) were more extreme, disinhibited and aggressive in their actions 
(Diener, 1979; Prentice-Dunn and Rogers, 1980; Spivey and Prentice-Dunn, 1990). 
Such features are often present in crowds, so it is easy to link this perspective to 
crowd behaviour. 
Time to reflect Can you remember a time when you felt ‘swept away’ by a situation? What were the characteristics 
of that situation and can you map them onto some of the situations characteristic of deindividuated contexts?
An alternative way to look at deindividuation and self-awareness is to distin-
guish between two kinds of self-awareness: public (how one wants others to view 
the self) and private (attitudes, thoughts, emotions and other private features of 
the self) (see Carver and Scheier, 1981; Scheier and Carver, 1981). Using this 
perspective, a loss of both aspects of self-awareness will lead to a state of deindi-
viduation. So, for example, becoming less concerned with one’s appearance to 
others in a crowd and becoming less aware of one’s own attitudes may influence 
behaviour. However, antisocial behaviour is more likely to emerge when public 
self-awareness is lowered and people become less aware of social norms of 
conduct. A loss of private self-awareness need not lead to antisocial behaviour 
unless the salient norm is to behave antisocially. 
Accountability cues
Accountability cues may determine what people think they are able to get away 
with. When accountability is low, people may choose to engage in behaviours that 
are gratifying but would normally be inhibited. The most studied effect on deindi-
viduation is anonymity. Imagine that you are allowed to be invisible for a day. 
What would you do? When a group of US college students were asked to answer 
this question anonymously, most responses involved criminal activities and the 
most common response was to ‘rob a bank’ (Dodd, 1985). 
Try it yourself sometimes it is difficult to believe findings such as those of dodd (1985). Would people really want 
to rob a bank if they were invisible for a day? Perhaps people would respond differently if they were asked to 
indicate their identity instead of responding anonymously. you can try this for yourself. the next time you are in a 
large group of friends or acquaintances, ask them to write down, on a piece of paper, what they would do if they 
were invisible for 24 hours. On half of the pieces of paper, tell your friends that their responses will be completely 
anonymous. On the other half, ask your friends to write down their name alongside their answer. take the pieces of 
paper and read out your friends’ answers. this is like a game – your friends will laugh when they hear what others 
have to say. so, what did they say? Were the responses largely related to antisocial activities? did the anonymous 
responses differ from the identifiable responses? How does this map onto the findings of deindividuation research?

think about the features of the situation, the people and the environmental cues that brought about this disaster. 
events such as these have significantly impacted on how we now deal with football hooliganism. 
Other research highlights the effects of anonymity on deindividuation. For 
example, Festinger et al. (1952) found that participants made more negative 
comments about their parents when they were placed in a dim room and were 
asked to wear grey lab coats than those in a control condition. Further, when 
placed in similar clothing (and so were unidentifiable), participants in a study by 
Singer, Brush and Lublin (1965) used more indecent language to discuss erotic 
literature than did identifiable individuals. Zimbardo (1970) investigated this effect 
further. He ran a series of experiments where participants were asked to wear 
cloaks and hoods (similar to the Ku Klux Klan) in a deindividuated condition, or 
normal clothing in a control condition. In one study, female participants were 
asked to administer shocks to a female confederate in a paired associate learning 
task. The deindividuated participants delivered shocks that were twice the dura-
tion of participants in the control condition. Note again, just as in the Milgram 
study, that the shocks were not real, but the importance of the findings is that the 
participants thought they were real. Zimbardo also ran the now infamous Stanford 
Prison Experiment featured in Chapter 9 (Zimbardo et al., 1982). Importantly for 
our discussion of deindividuation, the prison 
guards were protected, to some extent, by their 
uniforms. This anonymity was arguably the major 
contributor to their behaviour – the guards were 
physically brutal to their prisoners who were also 
deindividuated. 
In another novel study, Diener, Fraser, Beaman 
and Kelem (1976) demonstrated the effects of 
being in a group and being anonymous at the 
same time. At Halloween, they observed children 
trick-or-treating in Seattle, USA. The children 
(either alone or in groups) approached homes 
where they were asked to take one of the sweets. The experimenter then left the 
room and a hidden camera observed how many sweets the children took. Results 
revealed that children in groups were twice as likely to break the rules by taking 
more than one sweet than children who were alone. This effect was further 
enhanced when the children’s identity was unknown versus when the experi-
menter asked the children their names and where they lived (see Figure 10.9).
However, the loss of personal identity does not always lead to antisocial 
behaviour, suggesting that anonymity may interact with other features of the 
environment – sometimes this will lead to bad behaviour and sometimes it will 
not. For example, Zimbardo (1970) used his deindividuation paradigm with 
participants who were Belgian soldiers. Here, he found that the soldiers gave

Group behaviour
shocks of shorter duration when dressed in cloaks and hoods than when dressed 
in uniform. Zimbardo argued that the group was already deindividuated because 
they were wearing uniforms, and the addition of the cloak and hood had the 
counterintuitive effect of reducing deindividuation. Other studies, however, 
suggest an alternative explanation. In particular, a study by Johnson and Downing 
(1979) demonstrated how being anonymous can sometimes make people act 
more prosocially. In their experiment, half the female participants were dressed 
in clothing similar to that worn by members of the Ku Klux Klan, while the other 
half were dressed in nurses uniforms. Within each group, half were personally 
identifiable and half were anonymous. They were then asked to increase or 
decrease the intensity of electric shocks given to another 
female participant who had previously behaved obnox-
iously. Results revealed that participants in the Ku Klux 
Klan clothing increased the shock level, regardless of 
whether they were anonymous or identifiable. On the 
other hand, participants dressed as nurses decreased 
shock intensity four times more often when they were 
anonymous (Figure 10.10). 
These findings are interesting because they demon-
strate that sometimes being unaccountable or less self-
aware can have positive consequences. Apart from 
bringing out people’s less desirable tendencies, unac-
countability can make people more sensitive to the 
needs of others. It has been argued that exactly how a person reacts to their lack 
of accountability depends on the norms of the group that directly surround the 
individual. Taking Johnson and Downing’s (1979) example, one might expect 
generally high levels of aggressive behaviour from people wearing Ku Klux Klan 
outfits because aggression arguably fits the norm for Ku Klux Klan members. On 
the other hand, this norm is inconsistent with expectations of nurses, who are 
expected to be kind and caring. Thus, it makes sense that people who are 
immersed in the role of nurse would perform prosocially and decrease the level 
of electric shock. This account also explains why the Belgian soldiers in Zimbar-
do’s study were more aggressive in uniform, where it is arguably normative for 
them to be aggressive. 
Deindividuation: necessarily a process of loss?
Now that you have read about the various different accounts of deindividuation, 
read the Critical focus box below on emergent norm theory – a prominent theory of 
crowd behaviour (Turner and Killian, 1987). This theory has been influential in 
social psychologists’ efforts to understand crowd behaviour, and deindividuated 
behaviour more generally, and argues that rather than being driven by random-
ness, crowd behaviour is driven by norms. The view of the ‘random’ crowd is less 
commonly held among social psychologists and sociologists nowadays as they 
more fully consider the motivations for crowd formation and crowd behaviour.

Related to this point, another common feature of the deindividuation accounts 
discussed so far is that they each explain deindividuation as a result of losing an 
important aspect of the self. For example, people lose a sense of their individuality 
when they are in a crowd. They lose self-awareness. They lose a sense of their own 
identity, which leads to a loss of rational behaviour. However, Johnson and Down-
ing’s (1979) findings above suggest something different. Specifically, the norms 
associated with a particular context might matter. The social identity model of dein-
dividuation effects (SiDE) takes these findings further and argues for a different 
perspective on deindividuation (Klein, Spears and Reicher, 2007; Reicher, Spears 
and Postmes, 1995). SIDE argues that all the focus on ‘loss’ restricts the kinds of 
behaviours that social psychologists can explain. Instead, the focus should be on 
change from personal identity to social identity, or even increased norm aware-
ness, or group consciousness. The SIDE model draws on principles from social 
identity theory (see Chapter 8) and argues that features of the context such as 
anonymity have the consequence of ‘submerging’ people within a group and 
enhancing their social identity. As a result, individuals conform more to group 
norms rather than individual standards of behaviour when people within the 
group are anonymous to one another. The consequences of this depend on what 
the norms are. If, for example, a group’s sense of ‘us’ is defined by hatred and 
prejudice towards another group, then deindividuation will have negative conse-
quences. On the other hand, if a group defines itself in terms of its kindness and 
charity, then the outcome will be positive. 
Therefore, according to emergent norm theory and the SIDE model, deindi-
viduation is not all bad – it depends entirely on the context and standards of the 
group. Much research supports this position. In particular, a meta-analysis of 60 
studies by Postmes and Spears (1998) supports the argument that being anony-
mous makes people more focused on the group than the self, and people become 
more responsive to the norms of the group. Whether the norms are positive or 
negative will determine the outcome. We discussed research investigating the prin-
ciples of the SIDE model in relation to communication in Chapter 5.

Emergent norm theory: a theory of crowd 
behaviour
throughout history, crowds have been seen as dangerous, 
unpredictable, chaotic, threatening and inhuman. In the 
19th century, industrialization and urbanization gave the 
masses more chances to congregate. scholars such as Le 
Bon continued to emphasize the irrational and chaotic 
aspects of crowd behaviour. However, in the 20th century, 
scholars realized that there was a method to crowds’ 
apparent madness. the behaviour of even violent crowds 
is seldom entirely random. turner and killian’s emergent 
norm theory was one of the most important theories to 
elaborate on this idea. turner and killian (1987) assumed 
that instead of being determined by randomness, social 
behaviour is driven by norms. specifically, they suggested 
that in extraordinary circumstances, such as in certain 
types of crowds, the mundane norms that govern the 
course of our everyday lives no longer apply. new norms 
are created by the crowd. Initial uncertainty is reduced as 
people get together and develop a shared understanding 
of the situation. second, individuals make positive 
suggestions for action and these suggestions are likely to 
be accepted if they converge with the predispositions of a 
large part of the crowd. For example, if many people in 
the crowd are angry, aggressive individuals are more 
likely to have an influence. as a result of this process, the 
crowd arrives at a consensual understanding of what is 
right and wrong in the situation arrived at. the crowd now 
appears to behave with some logic and purpose, and to be 
capable of enforcing its new norm. thus, via processes of 
normative influence, participants begin to experience 
pressure to conform to the implicit norm they perceive to 
be taking shape. By conforming to this new norm, crowd 
members influence those around them, who infer from 
their conformity that the norm is widely accepted. 
However, this does not mean that the crowd is 
unanimous. Contrary to popular thinking about crowds, 
there is no ‘group mind’ in emergent norm theory. 
However, as the situation unfolds, individuals feel 
different, act differently and participate for different 
reasons. this is crucial to emergent norm theory and 
distinguishes it from earlier accounts of crowd behaviour. 
some people are more committed to action than others, 
some are concerned but still uncertain about the correct 
course of action, others are curious spectators, and still 
others are simply present to capitalize on the situation, 
perhaps for the thrill of violence or destruction. However 
passive and disengaged are curious spectators, and 
mercenary are exploiters, their presence and failure to 
intervene are likely to be seen as a sign of approval by the 
active participants. In this way they contribute to the 
growing illusion of unanimity among the crowd. 
a problem many critics have had with this theory is that 
too often it tends to describe rather than genuinely 
explain crowd behaviour. For example, the theory 
identifies certain people who take on roles within the 
crowd (e.g., observers and exploiters) but it does not 
specify what causes different people to adopt these roles. 
turner and killian (1987) argue that ‘distinctive’ 
individuals and behaviours are likely to shape the 
emergent norm, but do not propose specific or principled 
criteria for distinctiveness. More generally, critics have 
alleged that the theory is not specific about how crowds 
form and are organized. Where emergent norm theory 
does make clear predictions, empirical support is mixed. 
For example, according to the theory, rumour is central to 
the formation of crowds. However, field studies of crowd 
events, such as the detroit riots of 1967, showed that 
more participants heard about it through the mass media 
than by rumour. empirical studies of crowds have 
produced other problems for emergent norm theory. For 
example, the theory predicts that conformity to crowd 
behaviour should be strongest when crowd members are 
identifiable: participants perceive that the crowd will 
reward compliance and punish deviance. But most 
relevant research findings suggest that people are more 
susceptible to crowd influence when they are anonymous 
rather than identifiable, and lacking in rather than high in 
self-awareness. these findings are consistent with 
deindividuation accounts of crowd behaviour. 
Other critiques have centred on the extent to which the 
long-standing norms of the group and the societies in 
which they are embedded are left behind when crowds 
form, requiring entirely new norms to emerge. Critics from 
various perspectives have asked whether there really is a 
radical discontinuity between the norms that govern our 
everyday lives and the norms that govern crowd 
situations. research by stephen reicher and his colleagues 
shows that the ongoing social identities and associated 
normative codes of crowd members, whether as 

454
Belonging
environmental protestors, anarchists or police, have been 
shown to have a profound effect on their behaviour in 
crowd situations. according to the sIde model, the creative 
potential of crowds lies in the ability of its participants to 
discover group norms that may not have been apparent to 
them before, and to transform and adapt group norms in 
light of the new situation. Finally, critics have pointed out 
that it is not clear in what sense the so-called ‘collective 
behaviour’ of crowds is different from the aggregated 
behaviour of the individuals who comprise the crowd. For 
example, while psychological states such as ‘uncertainty’ 
and ‘urgency’ can be ascribed to individual crowd 
members, it is not clear they can be ascribed to the 
collective, at least not without resurrecting the ‘group 
mind’ hypothesis. 
despite the many criticisms that have been levelled at 
emergent norm theory, even its critics acknowledge the 
many valuable insights it contributes to the study of 
crowds. In particular, the point that crowds have an 
energizing and creative potential, but nonetheless behave 
in rational, systematic and normative ways has been 
highly influential. We may or may not have cause to fear 
the crowd, but it is clear that we should no longer regard 
crowds as lacking in all human reason or constraint.

have to be part of a crowd. What behaviours might we 
witness from so-called ‘exploiters’, who are simply 
present to capitalize on the situation?

3 reicher (1996) developed the elaborated social 
identity model of crowd behaviour, which focuses on 
the emergence and development of crowd conflict (see 
also drury, reicher and stott, 2012). according to this 
perspective, crowd conflict is argued to be meaningful, 
but can bring about social and psychological change 
because this meaning may be contested. How can this

road rage: losing it behind the wheel
In 1950, disney released an animated short, Motor Mania. 
In it, Goofy ‘plays’ a decent, mild-mannered chap called Mr 
Walker, who considers himself to be a good driver. But 
when Mr Walker gets behind the wheel of his car, he 
morphs into ‘Mr Wheeler’, an abominable creature of 
limitless competitiveness, impatience and rage. (the film 
is easy to find on the internet, and apart from the cars and 
some male-centric language, it hasn’t aged a day.) the 
film captures a truth about motoring that is all too 
recognizable even now, over 60 years later: people seem 
to undergo some kind of personality transformation when 
they drive. they appear to be more prone to antisocial 
behaviour, risk taking and anger, doing, saying and 
gesturing things that they would never normally 
contemplate. We’ve all seen it, and many of us have done 
it. In its most extreme form, it is known as ‘road rage’ (e.g., 
ayar, 2006; Byrne, 2000).
the remarkable transformation that driving seems to 
cause in some people is interesting from a social 
psychological perspective, since it seems to illustrate the 
power of the situation to override personality and shape 
our behaviour. But what is it about the driving situation, 
specifically, that seems to give it such power? One key 
answer that has often been advanced is that road rage and 
other forms of antisocial driving stem from deindividuation

and deffenbacher, 2001; novaco, 1998). In a car, you are 
surrounded by others, meaning that you are, in a sense, in 
the presence of a group, but nonetheless you are largely 
anonymous and physically cut off from them in the metal 
and glass shell of your car. as we have seen, this meets the 
two key conditions for deindividuation effects, in which 
people feel less inhibited about aggression. 
However plausible it seems, direct evidence for the 
deindividuating explanation is scarce. about the best 
experimental demonstration comes from ellison-Potter et 
al. (2001). they manipulated anonymity and showed that 
participants drove more aggressively in the ‘anonymous’ 
than in the ‘identifiable’ condition of their experiment. 
However, their drivers were in a simulator, not actually on 
a road (for obvious ethical and practical reasons). also, 
anonymity was manipulated merely by asking participants 
to imagine that other drivers could, or could not, identify 
them. so, there is much doubt about whether the results 
really show that anonymity makes people drive more 
aggressively, or merely whether they think it does, and 
acted out their own expectations in the experiment. 
a fascinating study by Parkinson (2001) uncovered 
some important factors apart from deindividuation. 
Parkinson asked British participants questions about the 
last time they had been angry while driving and while not 
driving, and compared the answers. as might be expected, 
people reported more intense experiences of anger, 
associated with stronger levels of other-blame, when they 
were driving. this seems to be due to some social 
psychological aspects of driving. Participants indicated 
that while driving (vs. not driving), complete strangers 
were much more likely to be the targets of their anger. 
Given that driving interactions are relatively simple and 
we haven’t met most of our fellow drivers before, there’s 
little room for complicated emotions, or to find some kind 
of historical fault with one’s own behaviour. another key 
factor was uncovered in Parkinson’s study: in driving 
situations, participants reported being less able to 
communicate their anger to others and to see their anger 
being acknowledged. you can gesture, wave and swear as 
much as you like, but the other driver may not notice or 
may speed into the distance before you’ve seen their 
reaction. this failure of communication tends to frustrate 
and anger people even more. 
Further, although situational factors are important, we 
should not overestimate the extent to which our behaviour 
behind the wheel is completely divorced from our day-to-
day behaviour. People who are aggressive or stressed 
when not driving are more likely to be prone to aggression 
behind the wheel (Gulian, Matthews, Glendon et al. 1989; 
Lowenstein, 1997). People who try to present an 
intimidating image of themselves to the world in their 
everyday lives are also more likely to experience road rage 
(Bassett, Cate and dabbs, 2002). deindividuation may be a 
factor in road rage, but it does not tell the whole story. 
Questions 
1 thinking about the methods of manipulating 
deindividuation you have been reading about, what 
else do you think they may be manipulating? 
specifically, how do they interfere with communication 
between people? does this represent a confound, and 
what does it mean for the evidence cited in favour of 
the concept of deindividuation? 
2 What do you think the sIde model would have to say 
about the idea that road rage emerges because of the 
deindividuating aspects of the driving situation? 
according to this model, when might driver aggression 
increase, and when might it decrease, in response to 
the anonymous conditions of driving? 
3 according to Halpern (1998), a good critical thinking 
skill is to think of two improvements that could be 
made to an experiment (see Chapter 15). Based on the 
description of the study by ellison-Potter et al. (2001), 
what improvements do you think you could make?

Group decision making 
Now, we turn our discussion to how people in groups make decisions and solve 
problems. Thus far, we have discussed many ways in which group behaviour can 
differ from the behaviour of solitary individuals. Research on how groups arrive 

456

at decisions and deal with problems is no exception. Of particular importance here 
are the following questions. Does interaction with people in groups intensify our 
decisions? Do groups generally make ‘good’ or ‘bad’ decisions? How does real 
group decision making compare with folk wisdom suggesting that groups are 
more conservative than individuals in decision making and that they err towards 
caution? How do groups solve problems differently than individuals acting alone?
Group polarization
When people discuss important issues, they often do so with people who already 
think the same way. We generally speak more often with people who share the 
same opinions and attitudes and go to meetings with like-minded others and so on. 
Does this kind of interaction make our attitudes stronger? Findings suggest that 
the answer is yes and that groups may not be more conservative in their decisions 
at all. Stoner (1961) tested this folk wisdom by presenting participants with 
scenarios (e.g., a person planning to write a book) and asking them to advise the 
person in the scenario how much risk they should take (e.g., based on the proba-
bility of the book’s success). For example, participants might be asked to rate the 
lowest probability of success that the book should have before considering it 
acceptable to recommend that the author should write it (the lower the probability, 
the riskier the advice). After responding to a series of items privately, people would 
get together in groups and reach agreement on each item. Rather than providing 
more moderate decisions in groups, findings showed that the group decisions 
became riskier. This was dubbed the risky shift phenomenon and was replicated in a 
variety of different settings (see also Wallach, Kogan and Bem, 1962).
However, this shift is not universal and is not necessarily best characterized as 
‘risky’. Subsequent research has demonstrated that groups sometimes make less 
risky decisions than the individuals on average. Overall, it depends on the initial 
leanings of the group. As Moscovici and Zavalloni (1969) stated, discussion typi-
cally strengthens the average inclination of group members. This phenomenon is 
called group polarization (see Figure 10.11). Moscovici and Zavalloni found that 
group discussion enhanced French students’ (already) positive attitudes towards 
their president and enhanced their (already) nega-
tive attitudes towards Americans. 
This finding has been replicated in a number of 
different settings. For example, Brauer, Judd and 
Jacquelin (2001) found that when students shared 
their mutual dislike for other people, their nega-
tive attitudes of these people were even stronger. 
After discussing a traffic case, Isozaki (1984) 
found that students gave stronger judgements of 
risky shift the finding that 
groups seem to make riskier 
decisions than individuals.

‘guilty’ than beforehand. Further, Myers and Bishop (1970) organized groups of 
students who were high and low in prejudice and asked them to respond to various 
indicators of racial attitudes before and after discussing their attitudes with their 
group. Again, the discussions enhanced the initial leanings of the group; that is, 
the high prejudiced groups became more prejudiced and the low prejudiced 
groups became less prejudiced. Group polarization effects have been demon-
strated more recently in settings such as in computer-mediated communication 
(Sia, Tan and Wei, 2002; Spears, Lea and Lee, 1990), efforts to reduce conflict (e.g., 
Paluck, 2010), choice dilemmas (e.g., Krizan and Baron, 2007) and even on social 
networking sites such as Twitter (e.g., Yardi and Boyd, 2010). 
Group polarization is a robust phenomenon in experiments – run an experi-
ment and there is a good chance you will observe the effect. But what does it mean 
for everyday life? As mentioned earlier, we are most likely to associate with people 
who share similar attitudes to us. The research on group polarization suggests that 
our attitudes are likely to become even stronger after interacting with these like-
minded people. Indeed, research in real-life situations suggests this does occur. 
What is commonly known as ‘terrorism’ is a good example. As people come 
together to share their grievances in a given social situation, they often interact in 
isolation from potentially moderating people and groups. Unsurprisingly, they 
become more extreme over time and individuals can perform violent acts that 
would not have occurred in the absence of the group (McCauley and Segal, 1987). 
Indeed, the 9/11 attacks on the World Trade Center in 2001 were arguably the 
result of a long process of interaction between like-minded people and the strong 
polarizing effect of group interaction. 
Another good example is how children develop gender roles. When they are 
young, children typically play in larger, mixed-gender groups but as they grow 
older, they self-segregate into all-female and all-male groups. Eleanor Maccoby 
(2002) argued that this has the polarizing effect of accentuating gender-typical 
behaviour and gender roles. As girls interact more with other girls, they become 
more ‘girly’ and relationship oriented. As boys interact more with other boys, 
they become more ‘boyish’ and competitive. This polarization is a robust conse-
quence of group interaction, which can have both positive and negative conse-
quences. But why exactly does it happen? Why do groups typically adopt 
decisions and attitudes that are significant exaggerations of the average opinions of 
their members? There are two main reasons: normative influence and informa-
tional influence (see also Chapter 9). 
Time to reflect Can you think of other examples of group polarization? What might be some of the consequences 
of group polarization?
First, group polarization may occur because when we interact with others, we 
naturally compare ourselves with them. You will remember from Chapter 8 that 
Festinger (1954) argued in his theory of social comparison that people are moti-
vated to evaluate their opinions and abilities. Thus, one way to evaluate one’s own

attitudes is to compare them with others’ attitudes. If we find that others share our 
views, we may express stronger attitudes because we want the like-minded people 
to like us. In general, we are most persuaded by people who are like us – our 
‘reference groups’ and people with whom we identify (Abrams, Wetherell, 
Cochrane et al., 1990) – so it stands to reason that if we find out that people are 
indeed like us, we will want to be viewed favourably by them. On the other hand, 
group discussion might reveal that our attitudes are not shared by the group, in 
which case, we may endeavour to avoid the disapproval of the group. This is an 
example of normative influence – the tendency to conform to the perceived norms 
of the group.
Group discussion is therefore good for dispelling what is known as pluralistic 
ignorance. This is when we often do not really know what people are thinking 
because they keep their attitudes to themselves (Miller and McFarland, 1987; Pren-
tice and Miller, 1993). People may be wary of introducing their attitudes for fear 
they will be rejected. So, we may think our own attitudes stand out. However, 
group discussion makes others’ attitudes clear, paving the way for people to express 
their true attitudes if these are indeed shared by the group. On the other hand, if 
people find that their attitudes are not shared by the group, they can conceal their 
attitudes, or even adopt the desirable attitude by jumping on the bandwagon (the 
bandwagon effect; see Codol, 1975). Because they want to be seen in a positive 
light by the group, they may compete to express the most extreme opinion at the 
desirable end of the pole, even if this is not their attitude at all. 
However, people may also be genuinely swayed by the opinions of the group 
and find them persuasive. Thus, group polarization can also be a result of infor-
mational influence, in which when the correct attitude or behaviour is unclear, 
people look to others for guidance. It is argued here that through group discus-
sion, people’s ideas are pooled. Most of the ideas may support the dominant 
opinion and occasionally group members will introduce new arguments that 
members of the group had not previously considered. The pooling of familiar 
ideas and new persuasive arguments may sway group members’ opinions further 
and cause their opinions to become more extreme (Burnstein and Vinokur, 1977; 
Vinokur and Burnstein, 1974). As a result, the group as a whole becomes polar-
ized. To give an example, someone who is against abortion is likely to become 
even less in favour of abortion after a discussion with like-minded individuals 
who introduce new arguments against abortion. It is important to note here that 
active participation in the group is important. Verbalizing one’s opinions to the 
group has the effect of reinforcing attitudes. So, the more group members discuss 
and repeat their shared ideas, the more they are validated (Brauer, Judd and Gliner, 
1995). But even simply anticipating a discussion with a person holding an opposing 
view can motivate people to prepare their arguments and express them more 
strongly (Fitzpatrick and Eagly, 1981). 
Self-categorization theorists (see also Chapter 8) have proposed a third account 
that treats polarization as a process of social conformity (Turner and Oakes, 1989). 
Specifically, it is argued that people in groups form a representation of the group

situation where a majority 
of group members privately

(incorrectly) that most others 
accept it.

Group behaviour
norm from the opinions expressed by others in the group compared to those 
opinions assumed (or known) to be held by outgroups. The process that is respon-
sible for identification with a group (known as self-categorization) produces 
conformity to the group norm. If the group norm is polarized, then group polari-
zation will occur. If the norm is not polarized, people will adopt the mean group 
position. The important feature of this argument is that for polarization to occur, 
the initial group leanings need to be perceived as a norm (Abrams et al., 1990; 
Mackie and Cooper, 1984; McGarty, Turner, Hogg et al., 1992; Turner, Wetherell 
and Hogg, 1989; see also Spears, Lea, Postmes and Wolbert, 2011). 
Groupthink
We now know that groups do not necessarily err towards caution. They often 
express their opinions more extremely than their individual members would do 
alone. But what is the impact of groups on the quality of the decisions they make? 
Janis (1971, 1982) questioned why groups have sometimes been known to make 
disastrous decisions. In particular, he wanted to explain how group decision-
making processes explain some significant international disasters, such as the US 
failure to anticipate the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor in 1941 and the botched 
invasion of Cuba at the Bay of Pigs in 1961. According to Janis, these events 
shared some important features. In particular, Janis believed that in each case, the 
decision-making groups suppressed dissent in order to maintain group harmony. 
Unfortunately, a dissenting opinion would have gone a long way. Janis believed 
that these events were also characterized by three main features: 
1 a cohesive group where people come from similar backgrounds
2 the group is isolated from outside opinions 
3 there are no clear rules that guide decision making. 
Janis (1971, p. 43) argued that these features of groups 
lead to bad decisions and he defined groupthink as: 
‘The mode of thinking that persons engage in when 
concurrence-seeking becomes so dominant in a cohe-
sive in-group that it tends to override realistic 
appraisal of alternative courses of action.’ According 
to Janis, there are several ‘symptoms’ of groupthink, 
which help group members maintain faith in their 
decision under difficult circumstances (see Table 
10.2). As a result of these features, Janis argued that 
people do not seek or discuss alternative possibilities 
to their planned decision, they do not assess the risks 
involved in the group decision, and they do not make 
contingency plans in case the group fails. The 
outcomes, as we have seen, can be fatal. 
Janis (1982) recommended that groups should 
take several factors into account in order to prevent 
Groupthink the mode of 
thinking that groups engage 
in when cohesion seems more 
important than making the 
right decision and considering 
alternatives.

groupthink. He based these on examples of unsuccessful decision-making proc-
esses, including the Kennedy administration’s handling of the USSR’s deployment 
of medium-range ballistic missiles in Cuba in 1962. These are:
1 Groups, and especially leaders of groups, need to be impartial and not endorse 
any one position from the outset. 
2 Groups should assign someone the role of critical evaluator or ‘devil’s advo-
cate’, who will critically evaluate the group’s decisions, question assumptions 
and plans, and encourage the group to consider alternative options. 
3 Everyone within the group should be encouraged to critically think about the 
decisions being made.
4 It is useful to divide groups, encourage members to seek advice from trusted 
outsiders, and then reunite them to discuss any differences. 
5 Groups should regularly invite critiques from outside experts who will chal-
lenge the group’s decisions. 
6 Before implementing the final decision, groups should spend time discussing 
lingering issues or doubts and considering the dangers and consequences of 
their decisions. 
Many of these principles are being taught in training programmes, such as those 
for airline flight crews, where flawed group dynamics are often responsible for 
plane accidents (Helmrich, 1997). Academic research has contributed to efforts 
designed to prevent groupthink among high-level policy making (Hart, 1998). 
However, although Janis’s theory has received much attention, not all 
researchers are convinced by his analysis. The main problem seems to be that 
much of the evidence for groupthink has been retrospective. Some findings 
support the theory (e.g., Hart, 1990; McCauley, 1989; Tetlock, 1979), but others 
are inconsistent with the basic principles of groupthink. In particular, group cohe-
siveness will not always lead to groupthink. The norms of a cohesive group can 
actually produce favourable decisions so long as the norms favour critical evalua-
tion (Postmes, Spears and Cihangir, 2001). Further, after an examination of many 
different events, Tetlock, Petersen, McGuire et al. (1992) concluded that even 
good decision-making processes can lead to bad decisions. Experimental work has 
not always supported groupthink, in particular with respect to cohesiveness, 
where sometimes there is an association between cohesiveness and groupthink 
and sometimes there is not, largely dependent on the conditions of the experiment 
(e.g., Bernthal and Insko, 1993; Flowers, 1977; Rovio, Eskola, Kozub et al., 2009; 
Turner, Pratkanis, Probasco and Leve, 1992). Other researchers have argued that 
cohesiveness itself should be more clearly defined before we can fully understand 
how it influences good decision making. Its influence may be quite different if we 
think of cohesiveness in terms of liking, friendship or interpersonal attraction; 
indeed, findings suggest this is the case (Hogg and Hains, 1998; McCauley, 1989; 
see also McCauley, 1998). Nevertheless, the concept of groupthink has influenced 
how social psychologists understand the processes underlying good and bad deci-
sions. Clearly, two heads are not always better than one. 

461
Group behaviour
ETHiCS AND rESEArCH METHODS
Studying groupthink
as we have discussed, one important criticism of 
groupthink is that the evidence for the phenomenon has 
been retrospective case studies of group decision making. 
For example, scholars have looked to events like the space 
shuttle Challenger disaster and Pearl Harbor to link bad 
group decisions with faulty group processes in each 
example. However, this approach is not without problems. 
For instance, it is relatively easy in hindsight to find 
specific examples that support a theory. applying a theory 
to specific examples may also mean that the researcher 
misses other potentially important factors. Further, the 
researcher has no control over the variables of interest. 
For example, if a researcher wants to investigate the role 
of cohesion in promoting groupthink, historical examples 
can only tell us if cohesion (in a general sense) may have 
had an influence on the decision. It can tell us very little 
about how different degrees of cohesion may influence 
group decisions.
One way to answer this criticism and test the effects of 
variables related to groupthink is to take investigations 
into the laboratory and conduct experiments. there have 
been some attempts to do this, although results have 
been mixed and sometimes contradictory. For example, 
Flowers (1977) manipulated group cohesion (high and 
low) and presented participants with a crisis problem to 
solve. In addition to this manipulation, the groups 
operated with leaders who either adopted an open or 
closed leadership style. Flowers found that the open 
leadership style produced the most suggested solutions 
and promoted more complete use of the information than 
the closed leadership style. In this study, levels of cohesion 
had no effect, which is contrary to the theory of 
groupthink. However, turner, Pratkanis, Probasco and Leve 
(1992) manipulated group cohesion slightly differently 
and found that in addition to self-esteem threat, cohesion 
had an independent effect on decision making, such that 
decisions resulting from highly cohesive groups were 
poorer than those resulting from less cohesive groups. 
this provides some support for the theory. In another 
study, Callaway and esser (1984) found that intermediate 
cohesiveness (not low as the theory may suggest) 
produces the best decisions. thus, the results from studies 
that have explicitly investigated groupthink – especially 
the effects of group cohesion on group decision making – 
have been mixed. this presents challenges for the theory. 
as you will know from your social psychology studies so 
far, theories face difficulties if they are not supported by 
empirical findings.
What might the problem be? One issue may be the way 
the experiments have been conducted. For example, Park 
(1990) criticized efforts to empirically test the principles of 
groupthink because they tend to include only one variable 
(or a small number) at a time. It is therefore difficult to 
know how various factors such as leadership and cohesion 
work in combination with each other to produce 
groupthink phenomena. In statistical terminology, there 
may be interactions between variables that are missed in 
studies that only investigate single variables. Further, as 
rose (2011) has recently noted, despite 40 years of 
groupthink theory, experimental studies are extremely 
limited, with only a small number of all the model’s 
variables being adequately tested. as a result, many 
scholars now see groupthink as a myth, while others 
remain committed to the theory. Of course, another 
consideration is that the theory may be incomplete and 
may need to be revised. In general, research on 
groupthink has not yielded a consistent picture that either 
supports or undermines the theory.

been applied to many different domains where 
decisions are made, such as juries and sporting teams. 
Why do you think the theory is so influential?
2 Would it be possible to test the full model of 
groupthink? take a look at the literature to see if this 
has been done. What are the difficulties in testing such 
a large social psychological model?
3 Can you think of a study to test one of Janis’s 
recommendations for reducing groupthink?
Exploring further In the 1957 film Twelve Angry Men, directed by sidney Lumet and starring Henry Fonda, the 
jury members begin their deliberations in a capital murder case where an 18-year-old man is accused of killing his 
father. the film follows the decision-making processes of the jury, riddled with errors, misconceptions and prejudices 
akin to the phenomenon of groupthink. One juror attempts to convince the jury of the defendant’s innocence. If you 
get a chance, take a look at the film and think about Janis’s groupthink principles. How did the group overcome its 
problems? also think about our discussion of minority influence in Chapter 9. 
Group problem solving
We now consider how individuals versus groups solve problems. The predomi-
nant conclusion from research is that two (or more) heads are, more often than 
not, better than one. On various intellectual tasks, people perform better in 
groups than they do alone. For example, Laughlin and Adamopoulos (1980) 
presented participants with analogy problems and found that participants’ 
answers were more accurate after discussion than when answering alone. Also, it 
is clear that when groups rely on expertise within the group when solving prob-
lems, the group performs better (Brodbeck and Greitemeyer, 2000; Davis and 
Harless, 1996). In eyewitness testimony, group accounts are much more accurate 
than individual reports (Warnick and Sanders, 1980). Further, when groups get 
together and critique each other’s ideas, they have been found to come up with 
better quality ideas (McGlynn, Tubbs and Holzhausen, 1995; McGlynn, McGurk, 
Effland et al., 2004).
This may explain why brainstorming can sometimes be an effective technique in 
group problem solving, at least if groups follow certain principles identified by 
Brown and Paulus (2002):
 o combine group brainstorming with individual brainstorming 
 o have group members interact with one another in writing (see also Mullen, 
Johnson and Salas, 1991)
 o make use of electronic communication technology (see also Gallupe, Cooper, 
Grisé and Bastianutti, 1994; Gallupe, Dennis, Cooper et al., 1992).
It has also been suggested that brainstorming groups are more effective if they are 
small rather than large, and if the experimenter is not present to monitor the 
process (Mullen et al., 1991). If ideas are allowed to flow in an efficient manner, 
working in groups to solve problems can be effective. On the other hand, there is

groups getting together

ideas to flow freely.

evidence to suggest that if only simple group brainstorming is used with no break-
out input from individuals, solitary efforts are typically better than those of the 
group (Diehl and Stroebe, 1987; Paulus, Larey and Ortega, 1995). People may feel 
good about taking part and feel that they have worked productively even if they 
may not have done so (Stroebe and Diehl, 1994). 
leadership
One question we have not addressed so far is the role of the leader in group deci-
sion making. Also, what makes a great leader? Do leaders need a particular combi-
nation of personality traits to be effective? Or do leaders simply have to be in the 
right place at the right time? In this section, we consider research on leadership in 
the context of group decision making.
What makes a good leader?
The great person theory of leadership asserts that good leaders have an ideal combi-
nation of personality traits that enable them to lead effectively, regardless of the 
situation. Originating in the 19th century and linked to the work of historian 
Thomas Carlyle, it is argued that a leader is someone who is gifted with unique 
qualities that capture people’s imaginations. Some people are born with the neces-
sary characteristics to set them apart from others and it is these characteristics that 
determine their place in positions of power and authority. However, the great 
person theory is not well supported by research. Studies have generally found 
only weak correlations between personality traits and leadership ability. Some 
patterns have emerged; for example, leaders tend to be more intelligent, more 
extraverted, socially skilled, confident, driven by a desire for power, more charis-
matic and less neurotic than non-leaders (Albright and Forziati, 1995; Hogan, 
Curphy and Hogan, 1994; Judge, Bono, Ilies and Gerhardt, 2002). There is also 
some research suggesting that leadership may be heritable; for example, twins tend 
to display similar leadership behaviour (Arvey, Rotundo, Johnson et al., 2006; 
Arvey, Zhang, Avolio and Krueger, 2007). However, in general, relationships 
appear fairly modest so it seems unlikely that people are ‘born leaders’. Other 
factors must contribute to leadership success (for reviews, see Judge, Bono, Iles 
and Gerhardt, 2002; Lord, DeVader and Alliger, 1986). 
Theorists have examined the possibility that particular combinations of person-
ality traits may be right for certain contexts. In other words, perhaps personality 
traits alone cannot explain leadership ability, but considering personality traits in 
particular situations may provide a clearer picture of when certain people may be 
good leaders and when they may not. Several theories of leadership have examined 
the characteristics of leaders themselves, and also their followers and the charac-
teristics of situations (Hollander, 1961; Sternberg and Vroom, 2002). One such 
theory is the contingency theory of leadership. This theory argues that leadership 
success is dependent on how task related or relationship oriented the leader is, and

the amount of influence they have over the group (Fiedler, 1967, 1978). Thus, two 
types of leader are assumed to exist. It is argued that task-oriented leaders focus 
more on the task at hand and getting the job done, and less on followers’ feelings 
and relationships. On the other hand, relationship-oriented leaders focus more on 
followers’ feelings and relationships and less on getting the task completed. 
Central to this theory is that neither leader type is best across the board. 
Instead, the type of leader that is optimal depends on the context and, more 
specifically, the amount of influence the leader has over their group. In high 
control contexts, the leader has strong interpersonal relationships with the group, 
a strong position in the organization or group, and the work to be done is well 
structured and clear. In low control contexts, the leader has poorer relationships 
with the group and the tasks are less clearly defined. Fiedler argued that task-
oriented leaders are likely to be more effective in 
high control contexts (where everything is running 
smoothly, everyone is happy and the leader can 
focus on the task) or low control contexts (where 
the leader takes charge and imposes order). Indeed, 
research has shown that specific, challenging goals 
and the monitoring of achievement by progress 
goals helps improve work outcomes (Locke and 
Latham, 1990, 2009; Latham, Stajkovic and Locke, 
2010). On the other hand, relationship-oriented 
leaders are likely to be most effective in conditions 
of moderate control. In such a context, things are 
generally running smoothly but the relationship-
oriented leader can step in when necessary to 
resolve relationship difficulties that may reduce 
overall group effectiveness (see Figure 10.12). Research reveals that this kind of 
leadership is good for morale, increases group cohesion, and people feel more 
satisfied with their situation (Spector, 1986; Tabernero, Chambel, Curral and 
Arana, 2009). In a democratic environment, people also become more motivated 
to achieve (Burger, 1987) and rate the outcomes more positively (van den Bos and 
Spruijt, 2002). 
Leadership effectiveness can also be viewed as a process of minority influence 
(see Chapter 9). For example, some research has demonstrated that leaders, like 
minorities, can inspire and influence people because they are consistent in their 
views and goals and exhibit self-confidence (Bennis, 1984; House and Singh, 
1987). They gain the trust of their group by communicating their clear and 
consistent view to others. 
Exploring further draw up a short list of leaders you either know personally, or prominent world leaders. using 
the principles you have read about so far, what type of leader are they? How is their leadership influenced by the 
context?

Group behaviour
Culture and leadership
Increasing globalization has created a need to understand the role of culture in 
leader behaviour and performance. According to House, Hanges, Javidan et al. 
(2004), there are some aspects of desirable leaders that appear to be universal. For 
example, the GLOBE (Global Leadership and Organizational Behavior Effective-
ness) project identified a list of leadership attributes 
endorsed by 17,000 people across 62 countries, and 
isolated 22 universal positive attributes (see Table 
10.3). The project also identified 8 attributes univer-
sally regarded as negative, such as being egocentric, 
dictatorial and ruthless. 
However, there are also some key differences in 
leadership behaviour across cultures. For example, 
the GLOBE project revealed that while countries in 
Latin America, the Middle East and Southern Asia 
scored high on ingroup collectivist leader behaviour 
such as promoting loyalty and joint interests, Western countries scored much 
lower. Also, while Western countries scored higher on uncertainty avoidance and 
future orientation, other regions scored lower. Thus there are clear cross-cultural 
differences in leadership orientation. 
Increasing globalization has also made it necessary to know more about how 
leaders can best function in cross-cultural working environments. Adler and 
Batholomew (1992) argued that leaders need to develop five attributes in order to 
work effectively as global leaders:
1 An understanding of business, political and cultural environments in relevant 
domains
2 An understanding of the perspectives, trends and technologies of other cultures
3 An ability to work with people of different cultures
4 An ability to adapt to other cultures
5 An ability to relate to other cultures as equals.
An appreciation of cultural differences, and the ability to adapt to these differ-
ences, strongly influences leader behaviour in cross-cultural contexts. 
Try it yourself Below is an excerpt from the dimensions of culture scale (House et al., 2004) which was used to 
identify cultural differences in leader behaviour across cultures. It was adapted from Hofstede’s culture in the 
workplace questionnaire and identifies the different aspects of leader behaviour. take a look at the scale and 
complete it yourself. If you have time, perhaps ask friends from other countries to complete the scale and compare 
your results. do you notice any trends?

Group behaviour
Gender and leadership
How do female and male leaders compare to one another? How does the gender 
of a leader influence group processes? It is commonly believed that women need 
to work much harder than men from the beginning to achieve the same level of 
status. Also, everyday experience would suggest that female leaders are evaluated 
differently than male leaders who do exactly the same job. For example, a confi-
dent kind of leader may be perceived as bossy or ‘mannish’ if she is female. 
Research supports this common wisdom (Biernat, Crandall, Young et al., 1998). 
For example, Eagly, Makhijani and Klonsky (1992) found that if a female leader 
adopts a typically male leadership style, she is evaluated more negatively than a 
male leader behaving in the same manner. Further, this is especially the case if the 
people making the evaluations are male. In another study, Butler and Geis (1990) 
showed that group members react differently to assertive leaders depending on 
whether the leaders are female or male. Participants in this study (especially males) 
reacted more negatively to the assertive female leader.  
Does this mean that female leaders will be more effective if they adopt a typi-
cally ‘female’ style? Are women who are more communal (helpful, kind and 
concerned about others) more successful in gaining the respect of their group and 
promoting positive group processes, while males who are agentic (assertive and 
self-confident) make better leaders? Research suggests that women find them-
selves in a catch-22 situation. If they behave in a communal way, they are perceived 
as having low leadership potential because good leaders are supposed to be agentic. 
On the other hand, if they behave counter-stereotypically and lead in an agentic 
manner, they are evaluated negatively (Carli and Eagly, 1999; Eagly and Karau, 
2002; Eagly, Karau and Makhijani, 1995). In this case, their behaviour goes against 
how women are ‘supposed’ to behave. These factors pose significant problems for 
female leaders and compromise their effectiveness. It is not surprising that in 2006 
only 8.5 per cent of CEOs in Europe were female (European Professional 
Women’s Network, 2006). The picture for women leaders becomes even more 
bleak when we consider that they are consistently paid less than men for doing the 
same work (Kulich, Ryan and Haslam, 2007) and that they are more likely to be 
appointed to risky or ‘doomed to failure’ leadership positions than men (known 
as the glass cliff effect) (Ryan and Haslam, 2005). Perhaps more optimistically, 
some evidence suggests that people have become more tolerant of women who 
violate stereotypically female behaviour norms (Twenge, 1997) and it is generally 
accepted that leaders must display both communal and agentic behaviours in order 
to get the most from their group (Eagly and Karau, 2002). 
Time to reflect think about gender and leadership in the context of gender roles as we discussed in Chapter 8. 
How much do you think people’s ideas about women leaders have changed? Have things changed enough? What 
other challenges still face aspiring female leaders?

Belonging
Chapter summary
In this chapter, we have learned that being a member of a 
group significantly influences what we do. Groups allow people 
to do things together that they would not be able to do alone. 
sometimes group behaviour is good and sometimes it is not. In 
this chapter, you have learned that:
• the phenomenon of social facilitation suggests that working 
alongside others can energize people to work faster, better 
and to reach their individual potential. 
• the arousal experienced in the presence of others enhances 
whichever response tendency is dominant, so whether 
social facilitation (or its opposite – social inhibition) occurs 
depends on the nature of the task. this is primarily due to 
the process of evaluation apprehension – people become 
concerned about the evaluation of others and their 
performance on ‘easy’ tasks is facilitated, whereas their 
performance on ‘difficult’ tasks is inhibited. People can also 
be distracted by the evaluation of others.
• research on social loafing suggests that people will often 
‘slack off’ when working in a group, in particular when 
their own contribution is not being monitored. this occurs 
when evaluation apprehension is low – typically when 
people are not accountable for their input. social loafing 
can be reduced by making tasks challenging, appealing  
or involving.
• It is sometimes possible to see the dark side of humanity 
when people are deindividuated in crowds or bear no 
accountability for their actions. People can perform acts they 
would not normally do, such as looting, rioting and other 
forms of antisocial behaviour. Large groups tend to display 
more deindividuated behaviour than smaller groups. It is 
argued that being deindividuated draws attention away 
from the self, such that people become less self-aware and 
less aware of how they would normally behave. 
• More recent theories of deindividuation argue that it is not a 
case of loss of identity or self-awareness, but increasing 
awareness of social identity or group norms. deindividuated 
behaviour is not therefore always antisocial. 
• Groups can facilitate decision making and problem solving 
such that – more often than not – people solve problems 
more accurately when they work with others than when they 
work alone. research on group polarization suggests that 
group decisions enhance initial leanings of the group, 
through processes of normative and informational influence. 
• However, not all groups make good decisions. When we 
examine the group decision-making processes that preceded 
some major world catastrophes, we can see symptoms of 
‘groupthink’, which arguably led to disastrous outcomes.
• Working under an effective leader can drive a group to 
success and accomplishment in many ways. there are 
several theories to describe effective leadership behaviour 
and an emerging body of literature describing the 
challenges facing female leaders. 
Groups are complex and dynamic. nevertheless, people need 
groups and cannot live without them. Groups allow people to 
achieve together what they cannot do alone. understanding 
group behaviour is therefore a topic of great importance to 
social psychologists. Our concern in this chapter has been on 
how people behave in groups. In Chapter 11, we turn to the 
study of how people in different groups behave towards one 
another. In the study of intergroup relations, social 
psychologists attempt to understand how groups react to and 
influence one another in positive and negative ways.
Essay questions
at the beginning of the chapter, we asked you to consider  
these questions:
1 diana is learning to tap dance and has been practising for an 
forthcoming recital. she practises in front of a mirror and 
makes all the right moves. However, when the recital comes 
along she makes many mistakes and cannot understand 
why she messed up so badly. all her family and friends were 
watching her. How might we explain this?
2 Faiza is working with a group on an assignment about 
stereotypes of the British. everyone has agreed to collect five 
references on the topic for the group to share. Faiza does not 
try very hard and only provides two references, letting the 
group down. What social psychological processes 
(intentional and unintentional) might lead Faiza to do this?
3 Ben is at a concert. It is his favourite band and he is very 
excited. the audience is huge and everyone is dancing. 
Quite spontaneously, Ben moves up to a female stranger in 
the audience and grabs her by the wrist. Why would he do 
such a thing?
Having read this chapter, these questions could also be 
framed as the following essay questions, which you can 
attempt in preparation for your examinations:

Applying social psychology
Women in leadership: the glass cliff
1 according to ryan and Haslam’s (2007) glass cliff effect, 
women are assigned to precarious leadership roles, such as 
when an organization is likely to experience hardship or 
failure in the near future. In the run-up to the 2008 us 
presidential election, it was clear that the presidency would 
be a precarious position. america was beset by the gathering 
clouds of two frustrating and seemingly intractable wars, 
the spectre of domestic and international terrorism, 
declining international prestige, the threat of climate 
change and the economic and political difficulties of 
mitigating this threat, and rapidly bursting ‘bubbles’ in the 
housing and financial sectors. However, american democrats 
opted for Barack Obama, the leading male candidate, rather 
than senator Hillary Clinton, the leading woman, to run in 
the election. How would you reconcile this electoral 
outcome with the glass cliff effect? 
2 If men and women were equally likely to win election to the 
presidency of the usa, approximately how many presidents 
ought to have been female? Is the running total of female 
presidents, which is none, significantly less than would be 
expected by chance?

Blind spot in social psychology
race and leadership
researchers know something about the principles that 
influence women’s appointment to, and success in, precarious 
leadership roles, but what about people of minority racial 
groups? Is there a ‘glass cliff’ for members of minority racial or 
ethnic groups? In other words, are racial minority members 
more likely to be appointed to precarious leadership positions? 
1 Can you find theoretical grounds to hypothesize that racial 
minority members, like women, may be subject to the glass 
cliff effect? (Hint: it might be useful to examine the social 
identity model of leadership. We have not covered this in 
this chapter but several of the key readings are available 
publicly or widely held by university libraries; e.g., ashforth 
and Mael, 1989; Hogg, 2001). according to this theory, 
leaders are endorsed and therefore succeed to the extent 
that they embody the norms and values of a group. In other 
words, effective and popular leaders tend to be prototypical. 
Perhaps a person’s minority racial background might raise 
questions in the minds of some about their prototypicality? 
2 Can you design a study to test whether racial minority 
members are subject to a glass cliff effect? 
Student project 
Civic disengagement and belief in conspiracy 
theories
robert Brotherton studied as an 
undergraduate student at the 
university of kent and his 
dissertation supervisor was dr 
karen douglas. His research 
investigated whether civic 
disengagement predicts the 
extent to which people believe in 
conspiracy theories – alternative 
theories for significant events that are often associated with 
mistrust within groups. Conspiracy theories present a challenge 
to group cohesion and leadership, which are factors discussed 
in this chapter. 
My topic and aims
My study examined whether civic disengagement – a lack of 
participation in positive civic behaviours like voting, protesting 
and recycling – predicts the extent to which people believe in 
conspiracy theories. I argued that people who are disengaged 
or disenfranchised from society may be more accepting of 
negative claims about significant events that happen around 
them, such as the claim that important events are controlled 
from behind the scenes by a nefarious conspiracy. 
I was interested more broadly in the slightly weird areas of 
psychology like false memories, magical thinking, superstitions, 
belief in the paranormal, and how they inform our 
understanding of belief formation in general. When I discovered 
there was a member of staff researching conspiracy theories I 
thought that was perfect. understanding how people can come 
to hold beliefs in unsubstantiated, implausible, and sometimes 
damaging conspiracy theories might tell us a lot about how we 
come to believe anything at all.
My methods
I used an experimental design, aiming to manipulate how 
civically engaged our participants would see themselves, and 
then to test the impact of this civic engagement manipulation 
on beliefs in a variety of conspiracy theories. Participants 
completed a questionnaire asking about their civic intentions 
and behaviours (e.g., ‘How often do you vote?’ ‘do you intend 
to vote in the next election?’). afterwards, I gave participants 
false feedback about their answers, randomly telling half the 
participants that they scored pretty high in comparison to their 
peer group (high civic engagement), and the other half that 
they scored pretty low (low civic engagement). then I asked 
them to complete a questionnaire assessing their beliefs about 
various conspiracy theories, such as the idea that climate 
change is a scientific fraud, Princess diana is not dead, and the 
american moon landings were faked.
My findings and their implications
Our data did not support our hypothesis. the two experimental 
groups did not differ in their endorsement of conspiracy 
theories. However, a manipulation check revealed that the false 
feedback manipulation simply had no effect on participants’ 
beliefs about their own level of civic engagement. that is, self-
reported civic engagement was no different whether we told 
the participant they were high or low compared to their peers. 
they just didn’t buy it. unfortunately, this meant that a fair test 
of our hypothesis was not possible.

471
Group behaviour
therefore, I still don’t know whether civic disengagement 
leads to susceptibility to conspiracy theories. Further research 
will be necessary to answer that question. I did personally learn 
the importance of including a manipulation check in a study like 
this. Without the manipulation check, I might have concluded 
that the data showed no effect of civic engagement on 
conspiracy beliefs, when in fact it was the manipulation that 
was ineffective.
My journey
I am now doing a Phd at Goldsmiths, university of London. the 
topic of my thesis is why people believe in conspiracy theories. 
Most of all I learned the value of building a project around 
whatever you happen to find most interesting. Psychology is an 
extremely broad subject – the scope for what you can choose to 
research is almost never-ending. However, if you can find 
something you think is important and interesting, it’s going to 
motivate you, sustain your interest and, ultimately, come across 
in the quality of your work.
My advice
Give yourself as much time as possible to think about which 
questions in psychology interest you the most. read as widely 
as you can, both academic articles and pop psychology books 
where relevant, and find out what research is going on in your 
department. But don’t worry if you aren’t completely sure when 
the time comes. If you begin with just a vague interest you 
might find that it grows into enthusiastic intrigue, which grows 
into zealous fascination – unless that’s just me.

In this chapter we review the bases of stereotypes, prejudice and discrimination. We consider 
how these phenomena play out in relations between different groups, such as those differen-
tiated on the basis of gender, race, religion and age. Finally, we consider some of the vicious 
cycles in intergroup relations. By the end of this chapter, you will have learned about the 
fundamental social psychological processes that occur between groups of people.

Questions to consider
1 You may have heard of various homophobic hate groups 
that have a strong presence on the internet. members of 
these groups stage homophobic demonstrations and, in 
one specific case, picketed memorials for soldiers killed 
in the Iraq War, taking the view that these soldiers’ 
deaths are a form of punishment against the uSa for 
its tolerance of homosexuality. Which of the social 
psychological processes described in this chapter may 
be contributing to the behaviour of these groups?
2 mark, a manager for a large bank, genuinely feels very 
warm towards women. He thinks that men should 
cherish, protect and revere women. Do mark’s attitudes 
mean that he is less likely than other male managers to 
discriminate against women, for example to oversee 
unequal pay? 
3 many countries invest a lot of effort and money into 
counteracting racism. Why is racism so resistant to 
eradication? 
4 What common principle might be illustrated by these 
two scenarios? 1. Suriya is in her sixties but has not 
aged well and has health problems one would normally 
associate with someone significantly older. 2. Danni 
does quite well in mathematics in class but gets a poor 
mark whenever she sits a mathematics exam. 

474
Belonging
You have probably noticed that people often resist being categorized. Try to 
impose a group label on someone – be it ‘English’, ‘British’, ‘smoker’, ‘bisexual’, 
‘feminist’ or ‘left-winger’, to name a few – and there is a decent chance they will 
object. ‘Don’t pigeonhole me’, ‘don’t label me’ are familiar refrains. This phenom-
enon is not much studied by social psychologists, and we are inclined to think of 
it as a ‘blind spot’ in research as it stands (see the Blind spot in social psychology 
exercise at the end of this chapter). One of the reasons for this wariness about 
being slotted into a category probably relates to the desire for a distinctive 
personal identity (Brewer, 1991) (see Chapter 8). One does not want to be seen 
merely as a member of a given group but also as an individual with unique quali-
ties. This suggests that people have an intuitive awareness of some of the social 
dangers inherent in being categorized. One danger stems from the existence of 
stereotypes – simplified but widely shared beliefs about the characteristics of 
groups and their members. Thus, you may find yourself being stereotyped, 
meaning that people will assume you must have the characteristics that are stereo-
typically associated with your group, even if they know nothing else about you. 
Further, and worse, you may find yourself the target of prejudice, a negative affec-
tive reaction to your group, so called because it can cause people to prejudge you. 
Finally, if people are prejudiced against you – and, as we shall see, even if they are 
not – you may find yourself a victim of discrimination, meaning that others treat 
you less well because of the group to which you belong. 
Stereotypes, prejudice and discrimination are the most often studied forms of 
intergroup relations. This is not to say that they are the most common forms of 
relations between groups. Children and adults, women and men, and members of 
different occupational groups generally live, work and play together with few 
problems. It is the job of social psychologists, like other scientists, to understand 
and help solve problems, so it is not surprising that their research gravitates 
towards the negative end of intergroup relations. In this chapter, we will review 
the bases of stereotypes, prejudice and discrimination. We then consider how 
these phenomena play out in relations between different groups, such as those 
differentiated on the basis of gender, race, religion and age. Finally, we consider 
some of the vicious cycles in intergroup relations.
Bases of stereotypes, prejudice and discrimination
Cognitive limitations and faults
One of the oldest theoretical perspectives on stereotyping and prejudice arose 
from the so-called ‘cognitive revolution’ of the 1950s and 60s. Informed by models 
of behaviour that gave great weight to cognitive processes, theorists speculated 
that stereotypes and prejudice may arise from the limitations of human beings as 
information processors. Stereotypes were seen as necessarily impoverished, 
simplistic understandings of groups and their members. In this perspective, one 
reason that stereotypes arise is that human beings have limited cognitive resources. 
Stereotype a simplified but 
widely shared belief about a 
characteristic of a group and 
its members.
Prejudice a negative, 
affective prejudgement about 
a group and its individual 
members.
Discrimination Negative 
treatment of a group member 
simply because of their group 
membership.

475
Intergroup relations
People are seen as cognitive misers (Fiske and Taylor, 1991; see also Chapter 3). 
There is just not enough space, particularly in working memory, for observers to 
take in each person, and each group, fully as they come. Instead of incorporating 
all the ambiguous, idiosyncratic and apparently contradictory information that is 
available, it is easier and more realistic for observers to take certain shortcuts 
known as heuristics (see Chapter 3). For example, noticing a trend for a group to 
have certain characteristics, such as friendliness and warmth, individuals may save 
a lot of time and effort by assuming the trait is probably possessed by a new 
acquaintance – ‘Luigi is Italian; Italians are warm and friendly; therefore I can 
expect Luigi to be warm and friendly.’ 
This idea is supported by many studies in which individuals are shown to draw 
upon stereotypes in order to furnish them with rich, elaborate knowledge about 
individuals they barely know (e.g., Dijker and Koomen, 1996; Gilbert and Hixon, 
1991). It is also supported by studies that examine when people do, and do not, 
apply stereotypes. For example, Stephan, Berscheid and Hatfield (1971) demon-
strated that female undergraduate students were less prone to committing basic 
social cognitive errors when thinking about a potential dating partner than about a 
man they thought they would never meet. Apparently, being ‘outcome dependent’ 
on another person motivates people to expend more of their limited and precious 
cognitive resources, with dramatic effects on accuracy. Similarly, Pendry and 
Macrae (1994) showed that people are less prone to stereotyping others upon 
whom they depend – but only if they have the cognitive resources free to do so. 
In one of their experiments, Pendry and Macrae (1994) led undergraduate 
participants to believe that they would work with an elderly woman named ‘Hilda’ 
on a problem-solving task. They were also told that the best problem solvers in the 
experiment would be eligible for a £20 prize. In the outcome-dependent condition 
of the experiment, participants were told that they would work together with Hilda 
to jointly produce solutions, and would both receive the £20 prize if they were the 
most successful pair. In the outcome-independent condition, participants were told 
that they and Hilda would each produce their own solutions, and the £20 would go 
to the best performing student and the best performing non-student partner. 
Participants read a personal profile of Hilda, half of which was consistent with 
stereotypes of elderly women and the other half inconsistent. As predicted, partici-
pants who expected to depend on Hilda, being motivated to expend more cognitive 
resources in order to paint an accurate mental picture of her, later evaluated her in 
more accurate, less stereotypical terms than participants who did not. But this 
advantage disappeared among participants who were also required to mentally 
rehearse an eight-digit number while reading Hilda’s profile. In this case, partici-
pants are ‘motivated but thwarted tacticians’ (Pendry and Macrae, 1994, p. 303), 
who have good reason to spend time and effort in forming an impression of Hilda 
but are unable to do so. In fact, in support of a cognitive miser view, you can see in 
Figure 11.1 that participants who were dependent on Hilda but made cognitively 
‘busy’ relied more than any other group on stereotypes.

The cognitive miser perspective holds that stereo-
types and prejudice may stem from a human insuffi-
ciency of thought and memory – there is simply not 
enough of it to ensure a subtle, authentic representa-
tion of people and groups. But stereotypes and prej-
udice may also stem from faults in human thought 
and memory. In this view, people are like ‘faulty 
computers’ (Nisbett and Ross, 1980). Ironically, 
many of these flaws may have evolved as hard-wired 
shortcuts designed to compensate for the miserliness 
that is required because of human limitations in raw 
processing speed and power (Gilbert, 1999). The 
upshot is, however, that if one’s thought processes 
are inherently flawed, it does not necessarily help to expend more time thinking 
about a group and its members. One such flaw in human thinking appears to be 
the illusory correlation bias (Hamilton and Gifford, 1976). 
Illusory correlation
Typically, we have much less contact with minorities and outgroups than we do 
with majorities and our own groups. Thus, we have fewer opportunities to observe 
or learn about instances of behaviour by members of such groups. This relative 
lack of information can lead us to commit a crucial cognitive error. Let us take an 
example. Imagine that you live near the ground of Hometown Football Club. 
Whenever this team is playing at home, you see the procession of its fans walking 
to and from the ground. Once a year, this team has a home fixture with Neigh-
bourtown Football Club. So you see this team’s fans much less often. Each team 
has a minority of fans, let us say five per cent, who are hooligans – drunken, 
aggressive and loutish fans who make spectacles of themselves and are occasion-
ally involved in violence. If asked, would you indicate, correctly, that hooliganism 
is as frequent, proportionately speaking, in the two groups (see Table 11.1)? 
According to over 100 published demonstrations of the illusory correlation bias, the 
answer is probably no (Fiedler, 2004). In such cases, where a minority and a 
majority group are equally prone to an undesirable behaviour, this trick of the 
mind leads people to believe that the behaviour is actually more common among 
the minority group. 
The illusory correlation bias can be used to explain, in part, why certain unde-
sirable behaviours are unfairly perceived to be more characteristic of real-life 
minority groups. Even if we allow that many stereotypes contain a ‘kernel of 
truth’, such that there are real differences between groups, we can expect any 
correlation to seem larger than it really is (McGarty, 
Haslam, Turner and Oakes, 1993). If you reflect for a 
few moments, we are sure you could think of a few 
possible examples of this phenomenon in real-life 
groups (see Figure 11.2).

Intergroup relations
How can we explain the illusory correlation effect? Several 
psychological mechanisms would appear to underpin it, as we 
might expect for an effect that is so robust, that is, likely to be 
obtained each time a study is repeated. For example, Fiedler 
(1991) showed that imperfections in human learning and 
memory may help produce the illusory correlation effect. 
Memory for events is faulty, so people do not perfectly encode 
the actual ratio of positive to negative behaviours for each group. 
As time goes by, their estimate of this ratio shifts in the direction 
of a 50:50 split. This causes them to underestimate the propor-
tion of good behaviours, and overestimate the proportion of bad 
ones, since bad behaviours are more rare. In our example in 
Table 11.1, the ratio was 5 per cent bad, 95 per cent good behaviour. 
Why is this bias more pronounced for the behaviours of the minority group? 
According to Fiedler (1991), observers are exposed to fewer instances of their 
behaviour, thus their memory is weaker to begin with; and memory for the 
frequency of their behaviour shifts still further towards the 50:50 split. The result 
of this larger shift is that the ratio of negative to positive behaviours will seem 
higher for the minority than the majority group – the illusory correlation effect. 
Consistent with this explanation, Eder, Fiedler and Hamm-Eder (2011) found that 
the illusory correlation bias was higher among participants who had a lower 
working memory capacity. Also, when they temporarily reduced participants’ 
working memory with a cognitive load manipulation, the illusory correlation bias 
increased relative to a control group.
Rothbart’s (1981) explanation of the illusory correlation bias also emphasized 
the accessibility of information at the time of retrieval. Positive behaviours by the 
majority are the most common (1,900 in our example – far more than all the other 
types of behaviour combined). Thus, they are the most accessible in memory. As a 
result, the majority group are seen more favourably than the minority group 
whose positive behaviours are fewer and therefore less accessible. In this view, the 
illusory correlation effect is driven by positivity towards the majority group, 
rather than negativity towards the minority. In a later model (based on a general 
model of memory proposed by Hintzman, 1986), Smith (1991) suggested that the 
absolute number of positive and negative behaviours, rather than the ratio between 
them, is more likely to be remembered. The majority group is therefore likely to 
be evaluated more favourably because the absolute difference between positive 
and negative behaviours is larger (in our example, 1,800 for Hometown FC, versus 
90 for Neighbourtown FC). 
The most well-known explanation of the illusory correlation effect refers to the 
tendency for distinctive behaviours to capture our attention and receive the most 
elaborate processing (Hamilton and Gifford, 1976). Distinctiveness is a tricky 
concept to pin down; indeed, this is one of the criticisms of this approach to the 
illusory correlation bias (e.g., McGarty and de la Haye, 1997; van Rooy, van 
Overwalle, Vanhoomissen et al., 2003). However, it is possible to define it in terms

of mere statistical rarity. In this sense, minority behaviours are, by definition, 
distinctive relative to majority behaviours. Also, undesirable behaviours are rarer 
and thus more distinctive than desirable ones. So, undesirable behaviours by the 
minority group are distinctive on two counts: they seize the most attention, and 
carry the most weight (see also Sherman, Kruschke, Sherman et al., 2009). 
The illusory correlation bias is a vivid, robust and well-explained bias, which 
would appear to underpin processes of stereotyping and prejudice. It may lead to 
unduly harsh perceptions of minority groups or of outgroups with whom people 
have little direct experience. Certainly, it highlights how a little knowledge of an 
outgroup can be a dangerous thing. That said, no one is pretending that illusory 
correlations are enough to explain all forms of stereotyping and prejudice. In 
order to do this, one has to consider other processes, and especially the emotions 
and motivations that go along with belonging to groups. Further, some have ques-
tioned the sense in which an illusory correlation always deserves to be called a 
‘bias’. It may be legitimate to evaluate a group according to the sum total of good 
things it does, rather than the proportion (Berndsen, McGarty, van der Pligt and 
Spears, 2001; McGarty et al., 1993). 
Category accentuation
The illusory correlation effect refers to a cognitive error that can occur when 
people have more information about one group than another. A still more basic 
error is category accentuation, in which the mere act of categorization can distort 
the way people think about members of groups and the groups themselves. Placing 
objects into categories changes the way they are perceived, such that differences 
between categories are maximized and differences within categories are minimized 
(Tajfel, 1959). This was demonstrated in a classic study by Tajfel and Wilkes 
(1963). Participants were presented with an array of lines of 
varying lengths. In one condition, the lines were unlabelled. 
In another condition, shorter lines were labelled, with the 
letter A, whereas longer lines were labelled B (see Figure 
11.3). Thus, Tajfel and Wilkes had created two categories, A 
and B, tending to comprise short and long lines respectively. 
When lines were categorized in this way, the difference 
between the shortest and longer line in the whole array was 
perceived to be larger, even though the objective difference 
was identical in the unlabelled condition. 
Tajfel and Wilkes (1963) found much the same differences 
when observers made judgements about people. Many 
researchers have since found that differences among people between categories, 
and similarities among people within categories, are accentuated (e.g., Corneille 
and Judd, 1999; McGarty and Penny, 1988; Queller, Schell and Mason, 2006). The 
effect extends beyond judgements about individuals. When asked to make judge-
ments about the categories themselves, people also make a similar mistake. For 
example, Krueger, Rothbart and Siriam (1989) told participants that sprinters

to perceive larger differences 
between the line groups.

generally weigh more than marathon runners and, in a ‘category learning’ phase, 
presented them with the body weights of a number of individuals who, by and 
large, conformed to this rule. In a later ‘category change’ phase, participants were 
presented with more body weight information, this time about people who either 
confirmed (heavy sprinters, featherweight marathon runners) or bucked (lithe 
sprinters, bulky marathoners) the trend. Participants’ estimates of the average 
weight of these two groups changed more in the first condition than in the second, 
that is, when the new category members tended to accentuate, rather than to mini-
mize, the difference between categories. Apparently, people attend to and 
remember more easily people who confirm, rather than disconfirm, category-
based expectations (see also Krueger and Rothbart, 1990). 
Cognitive motivations: dogmatism, closed-mindedness
Stereotypes and prejudice stem not only from limitations in how people are able 
to think. It is also important to consider how they want to think. As we consid-
ered in Chapter 3, human beings share a desire to understand their environment, 
and a general aversion to uncertainty or ambiguity about matters that are impor-
tant to them. A number of social psychologists have linked this epistemic (knowl-
edge) need with intergroup perceptions. This epistemic need can engender 
stereotypes and prejudice by causing people to seek haste, simplicity and clarity 
in the way they process information. Stereotypes meet these needs because they 
provide explanations for real or imagined patterns in behaviour. They are a type 
of social knowledge that helps us feel that we can understand our social environ-
ment in relatively simple terms. Similarly, prejudice can be seen as a natural reac-
tion to groups who seem to threaten our understanding of the world. For 
example, one way of feeling that we understand our social environment is to clas-
sify behaviours into ‘right’ and ‘wrong’. Prejudice can be seen as a response to 
groups of people whose values and behaviour seem to contradict our sense of 
right and wrong, and therefore the beliefs and values we use to understand the 
world (Duckitt, 2006). 
Most tests of this approach have focused on individual differences. The 
reasoning behind these tests is that some people experience these epistemic needs 
more acutely than others, and those people should be the most prone to stereo-
typing and prejudice. Rokeach (1956, 1960) was among the first to take this 
approach. According to Rokeach, individuals with high levels of antipathy 
towards outgroups were likely to share a trait he termed dogmatism. Dogmatism is 
the tendency to be able to tolerate mutually inconsistent beliefs by isolating them 
from each other in memory. This rigid cognitive structure tends to be resistant to 
change. Rokeach (1960) developed a measure of dogmatism and found some 
evidence that it is related to prejudice towards various groups. However, the 
measure he designed seemed to measure not only dogmatism but also some rather 
specific ideological and personality variables. It seemed to overlap with a variable 
we shall review shortly called authoritarianism (Adorno, Frenkel-Brunswik, 
Levinson and Sanford, 1950) – sharing its concern with personal inadequacy,

people to be able to tolerate

power and status (Webster and Kruglanski, 1994; for a review of the historical 
relationship between dogmatism and authoritarianism, see Brown, 1995). 
The personal need for structure (PNS) is a construct that addresses human beings’ 
epistemic concerns in a more direct way (Neuberg and Newsom, 1993). People 
who score highly on this variable – indicating a preference for structure in most 
situations – tend to stereotype others more. For example, Neuberg and Newsom 
(1993) presented participants with one of two descriptions of an undergraduate 
student. These descriptions were identical except that the student was called either 
‘Richard’ or ‘Michelle’. Sure enough, participants who were high in PNS assigned 
more stereotypically ‘female’, negative traits such as irrationality and gullibility to 
Michelle than to Richard. Participants who were low in PNS did not do this (see 
Figure 11.4) (see also Schaller, Boyd, Yohannes and O’Brien, 1995). 
Still another construct is the need for cognitive closure (NFCC) (Kruglanski, 
2006; Webster and Kruglanski, 1994). This is defined as a general desire to seek 
‘an answer on a given topic, any answer … compared to confusion and ambiguity’ 
(Kruglanski, 1990, p. 377). This latent desire is viewed as being expressed in five 
facets: the desire for predictability, a preference for 
order and structure, discomfort with ambiguity, 
decisiveness, 
and 
closed-mindedness 
(discussed 
in Chapter 6 in relation to persuasion). Like the 
need for structure, it has been shown to be associ-
ated with prejudice and stereotyping. For example, 
Dijksterhuis, van Knippenberg, Kruglanski and 
Schaper (1996) found that participants who scored 
highly on a measure of NFCC tended to recall more 
stereotype-consistent information about a group of 
football hooligans, whereas participants who were 
low in NFCC recalled relatively more stereotype-
inconsistent information. 
In sum, research supports the basic idea that the more an individual is moti-
vated to understand the world in simple, highly structured terms, the more they 
are likely to rely on stereo types and be prejudiced. Epistemic concerns may also 
shape stereotyping and especially prejudice in an indirect or mediated way. It is 
related to variables that themselves have been shown to predict prejudice towards 
certain groups that are perceived either as a threat to the social order or as 
deserving of their lowly position in the social status quo. These variables include 
political conservatism (Jost, Glaser, Kruglanski and Sulloway, 2003) and certain 
values such as security, conformity and tradition (Calogero, Bardi and Sutton, 
2009). It is to these variables, associated with preferences or ideologies surrounding 
how society should ideally be ordered, that we now turn.

Ideologies 
The study of the role of ideology in intergroup relations has a long history in 
social psychology. Arguably, the person who has had the most profound, far-
reaching impact on the study of intergroup relations is Karl Marx, with his 
collaborator Friedrich Engels. Marx and Engels ([1848]1998) were especially 
interested in conflicts between the social classes. For Marx, social classes arise 
from excess production in an economy. When agriculture or industry are efficient 
enough to produce more than is required for survival at a subsistence level, the 
ruling classes emerge who own the means of production (land, factories). The 
ruling classes dominate the working classes who supply the labour required to 
operate the means of production. In economies based largely on agriculture, the 
most fundamental classes are landowners and peasants. The bourgeoisie (or capi-
talists) and the proletariat (or working class) are the most basic and familiar of the 
classes in industrialized economies based on mass production (for a more fine-
grained analysis of social class, see Giddens, 1981). 
For Marx, these classes have inherently different, and conflicting, interests. 
Class conflict stems from the fact that it is in the interests of the ruling class to 
retain control of the means of production and to perpetuate their exploitation of 
the working class. For their part, it is in the interests of the working class to over-
throw this exploitation and share in the profits that stem from ownership of the 
means of production. Two key concepts developed by Marx have a strongly social 
psychological flavour. For Marx, the unequal class system is preserved by ‘false 
consciousness’. The working classes are distracted from awareness of their disad-
vantaged position in the class system, their common interests with fellow 
working-class people, and their competing interests with the ruling class. Ideolo-

482

gies, such as the Protestant work ethic and religious notions of providence (that 
people’s position in society is divinely ordained), play a key role in keeping people 
in a state of false consciousness. In contrast, ‘class consciousness’ emerges when 
the fog is lifted and people become aware of the implications of social class. 
In their general form, some of Marx’s key ideas are incorporated in all the 
approaches we are about to consider, including authoritarianism, social dominance 
orientation, realistic conflict theory and social identity theory. These are:
1 Groups have unequal levels of status in society.
2 Individuals within these groups tend to have interests in common. 
3 These groups tend to have conflicting interests.
4 Members of these groups are not fully aware of their interests and hence fail to 
act on them.
5 Awareness is hampered by ideologies that obscure status inequalities, justify 
them, or make them seem unchangeable.
Authoritarianism
Adorno et al. (1950) were the first to link the preference for hierarchy to prejudice. 
Their research, like Milgram’s (1961) studies of obedience (see Chapter 9), was 
largely an attempt to make some sense of the Holocaust of the 1940s. The key 
difference is that whereas Milgram (1961) linked evil intergroup behaviour to the 
power of the situation, Adorno et al. looked for a cause in the personalities of the 
wrongdoers and their supporters. The result was the concept of the ‘authoritarian 
personality’. Adorno et al. were able to show that people with this type of person-
ality were indeed more prejudiced. However, the scale they deployed, known as 
the F-scale (F for fascism), was not reliable or valid (Altemeyer, 1981). Also, their 
concept seemed to resonate with politically right-wing rather than left-wing forms 
of authoritarianism (Rokeach, 1960). Thus, it tended to account better for prejudice 
towards groups that right-wingers, rather than left-wingers, seem to dislike (e.g., 
the poor, as opposed to the aristocracy). 
Exploring further locate and read the excellent biographical entry on theodor adorno on Wikipedia. adorno was 
a brilliant individual, who, in addition to his social scientific work, was a public intellectual and a music composer. 
like several eminent social psychologists in the second half of the 20th century, adorno was Jewish and emigrated 
from germany in the 1930s, although unlike many others, he returned to germany after the Second World War. What 
other major Jewish social psychologists can you find who lived through the Holocaust? How do you think this 
experience influenced their thinking? 
Adorno’s ideas and methods were refined by Altemeyer (1981, 1998), who put 
forward the concept of right-wing authoritarianism and developed a much improved 
scale to measure it. This scale measures the three components of this concept: 
1 conventionalism: the desire for adherence to traditional social values and mores 
2 authoritarian aggression: the desire to aggress against or punish those who defy 
these social conventions 
3 authoritarian submission: the tendency to yield to authority.

Intergroup relations
Altemeyer (1998) found that right-wing authoritarians are more prejudiced 
towards a range of groups, particularly those who are traditionally low in status 
(e.g., Black people) or who seem to flout traditional values (e.g., gay people). 
Exploring further look for research on left-wing authoritarianism, using google Scholar or another research 
database. Compare and contrast this variable with right-wing authoritarianism. Why do you think relatively little 
research has been done on this topic? Does it suggest that social psychologists tend to be rather left-wing and are 
thus more eager to demonstrate the shortcomings of right-wing ideology? or is it because left-wing 
authoritarianism is simply less powerful and wide-reaching in its effects? 
Although Altemeyer’s (1998) results are clear and compelling, debate surrounds 
how they should be interpreted. Altemeyer explained them in terms of personality 
processes, arguing that something about the psychological makeup of authori-
tarian people creates a need to be prejudiced. However, others see right-wing 
authoritarianism as more like an ideology than a facet of someone’s character. In 
support of this view, authoritarianism turns out to be more strongly related to 
attitudes and values than to deep-seated personality dimensions (Heaven and 
Connors, 2001; Saucier, 2000). Further, right-wing authoritarianism changes in 
response to situational forces. For example, when the social order is threatened, 
people become more authoritarian (Duckitt and Fisher, 2003). This does not seem 
to be compatible with the view that right-wing authoritarianism is wired into 
people’s character by their genes or childhood experiences. 
Time to reflect Do you think that authoritarianism is always a bad thing? What might be some of the benefits of 
authoritarianism? Can you think of ways to test your ideas?
Social dominance orientation
The relationship between ideology and intergroup relations is addressed more 
squarely by another key concept in social psychology – social dominance orienta-
tion (Sidanius and Pratto, 1999). Like right-wing authoritarianism, this concept is 
‘multidimensional’, in that it comprises more than one component:
1 a general preference for hierarchical, as opposed to equal, relations between groups 
2 a desire for one’s own group to dominate or be superior to other groups. 
And, like right-wing authoritarianism, it enjoys a good deal of research support. 
For example, Pratto, Sidanius, Stallworth and Malle (1994) found that individuals 
who scored highly on social dominance orientation tended to be prejudiced 
towards a range of social groups, such as Black people and gay people, and 
opposed social policy measures designed to enhance the welfare and esteem of 
these groups. They also tended to endorse beliefs that legitimized the unequal 
status of different groups, such as the belief that in America, everyone has an equal 
opportunity to succeed regardless of the ethnic group they were born into (for 
more detail on the legitimization of the status quo, see Chapter 14).

As illustrated by right-wing authoritarianism and social dominance orientation, 
the development of new concepts inspires research that uncovers valuable insights 
into the causes of prejudice and other social behaviours. But there is a danger 
inherent in this creative process – we can end up with too many variables, each 
claiming to explain the same phenomenon. A key aim of science is parsimony – 
the explanation of the complex phenomena of the world in simple and under-
standable terms (Chapter 1). As Occam pointed out in the 14th century, when 
making sense of the world, we should try to posit the existence of as few things as 
we can. Each time we posit a variable, we increase the chances that the variable 
does not exist and therefore that our understanding is wrong. Thus, it is important 
to consider whether right-wing authoritarianism and social dominance orientation 
really are different, having different effects on intergroup relations, instead of just 
being superficially different ways of describing the same basic processes. 
Fortunately, it turns out they are different. Duckitt (2006) measured his partici-
pants’ right-wing authoritarianism as well as their social dominance orientation. 
He found that high scores on right-wing authoritarianism were correlated with 
prejudice towards groups perceived to pose a threat to the social order, as meas-
ured on items such as: ‘They seem to reject moral values that are important to me.’ 
In contrast, social dominance orientation was positively correlated with prejudice 
towards groups that seem to be in competition with the ingroup (e.g., ‘If they 
make economic gains, people like me will be worse off’). These results highlight 
the essential difference between the two variables. Right-wing authoritarianism is 
associated with perceiving the world as a dangerous place, and striving to preserve 
society from threats to its shared values, cohesion and safety. Social dominance 
orientation involves the perception of the world as a competitive jungle in which 
dog eats dog, and is concerned with preserving a clear hierarchy within which 
one’s group is highly placed (for other differences between these variables, see 
Duriez and van Hiel, 2002; Heaven and Connors, 2001). 
Ethnocentrism and the struggle for superiority
As we have seen, social dominance orientation is ideological insofar as it reflects a 
preference for a clear status hierarchy, or ‘pecking order’, in society. However, its 
second component is not ideological, equating instead to the desire for ‘us’ to 
dominate ‘them’. More generally, people seem to want their own social group to 
be superior in some sense to others. This desire may ultimately stem from what 
people want for themselves. 
For example, many social groups, such as teams, companies, political move-
ments and armies, work collaboratively in the face of competition from other 
groups. Individuals within these groups are better off if their group functions as a 
collective. This basic pattern of relationships – cooperation within groups, compe-
tition between groups – is a common feature of human experience. The competi-
tive nature of relations between groups can easily spill over into prejudice and 
intergroup conflict. This is especially so in ‘zero-sum’ situations where resources 
can only be gained by one group at the expense of the other (e.g., there is only so

Intergroup relations
much land in central Europe that can be claimed as territory; similarly, there can 
be only one winner of the Eurovision song contest). This approach to intergroup 
relations can be traced back to Marx’s ideas about class conflict, and is exemplified 
by realistic group conflict theory (Sherif, 1966).
The quest for the superiority of the ingroup is not all about material welfare, 
however. As we saw in Chapter 2, individuals strive to achieve a positive and 
coherent identity. As we saw in Chapter 8, a positive image of the self depends on 
a positive image of the groups to which one belongs, which, in turn, depends on 
seeing one’s group in positive terms relative to other groups. This approach to 
intergroup relations is exemplified by social identity theory (see also Chapter 8). 
Some of the different emphases between these 
two theories are shown in Table 11.2.
In general, realistic group conflict theory 
and social identity theory emphasize different 
aspects of intergroup relations. Whereas realistic 
group conflict theory highlights the need to 
secure scarce resources for the ingroup, social 
identity theory focuses on the need to view the 
ingroup positively. Other differences in emphasis 
are shown in Table 11.2, and are highlighted by 
probably the most famous and archetypal tests 
inspired by each approach to intergroup rela-
tions: Sherif, Harvey, White et al.’s ([1954]1961) 
‘Robbers Cave’ study, and the first ‘minimal 
group paradigm’ pioneered by Tajfel, Billig, 
Bundy and Flament (1971). 
Although realistic group conflict theory and 
social identity theory emphasize different stra-
tegic priorities, they share an essential feature 
that differentiates them from the cognitive, personality and ideological approaches 
considered so far. In explaining relations between groups, their focus moves 
beyond the processes inside an individual, although these remain important, to 
include processes occurring at the group level. Intergroup contexts cause people 
to identify themselves and others with the groups to which they belong. They 
then interact with each other as members of groups. They start to see their own 
group as better than its rivals, in a mindset known as ethnocentrism, and start to 
pursue strategic objectives on behalf of their group. 
The Robbers Cave study
Sherif et al. ([1954]1961) devised a vivid test of their ideas about how prejudice 
and conflict spring from a mix of intragroup cooperation and intergroup competi-
tion. Inspired by Golding’s 1954 novel The Lord of the Flies, they decided to take 
children, whose behaviour may be more malleable than adults, out of their normal 
environment to an isolated locale, where, free from the civilizing influences that

normally constrain them, the development of conflict and prejudice could be 
studied. They created a summer camp they called the ‘Robbers Cave’ for 11-year-
old boys in rural Oklahoma. The subsequent field experiment unfolded in three 
key phases:
 o Phase 1 – group attachment: The boys arrived and were divided into separate 
groups, staying at opposite ends of the camp in cabins located far apart. For a 
week, they engaged in fun, recreational activities like swimming, sports and 
walking, in blissful ignorance of the other group’s existence. They chose names 
for their groups – the ‘Rattlers’ and the ‘Eagles’, respectively – along with group 
symbols, flags and even T-shirts. 
 o Phase 2 – intergroup competition: Having established the kind of ingroup 
attachment and cooperation that is supposed to underlie prejudice and inter-
group conflict, the experimenters then introduced the other theoretically 
important ingredient: competition between groups. They brought the two 
groups together to compete in a series of contests. Not only would the winning 
group receive a trophy, but its members would receive desirable prizes such as 
pocket knives. So, the interests of individuals were strongly aligned with the 
interests of their group. Almost immediately, there were signs of ethnocen-
trism – boys saw their own group as superior to the other. Similarly, conflicts 
arose between the groups almost straightaway. These were initially confined to 
taunts and name calling, but then shifted up a gear to include symbolic acts of 
intergroup violence; for example, one group burned the other’s flag. These trig-
gered a familiar tit-for-tat pattern of aggression and retaliation between groups. 
Groups raided each others’ cabins and stole property, and used increasingly 
hostile language to describe each other, and displayed ever more intense ethno-
centrism. It is worth noting that the Robbers Cave study was run three times, 
with different groups of boys in different summers. On two of these runs, the 
situation became so hostile and stressful that the study had to be abandoned on 
ethical grounds. (You may recall from Chapter 9 that the same fate befell the 
Stanford Prison Experiment and the BBC Prison Study.) On just the final run, 
the study proceeded to the final phase.
 o Phase 3 – intergroup reconciliation: In this phase of the study, the experimenters 
attempted to douse the flames of conflict they had fanned so effectively. One 
technique they tried was to increase the amount of contact between the groups, 
for example by having them eat together. Consistent with much work on the 
contact hypothesis, which we will discuss in more detail in Chapter 12, merely 
increasing contact between the groups did not work and, if anything, worsened 
the situation. For example, shared mealtimes were treated less as an opportu-
nity to iron out differences than to throw food at members of the rival group. 
In contrast, what really worked was the introduction of shared or superordinate 
goals. Each group retained a separate identity, but was posed challenges that 
could only be solved in cooperation with the other group. In one case, the 
experimenters secretly sabotaged the camp’s water supply and had all the boys

work together to repair it. On another occasion, the 
boys all had to work together to pull a broken-down 
truck out of some mud – using a rope that had earlier 
featured in a competitive game of tug-of-war. The 
effect of working together was to reduce the ethnocen-
trism and intergroup hostility that had so dominated 
life in the camp before. For example, the percentage of 
outgroup members who were rated negatively after 
cooperation was significantly lower than the amount 
classified negatively after competition (see Figure 
11.5). Some boys even struck up friendships with 
members of the other group. 
The essential findings of the Robbers Cave study have been widely replicated 
(Fisher, 1990). The study has been highly influential in social psychology, espe-
cially as the flagship for realistic group conflict theory and its descendants (e.g., 
Stephan and Stephan, 1985). Its influence also extends far beyond social 
psychology. Although we hope you have not had an experience as aversive as the 
Robbers Cave, there is a good chance that you have undergone some of the ‘team-
building’ exercises that it and similar studies have inspired. These are widely used 
by organizations such as schools, sports clubs and corporations to foster ingroup 
cooperation and prevent or defuse intergroup conflict. Although they may some-
times feel forced and ‘cheesy’, the evidence suggests that they are generally effec-
tive in enhancing relations within groups (Blake and Mouton, 1961; Klein, 
DiazGranados, Salas et al., 2009). 
One of the great strengths of the Robbers Cave study, like many of the iconic 
studies in social psychology, is its resemblance to the real-life situations from 
which spring many problematic social behaviours. The boys were immersed in an 
unfolding situation that engaged a range of intense emotions and motivations, and 
fostered dynamic social relationships (see Figure 11.6). This richness is invaluable 
but comes at a price – it is difficult to tease out the influ-
ence of any given causal factor. Which of the many 
conditions of the Robbers Cave field experiment were 
necessary, and which if any were sufficient (that is, 
enough on their own), to bring about the various forms 
of conflict and ethnocentrism that arose? In particular, 
the Robbers Cave study left an important question 
unanswered – can socially significant displays of preju-
dice and ethnocentrism arise even when groups are not 
locked into a zero-sum, competitive situation? Is it 
enough simply for people to be in an intergroup context?

Time to reflect the normative climate of a social psychological experiment, like any other social situation, is 
affected by language. Sherif et al. told the boys that their camp was named after a local geographical feature, but in 
fact there was no robbers Cave in the vicinity. the boys chose, and were permitted, to name their groups after 
predatory animals – rattle snakes and eagles. How might these choices have affected the normative climate of the 
camp? What other kinds of names might have been chosen and how might this have affected the results of this 
experiment? Can we see the experimenters’ choice of name for the camp, and their permissive stance to the boys’ 
choices of group names, as a ‘demand characteristic’? Finally, reflect on the names of many situations, systems and 
groups in real life. For example, many countries in the West claim that they are engaged in a ‘war on drugs’, army 
units are often given names like ‘the Desert rats’ and so on. to what extent can we see these as strategic choices 
designed to affect the behaviour of people in these situations?
The minimal group paradigm
The classic minimal group study by Tajfel et al. (1971) seemed to provide an answer 
to the question left open by Sherif et al.’s Robbers Cave study. The main aim of the 
study was to examine whether merely placing people into different social categories 
can generate ethnocentrism and problematic intergroup relations. A further aim of 
the study was to re-examine whether prejudice and conflict are necessarily moti-
vated by the desire to procure as many resources for the ingroup as possible. Tajfel 
et al. asked a sample of British schoolboys to evaluate unfamiliar and unattributed 
paintings, and then divided them into two groups. One group was told that they 
had preferred paintings by the artist Kandinsky, whereas the other was told that 
their preference was for Klee. In fact, participants’ assignment to these groups was 
entirely random and had nothing to do with their evaluations of the paintings. The 
participants knew that everybody had been categorized, but did not know which 
of the other boys belonged to the Kandinsky or the Klee groups. 
Thus, Tajfel et al. (1971) had created minimal groups, based on an apparently 
trivial (in fact, bogus) difference, lacking history, common goals or indeed any 
prospect of a common future, and independent of interpersonal friendships. To 
test whether the boys would discriminate even on the basis of this minimal group 
basis, Tajfel et al. told them that they were to participate in a decision-making 
task. Each boy was given several opportunities to assign points to two other boys, 
on the understanding that the points would be converted into real money at the 
end of the experiment. These two boys were known only by their code number 
and group membership: one was always in the Kandinsky and one in the Klee 
group. The decision maker was asked to choose from a matrix of allocations. 
The first key finding was that boys assigned more points to ingroup than to 
outgroup members. This seemed to show that merely belonging to a group is, 
indeed, enough to produce ingroup favouritism. The second key finding was that in 
their striving to favour ingroup members in relative terms, participants were 
prepared to sacrifice some of the points they assigned to the ingroup in absolute 
terms. For example, imagine that a boy can choose to either give 17 points to the 
ingroup and 21 to the outgroup member, or 18 to the ingroup and 23 to the outgroup 
member. Neither of these choices is attractive because they entail giving less to the 
ingroup member. But the first choice is less unattractive, because the ingroup 

489
Intergroup relations
member is relatively worse off by only 4 points, rather than 5. Typically, participants 
will opt for this allocation, even though it gives the ingroup member 1 less point in 
absolute terms. To paraphrase a familiar expression, people will cut off their own 
group’s nose to spite another group’s face. Figure 11.7 provides an illustration of the 
possible allocations that can be made in the minimal group paradigm. 
In a typical study using the minimal group paradigm, participants are asked to circle the numbers 
on each line to indicate the resources they would like to allocate to the ingroup and the resources 
they would like to allocate to the outgroup. The numbers typically signify money. The numbers vary 
from matrix to matrix and diﬀerent matrices are used in diﬀerent studies, but this is an example:

From an analysis of how participants distribute points across a number of diﬀerent matrices like the 
one above, it is possible to determine which of the following is a participant’s preferred strategy in 
allocating resources:
F – fairness: the most equal allocation
MD – maximum diﬀerence: the most ingroup-biased allocation which makes the ingroup member 
most well oﬀ relative to the outgroup member, regardless of the absolute number of points they 
receive
MIP – maximum ingroup proﬁt: the allocation which gives the ingroup member most points, 
regardless of how much the outgroup member receives
MJP – maximum joint proﬁt: the allocation that awards the highest number of points (regardless 
of the diﬀerence between the groups)
FAV – favouritism: employment of MIP and MD

This study has been replicated hundreds of times with variations across many 
settings (Diehl, 1990). Its key finding seems to give strong support for the social 
identity approach to intergroup relations, especially to discrimination. Specifi-
cally, participants in these studies do not always seem to be interested in maxi-
mizing resources for their ingroup as realistic group conflict theory would suggest. 
Instead, they will often expend the resources of their group to ensure that it comes 
out ahead of other groups in relative terms. Just as social identity theory predicts, 
people seem to be pursuing the symbolic superiority of their group and are 
prepared to spend material resources in doing so. It is important to note that the 
minimal group paradigm is not a zero-sum situation – participants are not forced 
to divide a fixed total between two groups, but can choose allocations that involve 
a higher or lower total (in our example above, the first option entails a total of 38 
points, and the second 41 points). In contrast, a zero-sum situation means that one 
cannot give relatively less to the outgroup without also giving absolutely more to 
the ingroup. Thus, it is impossible in these situations, unlike Tajfel et al.’s (1971) 
study, to disentangle the two motives. This is a great strength of the minimal group 
paradigm and probably mirrors many real-life situations in which groups stand to 
make mutual gains if they can find ways to cooperate with each other. Now, read

CrITICAl FOCuS 
The minimal group paradigm
Despite its success, the minimal group paradigm has been 
critiqued on a number of grounds.
1 Is the minimal group paradigm too minimal?
an obvious critique of the minimal group paradigm is that 
it is different from most everyday group contexts, and 
therefore lacks ecological validity (see Chapter 1). real 
groups tend to have a history and a future, tend to feature 
bonds between their members that are created by 
ongoing interactions, or are based on within-group 
similarities and between-group differences that appear to 
be meaningful to participants. the stakes are generally 
much lower in the minimal group studies, where 
participants typically allocate tokens or tasks, than in real-
life situations where intergroup relations have enduring 
and often profound consequences. 
these charges cannot be denied, but the question is 
how important they are. the point of the minimal group 
paradigm was precisely to create an experimentally 
controlled situation in which the effects of merely being 
categorized could be studied in isolation from other 
factors. this scientific requirement means that the 
experiments must necessarily be different from many real-
life situations in which the various aspects of group life go 
hand in hand. and, it is always important when evaluating 
a particular methodology to compare the results it 
produces with those from other types of research. If other 
studies, which do not share the limitations of the research 
in question, produce similar results, then we have 
converging evidence for its conclusions. In this case, 
experiments with groups that have an enduring history 
have revealed much the same pattern of ingroup-
favouring allocations as in tajfel et al.’s (1971) study (e.g., 
amancio, 1989; mullen, Brown and Smith, 1992). Brown’s 
(1978) field study also showed that in real-life wage 
negotiations, groups of workers were prepared to reduce 
their own wage settlements in order to ensure that other 
groups did not receive more. each of these studies may be 
criticized on various grounds, but together, precisely 
because they have different strengths and weaknesses, the 
similar results they have produced are rather compelling. 
2 Is the minimal group paradigm not minimal enough?
another, less intuitive critique of the minimal group 
paradigm is that it is not sufficiently minimal: participants 
may imagine that their assignment into categories reflects 
some underlying psychological characteristic. For 
example, our preference for different artists may seem to 
say something about how open-minded, conservative and 
sensation-seeking we are. In many minimal group studies, 
participants are even instructed that a range of 
unspecified psychological differences distinguishes people 
from the two groups (e.g., elder, Douglas and Sutton, 
2006). this raises the possibility that observed patterns of 
intergroup relations in these experiments do not stem 
from the mere fact of categorization but also require that 
these categories are seen to have some deeper meaning. 
However, anticipating this criticism, researchers have 
created groups that are yet more minimal, in which groups 
are merely called ‘X’ or ‘Y’ and participants are explicitly 
told that their assignment to groups is entirely random. 
even under these conditions, ingroup favouritism is to be 
found (e.g., Billig and tajfel, 1973). 
3 Is the minimal group paradigm subject to demand 
characteristics?
another criticism of the minimal group paradigm refers to 
the ever present danger of demand characteristics (see 
Chapter 1). Critics such as gerard and Hoyt (1974) point out 
that participants are likely to be aware that the 
experimenters are dividing them into groups with the clear 
expectation that this will affect their behaviour. they argue 
that, specifically, participants are likely to infer that they 
are expected to behave in a discriminatory way, given that 
groups are stereotypically expected to be competitive 
along ‘us’ and ‘them’ lines (rather like the ‘group’ heuristic 
below). the argument goes, participants are merely doing 
what they believe to be expected of them. 
there are several things that can be said about this 
criticism. First, in some studies, the experimenters make 
their expectations explicit by telling participants that the 
norm in this situation is either cooperative or competitive. 
In these studies, there is little evidence that participants 
adhere to the norms that are presented to them (e.g., Billig, 
1973). Second, recent studies have shown that 
categorization in minimal groups causes people to exhibit 
apparently automatic forms of intergroup favouritism that 
they find difficult, if not impossible, to control. For example, 
ashburn-Nardo, Voils and monteith (2001) demonstrated 
ethnocentrism following a minimal group manipulation in 
the Implicit association test – reaction times revealed that 

491
Intergroup relations
they associated negative words more readily with the 
outgroup and positive words with the ingroup. 
Performance on a task like this is less likely to be affected by 
demand characteristics than the explicit assignment of 
resources to ingroup versus outgroup members. 
4 The group heuristic: they will scratch my back, so I am 
scratching theirs
Yamagishi and colleagues (Foddy, Platow and Yamagishi, 
2009; Karp, Jin, Yamagishi and Shinotsuka, 1993; 
Yamagishi and Kiyonari, 2000; Yamagishi, makimura, 
Foddy et al., 2005) have proposed an alternative to the 
social identity explanation of ingroup favouritism in the 
allocation of resources. In this ‘group heuristic’ account, 
participants’ allocation of resources to ingroup members 
simply reflects their intuitive understanding of how groups 
work – not necessarily the desire to enhance their social 
identity. as we have noted, cooperation within groups and 
competition between groups is a common feature of 
human life, so much so that it would be surprising if people 
did not acquire some intuitive appreciation that people are 
generally helpful and fair within group boundaries, and 
relatively cutthroat across them. Further, human beings 
have lived in this way throughout most of their 
evolutionary history, so it is possible that they are 
biologically prepared to expect intragroup cooperation 
and intergroup competition (Cosmides, 1989; Cosmides 
and tooby, 1992). thus, people may give more to ingroup 
than to outgroup members because they have a 
generalized expectation that this is how people behave. 
this interpretation was tested in a study by Karp et al. 
(1993). In the original study by tajfel et al. (1971), 
participants were told that the people to whom they 
allocated resources would not be given an opportunity to 
reciprocate. However, they were led to believe that they 
would receive allocations from other ingroup and 
outgroup members. Karp et al. (1993) reasoned that, 
based on the group heuristic, participants would expect to 
receive more from ingroup than from outgroup members. 
thus, they give more to ingroup members as a way of 
reciprocating the favourable allocations they expect to 
receive: a kind of ‘thank you in advance’. In support of this 
idea, when Karp et al. (1993) made it clear to participants 
that their own reward would not be determined by other 
participants, ingroup favouritism disappeared: 
participants gave equally to ingroup and outgroup 
members. Here, there was no ingroup favouritism to 
expect and therefore to reciprocate. 
If ingroup favouritism is based on a generalized 
principle of reciprocity, it also ought to disappear when 
people do not believe that their group identity is known to 
others. Your fellow group members cannot treat you 
especially well if they do not know that you belong to their 
group, so, as in the study by Karp et al. (1993), there is no 
favouritism to reciprocate. Indeed, when participants know 
others’ group identity, but are told that their own group 
identity is unknown to others, ingroup favouritism 
disappears (Yamagishi et al., 2005). this alternative model 
poses a powerful challenge to the traditional interpretation 
of tajfel et al.’s (1971) famous study and its many 
replications. However, it is too early to reject the social 
identity account of the minimal group paradigm altogether. 
one problem is that there is currently no direct evidence of 
the existence of the group heuristic. People behave as if 
they believed that generalized reciprocity is the norm 
within the ingroup, but there is no other, more direct 
evidence that they have this belief (Yamagishi et al., 2005). 
Indeed, when St Claire and turner (1982) asked 
participants to guess the results of minimal group studies, 
they significantly underestimated the extent of group 
bias. this raises doubts about whether people have a full 
heuristic appreciation that ingroupers will be more 
generous to them. that said, St Claire and turner’s (1982) 
participants were not actually in a minimal group 
situation. Instead, they were bystanders who merely had 
such a situation described to them. given the low stakes, 
they may not have expended the same level of cognitive 
resources as people who find themselves in a real minimal 
group context (as we saw earlier in this chapter with 
Pendry and macrae, 1994). this may have prevented them 
from fully understanding how people are likely to treat 
each other in such a context.
5 Dominance or identity? Some concluding notes
Both realistic group conflict theory and social identity 
theory can claim to be extensively supported by 
experiments in the laboratory and the field. Nonetheless, 
there are important questions about how the results of 
many of these experiments should be interpreted, and it is 
probably impossible to tell whether a winner has yet, will 
ever, or ought to emerge. this is partly because there is a 
lot of overlap and agreement between these two 
approaches to intergroup relations. as we have noted, 
both theories are strongly social, specifying how 
intergroup relations are affected by the social contexts in 
which people find themselves. Both theories are also 

492
Belonging
concerned with the pursuit of groups’ material as well as 
symbolic welfare, even if they emphasize them differently. 
this is not surprising: after all, the material welfare of a 
group and the esteem in which it is held are strongly 
linked. material wealth is often considered to be a marker 
of esteem – groups that are doing well for themselves 
materially tend to be held in high esteem, as we shall see 
elsewhere (Chapter 14). Conversely, when a group is well 
regarded, it tends to prosper: its members are unlikely to 
be discriminated against and ingroup members show 
greater loyalty to it and a willingness to make sacrifices in 
its interests (van Vugt and Hart, 2004).

to pay a short-term price in order to accrue later 
rewards? What benefits might flow from ensuring the 
group gets more resources than the outgroup, even if it 
gets less resources in absolute terms?

true? Can you briefly outline a way in which it could 
be tested?
Stereotyping, prejudice and discrimination in different 
intergroup contexts
Relations between groups have, historically, taken different forms depending on 
the nature of the groups involved. For example, slavery has been a feature of race 
relations, but not relations between people of different age groups. Genocide has 
featured in relationships between religious as well as racial groups, but not in 
gender relations. Although the theories we have reviewed thus far in this chapter 
were not designed with any particular groups in mind, they nonetheless have 
much to say about the experiences of the many different groups who have 
confronted grievous forms of prejudice through the ages. But, additional theoret-
ical assumptions are sometimes required to understand the particular forms of 
prejudice and discrimination that different types of groups have encountered. We 
now consider relations between gender, age and racial groups as examples.
Gender
It is possible to argue that gender is the most important of all intergroup contexts. 
All over the world, men and women are constantly interacting. Gender is always 
apparent, not only by virtue of the physical differences between men and women 
but also because of the different ways in which they speak, dress and act. The very 
survival of the species depends on successful cooperation between men and women, 
but relationships between these two groups are not always cooperative. And as 
both men and women – but especially women – recognize, women have generally 
been at the wrong end of the ‘battle of the sexes’ (Sutton, Douglas, Wilkin et al., 

493
Intergroup relations
2008). Worldwide, women are socially and economically disadvantaged relative to 
men on indices such as earnings, career and educational opportunities, freedom of 
dress and movement, victimization in sexual and domestic violence, and represen-
tation in political, business and religious leadership (e.g., López-Claros and Zahidi, 
2005; Rhode, 1989). Nonetheless, they are generally seen as nicer than men, and are 
liked more, in a ‘women are wonderful’ stereotype (Eagly and Mladinic, 1994; see 
also Fiske, Cuddy, Glick and Xu, 2002). This apparent paradox – that women seem 
to experience less prejudice but more discrimination than men – is possibly the 
most distinctive feature of gender relations. It also illustrates that prejudice and 
discrimination do not always go hand in hand. 
One reason that relations between gender groups differ from relations between 
other social groups is that they have been deeply affected by sexism. Sexism refers 
to beliefs about differences between men and women and the roles they perform. 
Typically, sexism not only includes beliefs about differences in the way men and 
women think, feel and act, but also includes beliefs about the appropriateness of 
these differences. Put differently, sexism does not just tell you how the genders 
differ, it also purports to tell you how they ought to differ. Thus, sexism, like, say, 
right-wing authoritarianism, is an ideology. However, sexism differs from the 
ideologies we have considered thus far, in that it is often rooted in ancient religious 
and cultural practices (Harris, 1991; Rhode, 1989; Stockard and Johnson, 1992), 
and is specific to relationships between genders, even if it is often correlated with 
other ideologies and social practices that have nothing directly to do with gender 
(e.g., Pratto et al., 1994). 
There are different types of sexism, and much has been learned in recent years 
since the advent of the distinction between hostile and benevolent sexism, first 
made by Glick and Fiske (1996): 
 o Hostile sexism is a negative view of women characterized by the belief that they 
pose a threat to men’s position. 
 o Benevolent sexism is an apparently positive view of women, in which they are 
seen as necessary for men’s happiness, and, indeed, superior to men in many 
ways, especially morally (e.g., as more kind and pure). 
 o Ambivalent sexism contains both positive and negative attitudes to women.
Research on ambivalent sexism has shown that the distinction between benevolent 
and hostile sexism holds across many countries in many parts of the globe. Indeed, 
Glick and 30 colleagues (2000) ran a large-scale global survey and found that, 
across countries, hostile and benevolent sexism were generally positively corre-
lated, but nonetheless emerged as separate variables when factor analyses were 
performed. In most countries, men endorsed hostile sexism more than women. 
Across countries, hostile but not benevolent sexism predicted negative stereotypes 
of women, suggesting that these variables are indeed functionally different. 
However, differences between men and women on benevolent sexism seemed to 
differ across countries. As shown in Figure 11.8, in countries where gender 
inequalities are especially strong according to UN figures, women endorsed

differences between 
men and women, the 
roles they perform, and 
beliefs concerning the 
appropriateness of these 
differences.

benevolent sexism more strongly than men (e.g., Cuba, South Africa and Turkey). 
In countries where these gender inequalities are not so pronounced, men and 
women endorsed benevolent sexism roughly as equally (e.g., Australia and the 
Netherlands). This finding seems to support a key prediction of social identity 
theory – where status differences between genders are marked and stable, members 
of low status groups will engage in social creativity – that is, preserving a positive 
self-image by identifying and giving weight to dimensions on which they are 
superior to the high status group (Jetten and Spears, 2003; Oakes, Haslam and 
Turner, 1994).

As you’ve been reading this, you may be wondering, what’s the problem? 
Surely benevolent sexism is a quaint, perhaps old-fashioned, but ultimately harm-
less view of women? Alternatively, you may be thinking, ‘it is sexism – so what’s 
‘benevolent’ about it?’ As Glick and Fiske (1996 p. 491) noted: ‘some readers 
might view … benevolent sexism as oxymoronic’. It is important to note that they 
were arguing that benevolent sexism is associated with overtly positive responses 
to women, not that it is good for them. Indeed, for Glick and Fiske (1996; Glick et 
al., 2000), benevolent sexism tends to justify women’s consignment to a subordi-
nate role. For example, if women are kind, pure and sensitive, they are presumably 
well equipped for nurturing roles and poorly equipped for the kinds of competi-
tive and status-driven roles that are so richly rewarded. Thus, benevolent sexism 
tends to justify the status quo. As a result, women who endorse this ideology are 
less likely to try to change it. 
A study conducted by Jost and Kay (2005) supports precisely this contention. 
Moving away from the correlational approach of Glick and his colleagues (e.g., 
Glick and Fiske, 1996; Glick et al., 2000), Jost and Kay adopted a priming proce-
dure in which participants were experimentally presented with benevolent sexism 
items from Glick and Fiske’s (1996) scale – specifically, items 8, 13, 19 and 22 (see 
Try it yourself later). Participants either indicated their agreement with each item 
or rated how ambiguously each item was worded (results showed that it did not

matter which). This exposure to benevolent sexism caused women 
to endorse the status quo, indicating that society is fair, more than 
women who had been exposed to positive, but non-stereotypical 
statements about women (e.g., ‘Men are less creative than 
women’). In fact, women exposed to benevolent sexism endorsed 
the status quo as much as men, whereas they normally endorse it 
much less than men. Exposure to hostile sexism had no effects on 
women’s endorsement of the status quo. As Jost and Kay (2005, 
p. 504) note, their findings suggest that ‘when it comes to main-
taining inequality, honey is typically more effective than vinegar’. 
For their part, men were unaffected by exposure to any kind of sexism, tending to 
view the social status quo as being fine as it is (see also Sutton et al., 2008). 
Exploring further Society routinely exposes people, and young children, to benevolent stereotypes of women. 
You may be interested to read about the ongoing debate concerning sexism in Disney films. of course, the female 
characters in these films are generally pleasant, but they are also – almost without exception – subordinate to male 
characters. as an exercise, choose a Disney film (e.g., Cinderella, The Little Mermaid) and think about what happens 
in the film. What was the main female character like? What happened to her? What relationships did she have with 
the male characters? Knowing what you now know about sexism, are these depictions sexist? What might the 
consequences of these depictions be? 
Research has revealed several other pitfalls of benevolent sexism for women. 
Moya, Glick, Exposito et al. (2007) found that Spanish women who were high in 
benevolent sexism found it more acceptable for husbands to give orders to their 
wives, as long as these orders had a protective justification (e.g., ‘you should not 
drive, because it will stress you out’). Dardenne, Dumont and Bollier (2007) found 
that a sample of Belgian women became literally less intelligent immediately after 
being primed with benevolent sexism. Sutton, Douglas and McClellan (2011) 
found that benevolent sexists in the UK were more likely to indicate that they 
would refuse to serve pregnant women alcohol, cheese or even tap water. These 
results suggested that benevolent sexism may underlie the cultural impulse to 
restrict the freedoms of pregnant women in ways that may not be warranted by 
medical evidence. Abrams, Viki, Masser and Bohner (2003) found that individuals 
(whether men or women) who were higher in benevolent sexism were more likely 
to blame the victims of acquaintance or ‘date’ rape. Viki and Abrams (2002) found 
that benevolent sexists were especially likely to blame married women who were 
raped while on a date with another man, that is, whose infidelity violated positive, 
so-called ‘benevolent’ expectations of women. Rudman and Glick (2001) found 
that female job candidates who present themselves as highly agentic – ambitious 
and competent, for example – may suffer a backlash as a result of defying the kind, 
generous, nurturing stereotypes associated with benevolent sexism. As a result, 
such women tend to be rated as less warm and less likely to work well in a team.

Time to reflect the united Nations Development Programme annually reports statistics that provide an index of 
gender equality across the world. the gender empowerment measure (gem) examines the degree to which women 
have achieved positions of status and power within a nation (e.g., women in government, managers of businesses). 
In cross-national comparisons, glick et al. (2000, 2004) have shown that average benevolent sexism scores are 
negatively associated with the gem. the same occurs for hostile sexism, and both effects are present irrespective of 
respondent gender. So, it seems that women have less status and power in nations where people score highest in 
benevolent and hostile sexism. Data from glick et al. (2000) are presented in Figure 11.10 below. these are the 
results from 19 countries. although not all significant, the correlations are high, suggesting that approximately  
15–25 per cent of the variance is shared by sexism and objective gender inequality. Why do you think these 
relationships are so strong? What are the functions of hostile and benevolent sexism in maintaining, or reducing 
resistance to, inequality?
Try it yourself Below are some example items from glick and Fiske’s ambivalent sexism inventory. this contains 
11 items measuring benevolent sexism, and 11 for hostile sexism. the response scale for each item runs from  
1 = disagree strongly, to 7 = agree strongly. 
three items measuring benevolent sexism are:
1 a good woman should be set on a pedestal by her man.
2 In a disaster, women ought not necessarily to be rescued before men (this item is reverse scored). 
3 Women, as compared to men, tend to have a more refined sense of culture and good taste.
three items measuring hostile sexism are:  
1 once a woman gets a man to commit to her, she usually tries to put him on a tight leash.
2 Feminists are not seeking for women to have more power than men.
3 Women are too easily offended.
the ambivalent sexism inventory is available online (and is included in an appendix to glick and Fiske, 1996). locate 
it, and complete it. Calculate your mean hostile and benevolent sexism score. remember to reverse score the 
appropriate items where disagreement indicates higher sexism. In these cases, change 5 to 0, 4 to 1, 3 to 2, 2 to 3, 1 
to 4, and 0 to 5. Find means for hostile and benevolent sexism from at least one study. How do your scores compare?

Intergroup relations
As well as providing ideas about how the genders ought to differ, sexism also 
suggests why they differ. Like the racist ideologies we are about to encounter, 
sexism tends to appeal to biology to explain the characteristics of each gender, 
especially women. In Western thought, women have long been associated with 
nature and their behaviour attributed to bodily rather than purely mental 
processes, in contrast to men who are seen to have transcended their biology 
through the powers of reason and self-control. For example, the term hysteria 
(from the Greek, hystera, meaning womb), used to describe an extreme and irra-
tional state of emotional distress, originated from the ancient idea that madness in 
women was caused by the womb wandering about the body. 
Arguably, this ancient idea has a modern equivalent in exaggerated popular 
stereotypes about the influence of the menstrual cycle on women’s mood (Chrisler 
and Levy, 1990; Walker, 1995). Stereotypically, women are irascible and irrational 
for a few days prior to menstruation. This ‘premenstrual syndrome’ has even been 
used as a legal defence by women facing criminal charges (Chrisler, 2002). But for 
women, the downside of this notion of premenstrual syndrome is that they are 
likely to be taken less seriously. And it even shapes the way that women see them-
selves, as McFarlane, Martin and Williams (1988) have shown. In their diary study, 
women were asked to report on their mood for 70 days. These concurrent, daily 
reports did not show a significant deterioration in mood at that time of the month. 
However, at the end of the study, they were again asked to indicate what their 
moods had been over that time – without access to their concurrent reports. These 
retrospective estimates were not terribly accurate; in particular, women wrongly 
‘remembered’ being in a negative mood at the premenstrual phase of their monthly 
cycle. As we saw in Chapter 2, our self-knowledge, especially when we are making 
retrospective guesses about our thoughts, feelings and intentions, is not very reli-
able (Nisbett and Wilson, 1977; Ericsson and Simon, 1980). In place of reliable 
memories, we make inferences about ourselves based partly on our expectations – 
in this case, stereotypes about the menstrual cycle. In memory, therefore, stereo-
types have the capacity to seem to be accurate even when they are not. 
The sexist tendency to equate women with their bodies is also apparent in an 
extensive research literature on objectification. Objectification occurs when women 
are viewed as if their bodies are capable of representing them (Frederickson and 
Roberts, 1997), that is, as if women were their bodies. One manifestation of objec-
tification is ‘face-ism’: the tendency for women’s faces to be less prominent than 
men’s, and their bodies to be more prominent than men’s, on TV and in print 
media like newspapers and magazines (Archer, Iritani, Kimes and Barrios, 1983). 
Objectification of women changes the way they are evaluated and treated. In a 
striking example, Heflick and Goldenberg (2009) had participants write about 
Sarah Palin, John McCain’s running mate in the US presidential election of 2008. 
Participants were asked to describe either the positive and negative traits of ‘this 
person’ (in the control condition), or ‘this person’s appearance’ (in the experi-
mental, ‘objectification’ condition). Participants led to objectify Sarah Palin in this

way rated her as less competent and even reported a reduced intention to vote for 
the McCain/Palin combination in the coming election. This manipulation had a 
similar effect on ratings of the Hollywood actress Angelina Jolie, although she is 
not (at least, not yet) running for office – so Heflick and Goldenberg did not ask 
participants whether they intended to vote for her. 
Question to consider reread question 2 at the start of the chapter. Despite mark’s positive feeling about women, 
is he less likely or more likely to discriminate against them?
According to objectification theory (Fredrickson and Roberts, 1997), objectifi-
cation not only changes the way women are treated by others, but also changes 
the way women themselves think, feel and act. Women frequently experience 
objectification, for example when they are the object of a prolonged gaze by a 
male observer, or are flattered on the basis of their appearance. This chronic expe-
rience can cause them to engage in self-objectification, that is, to monitor their 
appearance, anticipating that this will be a major factor in how they are seen by 
others (Calogero, 2004). Although men engage in self-objectification too (e.g., 
Strelan and Hargreaves, 2005), the sexist tendency to objectify women more often 
means that women are likely to do it more often, and with more adverse conse-
quences. For example, Fredrickson, Roberts, Noll et al. (1998) had women try on 
either a swimsuit or a sweater. As predicted, wearing the swimsuit elicited higher 
levels of self-objectification, with the result that women in this experimental 
condition experienced more shame about their appearance, restrained their eating, 
and did worse on a test of mathematical ability. Self-objectification has also been 
linked to the severity of striving for thinness among young women in eating 
disorder clinics (Calogero, Davis and Thompson, 2005). A study of English 
university students found that when women were primed with benevolent sexism, 
they became more accepting of the status quo between men and women, which in 
turn caused them to objectify themselves (Calogero and Jost, 2011).
Race and ethnicity
Relations between people of different racial or ethnic backgrounds have always 
had a different nature from gender relations. In part, this is no doubt because 
racial or ethnic groups are not necessarily in contact with each other, and do not 
need to cooperate with each other on the same daily basis as the gender groups. 
Not only is contact between different racial groups less frequent but it is often 
more recent, historically speaking. Indeed, much of the early contact between 
different ethnicities and racial groups arose from exploration, invasion and mass 
migration, which tends to bring people into the kinds of competition for 
resources described by realistic group conflict theory (Sherif, 1966). Ethnocen-
trism in its strongest sense is often a feature at least in the early history of rela-
tions between racial and ethnic groups. Those who look, dress and act very 
differently, who have different ideas about what is morally acceptable and what is

disgusting, and who speak an unintelligible language may seem less than fully 
human (Sumner, 1906). 
This dehumanization of racial groups tends to legitimate even the worst actions 
against them (e.g., Haslam, 2006). Thus, relations between racial groups have been 
characterized by outbursts of organized, large-scale violence seen elsewhere only 
in some conflicts between religious groups. You are probably familiar with the 
expressions ‘ethnic cleansing’, where attempts are made to forcibly move whole 
peoples from an area, and ‘genocide’, where attempts are made to eliminate them 
altogether. Slavery has also been a recurrent feature of relations between racial 
groups. You may have read H.G. Wells’ famous 1898 novel, The War of the 
Worlds, or seen a film adaptation of it. Quite astoundingly, the following appears 
on the first page of Chapter 1: 
And before we judge them [the Martians] too harshly, we must remember what 
ruthless and utter destruction our own species has wrought, not only upon 
animals, such as the vanished Bison and the Dodo, but upon its own inferior 
races. The Tasmanians, in spite of their human likeness, were entirely swept out 
of existence in a war of extermination waged by European immigrants, in the 
space of fifty years. Are we such apostles of mercy as to complain if the 
Martians warred in the same spirit? [emphasis added]
Even in this book, which was meant as a critical parody of British colonialism, we 
see voiced the quintessentially racist idea that some races are superior to others, 
and more striking, that some races are not fully human, possessing only a ‘human 
likeness’. And we see documented the fact that these people, seen not fully as 
people, were exterminated by European settlers – the last ‘full-blooded’ member 
of this group died in 1876 (Ryan, 1996). 
Historically, racism has been underpinned by the belief that not only are people 
of different races different, especially in terms of their intelligence, but that these 
differences are underpinned by genetic differences. For a long time, researchers, 
especially in Britain and Europe, looked for physiological differences between 
racial groups, for example in cranial capacity, and even the number of folds in the 
cortex of the brain (see Gould, 1996). These tests proved inconclusive, but the 
hold of the eugenics movement, which advocated that differences in intelligence 
and behaviour between groups (such as the races and the social classes), over the 
popular imagination remained strong – nowhere more so than in Nazi Germany, 
where it contributed to the policy of extermination of Jews, Gypsies, people with 
learning disabilities and some Slavic people. 
For much of the 20th century, over much of the world, overtly racist ideas and 
policies predominated. In some countries, most famously South Africa and many 
US states, there was a policy of forced racial segregation, where people of colour 
were excluded from restaurants, public facilities and even residential areas. In 
other countries, such as Australia, people were excluded from the vote on the basis 
of race, and mixed-race children were forcibly removed from indigenous families 

500
Belonging
in order to be raised in a white cultural milieu. Such racist policies are at odds with 
the egalitarianism that these same countries’ laws and even constitutions have been 
based upon. If ‘all men are created equal’, as stated in the 1776 US Declaration of 
Independence, then how is race-based slavery and segregation possible? This 
ambivalence and tension has always been a defining feature of racism (Allport, 
1954; Walker, 2001). One way of resolving the tension is to suppress, inhibit or 
control racism (Devine, 1989). There is extensive evidence that people who do not 
consciously endorse or possess racist attitudes nonetheless display unconscious or 
implicit racism.
Another way to resolve the tension between egalitarianism and racism is to find 
a way to justify distinctly unegalitarian policies – as did the racist, eugenic notions 
that some races are inferior to others and therefore worthy of inferior opportuni-
ties. As we shall see in Chapter 14, there are a number of social psychological 
mechanisms available to human beings in order to help then justify behaviours, 
beliefs and social systems that conflict with their cherished notions of what is right 
and wrong (e.g., Jost and Banaji, 1994; Lerner, 1980). 
One can also resolve the tension between racism and fair-mindedness in the 
way that one talks. As we saw in Chapter 1, discourse analysis (Billig, 1997; 
Potter, 1996) is a qualitative research method designed precisely to illuminate 
how people use talk strategically. Potter and Wetherell (1987) employed this 
method in their study of racism in the context of relationships between Pakeha 
(people descended from European settlers) and Ma¯ori (the indigenous people) in 
New Zealand. In the following extracts, a Pakeha interviewee expresses rather 
egalitarian, anti-racist sentiments: 
 o and [in my class] I had this child who said ‘What would happen if you got a 
whole lot of Maoris living next to you?’ and I said to him ‘that’s a very racist 
remark and I don’t like it’
 o I don’t like them [racist jokes] I don’t find them amusing
 o The extended family situation’s brilliant, they’ve got this lovely idea that a 
child born out of wedlock would have to be the best sort of child because it 
was obviously born in love … I think their way with children is wonderful 
… They’ve got a lot to show us I think.
But, interviewees did not always express such noble views, as shown in the 
following extracts:
 o the ridiculous thing is that, if you really want to be nasty about it, and go 
back, um, the Europeans really did take over New Zealand shore, and I mean 
that Maoris killed off the Morioris beforehand, I mean it wasn’t exactly their 
land to start with, I mean it’s a bit ridiculous. I think we bend over back-
wards a bit too much. [The notion that Maoris killed off an earlier indigenous 
population of Morioris on mainland New Zealand is a fiction, once taught in 
New Zealand schools, that seemed to justify European colonialism. In fact, 
Morioris were based on the distant Chatham Islands.]

501
Intergroup relations
 o And this is the part that I think is wrong with, a bit wrong with the Maoris 
as well there, the problems they have, they’re not willing, I mean it’s a Euro-
pean society here and they’ve got to learn to get in and work, otherwise it’s, I 
mean you can’t tell them to go back to where they came from.
Now, you may be surprised to learn that all the extracts presented here – the first 
few anti-racist ones and the latter two more apparently racist and defensive 
quotes – were taken from the same interviewee, in the same interview. This illus-
trates how inconsistent people will be as they embed potentially racist statements 
in anti-racist talk, allowing them to express racist views while defusing the charge 
that they are racist. 
Recent experimental work has similarly shown that people express more 
prejudice after moral credentialing – that is, having an opportunity to demonstrate 
that they are not prejudiced. In one study, Monin and Miller (2001) gave Princ-
eton undergraduates a chance to select a candidate for a position in a hypothetical 
consulting firm. When the standout candidate was either a Black person or a 
woman, Monin and Miller (2001) reasoned, then participants had been given a 
chance to ‘hire’ this person and thus to display their moral credentials, ‘proving’ 
that they are not prejudiced. Later, these participants, compared to control 
participants whose ‘star’ candidate had not been a minority group member, were 
less likely to hire a fictional Black applicant for a job as a police officer. Having 
‘proved’ themselves to be non-prejudiced, participants appeared to be more 
willing to discriminate against another Black candidate. It is notable that partici-
pants were more willing to discriminate against Black candidates for the police 
position after hiring a Black or a female candidate. They seemed to feel that 
hiring any sort of minority candidate is sufficient to show that their later hiring 
decision is not racist. In a subsequent study, Monin and Miller showed that 
people were more willing to reject a minority job applicant even when their 
earlier decision to hire a minority candidate for a different position was unknown 
to others. Apparently, moral credentialing has this effect because people want to 
prove to themselves, rather than to other people, that they are not prejudiced 
(see also Harber, Stafford and Kennedy, 2010). 
The kind of moral unease about racism illustrated by Monin and Miller’s (2001) 
findings appears to be one of its defining features. It is also entirely consistent 
with theories of modern racism (Dovidio and Gaertner, 1998). According to this 
theory, the growing unacceptability of racism has not caused racism to disappear 
but has driven it underground. In place of ‘old’, overt racism, a modern, subtle 
variant has appeared, in which racism is expressed in forms and in situations that 
make it appear to be socially acceptable and consistent with the prevailing sense of 
fair play. For example, instead of advocating that all ethnic migrants should be 
deported to their countries of origin, modern racists will agree that ethnic migrants 
who have committed serious crimes should be deported. This qualifier deflects the 
charge that their opinion is racially motivated (Meertens and Pettigrew, 1997). 
Ironically, from their review of research, Gaertner and Dovidio (1986) conclude

values and racist impulses to be aversive – causing them to avoid interactions with 
Black people for fear of experiencing discomfort and unease. This aversive racism 
can be seen as an example of the intergroup anxiety that people experience in their 
dealings with outgroup members. 
Question to consider Now, reread question 3 at the start of the chapter. Why do you think racism is so difficult to 
eradicate? this is a good question to consider before reading Chapter 12.
Exploring further think of some films you have seen that have involved the theme of racism. Have more films 
dealt with old-fashioned racism than modern racism or vice versa? Why do you think this might be?
Age
Ageism is a widespread form of prejudice and older people face many forms of 
negative stereotyping, discrimination and ridicule (Age Concern, 2006; Nelson, 
2002). It is an intriguing form of prejudice because the perceiver is bound to 
become a member of the target group – barring some disaster (Nelson, 2005). This 
allows it to be self-fulfilling in a unique way: it can negatively affect the ageing 
process itself, causing the perceiver to be weaker, more infirm and more dependent 
as they age. Thus, if a perceiver is ageist, they are ultimately more likely to become 
a prototypical example of their negative view of the elderly. This hypothesis may 
seem like a long shot, but the evidence in favour of it is surprisingly abundant and 
compelling. Ageism may be as bad for you as smoking. Combating ageism may 
not only be a matter of social justice but also public health. 
Consider a study by Levy, Zonderman, Slade and Ferrucci (2009). These 
researchers drew on data from the Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging, which 
started in 1968 and tracks a large and renewing sample of adults from adulthood 
into old age. Levy et al. considered only those respondents who were less than 50 
years old at baseline, who had not experienced a cardiovascular event (e.g., heart 
attack or stroke), and who completed a measure of ageist stereotypes as they 
entered the study. This widely used, reliable and valid measure included items 
such as ‘old people are helpless’ (Tuckman and Lorge, 1953). Results were startling 
in their support for the ‘ageism is bad for you’ hypothesis. Levy et al. compared 
the health outcomes of participants who entered the study endorsing ageist stere-
otypes more than average with those who endorsed them less than average. Fully 
25 per cent of the first group, who endorsed ageist stereotypes, turned out to have 
a cardiovascular event in the subsequent 30 years. In comparison, only 13 per cent 
of the second group of participants, who did not endorse these stereotypes as 
strongly, experienced a cardiovascular event. If you are thinking like an experi-
mentalist, you may have been thinking: ‘Probably the people who originally

endorsed ageist stereotypes of ageing were different, perhaps less educated and 
less healthy, from those who did not endorse them.’ Of course, correlation does 
not entail causation. But Levy et al. (2009) controlled for these and a host of other 
factors, including age, body mass index and family history, obtaining the same 
results (see Figure 11.11).

although levy et al. (2009) controlled carefully for third 
causes, and employed a longitudinal design, it is difficult to 
infer that ageist stereotypes really caused the 
cardiovascular events because the study was correlational. 
Can you think of experimental approaches to this problem? 
In other words, how can you try to affect people’s 
stereotypes about ageing and the aged, in order to 
observe effects of these stereotypes on health outcomes? 
an effective manipulation might not just be a way to 
test theory; it might also be an extremely helpful 
intervention that, if widely implemented, could improve 
the health and wellbeing of thousands, if not millions,  
of people.

• You will need an experimental group. 
• What ethical and scientific issues are raised by attempts 
to increase participants’ ageism; and decrease

• What are the most effective ways to get stereotypes  
to change? 
Have a go at doing this yourself. You might want to 
consult Chapter 13 on the reduction and mitigation of 
prejudice, and Chapter 6 on persuasion techniques. What 
are the best dependent measures? Is it necessary to 
measure cardiovascular events, or are you also interested 
in measures such as blood pressure, exercise behaviours, 
dietary behaviours and so on? What can your choice of 
measures tell you about why ageism is linked to negative 
health outcomes?

SOCIAl PSYCHOlOgY IN THE rEAl WOrlD 
Homophobia
thus far, we have talked about sexism, ageism and racism 
as specific forms of prejudice. another significant form is 
prejudice against homosexuals. Homophobia has not 
always been a problem in society. Indeed, the romans 
were tolerant of different sexual orientations and other 
civilizations and cultures have been permissive of non-
heterosexual orientations over the years. However, few 
would disagree that prejudice against homosexuals is 
pervasive in many societies today – one reason perhaps 
being the rise of Christianity and the development of 
different norms regarding sexual behaviour. It is also 
interesting to note that it was as late as 1973 that the 
american Psychiatric association removed homosexuality 
as a psychiatric disorder from its listing. 
of course, attitudes have generally become more 
positive over the years but significant anti-gay sentiments 
still exist. For example, the recent introduction of the Civil 
Partnership act in 2004, which gave same-sex couples in 
the uK the rights and responsibilities identical to civil 
marriage, met with general opposition from the public – 86 
per cent of respondents to a Northern Ireland consultation 
document on the Civil Partnership act opposed the 
introduction of the act (office of law reform, 2004).
It is important to consider some of the antecedents and 
consequences of anti-gay prejudice.

Vicious cycles in intergroup relations
In Chapter 12, we will deal at length with how relations between groups can be 
improved, reducing unwanted phenomena such as prejudice, discrimination and 
intergroup conflict. We think it is useful to close this chapter by considering why 
these phenomena are so intractable, in order to highlight just how immense and 
important is the challenge that confronts social psychologists. Of particular 
interest is something you may have noticed while reading through this chapter: 
stereotyping, prejudice, discrimination and other undesirable intergroup dynamics 
appear to have a remarkable ability to perpetuate themselves. 
Vicious cycles in social cognition
One way stereotypes and prejudice perpetuate themselves is by affecting – we 
might even say ‘hijacking’ – the way people process social information. Stereo-
types can affect the way we think so that the information we are receiving from

Intergroup relations
the environment seems to confirm them, even when it does not, objectively 
speaking. In Chapter 3, we covered the correspondence bias – the tendency to infer 
that a person who acts a certain way must possess the trait that is associated with 
that behaviour (as opposed to seeing the behaviour as a product of the situation, 
for example). One manifestation of this bias is spontaneous trait inference, shown 
when people take longer to correctly decide they have not seen a trait (e.g., ‘kind’) 
in a set of sentences presented earlier (e.g., ‘Leigh donated money to charity’). 
Wigboldus, Dijksterhuis and van Knippenberg (2003) showed that when sentences 
convey stereotype-inconsistent information (e.g., ‘the girl hits the saleswoman’), 
people made much weaker spontaneous trait inferences than when the sentences 
were consistent with stereotypes. In a subtle but pervasive way, it seems, stereo-
types perpetuate themselves by causing us to attribute stereotype-consistent traits 
to people more than stereotype-inconsistent traits. Dunning and Sherman (1997) 
went so far as to describe stereotypes as ‘inferential prisons’, which constrain our 
perceptions so that we are condemned to experiencing a world in which even 
completely unwarranted stereotypes seem to be true.
Researchers have also uncovered a rather cruel way in which prejudice can gain 
a kind of self-perpetuating momentum. Groups who experience prejudice, 
discrimination and oppression come, over time, to be associated with prejudice, 
discrimination and oppression. Uhlmann, Brescoll and Paluck (2006) used the 
Implicit Association Test (IAT) and showed that African Americans were mentally 
associated (by a sample of White Americans) with oppression (the words were 
oppressed, brutalized, dominant and powerful). The more strongly participants 
associated African Americans with oppression, the more implicit prejudice they 
showed against this group on another IAT. Uhlmann et al. followed up this corre-
lational study with experiments in which participants viewed pairings of the name 
of a fictional group, the ‘Noffians’, with words related to either oppression or 
privilege. Participants who had learned to associate Noffians with oppression 
were, as a result, more prejudiced towards them in a later test of implicit prejudice. 
Even people who appraise the negative experiences of a group in an egalitarian 
way – seeing them as symptoms of oppression – may, as a result, associate this 
group with oppression and thus unconsciously devalue them. As the saying goes, 
mud sticks. In a supreme irony, thinking that mud has been thrown unfairly at a 
group may foster prejudice towards that group. 
Exploring further Srull and Wyer (1979) reported perhaps the most famous demonstration of the power of 
stereotypes to influence social judgement, in ways that make them ‘seem’ true. using google Scholar or a similar 
database, find the full reference for this article, and obtain a list of the many papers that have since cited it. many of 
these papers will investigate how stereotypes distort people’s thinking in ways that make incoming information 
appear to ‘fit’ or support the stereotype. Identify three different ways in which this happens. 
Vicious cycles in social emotion
Just as people experience emotions such as fear and anger towards each other, 
group members can experience emotions towards other groups (Smith, 1993, 
Spontaneous trait inference 
People sometimes 
spontaneously infer others’ 
traits from their behaviour 
without intending to, or being 
aware.

1999). According to intergroup emotions theory (Mackie and Smith, 2002), the 
precise nature of these intergroup emotions will depend on factors such as the 
relative power and status of the groups. For example, Mackie, Devos and Smith 
(2000) found that when people perceive their ingroup to be powerful, they are 
more likely to experience anger towards an outgroup. On the other hand, if they 
perceive their group to be relatively weak, they are more likely to fear outgroups. 
People who experience anger rather than fear are more likely to take offensive 
actions against an outgroup, whereas those who experience fear rather than anger 
are more likely to attempt to avoid the outgroup. Intergroup emotions have the 
capacity to dampen intergroup aggression and conflict. For example, Maitner, 
Mackie and Smith (2007) found that the experience of intergroup guilt about acts 
of aggression by the ingroup reduced support for further acts of aggression. 
However, they also have the capacity to play an important role in irrational 
cycles of tit-for-tat aggression between groups. In the same studies, Maitner et al. 
found that the experience of satisfaction after acts of aggression by the ingroup led 
to increased support for further acts of aggression. Further, it does not require 
great powers of deduction to realize that from the perspective of the victim group, 
the experience of anger in response to being attacked is likely to motivate retalia-
tory aggression, especially if the victim group feels powerful enough to strike back 
(Mackie et al., 2000).
Exploring further using google Scholar, PsycINFo or Web of Science, find papers on ‘collective guilt’ (social 
psychological work on this topic began with Doosje, Branscombe, Spears and manstead, 1998). a quick survey of the 
abstracts of these papers should give you a feel for the helpful and harmful role this intergroup emotion can play.
Anxiety is one of the most important types of intergroup emotion and also 
plays a crucial role in perpetuating unhealthy, conflictual relationships between 
groups. Its role in intergroup relations was highlighted by Stephan and Stephan’s 
(1985) intergroup anxiety model. This model was originally formulated with racial 
or ethnic groups in mind, but could in principle be applied to many other inter-
group contexts as well. According to this model, people expect negative outcomes 
when they interact with, or even anticipate interacting with, outgroup members. 
Specifically, they may expect:
1 Negative psychological consequences, such as feeling embarrassed or uncom-
fortable
2 Negative behavioural consequences, such as being exploited or dominated by 
outgroup members
3 Negative evaluations by outgroup members, for example a White person may fear 
being seen as racist, a Black person may fear confirming widespread prejudices
4 Negative evaluations by ingroup members, for example being seen as disloyal 
or too friendly to the outgroup.
These negative expectations represent threats, and these threats elicit anxiety. The 
threats and hence anxiety may be exaggerated when people have strongly stereo-

outgroups.

507
Intergroup relations
typic views of the outgroup (Allen, 1996), perceive that the outgroup poses a threat 
to the ingroup (Stephan, Boniecki, Ybarra et al., 2002), lack knowledge about the 
outgroup (Britt, Boniecki, Vescio et al., 1996) or have little previous experience of 
interaction with its members (Stephan, Diaz-Loving and Duran, 2000). 
Anxiety is not ‘all bad’ and may have some positive effects on intergroup rela-
tions. For example, it may cause people to attend closely and with interest to their 
interaction partner. The fear of being seen as racist may sometimes motivate 
people to act in a more friendly, positive way (Harber, 1998; Littleford, 
O’Dougherty Wright and Sayoc-Parial, 2005). However, anxiety is not ‘all good’ 
either and can be expected to have several negative effects on the interaction and 
its downstream consequences. 
For one thing, even when anxiety may have motivated people to behave in a 
friendly, positive way, the effort is stressful (Ickes, 1984), reduces their enjoyment 
of the interaction (Shelton, 2003), and may impair their effectiveness as communi-
cators (Stephan and Stephan, 1985). Anxiety may also energize and heighten any 
negative thoughts and feelings towards the outgroup (Stephan, Stephan and 
Gudykunst, 1999). Also, as we have seen, when members of minority groups fear 
confirming negative stereotypes of their group, their task performance tends to 
suffer (Steele and Aronson, 1995). Another downside of anxiety is that it can inter-
fere with self-control (Easterbrook, 1959; Stephan and Stephan, 1985). Alas, as we 
shall see in Chapter 12, some kind of self-control seems essential in the reduction 
of prejudice. Thus, the anxiety arising from interactions with outgroup members 
may make people unable to stop themselves from exhibiting prejudiced responses. 
To test this last idea, Amodio (2009) had White American participants talk 
about race with either a White or a Black interviewer (see also Lambert, Millimet 
and Slottje, 2003). Later, their saliva was sampled to obtain a measure of cortisol, a 
hormone associated with anxiety. Also, they completed a measure of race bias 
known as the weapon identification task (Payne, 2001). In each trial of this task, 
participants were presented with a Black or White face on a computer screen, then 
a picture of a gun or a tool. The task was to identify the object. In this task, pair-
ings of Black faces with weapons and White faces with tools are stereotype 
congruent; pairings of White faces with guns and Black faces with tools are stere-
otype incongruent. Given a congruent pairing, both automatic race bias and the 
motivation to control prejudice should lead participants to respond accurately. 
That is, they should correctly identify guns after seeing them primed with Black 
faces, and correctly identify tools after White faces. In contrast, incongruent pair-
ings cause controlled processing and automatic race bias to pull participants in 
opposite directions. For example, an automatic race bias might lead participants to 
wrongly indicate ‘gun’ after they have seen the pairing of a Black face with a tool. 
On the other hand, the motivation to control prejudice will tend to lead them to 
correctly indicate ‘tool’. 
Results showed that among participants who had been in the interracial inter-
view, increased levels of cortisol were indeed associated with reduced ability to 
control race bias. In contrast, cortisol did not affect performance in the weapon

identification task by participants who had dealt with a same-race (White) inter-
viewer. This finding supports the predictions of the intergroup anxiety model – 
anxiety, as indexed by cortisol, would appear to disrupt attempts to control biased 
responding. On the other hand, self-reported anxiety was not related to race bias. 
Thus, the physiological rather than the phenomenological aspects of intergroup 
anxiety appear to be most responsible for the disruption of people’s ability to 
control race bias. 
Time to reflect Do social neuroscience methods such as those used by amodio (2009) enable researchers to pin 
down a causal pathway where self-report measures fail? What are some of their weaknesses? 
Vicious cycles in social behaviour
Stereotypes need not be false. As you have been reading about stereotypes, preju-
dice and so on, it may have occurred to you that many stereotypes contain at least 
a kernel of truth. Indeed, research shows that they do. For example, the ‘women 
are wonderful’ stereotype may overstate the case, but studies do show that, on 
average, and in many (but not all) situations, women are somewhat more consci-
entious, less egocentric and more nurturing (e.g., Andreoni and Vesterlund, 2001; 
Feingold, 1994; Hoffman, 1977). These findings are not necessarily comfortable to 
contemplate. But, putting aside our political preferences, it is of vital importance 
for any scientist to be honest, with others and with themselves, about what the 
data show. Equally, it is important to examine why stereotypes sometimes contain 
a kernel of truth. Do gender or racial groups sometimes behave differently because 
of innate biological differences? Or do political and social psychological factors 
contribute to these differences (Campbell, 1967)? 
This is where the self-perpetuating properties of stereotypes are so important. 
Stereotypes have the power to change people’s behaviour in ways that seem to 
verify the stereotypes. One of the most powerful, striking and cruelly poetic cases 
of this power has been uncovered by research on the stereotype threat phenomenon 
(Steele, 1997). Ironically, when people’s performance is being tested, and they 
belong to a group that is stereotypically not expected to do well, they become 
anxious that they may confirm the stereotype. This anxiety interferes with their 
performance – causing them to fall precisely into the trap that they were so anxious 
to avoid. Thus, girls do worse in maths tests when they are made aware of the 
stereotype that girls are not as good at maths as boys (Keller, 2002; Spencer, Steele 
and Quinn, 1999; Steele, 1997). Black students do worse in scholastic aptitude and 
IQ tests when they are made aware of their supposed academic inferiority (Steele 
and Aronson, 1995). Older adults’ cognitive performance declines when reminded 
of ageist stereotypes (Abrams, Eller and Bryant, 2006), and the scholastic aptitude 
of students from poorer backgrounds declines when they are reminded of their 
socioeconomic background (Croizet and Claire, 1998). 
Stereotype threat Fear of 
being judged in terms of a 
stereotype and negatively 
fulfilling the stereotype. 
Stereotype threat leads to 
poorer performance on a task.

509
Intergroup relations
Just as stereotypes stand in the way of success for groups that are not expected 
to do well, they give a boost to groups that are expected to succeed. Thus, if indi-
viduals are made aware of a negatively stereotyped outgroup, their own test 
performance is actually enhanced, in a phenomenon that Walton and Cohen 
(2003) called stereotype lift. Further, as we have seen in Chapter 3, racist stereotypes 
about the alleged hostility of Black people (in the USA) have the potential to 
become self-fulfilling, because the activation of these stereotypes can cause people 
to act in a more hostile way, with the result that the people they interact with 
become more hostile (Bargh, Chen and Burrows, 1996). Further, people are 
conscious of the ‘backlash’ that is often experienced by people who buck stereo-
typical expectations, such as women who act in assertive and fearless ways 
(Rudman and Fairchild, 2004). This consciousness motivates people to conform to 
expectations, and so appear to confirm the stereotype. Thus women may portray 
fearfulness, and men fearlessness, because they want to be evaluated positively 
(e.g., Sutton and Farrall, 2005, 2008). 
Question to consider Now that you know about stereotype threat, reread question 4 at the start of the chapter. 
Jot down some reasons for the women’s behaviour. How did it work in each specific situation? What were the 
stereotypes and what impaired the women’s performance?
Chapter summary
Stereotype lift the reverse of 
stereotype threat. Fulfilling a 
positive stereotype leads to 
enhanced performance. 
In this chapter we have covered the bases of stereotypes, 
prejudice and discrimination. We have considered how these 
phenomena play out in relations between different groups, 
such as those differentiated on the basis of gender, race, 
religion and age. Finally, we have considered some of the 
vicious cycles in intergroup relations. Specifically, we have 
learned that:
• Stereotypes are simplified, but widely shared beliefs about 
the characteristics of groups and their members. Prejudice is 
a negative affective reaction to a group. Discrimination is the 
negative treatment of a person based on their group 
membership.
• the cognitive miser approach argues that people use 
stereotypes as shortcuts because they have limited memory 
resources to deal with everyone as an individual. also, 
stereotypes and prejudice may stem from faults in human 
thought and memory. 
• typically, people have less contact with minorities and 
outgroups than they do with majorities and their own 
groups. Because they have fewer opportunities to learn 
about such groups, this leads to an overestimation of the 
undesirable behaviours of minority group members. this is 
called the illusory correlation bias.
• the mere act of categorization can also distort the way 
people think about members of groups and the groups 
themselves. Placing objects into categories changes the 
way they are perceived, such that differences between 
categories are maximized and differences within categories 
are minimized.
• However, stereotypes stem not only from human 
limitations, but also from what people want to think. 
Dogmatic individuals (those with the tendency to be able to 
tolerate mutually inconsistent beliefs by isolating them 
from each other in memory) tend to be more prejudiced. 
likewise, people with high personal need for structure 
(indicating a preference for structure in most situations) and 
those high in need for cognitive closure (indicating a desire 
for definitive answers to questions) stereotype more. 
• Ideology also plays a part in stereotyping and prejudice. 
Further, people who possess an authoritarian personality 
and score high in right wing-authoritarianism tend to be 
more prejudiced.

510
Belonging
• Social dominance orientation (a preference for hierarchy and 
for one’s own group to be dominant) is associated with 
higher levels of stereotyping.
• two theories of intergroup relations – social identity theory 
and realistic group conflict theory – differ from the cognitive, 
personality and ideological approaches to the study of 
intergroup relations by focusing on processes that occur at 
the group level.
• Stereotyping, prejudice and discrimination occur in a vast 
array of intergroup contexts. one example is gender, where 
attitudes towards women contain ambivalent (hostile and 
benevolent) stereotypes. Further, women are objectified, or 
viewed as if their bodies are capable of representing them. 
Such objectification changes the way that women think, 
feel and act. 
• another example is race, where members of different racial 
groups are often dehumanized, or stripped of their human 
qualities. Such dehumanization legitimizes negative actions 
towards racial groups. there are different forms of racism 
and more traditional (hostile) racism has given way to a 
more subtle (modern) racism. 
• ageism is a widespread form of prejudice and older people 
face many forms of negative stereotyping, discrimination 
and ridicule. another example of prejudice that we 
discussed in this chapter is homophobia.
• We then discussed some of the vicious cycles in intergroup 
relations. Specifically, stereotypes can affect the way people 
think so that the information people receive from the 
environment seems to confirm them, even when it does not. 
People experience strong emotions towards others groups 
and, in particular, anxiety plays a crucial role in perpetuating 
unhealthy, conflictual relationships between groups. 
• Stereotypes may not always be false and may contain a 
‘kernel of truth’. Such stereotypes are powerful and the 
process of stereotype threat, awareness of a stereotype, 
and anxiety about fulfilling the stereotype may lead to 
impaired performance. 
We now know about the factors that contribute to 
stereotyping, prejudice and discrimination. We also know about 
the consequences of these important social psychological 
processes of intergroup relations. In Chapter 12, we focus on 
improving intergroup relations. 
Essay questions
at the beginning of the chapter, we asked you to consider  
these questions:
1 You may have heard of various homophobic hate groups 
that have a strong presence on the internet. members of 
these groups stage homophobic demonstrations and, in one 
specific case, picketed memorials for soldiers killed in the 
Iraq War, taking the view that these soldiers’ deaths are a 
form of punishment against the uS for its tolerance of 
homosexuality. Which of the social psychological processes 
described in this chapter may be contributing to the 
behaviour of these groups? 
2 mark, a manager for a large bank, genuinely feels very warm 
towards women. He thinks that men should cherish, protect 
and revere women. Do mark’s attitudes mean that he is less 
likely than other male managers to discriminate against 
women, for example to oversee unequal pay? 
3 many countries invest a lot of effort and money into 
counteracting racism. Why is racism so resistant to 
eradication? 
4 What common principle might be illustrated by these two 
scenarios? 1. Suriya is in her sixties but has not aged well 
and has health problems one would normally associate with 
someone significantly older. 2. Danni does quite well in 
mathematics in class but gets a poor mark whenever she sits 
a mathematics exam. 
Having read this chapter, these questions could also be framed 
as the following essay questions, which you can attempt in 
preparation for your examinations:
1 Discuss some of the social psychological processes that can 
explain the behaviour of hate groups.
2 overview the theory of ambivalent sexism and, referring to 
research evidence, describe some of the consequences of 
hostile and benevolent sexism.
3 With reference to social psychological theory and research, 
explain how racism is resistant to eradication. What do we 
know about prejudice reduction from social psychology?
4 overview the research to date on stereotype threat and 
stereotype lift phenomena. What are the consequences of 
each and when are each more likely to occur?

Applying social psychology
understanding and improving boys’ academic 
achievement
In this chapter we reviewed quite a lot of literature on sexist 
stereotypes and gender role attitudes, with particular attention 
to their negative consequences for women. However, women 
are by no means alone in being adversely affected by social 
understandings of gender. 
one context in which men and boys appear to be suffering is 
in educational achievement. there is overwhelming evidence 
that, globally, girls outperform boys academically. girls have 
narrowed, closed and reversed the historical gender gap in 
academic performance within school settings (e.g., DfeS, 2007; 
van Houtte, 2004; West, 1999). 
one such study was conducted by the organisation for 
economic Co-operation and Development (oeCD, 2010). under 
the auspices of its Programme for International Student 
assessment, it assessed the educational outcomes of 15-year-
old children in the 34 oeCD countries, including the uSa, 
Canada, australia, the uK, France, Spain, germany and Italy, as 
well as 41 partner countries. although boys outperformed girls 
in maths by an average of 12 points, girls significantly 
outperformed boys in reading in every participating country by 
an average of 39 points, which is the equivalent of an average 
school year’s progress (oeCD, 2010). thus, boys’ advantage in 
maths is considerably smaller than their disadvantage in other 
core subjects.
Further, in some countries, there is evidence that boys are 
disadvantaged even in maths and science. For example, 
throughout elementary, middle and high school in the uSa, girls 
obtain higher grades than boys in all major subjects, including 
maths and science (aauW educational Foundation, 1998; 

512
Belonging
Pomerantz, altermatt and Saxon, 2002). Similarly, recent 
statistics from england’s Department for education (Dfe) reveal 
that girls outperformed boys on reading, writing, maths and 
science at Key Stage 1 (age 5–7) through to gCSe stage (age 16), 
where 58.8 per cent of girls achieved five or more a*–C grades 
(including english and maths) compared to 51.1 per cent of boys 
(Dfe, 2010a, 2010b). 
In addition to obtaining higher grades, research suggests 
that girls receive more referrals to gifted programmes (Bianco, 
Harris, garrison-Wade and leech, 2011), are more self-
disciplined, and overall progress better scholastically than boys 
(Duckworth and Seligman, 2006; mathews, morrison and 
Ponitz, 2009). girls also go on to outnumber men in university 
degree programmes. For example, women outnumber men 
58:42 in uK universities (Higher education Statistics agency, 
2011), and 57:43 in the uSa (Snyder and Dillow, 2011). In 
contrast, boys represent the majority of referrals to special 
education services, as well as suspensions and expulsions from 
school (Dfe, 2009, 2011). 
Imagine that you have been asked to provide psychological 
consultancy on the causes and possible remedies of this 
problem. How can boys’ performance be improved, without 
negatively impacting on girls’ performance? In particular, your 
brief is to suggest causes and solutions that have not yet been 
identified in the literature. 
there are many possible solutions to this problem, but let us 
focus on one that is directly relevant to some of the important 
social psychological principles we have been discussing in this 
chapter. In particular, we discussed how stereotypes can be self-
fulfilling. recall that stereotype threat – the anxiety that one’s 
performance will be viewed through the lens of adverse 
stereotypes – undermines the academic performance of Black 
people, older adults, children from poorer economic 
backgrounds. although these are all relatively disadvantaged or 
even stigmatized groups, stereotype threat can also affect 
relatively high status groups. this applies when such groups are 
the target of specific stereotypes suggesting they are inferior at 
a particular task. For example, White participants underperform 
in athletics when the task is said to reflect natural athletic 
ability (Stone, lynch, Sjomeling and Darley, 1999). also, men 
underperform on social sensitivity and affective processing 
tasks when they are reminded that women outperform them in 
this domain (Koenig and eagly, 2005; leyens, Desert, Croizet 
and Darcis, 2000). 
We saw in the chapter that stereotype threat has been 
successfully applied to study women and girls’ performance in 
maths and science, which is held by traditional and probably 
outdated stereotypes to be inferior (e.g., Keller, 2002; Spencer, 
Steele and Quinn, 1999; Steele, 1997). Has it been applied to 
study boys’ academic performance? Is this a promising 
approach, and how could it be achieved? If stereotype threat 
does contribute to boys’ academic underachievement, how 
could this inform interventions to boost their performance?
1 Search the literature: Has this idea been tested before? 
How many articles can you find that have examined how 
stereotype threat can worsen women and girls’ academic 
performance? How many have examined stereotype threat 
effects on men and boys’ academic performance? Is stereotype 
threat really a new possible explanation of boys’ academic 
underachievement? (remember your clients have asked you 
to explore causes and remedies that have not been 
investigated before.) 
2 Search the literature: Are boys stereotypically inferior to 
girls academically?
Stereotype threat happens when people feel that their 
performance might be viewed through the lens of unfavourable 
stereotypes. thus, in order for stereotype threat to afflict boys, it 
is necessary for there to be a stereotype that boys are in some 
sense academically inferior to girls. Is there any evidence of 
such a stereotype in the research literature? Bear in mind that 
evidence that boys are actually underachieving does not count. 
What you need is evidence that boys are perceived to be 
underachieving. 
3 Search the literature: Are boys aware of such a stereotype? 
Not only stereotypes but also meta-stereotypes are required for 
stereotype threat to occur. this is because people must be 
aware that they may be viewed through the lens of 
unfavourable stereotypes. 
4 Sketch studies 
If you did not find studies in questions 1, 2, or 3, then think 
about how you might design studies to address these ‘blind 
spots’ in knowledge. take a look at the coverage of 
stereotypes, meta-stereotypes and stereotype threat in the 
chapter, and look up some articles to see how the studies are 
done. outline each of your studies in no more than 150 words, 
plus references. 
5 Think about interventions 
assuming stereotype threat does turn out to contribute to boys’ 
academic performance, how might stereotype threat be 
reduced? Can you find studies that reduce or eliminate 
stereotype threat effects for other groups, and borrow their 
ideas? or are there other interventions in this chapter that you 
can adapt to reduce stereotyping, meta-stereotyping and  
other forms of intergroup anxiety that you can adapt?  
outline your ideas in no more than 300 words, plus references 
where appropriate.

Intergroup relations
Blind spot in social psychology
The contested nature of social identity
a great deal of research and theory on intergroup relations 
assumes that individuals are identified with social groups; that is, 
they are placed into social categories by themselves and others. 
this is seen as a necessary condition for stereotyping, prejudice, 
discrimination and other forms of intergroup relations. once we 
see ourselves as a member of a social group, it is then possible 
for us to identify ourselves with that group, to act in its interests, 
and, where it seems necessary, to act against the interests of 
other groups. therefore, most studies on intergroup relations 
create contexts in which it is clear and uncontroversial, to all 
involved, what groups participants belong and do not belong to.
However, as we suggested at the start of this chapter, real 
life may not always be like that. People may actively resist 
categorization – into a particular group, or into any group. 
People may not agree on categorization. I may see myself as a 
feminist, but some of my friends may see me as a sexist. as we 
know, people often preface apparently racist marks with classic 
disclaimers such as ‘I’m not a racist, but …’, as if they were aware 
of, and attempting to obstruct, the potential that they would be 
categorized as a racist. many, if not all, social categorizations 
tend to be rather subjective in nature and are socially 
constructed by processes of enactment, display and negotiation 
that sometimes do, and sometimes do not, result in consensus 
(Dixon and Durrheim, 2000; Howard, 2000). We would like you 
to draw on your intuition and life experience to think about this 
issue and come up with some suggested answers to the 
following questions. the more suggestions you can think of, the 
better. then, it is possible to search the literature to see which 
of your ideas have been acknowledged in the literature and 
which remain relatively unexplored. 
1 We each belong, or can be seen to belong, to a huge number 
of social categories. on a sheet of paper, list 10 categories to 
which you would see yourself as belonging. Start each line 
with ‘I am a …’ or ‘I am an …’. on a second sheet of paper, 
write 10 statements about yourself that describe some of 
your qualities as you see them. Start each line with ‘I am’ 
and do not place yourself into categories with ‘a’ or ‘an’. 
Which task took you longer? Which made you feel more 
anxious? Finally, can you think of any categorical boxes that 
you think others might want to place you into, but with 
which you would you not necessarily agree. Start each line 
with ‘others may see me as a/an …’. What is it that makes 
you uncomfortable about being categorized in these ways?
2 Why are people sometimes reluctant to accept 
categorization? You might want to think about categories 
such as ‘english’, ‘British’, ‘White’, ‘Black’, ‘smokers’, 
‘bisexuals’, ‘feminists’, or ‘left-wingers’. 
3 Imagine that you are a participant in a minimal group 
paradigm experiment. Participants in this experiment are 
assigned, at random, either to the ‘blue group’ or the ‘red 
group’. Participants are told that ‘blue groupers’ are tolerant, 
whereas ‘red groupers’ are intolerant. Do you see yourself as 
a tolerant or intolerant person? Which categorization would 
you therefore be more willing to accept? and which you 
would you be more likely to reject? Why? 
4 Imagine that Said is the son of North african migrants to the 
Netherlands. He is devoutly Islamic, a big supporter of 
Feyernoord Football Club, and talks at length to like-minded 
friends about the corrupt and tyrannical foreign and 
domestic policies of Western nations and how these might 
be violently overturned. What possible social categories 
could Said be categorized as, based on this minimal 
information? What kinds of people might want to place him 
into each category and, in doing so, what might they be 
trying to do, consciously or unconsciously?
Student project 
Marginalizing prejudice 
Brad Carron-arthur studied as an 
honours student at the 
australian National university, 
under the supervision of 
Professor michael Platow. His 
research explores a newly 
identified type of prejudice 
called ‘marginalizing prejudice’. 
My topic and aims
my project investigated the psychological processes 
underpinning the phenomenon of marginalizing prejudice. 
marginalizing prejudice occurs when a person treats a fellow 
ingroup member as if they are included in the group, but are 
not truly ‘in’ because they lack some essential feature of the 
group. this feature could be a particular ethnicity or place of 
birth. For example, a person might be considered australian 
because they are a citizen, but not fully australian since they are 

514
Belonging
not of european ancestry, or were not born in australia. In 
contrast to traditional conceptions of prejudice, such as old-
fashioned racism, which simply involve discriminatory 
exclusion, marginalizing prejudice is a dualistic prejudice – one 
in which inclusion and group membership are promised with 
one hand and at the same time withdrawn by the other.
marginalizing prejudice is a relatively understudied 
phenomenon and the aim of my project was to identify some 
broad factors that may provide a plausible explanation for its 
occurrence. one cognitive factor (a framing effect) and one 
motivational factor (a manipulation of procedural fairness) 
were chosen for this task. 
When my supervisor first described marginalizing prejudice 
to me, I was particularly excited by the thought of working on 
something that no one else had studied before. research really 
grabs you when you can conceptualize a phenomenon and you 
get the sense that it really exists, only you don’t have any proof 
so it is up to you to demonstrate its existence through 
empirical research.
My methods
Participants in this study were anglo australian-born citizens. 
their task was to judge whether to include 24 targets within the 
group ‘australians’. the targets, who were all australian citizens, 
varied systematically on four factors (ethnicity, country of birth, 
gender and intellectual prestige of occupation). to judge their 
inclusion in the group, participants were asked to indicate 
which targets they would like to see included in an australian 
citizens’ assembly. two variables were manipulated in the 
study. Some of the participants were instructed to select those 
targets they would like to see included, while others were 
instructed to select the targets who they would exclude. 
orthogonal to this, some of the participants were told that the 
citizens’ assembly would be instrumental in making changes to 
the nation, while others were told that its opinion would be 
heard but would not be instrumental. 
My findings and their implications
theoretically, inclusion and exclusion judgements should yield 
complimentary sets. that is, those who were not included 
should also have been excluded. Psychologically, however, this 
does not necessarily hold true. the main finding of this 
experiment was that some of the applicants were often neither 
included when participants were asked who they would 
include and nor were they excluded when participants were 
asked who they would exclude. that is, they are not truly ‘in’ 
the group but they are not ‘out’ either. In effect, they are being 
subjected to marginalizing prejudice. 
Interestingly, this finding was also dependent upon the 
other experimental factors. For example, citizens who were not 
born in australia were simply ‘out’ rather than being 
marginalized, but only if they were also non-anglo and the 
assembly was non-instrumental – this reflects overt 
discrimination (e.g., old-fashioned racism). 
this research has important theoretical implications. 
Previous conceptions of groups have held that group 
boundaries are either permeable or impermeable to new group 
members, but not both. this study demonstrates that it is 
possible for a person’s psychological representation of a group 
to be simultaneously open to new group members in the sense 
that they are not actively excluded, but nor are they truly 
accepted in the sense that they are not actively included either. 
they are relegated to the margins of the group.
the project was presented by my supervisor at the Society 
of australasian Social Psychologists conference in adelaide in 
april 2012.
My journey
after completing my honours in psychology, I took the 
following year off to run across australia (5,000 km) Forrest 
gump style. It took four months and I raised over $35,000 for 
mental health research. at the time of writing, I have just 
returned home and I am currently applying for a scholarship to 
undertake postgraduate study overseas in a similar field to the 
current research.
In order to take the step up to conducting research of the 
scope that is expected in your honours year, it is necessary to 
engage with the literature on the theoretical level. reading 
vast amounts of literature and reducing it into your own study is 
incredibly daunting if you can’t see the (theoretical) wood for 
the trees (details). this is a skill that my supervisor helped foster 
in me and I am glad because I now see the ideas behind the 
words in anything I deal with rather than getting bogged down 
in the details.
My advice
In the lead-up to your thesis, read widely, not just what you are 
required to. Fascination, inspiration and novel solutions to 
problems puzzling psychologists come from a breadth of 
knowledge and experience. once you have picked a topic that 
most interests you, read with depth. read everything in that 
area until you even understand the full historical progression of 
research and where everything fits into the field. You will see all 
the gaps in understanding. Coming up with solutions will take 
both breadth and depth of understanding.

As we saw in Chapter 11, relations between social groups are fraught with prob-
lems. But social groups cannot live in perfect isolation. Trade, invasion, coloniza-
tion and immigration have always been features of human life that have brought 
people from different tribal, ethnic and cultural groups together. As recent centu-
ries and decades have passed, economic, technological and political forces have 
accelerated this process. At the time of writing, Marseille, France’s second city, 
was predicted to become the first Muslim-majority city in Western Europe 
(Dickey, 2012). However, this prediction overlooks the fact that until the territo-
ries of modern Spain were recovered by Christian armies, cities such as Cordoba 
and Granada were inhabited mostly by Muslims. Faced with the historical inevita-
bility, the present fact and the future increase of diversity, how are we to avoid 
conflict and inequality between social groups? More positively, how can social 
groups be encouraged to join forces, to work together to solve common problems, 
and even to capitalize on their diversity (Crisp and Meleady, 2012; Crisp and 
Turner, 2011)? 
In this chapter we consider the major strategies for improving intergroup rela-
tions that have been considered by social psychologists:
1 Change the way individuals from different groups are treated. This is the 
essence of techniques known as tokenism and affirmative action. 
2 Increase the extent and manage the nature of contact between individuals from 
different groups. 
3 Change individuals’ perceptions of the boundaries between groups and the 
meaning of group differences. This is the basic idea behind categorization- and 
cooperation-based approaches. 
4 Change the values and ideologies that underpin intergroup relations, so that 
diversity and tolerance are embraced as positive values, and prejudice is seen as 
a bad thing. 
5 Encourage strategies for reducing intergroup conflict at a political level by the 
joint action of different groups. This involves truth and reconciliation, inter-
group apologies and reparations, negotiations and treaties. 
6 Collective action by the disadvantaged groups in society to improve their posi-
tion. This strategy does not assume that increases in goodwill and cooperation 
are always required for improvements in intergroup relations, but focuses on 
the elimination of inequality and disadvantage. 
Tokenism and affirmative action 
The causes of social inequality are often much too old, deep-rooted and large 
scale for any individual, organization or even government to hope to deal with 
in one fell swoop. However, it is within everyone’s power to make small gestures 
that are of help to individual members of disadvantaged groups. For example, if 
you are an employer taking on a new staff member, perhaps you can try to give 
a job to a minority group member ahead of other, similarly qualified applicants.

Improving intergroup relations
If you are a teacher, perhaps you can 
make a special attempt and go out of 
your way to give more pleasant, less 
critical feedback to minority group 
members (Harber, 1998). This process 
of favouring a member of a minority 
group over a member of a majority 
group in isolated episodes is the 
essence of tokenism (see Figure 12.1). 
On the surface, this may look like a 
promising attempt to reduce prejudice. 
After all, a person is consciously going 
out of their way to provide a positive 
outcome for someone within a minority group. However, one problem with 
tokenism is that it can be used, consciously or unconsciously, as a means to 
disguise one’s prejudices. This makes it easier, psychologically, to engage in subse-
quent acts of discrimination. This point was made clearly in studies conducted by 
Monin and Miller (2001). In these studies, participants who were given the oppor-
tunity to hire well-qualified Black applicants for fictional jobs were more willing 
to discriminate against women or Black people in subsequent hiring decisions, 
having already ‘proved’ that they are not prejudiced. Interestingly, it did not 
matter whether participants thought anybody else knew they had previously hired 
a Black job applicant. Participants who had ‘proved’ to themselves, but no one 
else, that they were not prejudiced were more willing later to discriminate when it 
seemed legitimate to do so. These findings suggest that tokenism can be motivated 
purely by the desire for people to prove to themselves that they are decent, fair-
minded and unprejudiced people. Thus we can see tokenism as an example of the 
desire to self-enhance, as we explored in more depth in Chapter 2. This effect is 
known as moral credentialing (Monin and Miller, 2001). If an individual displays a 
good track record of egalitarianism, they can establish an unconscious ethical or 
moral licence that actually increases their likelihood of making less egalitarian 
decisions later (Figure 12.2). Recently, Kouchaki (2011) demonstrated that the 
moral credentialing effect occurs even when people have observed a member of 
their own ingroup being egalitarian, that is, they display a vicarious moral licensing 
effect. Here, participants who had seen a member of their own ingroup displaying 
non-prejudiced hiring behaviour were more likely to reject another minority 
group member (in this case, an African American man) for a job that was stereo-
typically suited for majority members.

Applying
tokenism is clear – people are perceived as less competent by their colleagues if it 
is known that they were hired as part of an affirmative action policy (Heilman, 
Block and Lucas, 1992). Such policies, which include employment ‘quotas’ where 
organizations are required to hire a certain percentage of minority members, are 
forms of tokenism because they involve granting positive outcomes to minority 
members. Employment quotas are now illegal in many countries. Such policies 
may also mean that organizations fail to take more important steps towards equal 
opportunities. Having ‘made the effort’, leaders of organizations may feel there is 
nothing else that needs to be done. Findings also suggest that another downside 
of affirmative action policies is that the employees suffer reduced self-esteem, 
motivation and job satisfaction if they perceive they are ‘tokens’, who have been 
hired because of their group membership such as their race or gender (Chacko, 
1982). Clearly, tokenism can be harmful both to the organization, which may 
ultimately fail to be progressive, and its employees, who ironically feel worse 
because of the organization’s efforts. 
Another harmful face of tokenism may be close to home for you as a student in 
higher education. Studies have shown that teachers may mark identical work more 
highly and make fewer critical comments if they believe it is by a Black as opposed 
to a White student (Fajardo, 1985; Harber, 1998). At first glance, this so-called 
positive feedback bias may not look like a big problem; surely, positive feedback is 
nice? However, the problem is that bias can harm minority students’ education. 
Specifically, it can cause students to misdirect their efforts at improvement 
(Massey, Scott and Dornbusch, 1975), and it can demoralize them, by suggesting 
that praise reflects their race rather than their achievement (Crocker, Voelkl, Testa 
and Major, 1991). The risk, then, is that students feel patronized and are deprived 
of the critical feedback that all students need to realize their potential. 
Like Monin and Miller (2001), Harber, Stafford and Kennedy (2010) were 
interested in whether this form of tokenism was motivated by teachers’ desire to 
prove to themselves, or to others, that they are not prejudiced. They gave White 
trainee teachers the opportunity to give feedback on a poorly written essay that 
had supposedly been authored by either a Black or a White student. The partici-
pants then provided feedback to the supposed student. Crucially, participants 
privately completed one of three versions of the Social Issues Survey as employed 
by Monin and Miller (2001). In an ‘egalitarian boost’ condition designed to rein-
force pro-minority views, participants were asked to rate their agreement on items 
such as ‘Government offices should be closed on Martin Luther King Day’. An 
‘egalitarian threat’ condition, designed to express opinions that are unfavourable 
to minorities, included items such as ‘It should be legal for businesses to open on 
Martin Luther King Day’. A neutral condition focused on shopping. As predicted, 
participants in the Black writer/threat condition rated the essay more favourably, 
recommended the writer take less time to develop their skills, and provided more 
favourable comments. Participants in the Black writer/boost condition provided 
feedback that was no different to feedback provided by participants in the White 
writer conditions, both of which were unaffected by the threat/boost manipula-

tion (see Figure 12.3). Thus, it seems that 
the positive feedback bias is probably a 
reflection of teachers’ desire to prove their 
moral credentials. 
In light of these research findings, it is 
clear why tokenism is so often discussed as a 
harmful strategy. It is widely considered this 
way even by the authors of social psycho-
logical textbooks. For example, Baron and 
Byrne (2003, p. 215) wrote that ‘tokenism is 
one subtle form of discrimination worth 
preventing’. However, tokenism need not 
be seen as an entirely bad thing. Tokenism 
may sometimes be Machiavellian or deceitful, but, equally, it may sometimes be a 
noble attempt to counteract inequality and injustice. Whatever the motives for 
tokenism, it may reduce prejudice by placing competent minority members in 
prestigious, powerful positions, and so ‘proving’ that their group membership 
does not make them incompetent or untrustworthy (Plant, Devine, Cox et al., 
2009: see the Social psychology in the real world box on Barack Obama’s elec-
tion). Further, although affirmative action policies can reduce the self-esteem of 
those who are explicitly told that is why they got their job, it can actually increase 
the self-esteem of minority group members who are not told this. Under these 
conditions, ‘tokens’ are free to think that they got where they are because of their 
own achievements (Unzueta, Guttierez and Ghavami, 2010). 
Perhaps a more extreme version of tokenism can be seen in what is known as 
reverse discrimination. For people who harbour negative attitudes towards particular 
minority groups, openly displaying pro-minority behaviour, or public behaviour 
that favours the minority, is a way to deflect accusations of prejudice. Dutton and 
Lake (1973) asked 40 White male and female undergraduate students, who had 
rated themselves as unprejudiced and in favour of equality, to participate in a study 
ostensibly about involuntary control of autonomic behaviour. Participants in a 
high-threat condition were led to believe that they had displayed physiological 
responses indicative of prejudice, while participants in a low-threat condition were 
led to believe that their response indicated no prejudice. Following the manipula-
tion, participants were approached by either a Black or White confederate who was 
begging for money. As the researchers predicted, the Black confederate received 
more money from participants in the high-threat condition than from participants 
in the low-threat condition. Contributions to the White confederate were unaf-
fected by the threat manipulation. Like other forms of tokenism, it is argued that 
reverse discrimination can have positive short-term effects but, ultimately, the 
practice is not good for minority groups. There is no evidence that the practice 
improves the attitudes of the person displaying the reverse discrimination. It may 
seem to be egalitarian, but may mask underlying prejudice or ambivalence about 
groups (Gaertner and Dovidio, 1986), and provide people with the moral creden-

Applying
intergroup contact
We, the authors of this book, are old enough to remember ‘the Troubles’ – a long 
period of violence in Northern Ireland – which, with tragic monotony, featured in 
the evening news while we were growing up. Riots, shootings, bombings and kill-
ings took place largely between the nationalist community (who sought the inde-
pendence of Northern Ireland from the UK and generally envisage a merger with 
the Irish Republic, and were largely from the Roman Catholic minority), and the 
unionist community (who sought for Northern Ireland to remain part of the UK, 
and were largely from the Protestant majority). The violence also spilled over 
these group boundaries and involved security forces from the British mainland, 
and terrorist attacks on English cities including London, Birmingham and 
Manchester, largely by the Irish Republican Army (IRA). With great political will, 
the flames of this conflict were doused by a period of negotiations culminating in 
the ‘Good Friday Agreement’ of 1998. 
Although sporadic violence and a good deal of prejudice and mistrust survive, 
this extraordinary reduction in violence deserves to be seen as one of the most 
inspirational examples of intergroup reconciliation in living memory. A striking 
feature of this peace process is that it was not associated with increasing contact 
between the nationalist and unionist communities. On the contrary, schools and 
housing developments became increasingly segregated throughout the Troubles 
and this process of segregation appears to continue. In some parts of the country 
and in Belfast in particular, the communities became starkly divided by so-called 
‘peace walls’ that were designed as a means of defusing sectarian tensions. Most 
are still standing today (see Figure 12.4). In recent years, ‘peace gates’ have been 
opened to allow nationalist and unionist communities to 
interact more freely and to foster greater links between them, 
but the barriers set up during the Troubles are taking a while 
to come down completely. 
Does this mean that contact between groups is harmful, 
and that to resolve conflict, groups should be separated? 
Certainly, some degree of contact is necessary for groups to 
engage in conflict with each other – no matter how much 
groups may hate each other, the range of harms they can do 
to each other is limited if they cannot reach each other. Some 
thinkers have regarded contact between groups as fuel to the 
flames of hatred, suspicion, fear and resentment (e.g., Baker, 
1934). But across hundreds of studies, the evidence suggests 
that contact between groups tends to douse, rather than fuel, the fires of inter-
group conflict (Pettigrew and Tropp, 2006, 2008). Perhaps more accurately, 
research shows that contact generally has the effect of reducing the prejudice that 
individuals feel towards outgroups. Indeed, contact has become the most studied 
method for reducing prejudice.

Improving intergroup relations
When and why does contact work? 
Research on when and why contact works was placed on a systematic theoretical 
foundation, since labelled contact theory, by Allport (1954) in his book The Nature 
of Prejudice. (As an aside, contact theory was only one of the foundational insights 
on prejudice to be published in that book; others included early statements about 
dehumanization, moral exclusion, and the importance of categorization for preju-
dice. It remains recommended reading for those planning higher study in social 
psychology.) The basic tenet of contact theory is that bringing members of 
opposing groups together should improve intergroup relations, and reduce preju-
dice and discrimination. For Allport, contact between groups could reduce preju-
dice, especially if four optimal conditions were met: 
1 Equality of status: The groups must have roughly equal status in the situation. 
If group members do not meet as equals, there is every chance that the inequality 
will be exploited by those who find themselves at an advantage and resented by 
everybody else. Of course, groups often differ in status, as is the case in 
Northern Ireland where the unionist community is larger and more affluent 
than the nationalist community, and this inequality can erode the value of a 
contact situation (Brewer and Kramer, 1985; Foster and Finchilescu, 1986). 
Thankfully, however, research suggests that most important is the perception of 
equal status in the situation (Cohen, 1982; Riordan and Ruggiero, 1980; 
Robinson and Preston, 1976). As long as this condition is met, the contact situ-
ation can be successful, even if the groups went into the situation with different 
levels of status (Patchen, 1982; Schofield and Eurich-Fulcer, 2001). 
2 Common goals: The people in the situation should be working towards a goal 
that both groups share. Participation in mixed-race sports teams is a good 
example – whatever the racial background of the players, they share the goal of 
victory for their team (Patchen, 1982), with the effect of reducing racial prejudice. 
3 Intergroup cooperation: The two groups’ pursuit of common goals should be 
based on cooperation, rather than competition, between their members. Recall, 
for instance, the peace-making effect of having boys from the Rattlers and the 
Eagles work together in the Robbers Cave experiment (Sherif et al., [1954]1961) 
(see Chapter 11). 
4 The support of authorities, law or custom: This stamps legitimacy on the contact 
situation, and establishes that acceptance between groups is the norm. As we 
shall soon see, perceived social norms appear to have a strong impact on the 
expression of prejudice (Crandall, Eshleman and O’Brien, 2002). It may be 
especially important in gaining the positive attitudes that may develop between 
individuals to generalize beyond the contact situation, and beyond those people 
who were not personally present in a contact situation – which has been one of 
the defining challenges in research on contact. The importance of the support 
of an authority has been shown in field studies of contact interventions in real-
life settings, such as the military (Landis, Hope and Day, 1984), a credit card 
company (Morrison and Herlihy, 1992) and a church (Parker, 1968).

526
Applying
Pettigrew and Tropp’s (2006) extensive meta-analysis of 515 articles examined 
the effectiveness of contact in the presence and absence of Allport’s (1954) optimal 
conditions. The results confirmed that even when the optimal conditions are not all 
present, contact generally works. Contact reduced prejudice not only between the 
racial and ethnic groups it was originally designed for. It also reduced prejudice 
based on age, disability, mental illness and sexual orientation. These effect sizes are 
not large – contact, as an independent variable, generally explained around 7 per 
cent of the variance in prejudice, as the dependent variable. But they are in the right 
direction, and highly statistically significant, when considered across the studies. 
And in support of Allport’s (1954) contact theory, the effect of contact increased 
when the four optimal conditions were present. The benefits of these optimal 
conditions are clearest when they are together as a package. Thus, it would appear 
that these conditions combine to create the right atmosphere for contact, rather 
than adding up incrementally, increasing the effectiveness of contact one by one. 
So, for example, it may not help to work cooperatively in the pursuit of common 
goals unless groups do this as equals, with the sanction of authority.

What if contact is not possible? 
There is a serious problem that limits the applicability of contact theory to many 
cases of prejudice and intergroup conflict. Specifically, it can be difficult and 
expensive to arrange suitably controlled contact situations. Even if the resources 
are available, groups may live in separate territories, so that meetings can involve 
long or dangerous journeys. Prejudice may be too intense, and the wounds of 
intergroup conflict too fresh and too raw to stage controlled contact between 
groups (Staub, 1996; Stephan and Stephan, 1984). Therefore, researchers have 
investigated ways in which people can benefit from the idea of contact, even when 
they are unable to directly experience it. 
One method of benefiting from contact without directly experiencing it is 
known as the extended contact effect (Wright, Aron, McLaughlin-Volpe and Ropp, 
1997). You have extended contact with an outgroup if you know that one of your 
ingroup friends has good friendships with outgroup members. Wright et al. found 
that people are less prejudiced if their friends have high-quality contact with an 
outgroup, even if their own contact with the outgroup is limited. Their findings 
were replicated in Northern Ireland by Paolini, Hewstone, Cairns and Voci 
(2004). Thus, Catholics were less prejudiced towards Protestants if they knew that

Improving intergroup relations
at least one of their Catholic friends was good friends with at least one Protestant. 
It seems that being able to include the other in the self (Wright, Aron and Tropp, 
2002), or to experience others as themselves, reduces dislike for those others. 
Of course, these studies of extended contact were largely correlational. Having 
friends with people who enjoy excellent contact with an outgroup was associated 
with lower personal levels of prejudice towards the group. This begs the question, 
does having extended contact lead to lower prejudice, or does lower prejudice lead 
to having extended contact? Intuitively, if you have positive attitudes to an 
outgroup, you are more likely to have friends who are also low in prejudice. 
However, there is also good experimental evidence for the extended contact 
hypothesis. For example, Liebkind and McAlister (1999) exposed adolescents to an 
unknown ingroup member who was good friends with an outgroup member, with 
the effect of lowering their prejudice relative to a control group of adolescents. The 
prejudice of British school children towards refugees (Cameron, Rutland, Brown 
and Douch, 2006) and the disabled (Cameron and Rutland, 2006) was reduced by 
implementing intervention techniques derived from the extended contact hypoth-
esis (for further research on the effectiveness of extended contact, see also Islam 
and Hewstone, 1993; Turner, Hewstone, Voci and Vonofakou, 2008).

Another form of indirect contact seems even more ephemeral than the vicarious 
experience of extended contact, but is also showing signs of promise as a weapon 
in the fight against prejudice. Specifically, prejudice may be reduced, at least 
temporarily, by imagining a positive episode of contact with an outgroup member 
(Crisp and Turner, 2009). Imagine, for example, you are on a busy train and you 
get talking to the person sitting next to you about the novel they are reading. You 
end up having a conversation ranging over many topics, from where you live, to 
what your children enjoy doing, sports and films. Time flies and before you know 
it, your train arrives at your stop. If this person is an outgroup member (e.g., 
someone of a different race, religion, age group or sexuality), chances are that 
merely imagining this encounter will make you feel better about their group. This 
is named the imagined contact effect. 
Turner, Crisp and Lambert (2007) asked young British participants to imagine 
this kind of contact with older adults, and heterosexual men to imagine (non-
sexual) contact with gay men. Impressively, none of the participants in these 
studies were able to guess the aims of the experiment, which tends to rule out the 
interpretation that participants were merely responding to demand characteristics.

528
Applying
Further, Turner and Crisp (2010) showed that imagining contact with outgroups 
reduced implicit prejudice, measured on the Implicit Association Test (IAT). 
Although the IAT is not entirely resistant, it is clearly much harder to fake than 
answers to straightforward questions about how prejudiced one is. This is another 
reason, then, to doubt that the effects of imagined contact can be dismissed as a 
mere demand characteristic (for arguments against other alternative interpreta-
tions of the imagined contact effect, see Crisp and Turner, 2009). 
Imagined contact has other subtle and intriguing effects, which suggest the 
promise of this approach. Previous research had shown that older adults are prone 
to stereotype threat effects on intellectual performance – reminded of negative 
stereotypes of the elderly, their performance declines (Abrams, Eller and Bryant, 
2006). Recent research suggests that if older adults imagine positive contact with 
younger people, they are subsequently less susceptible to this stereotype threat 
effect (Abrams, Crisp, Marques et al., 2008). Further, Stathi and Crisp (2008) 
found that majority or mestizo Mexicans who imagined contact with indigenous 
or Amerindian Mexicans were later more prone to projecting their own positive 
traits to the outgroup. For example, a participant who sees themselves as enter-
taining would be more likely to see indigenous Mexicans in the same way, after 
imagining contact with them. This process of projection is likely to reflect a sense 
that the outgroup may not, after all, be so very different from oneself (Ames, 2004; 
Jones, 2004). It is also likely to contribute to a more positive general feeling 
towards the outgroup, that is, less prejudiced (Brown and Hewstone, 2005). 
However, research is yet to test whether prejudice is reduced by projection from 
the self to the outgroup. Further, some recent research (West, Holmes and 
Hewstone, 2011) discovered a complicating factor of imagined outgroup contact. 
Specifically, it revealed that if individuals imagine contact with a threatening or 
challenging group (e.g., schizophrenics), prejudices can be heightened. Imagining 
contact with such a group can amplify pre-existing tensions and negative associa-
tions rather than reduce them. This effect can be reduced, however, if participants 
are asked to integrate positive features into these images.

reservations and unanswered questions 
about contact
It is clear there are many success stories associated with 
intergroup contact. But a number of important criticisms 
have been levelled at contact theory, which leaves 
question marks over its applicability to many settings 
(e.g., Amir, 1965; Forbes, 1997, 2004; Ford, 1986; Hopkins, 
Reicher and Levine, 1997). Many of these criticisms were 
gathered together and eloquently put forward in a review 
by Dixon, Durrheim and tredoux (2005) and we outline 
them here.

Improving intergroup relations
1  Are the conditions for contact too many? 
One of Dixon et al.’s (2005) key criticisms follows from the 
fact that much of theory and research has focused on the 
ideal conditions for contact (e.g., Brewer and Miller, 1984; 
Brown and Zagefka, 2005; Hewstone and Brown, 1986; 
Schofield and eurich-Fulcer, 2001). Of course, this makes 
sense if we want to use research to inform how to 
engineer meetings between group members under 
conditions that can be tightly controlled. But this focus has 
led to two key problems. First, research and theory led to 
the identification of so many conditions that, in the 
colourful words of Stephan (1987, p. 17), intergroup 
contact came to resemble ‘a bag lady who is so 
encumbered by excess baggage she can hardly move’. In 
addition to the four originally proposed by Allport (1954), 
Dixon et al. (2005) list some other ideal conditions for 
contact that have been identified by researchers:
•  Contact should be regular and frequent
•  Contact should occur across a variety of social settings 
and situations
•  Contact should involve interaction with a counter-
stereotypic member of another group
•  Contact should be free of anxiety or other negative 
emotions
•  Contact should involve a balanced ratio of ingroup and 
outgroup members
•  And several more. 
thus, so many conditions are specified that designing the 
‘optimal’ contact situation can be a fiddly and difficult task, 
if one wishes to take them all seriously. there is also a 
suspicion that the growth in the number of supposed 
conditions for when contact works has not been checked 
because social psychologists have not been able to agree 
on a simple or parsimonious theory of why contact works. 
If we know exactly what social psychological mechanisms 
are involved, we presumably do not have to rely on a 
shopping list of conditions. Instead, we are likely to use 
our understanding of the processes involved in contact to 
work out which of a small set of conditions might be 
needed in a particular setting. As it stands, there are 
several competing theories and some are rather complex, 
invoking a range of different emotional and cognitive 
variables (for some of the leading examples of theories of 
contact, see Brown, 1995; Dovidio, Gaertner and 
kawakami, 2003; kenworthy, turner, Hewstone and Voci, 
2005; Pettigrew, 1998). 
In defence of the contact literature – and it should be 
borne in mind that despite their criticisms, Dixon et al. 
(2005) are explicit that they are ‘broadly sympathetic’ (p. 
697) to it, and regard it as ‘one of the most successful 
ideas in the history of social psychology’ (p. 698) – the 
profusion of conditions for contact has been slowed and 
even reversed recently. As we have seen, Pettigrew and 
tropp’s (2006) meta-analysis focused only on Allport’s 
(1954) four original conditions. Further, their analysis 
suggested that these conditions are best considered 
together, as a kind of package, rather than separately. 
Recent work has also brought some theoretical simplicity 
and clarity about why contact works. For example, in a 
second meta-analysis of the literature, Pettigrew and 
tropp (2008) found that the effect of contact on prejudice 
was mediated by two key processes. First, contact 
between groups increases people’s willingness to 
empathize with outgroup members and take their 
perspective (e.g., Aberson and Haag, 2007). Second, 
contact between groups reduces intergroup anxiety, 
especially anxiety about contact itself (e.g., Blascovich, 
Mendes, Hunter et al., 2001; Stephan, Stephan and 
Gudykunst, 1999). Contact also increases knowledge of 
the outgroup, which helps to reduce prejudice, but, 
according to Pettrigrew and tropp’s (2008) meta-analysis, 
to a lesser extent than the changes in intergroup emotion 
(anxiety and empathy) that contact brings. 
2 Are the optimal conditions for contact realistic? 
Let us say that researchers are able to whittle down the 
ideal conditions to a package of four or fewer and that 
theorists are able to agree on why contact reduces 
prejudice. Clearly, this would be progress. However, an 
important question remains. In the majority of studies in 
the intergroup literature, researchers have examined the 
impact of experimental contact situations that have been 
carefully engineered to produce a good outcome. 
However, the vast majority of contact situations occur in 
the much less controlled conditions of real life, where 
members of different groups live close together and go to 
the same places for their work, education and recreation. 
In these conditions, there is no guarantee that the contact 
is of good quality. this requires us to do two things when 
considering the applicability of experimental findings. 
First, we should not automatically generalize to real-
life settings from studies of contact in carefully controlled 
settings, be they in the field or the laboratory. these 
experiments may be a good model for interventions in 

530
Applying
classrooms or community halls, which bring people 
together in a positive and supervised way for a specified 
period. But they may not be a good model for the 
everyday contact that happens in our playgrounds, streets 
and other public spaces. thus, while we can assume that 
well-designed, controlled encounters between groups can 
reduce prejudice, we cannot assume that prejudice will be 
reduced if people from different groups live, work, study 
and play in the same places. In general, findings from the 
contact literature do not automatically justify policies of 
desegregation in housing or education, although there 
may be many other grounds for backing such policies 
(Brewer and Miller, 1984). 
Second, we should try to find out how well 
experiments actually model the contact that happens in 
naturally occurring situations. Of course, there is always a 
worry that, in principle, experiments cannot be 
generalized to real life (as we saw in Chapter 1). But in 
practice, the extent to which the generalizability of 
experiments is limited depends on exactly what 
differences exist between experiments and specific real-
life situations, and what effect these differences have on 
behaviour. Recent research has cast a good deal of light on 
specific differences between contact, as it unfolds in many 
experiments, versus real life. In an observational study, 
Dixon and Durrheim (2003) watched relations between 
Black and White people on a beach in post-apartheid 
South Africa. they found that a mix of races (mostly Black 
people, with a significant minority of White people and 
those of other racial backgrounds) used the beach. this 
desegregation, impossible in the appalling days of 
apartheid where different areas of beach were reserved 
for those of a different racial background, clearly 
constitutes a kind of minimal contact. But how did this 
contact play out in practice? the essential finding was that 
direct interaction between the racial groups was rare. 
Different racial groups tended to cluster together in 
different areas of the beach. When members of different 
groups were in close proximity, they tended to construct 
racially exclusive territories with strategically positioned 
sun umbrellas (see Figure 12.5). Racial groups also 
segregated themselves with ‘temporal processes of flux 
and withdrawal’ (Dixon et al., 2005, p. 704). For example, 
if a large number of Black holidaymakers arrived at a 
beach, White people tended to leave. 
Lee (2003) carried out a qualitative study in which 
Black shoppers were asked about their experience of 
shopping in predominantly White and Black 
neighbourhoods in the USA. Again, the lived experience of 
this kind of contact differed radically from those taking 
place in carefully engineered contact situations. Black 
shoppers reported feeling watched and distrusted (e.g., 
being watched covertly by store detectives), leading some 
of them to avoid contact while shopping in White areas or 
to avoid shopping. Others took care to wear expensive 
clothes and accessories so as to avoid being stereotyped 
as poor and potentially criminal because of their race.
Of course, none of this is to say that contact theory is 
wrong. It has never said that any type of contact will 
reduce prejudice. What it does show, however, is that the 
lived experience of groups who work, study or play 
together does not necessarily include actual interaction 
with outgroup members, in the style of carefully designed 
contact interventions. Arguably, then, a key challenge for 
social psychologists is to understand how groups interact 
with each other when sharing physical spaces and how to 
improve the quality of that contact. In our view, this 
means there should be greater dialogue between contact 
theorists and scientists from other disciplines, including 
environmental psychologists, who study the impact of 
physical environments on human behaviour, and political 
psychologists, who are concerned among other things 
with the effect of the political environment on behaviour 
(see Chapter 14). In this way, there is a greater chance that 
everyday experiences of contact will be improved by 
insights from the contact literature.

Improving intergroup relations
3 There is more to life than prejudice, and more to 
intergroup relations than prejudice reduction
the final criticism of research on contact is that the vast 
majority of it has focused on reductions of prejudice, that is, 
it has sought to improve the attitudes of individual 
participants to the outgroup (Dixon et al., 2005; Forbes, 
1997, 2004). Of course, this is an important and desirable 
outcome, but does not mean that contact improves all 
aspects of intergroup relations. Increasing contact in 
everyday life brings opportunities for positive contact, but 
also new opportunities for acts of intergroup aggression 
(see Chapter 13), disrespect, suspicion and fear (Amir, 
1965). Forbes (1997, 2004), for example, argues that 
increased contact in everyday life may heighten perceptions 
of threat. Individuals who are directly in contact with the 
outgroup may experience reductions in prejudice, but those 
in the wider community who see more outgroup members 
around but are not in contact with them may feel 
threatened – the effect being a net increase in threatened 
and negative feelings across the group overall. 
Although Forbes’ arguments are yet to be directly 
tested, there is recent evidence of another potential 
downside of contact. Saguy, tausch, Dovidio and Pratto 
(2009) found one problem with contact is that, among 
members of disadvantaged minority groups, it may breed 
an unrealistic expectation that the majority group will 
start to treat them in a fair and equal way. Ironically, this 
unrealistic optimism seems only to emerge after high-
quality contact, that is, contact that is perceived as positive 
or is focused on what groups have in common rather than 
what makes them different. It is as if minorities think, 
‘now that they’ve met us and seen we’re not so different, 
they’ll treat us right’. In the first of the two studies they 
published, Saguy et al. (2009, Study 1) conducted 35 
sessions in which a total of 210 participants were divided 
into two minimal groups of three members. each group 
gave itself a name and wore the same coloured t-shirts as 
a kind of uniform. One group was placed in an advantaged 
position over the other, being empowered to decide the 
rewards the two groups would receive. these rewards 
were research credits (course credits awarded to students 
in exchange for participating in studies). Meeting the 
‘advantaged’ group and talking about what they had in 
common tended to cause the ‘disadvantaged’ group to be 
more optimistic about how many credits they would 
receive from them. However, it did not affect the number 
of credits they actually got from the advantaged group. 
Consequently, high-quality contact caused disadvantaged 
groups to develop unrealistically optimistic expectations 
about how they would be treated: they imagined they 
would get more from the advantaged group than they 
actually got (Figure 12.6).

Source: Data from Saguy et al., 2009  
Saguy et al. (2009, Study 2) followed this up with a 
correlational study of Israeli Arabs’ perception of how they 
would be treated by Israeli Jews. In this second study, they 
found that Arabs who indicated they had more Jewish 
friends and acquaintances expressed less prejudice 
towards Jews. this, of course, is the classical effect of 
contact. Alongside this finding came greater trust that 
Jews intend to treat Arabs fairly – similar to the 
expectation of just treatment that contact fostered in the 
minimal groups of Saguy et al.’s first study. this 
expectation of just treatment appeared to lead Arabs who 
enjoyed positive contact with Jews to express lower 
support for social changes in Israel that might lead to 
more equal relations between groups. Unlike the first,

many scholars argue that it is essential to reduce

complex thought. What do you think this adds to the 
debate about the contact hypothesis? 
Time to reflect We have spent some time critiquing the contact hypothesis, but as you read on, consider the 
extent to which similar criticisms could be levelled at research and theory on other approaches to improving 
intergroup relations.
The concept of intergroup contact has sparked a great deal of research interest 
and debate in social psychology. As in the earlier example of Northern Ireland, it 
is worrying that a lack of contact reflects and potentially fuels prejudice. However, 
it is also important to note that laboratory studies of contact are not about living 
side by side. What we may think of as ‘contact’ in everyday life is different from 
the programmed, structured, legitimized meetings between people that are typical 
of modern studies of contact. The wider, everyday meaning of contact also 
requires the input of political scientists, sociologists and human geographers. 
Categorization-based approaches
As we saw in Chapter 11, ever since Allport’s (1954) pioneering work, social 
psychologists have known that a vital precondition for stereotyping, prejudice 
and discrimination is the human tendency to place themselves and others into 
categories. Even a minimal categorization into ‘us’ and ‘them’ appears to be 
enough to elicit certain forms of stereotyping and prejudice (Ashburn-Nardo, 
Voils and Monteith, 2001). However, theory and research over the past two 
decades have suggested that categorization does not necessarily lead to ingroup 
bias. In fact, social categories can be used as a tool to reduce prejudice. The key 

533
Improving intergroup relations
insight underlying these developments is that a minimal categorization into ‘us’ 
and ‘them’ is especially likely to lead to intergroup bias. If people can be encour-
aged to categorize in more inclusive and complex ways, there is a good chance that 
biases can be eliminated. 
One option is to go through a process of decategorization (or personalization), 
where personal rather than group identity becomes the focus (Miller and Brewer, 
1984). Thus, people regard one another as ‘me’ and ‘you’ rather than ‘we’ and 
‘they’, which is said to reduce intergroup bias by undermining the validity of 
outgroup stereotypes (Brewer and Miller, 1984; Miller, 2002; Miller, Brewer and 
Edwards, 1985). This process has been shown to be effective in reducing inter-
group conflict in the laboratory. For example, Miller et al. (1985) showed that 
intergroup conflict that permits more personalized interactions (e.g., being more 
person focused than task focused) elicits more positive attitudes to outgroup 
members who are both present and not present. 
However, in the real world, this kind of avoidance of group boundaries is not 
always going to be possible. An alternative categorization-based approach to 
reducing prejudice is offered by the common ingroup identity model, which suggests 
that if members of rival or opposing groups are encouraged to recategorize them-
selves as members of the same ingroup, intergroup attitudes will improve, or 
perceived differences may even disappear (Gaertner and Dovidio, 2000; Gaertner, 
Mann, Murrell and Dovidio, 1989). In part, this model emerged from research on 
the contact hypothesis, which, since Allport (1954), has emphasized the impor-
tance of having common goals and working cooperatively towards them. In their 
experiments, Gaertner et al. (1989) assigned participants to small work teams of 
three people. They brought two such teams together and encouraged them to 
represent themselves as one big team encompassing six people, rather than two 
separate teams of three. To do this, they used techniques such as manipulating 
seating arrangements so that teams had to sit together rather than apart, giving 
them common rather than unique team names, and ensuring that participants’ 
success or failure was linked to that of members of the other team of three people, 
as well as the members of their own team. Under these conditions, which encour-
aged participants to form a common ingroup identity, bias between the teams was 
eliminated or at least reduced. Other research has demonstrated that common 
ingroup identity may be achieved by increasing the salience of existing common 
superordinate identities (e.g., schools) or categories (e.g., students) (Gómez, 
Dovidio, Huici et al., 2008), or by introducing factors such as a common goal or 
fate that is perceived to be shared by the group memberships (Gaertner, Dovidio, 
Rust et al., 1999). 
Results of field surveys have also supported the common ingroup identity 
model. Gaertner, Rust, Dovidio et al. (1994) asked students at a multiracial school 
in the USA to circle which of several racial, ethnic and national labels applied to 
them. Participants who circled inclusive labels that included several racial and 
ethnic groups (e.g., American) reported lower levels of racial and ethnic prejudice. 
Once again, a common identity appears to be able to reduce negative feelings

between groups. Interestingly, bias was reduced still further when participants did 
not just indicate a common (or ‘superordinate’) identity, but also classified them-
selves into a unique (or ‘subordinate’) identity, such as Black, White or Asian 
(Gaertner et al., 1994). Many studies have since echoed this finding that simultane-
ously identifying with both subordinate and superordinate categories leads to the 
most effective reductions in intergroup bias (e.g., Hornsey and Hogg, 2000; Huo, 
Smith, Tyler and Lind, 1996; Smith and Tyler, 1996). We need not throw away our 
identification with smaller, more distinct groups. Instead, it is possible, and better, 
to complement our group identification with higher level identification with 
superordinate identities.
For the common ingroup identity model, there are two good reasons why this 
kind of simultaneous identification reduces prejudice. First, it can be seen as a 
form of crossed categorization (Crisp, Walsh and Hewstone, 2006; Hewstone, Islam 
and Judd, 1993). If you categorize yourself along one dimension (e.g., French), 
you are likely to perceive fewer differences between yourself and a person of 
another nationality (e.g., British) if you simultaneously perceive that person and 
yourself to share membership of another category (e.g., you are both Asian). This 
is because you will perceive similarities between yourself and that person because 
of your common racial identity, and not just differences because of your distinc-
tive national identity. The two category accentuation processes (see Chapter 11) 
are at odds, with the result that overall bias is reduced compared to the situation 
where you were only aware of your different nationalities. Second, if people retain 
distinctive as well as superordinate identities while working with people from 
other groups, they are more likely to be able to show reduced prejudice in other 
settings. For example, if a French participant is thinking, ‘we are no longer Asian 
or White, but we are all French’, they may be less well equipped to show reduced 
bias in later encounters with French members of racial outgroups. The experience 
is more likely to generalize if they are aware of racial identities at the same time, so 
that they are really learning, for example, that ‘those White people are not so bad’ 
(Gaertner and Dovidio, 2000). 
However, the common ingroup identity model is not the only account of why it 
is beneficial for people to acknowledge both superordinate and subordinate identi-
ties. According to the mutual differentiation model (Crisp, 2005; Hewstone, 1996; 
Hewstone and Brown, 1986), people are often very committed to subordinate 
groups. As social identity theory has made clear, commitment to their social identi-
ties is a strong, characteristic feature of human nature and people strive to maintain 
the positive distinctiveness of their social identity (Tajfel and Turner, 1986).
Further, relatively small, distinctive groups often satisfy people’s need for iden-
tity and belonging more completely than large, inclusive groups (Brewer, 1991; 
Hornsey and Jetten, 2004). Thus, in the mutual differentiation model, people are 
prone to ‘distinctiveness threat’ when a superordinate identity looks like it might 
swallow up, and replace, more distinctive subordinate groups. This feeling of 
threat can undermine the gains that might be made by reducing category accentua-
tion effects.

Improving intergroup relations
How can we differentiate between the common ingroup identity model and the 
mutual differentiation model? They both make many of the same predictions. But 
differentiating between the models is important, because it is crucial that profes-
sionals and policy makers are guided by a correct understanding of how people 
are going to respond to their interventions. According to the mutual differentia-
tion model, attempts to get people to simply identify with superordinate groups, 
in place of meaningful subordinate groups, can actually backfire, producing 
increased prejudice. Why? Because the threat of losing a cherished and distinctive 
identity can make people defensive. People are motivated to reassert the unique-
ness and, indeed, the superiority of their group. What better way to do this than 
to discriminate and express prejudice towards the outgroup? This prediction is 
not made by the common ingroup identity model, because it does not acknowl-
edge that the loss of subordinate identity can be threatening. Several studies have 
now produced clear support for this unique prediction of the mutual differentia-
tion model. For example, Hornsey and Hogg (2000) had participants – university 
students in Queensland, Australia – complete a problem-solving task while 
different aspects of their identity were made salient. The conditions were: 
1 Individual identity salience: Participants were told that ordinary individuals 
could solve problems in ways that trained professionals could not.
2 Superordinate identity salience: Participants were told that university students 
could solve problems in ways that trained professionals could not.
3 Subordinate identity salience: Participants were told that the problem solving of 
humanities students and maths/science students would be compared.
4 Simultaneous identity salience: Participants were told that university students 
could solve problems in ways that trained professionals could not, and that the 
performance of humanities and maths/science students would be compared.
After completing the task, participants were told they would solve a similar problem 
again, but this time in groups. They were asked how much they would like working 
with members of their own, versus the other, 
subordinate group (humanities or maths/sciences). 
This was taken as a measure of ingroup bias. 
Results revealed that ingroup bias was higher in 
the superordinate condition than in the other three 
conditions (see Figure 12.7). Indeed, it appears 
that prejudice between groups can be made worse 
by imposing a superordinate identity without 
preserving the subordinate identities at the same 
time (see also Kenworthy et al., 2005).

Applying
If you identify strongly with a relatively small, distinctive group, there is a good 
chance you will feel especially threatened if you perceive that it stands to be 
replaced with some larger, more inclusive social category. Thus, it is all the more 
likely that you will react to this threat with increased prejudice towards the other 
groups with which your group may be merged. Indeed, this is what Crisp and 
Beck (2005) and Crisp, Stone and Hall (2006) have found. They had British people 
imagine what life would be like in a United States of Europe, where being British 
would no longer have any special relevance. They then had participants complete 
measures of prejudice towards a European outgroup (the French). Participants 
who had a low (below median) level of identification – that is, a weak sense of 
being ‘British’ – responded to the superordinate identification with lower levels of 
implicit prejudice towards the French. High identifiers (above median) responded 
with increased levels of prejudice, relative to a baseline condition.

The common ingroup identity model and the mutual differentiation model are 
concerned with how people think about the relationship between ingroup and 
outgroup categories. Are they entirely separate with nothing in common? Can the 
boundaries between them be dismantled? A promising new model of the role of 
categorization in prejudice, and prejudice reduction, is concerned exclusively with 
how people think about their own social categories. This model of social identity 
complexity (Roccas and Brewer, 2002) assumes that people have many ingroups 
(see also Crisp, 2005). Try out the exercise below and you will see what we mean.

According to some provisional fi ndings published by Roccas and Brewer 
(2002), the more complex your social identity, the less you value personal power, 
the more you value tolerance and other ‘universalist’ values, and the more positive 
you are about outgroups. As you may remember from Chapter 5, Mullen, Calo-
gero and Leader (2007) obtained further support for this idea in their archival 
studies of intergroup confl ict. Tribal groups, and urban gangs, who used more 
complex (non-overlapping) sets of labels to describe themselves, committed fewer 
atrocities against other groups. For Roccas and Brewer (2002), complex social 
identity works by making people less closed-minded and equipping them with 
greater cognitive fl exibility, as a result of experiencing life from multiple perspec-
tives (see Figure 12.8). Further, if your social identities are largely separate, it is 
likely that threats to one of your identities are going to be easier to cope with, 
because your entire identity is not under attack.

Consider the two social categories, A and B. One way that an individual 
can recognize more than one social identity and maintain a single ingroup 
representation is to deﬁ ne the ingroup at the intersection of multiple group 
memberships (a). For example, a female lawyer can deﬁ ne her primary 
social identity in terms of the compound combination of her gender and 
her profession, which is an identity shared only with other female lawyers. 
Another way of representing group membership is dominance (b). A female 
lawyer may see herself overwhelmingly as a lawyer (group A). Although she 
recognizes she is a female lawyer (group B within A), she does not feel kinship 
with other women, only with other lawyers. Another mental model of group 
membership is compartmentalization (c). A female lawyer may see her gender 
and professional identity as completely independent, and so will think, feel and 
act ‘as’ a woman in some settings, and ‘as’ a lawyer in others. Finally, she may 
see her gender and legal identities as merged (d), so will feel a strong sense 
of commonality and solidarity with women (whether or not they are lawyers) 
and with lawyers (whether or not they are women); she doesn’t see anything 
special about female lawyers.

Applying
Values-based approaches
As we have seen, the contact and categorization approaches to improving inter-
group relations have had many successes. It is clear they can be applied in class-
rooms and communities to reduce prejudice between groups. They do not always 
work and sometimes may even backfire, but research has identified many of the 
conditions in which this happens and thus it is possible to reduce the risks. 
However, because the approaches do not always work, it is sensible to look for 
other approaches to achieving harmony between groups. 
Many approaches to understanding how relations between groups may be 
improved have concerned themselves with values. Values such as tolerance, multi-
culturalism and egalitarianism may encourage positive attitudes and behaviours 
towards outgroups and discourage hateful or competitive attitudes and behaviours 
(Crandall and Eshleman, 2003). If these values can be strengthened or if people 
can be made mindful of them, there is a good chance they will relate to outgroups 
in a more positive way. They can also defuse the harmful effect of values such as 
social dominance and ideologies such as right-wing authoritarianism, which can 
contribute to prejudice and conflict, as we saw in Chapter 11. A major strength of 
this approach is that the effect of values may be felt far beyond prejudice. Values 
have the potential to provide a common moral language, which means that not 
just prejudice but any harmful, negative action towards an outgroup is likely to be 
disapproved of, whereas acts of conciliation and consideration towards outgroups 
may be highly prized (Roccas and Brewer, 2002; Schwarz, 1994). 
To some extent, we can view the 20th century as a kind of giant, naturalistic 
experiment. Throughout that century, values concerning intergroup relations 
changed dramatically. As we saw in Chapter 11, at the beginning of the century, 
many forms of prejudice, including racism, sexism and homophobia, were seldom-
questioned norms. Although the principles of equality and freedom were already 
enshrined in the constitutions of many Western nations, numerous groups were 
routinely excluded from this noble tradition. However, values were transformed 
by the traumas and immense social changes of the century. In particular, the new 
horrors of industrialized genocide were brought to people’s attention with ever 
increasing rapidity by the mass media. This brought to people’s living rooms 
indelible and visceral proof of where irrational hatred and feelings of superiority 
can lead. Globalization brought different ethnic, cultural and religious groups into 
close contact and demanded that they learn at least to tolerate each other. The 
racist doctrines of their early 20th-century predecessors were discredited by biolo-
gists and social scientists (e.g., Gould, 1996). Social scientific terminology like 
‘prejudice’, ‘racism’ and ‘homophobia’ entered popular consciousness. To openly 
discriminate or express blatant prejudice was to risk being fined, fired, jailed, 
mocked and ostracized. The century saw the end of legally enforced racial segre-
gation and discrimination in many countries, including the USA, South Africa and 
Australia. Blatant, open forms of prejudice declined dramatically. For example, 
Dovidio, Brigham, Johnson and Gaertner (1996) conducted a meta-analysis of the 

539
Improving intergroup relations
literature on White people’s stereotypes, preju-
dice and discrimination against Black people in 
the USA and found that the extent to which 
they selected derogatory terms to describe 
Black people (e.g., lazy, ignorant) had signifi-
cantly decreased since 1933 (Figure 12.9).
Clearly, the changes in values in the last 
century were accompanied by massive improve-
ments in many aspects of intergroup relations. 
This should be recognized as a phenomenal 
victory for human decency and dignity. But it is 
by no means a complete victory. In many coun-
tries, massive disparities in power, status, health 
and wealth exist between racial groups, even 
in the absence of legally enforced disadvantage. War, terrorism and hate crimes 
are by no means extinguished. If anything, some tensions, such as that between 
people of Christian and Muslim faiths, seem to have worsened. Further, how can 
we be sure that reductions in racism, homophobia and the like can be attributed 
to the new value priorities of tolerance and equality? Theory and evidence are 
needed to establish what the link is between these two. 
Multiculturalism
Multiculturalism is the ideology that diversity should be acknowledged and celebrated 
(Takaki, 1993; Yinger, 1994). Different groups are seen as having equal value but 
being able to make unique contributions and offer unique perspectives to society. 
This ideology envisions a society that is more dynamic, creative and ultimately 
harmonious as a result of the coexistence of different peoples. It can be contrasted 
with ideologies that stress the importance of downplaying differences between 
groups, variously known as assimilationism, integrationism and colour blindness. 
The ‘melting pot’ ideology of colour blindness has obvious intuitive appeal; 
indeed, it is widely favoured by teachers and administrators in US schools (e.g., 
Schofield and Eurich-Fulcer, 2001). Would we all get along better if we did not 
obsess, or even notice, each other’s differences? But a good deal of evidence 
suggests that multiculturalism is the better policy for reductions in bias. One 
reason for this is clear after reading the categorization literature – multiculturalism 
provides a framework that acknowledges differences between groups but also 
suggests that these groups combine to create a new, superordinate, emergent iden-
tity. Thus, it encourages the simultaneous identification with superordinate and 
subordinate groups, which, as we have seen, tends to be beneficial for intergroup 
relations (Crisp, 2005; Gaertner et al., 1999; Hornsey and Hogg, 2000). Conversely, 
colour blindness may threaten people’s cherished subordinate identities (Crisp et 
al., 2006; Hornsey and Hogg, 2000). Further, when group differences are acknowl-
edged, it is easier for people to notice, and remedy, instances of injustice and 
disharmony between groups (Banks, Cookson, Gay et al., 2001). Also, the ideo-

logical nature of multiculturalism signifies to people that positive attitudes to 
diversity, to outgroups, are the norm (Crandall et al., 2002). 
Richeson and Nussbaum (2004) were able to provide experimental support for 
the merits of multiculturalism, as compared to colour blindness. They had partici-
pants read a one-page statement that endorsed either multiculturalism or colour 
blindness, and then asked them to write a summary of five key reasons why the 
ideology they had read about was ‘a positive approach to interethnic relations’. 
Afterwards, participants completed the classic IAT for implicit racism towards 
Black people, and then rated Black, White and other ethnic groups in America on 
a feeling thermometer. The multiculturalism induction led to declines in all these 
indices of racial bias (Figure 12.10).

Suppression of prejudice
As we saw in Chapter 11, many forms of prejudice and discrimination, including 
racism and sexism, have always been at odds with sincerely held values of liber-
alism and equality. Thus, people in avowedly liberal and democratic countries 
have experienced a dilemma – on one hand they are prejudiced, but on the other 
they subscribe to values suggesting that human beings are of equal worth regard-
less of race, religion, gender or creed. These two opposing pressures have long 
been recognized by social psychologists. Myrdal (1944), for example, wrote of the 
‘American dilemma’, one of its horns being racism and the other the ideology of 
opportunity for all. Allport (1954) claimed that although some White Americans

are bigots who are at ease with their prejudices, the majority experience compunc-
tion (moral guilt). More recently, as we saw in Chapter 11, people who are squeezed 
between these opposing forces are prone to modern racism (McConahay, 1986) 
and automatic prejudice (Devine, 1989). According to these theories, the mounting 
emphasis throughout the 20th century on values such as ‘liberalism, egalitarianism, 
sympathy for the underdog … and humanitarian values’ (Crandall and Eshleman, 
2003, p. 415) has increasingly motivated people to suppress prejudice and the 
impulse to discriminate. These values have translated into social norms that suggest 
it is no longer acceptable to express overt prejudice towards many groups. These 
norms are extremely powerful, as some recent findings suggest.
Crandall et al. (2002, p. 363) asked 150 US undergraduate students to rate how 
acceptable prejudice was towards each of 105 groups, according to the ‘predomi-
nant social norm’. Each group earned a mean prejudice acceptability score between 
0 and 2, which ranged from 0.047 for blind people and women who stay home to 
raise kids, to 1.967 for rapists and child molesters. They then asked a separate 
sample of 121 US undergraduate students to rate how they felt about each of these 
105 groups on a feeling thermometer from 0 = ‘cold/not positive’ to 100 = ‘hot/
very positive’. This was later reverse scored (e.g., a score of 20 would be translated 
to 80, and a score of 90 would be translated to 10), so that the higher the score, the 
more the participants were prejudiced towards each group. 
As Figure 12.11 shows, the more participants in the first 
group perceived prejudice towards each group to be socially 
acceptable, the more participants in the second group 
expressed prejudice towards each group. Indeed, this corre-
lation was extraordinarily high at r = .96, just shy of the 
maximum, perfect correlation of 1.0. For reassurance that 
this whopping correlation was not a fluke, see Graziano, 
Bruce, Tobin and Sheese (2007) who found something 
similar (r = .94). To put the correlation obtained by Crandall 
et al. (2002) into context, the typical correlation between 
contact and (lower) prejudice is around r = .27 (Pettigrew 
and Tropp, 2006). It is tempting to say, therefore, that the 
effect of social norms is nearly four times as large as the 
effect of contact. However, this is a serious understatement. 
To get an idea of how the proportion of the ups and downs in one variable (preju-
dice) overlap with another variable (contact, or perceived social norms), you 
should square the correlation coefficient to obtain r2. Squaring .27, we get a little 
over .07, or 7 per cent of the variance in common between contact and prejudice. 
Squaring .96, we get .92, or 92 per cent of the variance in common. 
In an experiment reported in the same article and inspired by Asch’s (1951) 
famous experiments on conformity, Crandall et al. (2002) had a confederate 
express prejudice. This had the effect of increasing the prejudice that participants 
themselves expressed towards the same group. This provides some evidence that

gathered in a laboratory, genuinely have the power to influence, and do not merely 
reflect, the prejudices people are willing to express. Norms can motivate people to 
suppress prejudice in different ways. For example, if you are comfortable with 
your own prejudices but suppress them because you think others will disapprove, 
you are extrinsically motivated. On the other hand, if you dislike your prejudices 
and suppress them for this reason, irrespective of how you are viewed by others, 
you are intrinsically motivated. People may start out being extrinsically motivated 
to suppress prejudice, but, over time, internalize anti-prejudice norms and thus 
become intrinsically motivated (Crandall et al., 2002). 
Evidence suggests that the intrinsic motivation to suppress prejudice may be 
more effective. One reason for this is that intrinsically motivated people experi-
ence genuine emotions, especially guilt, when they fail to live up to their own 
non-prejudiced standards. Plant and Devine (1998) attempted to disentangle the 
motivation to respond without prejudice by distinguishing between external/
social (extrinsic) and internal/personal (intrinsic) motivation. They developed 
scales to measure both types of motivations to respond without prejudice towards 
Black people. Intrinsic motivation referred to internalized and personally impor-
tant non-prejudiced standards, whereas extrinsic motivation referred to the social 
pressure to conform to non-prejudiced norms. Plant and Devine (1998) found that 
intrinsic motivation to respond without prejudice was associated with lower 
racism (self-reported racism scores), whereas extrinsic motivation was related to 
higher self-reported racism scores. 
In another series of experiments, Monteith (1993) had participants decide 
whether a hypothetical applicant should get a place to study in law school. The 
applicant was weak and was duly rejected by all but 11 participants. Half the 
participants had been told at the outset that the applicant was gay, and were also 
led to believe they had discriminated against the applicant because of it. The other 
half had been told the applicant was heterosexual. Participants who were low in 
homophobia according to tests run before the experiment had thus been tricked 
into thinking they had violated their own moral standards. Following this, all 
participants read an essay about stereotyping and prejudice, ostensibly written by 
Monteith. Pretending she was seeking feedback on her ideas, she asked partici-
pants for their thoughts about it. What she was really interested in was whether 
participants mentioned their own prejudices, and whether they mentioned any 
discrepancies between their egalitarian principles and their behaviour. Results 
showed that after being led to believe they had discriminated against a gay person, 
low homophobia participants showed increased negative thoughts about them-
selves and took longer to read the essay on stereotyping and prejudice. They also 
thought more about themselves and the discrepancies between their ideal stand-
ards and their actual behaviour. The awareness manipulation had no significant 
effect on participants who scored high in homophobia (Figure 12.12). 
Theoretically, these guilty reactions should help people exert self-control, 
because they bring the self into focus, motivating people to think carefully about 
controlling their future behaviour. Indeed, in a subsequent experiment, Monteith 

543
Improving intergroup relations
(1993) led low homophobia individuals to believe they had acted in a manner 
discrepant with their standards. This led them to rate derogatory jokes about gays 
as less funny, witty and creative. In a later series of studies, Monteith, Ashburn-
Nardo, Voils and Czopp (2002) found that, to some extent, practice makes perfect. 
The more people suppress prejudice over time, the more certain psychological 
cues such as the experience of guilt and self-reflection help them control prejudice.

Can suppression backfire?
The findings we have been reviewing are impressive and cause for hope. Appar-
ently, we have the power to control our own prejudices, at least if we really want 
to. Or not? In a classic experiment, Macrae, Bodenhausen, Milne and Jetten (1994, 
Experiment 2) explored the limits of the human ability to suppress their attitudes 
towards an outgroup. They showed Welsh participants a photograph of a male 
skinhead, and asked them to spend five minutes writing about a typical day in his 
life. Half the participants were assigned, at random, to the suppression condition. 
These participants were told that our perceptions of others are often based on 
stereotypic preconditions, and were asked to try to avoid thinking about the skin-
head in a stereotyped way while writing their stories. The remaining participants 
were assigned to the control condition, and were merely asked to write the story 
without any such condition. 
The manipulation was successful. Participants managed to suppress stereotypes 
while writing the stories. Those in the suppression condition wrote stories that were 
rated by independent coders (who were blind to conditions, which means that they 
did not know the instructions each participant had been given) as significantly less

Applying
stereotypical than the controls. But of greater interest to Macrae et al. (1994) was 
what happened after participants had finished the stories and were no longer 
required to suppress the stereotypes. At this point, the experimenter told partici-
pants that they were about to meet the skinhead they had just written about. The 
experimenter led each participant to a neighbouring room containing a row of eight 
chairs. A denim jacket and bag, apparently belonging to the skinhead, were slung on 
a chair at one end of this row. The experimenter explained that the skinhead had left 
the room temporarily, and invited the participant to have a seat. The dependent vari-
able in this study was how far away from the skinhead’s belongings the participants 
chose to sit, from 1 (the next chair) to 7 (the furthermost chair). 
What would you expect to happen? It would make sense to predict that those 
in the suppression condition would sit closer to the skinhead’s belongings, right? 
Presumably, they have put their negative feelings aside and thus would feel more 
comfortable anticipating being close to the skinhead. But the exact opposite 
happened – those who had suppressed stereotypes sat further away than those 
who had been allowed to make their stories as stereotypical as they liked. Why? 
Macrae’s findings reveal something about mental regulation. Once you have 
finished suppressing an unwanted set of thoughts or feelings, it can ‘rebound’, 
coming back stronger than ever. According to the leading theoretical explanation 
of this rebound effect of thought suppression, it happens because thought suppres-
sion relies on two types of mental machinery. The first monitors mental content 
for any sign of the unwanted thought, and alerts the second system that is respon-
sible for eliminating or replacing it. Ironically, the monitoring machinery activates 
the unwanted thought (see Chapter 2 for coverage of the concept of activation). 
Thus, when participants give up trying to control the unwanted thought, it is left 
highly activated but is no longer being dealt with. So, in a rush and quite 
unchecked, it enters consciousness (see Figure 12.13). This theoretical process is 
known as ironic monitoring (Wegner, 2009). 
Time to reflect Monteith’s and Macrae’s ideas can be linked to philosophical models of humanity. the 
enlightenment model sees human beings as functioning best when irrational and unwanted impulses are kept in 
check. the Romantic model suggests that human nature is warped, with harmful consequences when people try to 
control their deepest impulses and desires. Whose ideas map onto the conception of enlightenment and whose are 
Romantic? (If this is not immediately clear, it may help to look up ‘enlightenment’ and ‘Romantic’ philosophy on  
the internet.) 
This research shows that attempts to suppress stereotypes can rebound. Should 
we conclude that suppression is too risky a strategy for the reduction of prejudice, 
and look instead to other techniques for improving intergroup relations? This 
would be a sad conclusion, casting doubt as it does on the efforts of human beings 
worldwide to improve themselves in this important respect – to turn their backs 
on messages of hatred, intolerance and group-based inferiority in favour of a 
humane appreciation of equality. Fortunately, we have evidence that suppression 
can work in other circumstances (Monteith, Sherman and Devine, 1998). In the 
Wales of the early 1990s, there were few if any social rules that said to people that

Improving intergroup relations
it was not okay to stereotype skinheads. This was not and still isn’t a group that is 
normatively ‘protected’ from prejudice (Crandall et al., 2002). As a result, partici-
pants were not used to suppressing stereotyped thoughts about skinheads. As we 
have seen, practice appears to make perfect (Monteith et al., 2002). Indeed, research 
suggests that if people are motivated over a period of years to think of groups as 
equals, they are unable to control even unconscious forms of stereotyping and 
prejudice in their thinking (Moskowitz, Gollwitzer, Wasel and Schaal, 1999). As 
we saw in Chapter 4, these unconscious, automatic or implicit forms of stereo-
typing and prejudice are commonly thought to be the most resistant to change. 
The media and real-world conflict
One recent development in prejudice reduction research involves the role of the 
mass media in reducing conflict. Paluck (2009) argued that, for many years, 
psychological research has attempted to reduce prejudice and intergroup conflict 
with various methods, but that scholars still know relatively little about what 
interventions have been shown to reduce prejudice and conflict in real-world 
settings (Paluck and Green, 2009). Paluck argued that a largely ignored source of 
knowledge may lie in the mass media’s role in shaping beliefs and behaviours, 
especially those related to prejudice. After the two world wars, social psycholo-
gists were interested in the role of propaganda in improving intergroup attitudes 
and reducing conflict and prejudice (e.g., Doob, 1935; Cooper and Jahoda, 1947), 
but this interest waned over the years as researchers became more focused on 
other methods of conflict reduction, and contact in particular. 
Paluck (2009) focused on the central African country of Rwanda, in which 10 
per cent of the population (and 75 per cent of the Tutsi ethnic minority popula-
tion) were killed in an act of genocide during a three-month period of intense 
conflict in 1994. Radio communication was instrumental in fuelling the conflict as 
it is the most important form of mass media in Rwanda. It is well documented that 
radio communication was culpable in the genocide of 1994 (e.g., Article 19, 1996; 
Li, 2004; Thompson, 2007) and is specifically relevant to intergroup conflict as, 
just as in other parts of the developing world, Rwandan people gather together to 
listen to the radio (Bourgault, 1995; Hendy, 2000). Ten years after the conflict, a 
nongovernmental organization produced an ‘education entertainment’ soap opera 
specifically designed to promote reconciliation between the ethnic groups in 
Rwanda. The programme contained messages designed to address the mistrust, 
lack of communication and interaction, and the trauma remaining from the geno-
cide. It contained educational messages designed to influence listeners’ beliefs 
about the origins and prevention of prejudice, as well as paths to healing. It also 
contained information about norms – demonstrations of what listeners’ peers do 
(descriptive norms) and should do (prescriptive norms) in everyday situations.
Paluck (2009) conducted a year-long field study to examine the effect of the 
programme on people’s beliefs, perception of social norms, and behaviours.

Applying
Specifically, Paluck attempted to answer three questions. First, do the mass media 
have the capacity to influence personal beliefs about prejudice, violence and 
trauma? Second, can the media influence perceptions of social norms? Third, can 
the media influence behaviour? Communities were randomly assigned to a treat-
ment condition (they listened to the radio programme), or a control condition 
(they listened to a radio programme about health and were asked not to listen to 
the other programme which was publicly available). Results revealed that the 
reconciliation programme did not significantly influence listeners’ personal 
beliefs, but it did significantly influence listeners’ perceptions of social norms. 
Further, normative perceptions were realized by actual behaviours such as active 
negotiation, open expression about sensitive topics, and cooperation. Thus, Paluck 
argued that in order to change prejudiced behaviour, a useful technique may be to 
target social norms rather than personal beliefs, and the mass media are a useful 
way to do so. This suggestion presents a challenge to other prejudice reduction 
techniques, which typically target personal beliefs and cognitive processes as the 
main source of prejudice. 
However, this approach also has some limitations. Perhaps, the results are 
specific to the Rwandan culture and context. Perhaps, it does not consider the 
influence of age, particularly the possibility that younger listeners tend to be more 
influenced by the media (Paluck, 2007) and their beliefs are more flexible than 
older people’s beliefs (Krosnick and Alwin, 1989). Also, although media exposure 
may lead to less bigotry and prejudice (Stephan and Stephan, 2001), if people are 
exposed to other sources of prejudice or negative stereotypes in the media or 
elsewhere, anti-prejudice interventions will have limited effect. It also raises some 
questions, such as how durable the effects are and how exactly the media work to 
influence perceptions of norms and thus prejudiced behaviour. Such issues may be 
addressed by longitudinal research, which would enable researchers to examine 
the social, political or individual processes that change over time to influence the 
perception of social norms. The Ethics and research methods box below looks at 
reducing real-world intergroup conflict.

Applying
intergroup apology and forgiveness
As we saw in Chapter 10, it is possible to see groups as agents, whose members do 
not just act as individuals but together act as a collective. This means that it is 
possible for groups to acquire a kind of collective moral responsibility for their 
actions. For some thinkers, this means that when one group has transgressed 
against another, it is morally obliged to consider offering an apology (Brooks, 
1999; Philpot and Hornsey, 2008). Perhaps the moral obligation to apologize is 
more pressing if it can be shown that the apology benefits the group that has been 
wronged. However, to date, social psychologists have not turned their attention to 
this question. It is a ‘blind spot’ in research that we think leaves open the opportu-
nity to do much intellectually exciting and important research over the next few 
years (see the Blind spot in social psychology exercise at the end of the chapter). 
Another intended function of apology, however, is to allow the perpetrator and 
victim groups to reconcile with each other. What makes a good intergroup 
apology? Blatz, Schumann and Ross (2009) identified 10 elements of government 
apologies that theory and research suggest should make them satisfactory so far as 
the victim group is concerned (see Table 12.1).
The first six elements had already been studied in 
research on apologies between individuals. The last four 
were specific to intergroup contexts and based mostly 
on theory rather than research findings. Blatz et al. 
(2009) found some of these elements present in all 
governmental apologies, such as in the South African 
premier’s apology to Black people for apartheid, and 
the Queen’s apology to New Zealand Ma¯ori for the 
illegitimate seizure of their lands. However, they were 
all present in only one apology. This will surprise many 
Australian readers, because, according to Blatz et al. 
(2009), the only apology that scored 10 out of 10 was an 
apology they attributed to Australian Prime Minister 
John Howard in 1999, regarding the forcible removal of 
a ‘stolen generation’ of Aboriginal children from their 
families. This certainly came as news to us in researching 
this textbook, as we knew that John Howard had spent 
many years after 1999 refusing to apologize, and that 
Kevin Rudd, his successor, had delivered what seems to most Australians to have 
been the first such apology. John Howard, no longer in office, criticized Kevin 
Rudd’s apology as a mistake. This case raises a number of questions about what 
counts as an apology, how subjective the perception of an apology and its elements 
might be and thus how it might differ from person to person, and also, just 
possibly, the striking phenomenon of collective amnesia for apologies (see the 
Blind spot in psychology exercise at the end of chapter). Research by Giner-
Sorolla, Castano, Espinosa and Brown (2008) adds another element to the mix.

Improving intergroup relations
They studied the importance of the emotions an outgroup member expresses in 
the process of making apologies and offering reparations. They found that ingroup 
members can be offended and feel insulted if apologies and offers of reparations 
are offered without emotion or with guilt. Only shame, a self-conscious emotion 
associated with low self-esteem and self-abasement, was enough to defuse the 
feeling of insult.

Do intergroup apologies, whatever positive effects they might have, elicit the 
forgiveness of the group by its victims, as the apologizers presumably intend? Inter-
group forgiveness is a relatively new area of research and the signs are not good (for 
a review, see Blatz and Philpot, 2010). McLernon, Cairns, Hewstone and Smith 
(2004), studying a Northern Irish sample, found participants to be less forgiving of 
outgroups than people usually are in studies of interpersonal forgiveness. Philpot 
and Hornsey (2008) found that although good apologies convinced recipients that 
the outgroup felt remorse for what they had done, and would sometimes lead them 
to forgive the person doing the apologizing for the actions of their group, they did 
not affect recipients’ willingness to forgive the outgroup as a whole for what it had 
done. Further, Philpot and Hornsey (2011) asked people whether the Japanese 
government had apologized for their aggression during the Second World War. 
Participants were more likely to believe (incorrectly) that they had not apologized 
than to believe (correctly) that they had. Although participants in Philpot and 
Hornsey’s studies were slightly more forgiving if they felt that an apology had been 
issued, memory for apology was generally so poor so that it is difficult to fully 
appreciate how apology may influence forgiveness. Recently, Wohl, Hornsey and 
Bennett (2012) argued that one reason why apologies may not be terribly effective 
in eliciting forgiveness is because people view the outgroup as less able to experience 
complex, uniquely human emotions such as remorse. In support of this idea, they 
found that Canadian participants forgave Afghanis for a friendly fire incident to the 
extent that they perceived Afghanis as able to experience emotions such as anguish. 
The role of apology in the reconciliation process becomes more complex still if the 
victim group refuses to accept the apology. Harth, Hornsey and Barlow (2011) 
reminded participants about an ingroup transgression and were told that their 
ingroup had apologized to the target group. Participants were then placed into one 
of two conditions – one where the target group accepted the apology, or another 
where the group rejected it – and were asked to rate the target group. Results 
revealed that when the target rejected the apology, they were met with a strong 
emotional backlash and were rated with higher levels of racism. Participants also 
expressed reduced willingness to financially compensate the target group. 
Facilitating intergroup forgiveness is a major challenge confronting researchers. 
The early signs are that apologies may not be a fruitful route to this goal (Wohl, 

550
Applying
Hornsey and Philpot, 2011). However, recent research points to the fact that the 
dehumanization of the apologizer may be partly responsible for a lack of evidence 
linking apology and forgiveness. If victim groups view the apologizing group as 
capable of experiencing complex emotions such as remorse, forgiveness increases. 
Further, an ingroup proxy apologizer can eliminate the negative influence of 
dehumanization (Wohl et al., 2012). When an ingroup member relays the apology, 
trust and forgiveness become more likely. The message and tone of the apology 
may be important too. For example, empathic messages may improve attitudes 
towards an apologizing group, if trust in the group is high (Nadler and Livitian, 
2006). The path to reconciliation via apology may therefore be possible if the right 
conditions are met.

defusing intergroup conflict? Is Jarek right in believing that an apology can solve any conflict?
Communication and negotiation
More often than not, communication enables people to cooperate and overcome 
conflict (Bornstein, Rapoport, Kerpel and Katz, 1989). Especially in the case of 
social dilemmas, when conflicting parties communicate with each other, they 
approach the issue as a common problem that needs to be dealt with in the interests 
of everyone. Communication can be particularly effective if conducted face to face, 
as it encourages people (or maybe even forces them) to follow established norms 
and adhere to certain expectations (Bouas and Komorita, 1996; Kerr and Kaufman-
Gilliland, 1994). Three main elements make communication work as a method of 
conflict reduction and resolution. These are bargaining, mediation and arbitration:
1 Bargaining: When both groups are fighting over something, one thing they can 
do to resolve the conflict is to attempt to bargain their way out of the problem. 
Specifically, one group can offer something and the other group either accepts it 
or communicates a counter offer. One question is whether it is best to drive a 
‘hard bargain’ and go into the communication with a strong offer, or to attempt 
to resolve the conflict with a more reasonable, conciliatory offer. Some research 
suggests that tough bargaining may be effective because it reduces the other 
party’s expectations, making them willing to accept less for themselves (Yukl, 
1974). However, too much inflexibility can present conflicting parties with a 
situation where both lose out. Consider some serious world conflicts that have 
led to war, for example. Arguably, conflict escalated as a result of neither side 
being willing to negotiate a reasonable solution for all involved. As we discussed 
in Chapter 5, ‘saving face’ is a primary concern for humans (Goffman, 1955), 
and conceding more than one wants to concede, or backing down on a conflict 
from which a hard bargain is being driven, can mean a serious loss of face. 
2 Mediation: Sometimes, it is not possible to solve a problem without a third 
(independent) party stepping in to help. Using a mediator usually means that

Improving intergroup relations
the parties are both prepared to make concessions and if the concessions are 
made with the aid of another person, it is possible for face to be saved (Pruitt, 
1998). Neither party is seen as weak if they both concede equally, with the help 
of another person. How does mediation work? Specifically, mediators help 
resolve conflicts by helping conflicting parties to rethink the situation and gain 
information about each other’s perspective. This perspective-taking technique 
has been found to decrease stereotyping of a target (Esses and Dovidio, 2002; 
Galinsky and Moskowitz, 2000; Thompson, 1990). However, sometimes it is 
difficult to achieve (Carroll, Bazerman and Maury, 1988; Galinsky and Muss-
weiler, 2001), especially in intercultural contexts, which are common in political 
conflict (e.g., Bond and Smith, 1996). Likewise, learning information about 
someone can overcome reliance on stereotypes (Crawford, Jussim, Madon et 
al., 2011; Locksley, Borgida, Brekke and Hepburn, 1980). These processes allow 
the mediator to turn the situation into one where both parties can win. Indeed, 
Thompson (1990) found that with experience, mediators become more skilled 
at making losing situations into winning ones. A key factor that a mediator 
needs to build between groups is trust (Ross and Ward, 1995) and this begins 
by building trust with the mediator themselves. Then, through a process of 
negotiation, perspective-taking and explicit statement of a group’s concerns, the 
conflict can be overcome (e.g., Kelman, 1997; Staub, Pearlman and Miller, 2003; 
Staub, Pearlman, Gubin and Hagengimana, 2005).
Arbitration: Occasionally, the conflict may be too intense or the underlying 
interests of the groups may be too different for negotiation to work, even with 
the aid of a mediator. In such a case, it may be necessary for a third-party arbi-
trator to actually impose a settlement on both groups. As you can imagine, this 
is a difficult task – the arbitrator needs to carefully study each group’s history, 
current position, concerns, interests and so on and devise a resolution that is 
mutually beneficial, or as beneficial for both groups as it can possibly be. This 
is also a risky option for conflicting parties to take. How can each group be 
sure that the arbitrator will do what is best for them? It is for this reason that 
groups tend to prefer to bargain or go through a mediator than have a conflict 
resolved for them through arbitration (McGillicuddy, Welton and Pruitt, 1987). 
Real-world examples attest to the effectiveness of these techniques. For 
example, a successful mediation process was instrumental in resolving the Israel–
Egypt conflict in the late 1970s. US President Jimmy Carter brought Egyptian 
President Anwar Sadat and Israel’s Prime Minister Menachem Begin together and 
after 13 days of mediation, an agreement was reached that ended the long-standing 
conflict. A classic example of how bargaining may have helped resolve conflict can 
be seen in the media communication between US President George Bush (senior) 
and Saddam Hussein over the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait in 1990. A hard line was 
driven between the two groups when Bush promised to ‘kick Saddam’s ass’ and 
Hussein promised to make the ‘infidel’ Americans ‘swim in their own blood’ and 
sadly there was no going back from there.

Applying
Unfortunately, communication processes may be completely ineffective when 
conflicting parties are so suspicious of each other. In such instances, a process 
advocated by Osgood (1962) may be effective. This graduated and reciprocated initi-
atives in tension reduction (griT) approach works on the principle that one side in the 
conflict initiates a few small de-escalatory actions after declaring a desire to 
de-escalate conflict. Often, this intention is made public so that the pressure is on 
the other group to reciprocate the efforts of the other side. If done voluntarily, the 
technique may promote a series of conciliatory actions that lead to de-escalation 
of the conflict. There is some evidence to suggest this works. For example, in the 
laboratory, social dilemmas have been found to be resolvable through a bit of ‘give 
and take’, where conflicting parties match each others’ efforts (e.g., van Lange and 
Visser, 1999). However, this strategy can easily fall apart if one group refuses to be 
cooperative (e.g., Lindskold, 1981). 
Collective action
Sometimes, the most effective way to improve intergroup relations may not be to 
try to improve the way groups feel about each other, nor to bring them together in 
collaborative processes such as bargaining and reconciliation. The most problem-
atic intergroup relations tend to involve entrenched inequality and conflicts of 
interest. In these conditions, ill feeling is a less important problem to solve than 
the material disadvantages that are built into the relationship between groups. 
Also, it is less likely in such circumstances that groups will approach each other 
with a sincere spirit of collaboration and reconciliation. Thus, the most effective 
way to improve intergroup relations may be collective action (Blumer, 1939; 
Major, 1994; Olson, 1965; Turner and Killian, 1993). In its general sense, collective 
action can be defined as the pursuit of goals by more than one person. It is a type 
of group behaviour, which was our focus throughout Chapter 10. However, in the 
social psychological study of intergroup relations, the term is a shorthand for the 
coordinated actions of disadvantaged group members in order to change inter-
group relations. 
Sometimes, collective action is not taken by group members on their own 
behalf, but in the wider cause of justice and in response to the needs of other 
groups (Thomas, McGarty and Mavor, 2009a). On 15 February 2003, in the cold 
of an English winter, hundreds of thousands of British people descended on 
London’s streets to protest against the forthcoming invasion of Iraq. For several 
years from 1998, many thousands of non-Indigenous Australians circumvented 
their government’s refusal to apologize for historical wrongs against Indigenous 
Australians by signing a ‘sorry book’ that contained a collective apology (Leach, 
Iyer and Pederson, 2006). However, since people are more likely to take action en 
masse on behalf of their own group, research has focused mostly on this type of 
collective action (see Figure 12.14). Overwhelmingly, the study of collective action 
is focused on protest (e.g., van Stekelenburg and Klandermans, 2012; van Zomeren,

Postmes and Spears, 2008), but other forms of collective action 
may include lobbying, organized charity and volunteering 
(Thomas, McGarty and Mavor, 2009b). Some famous examples 
of collective action have led to material advances in the welfare of 
the group and for wider intergroup relations. These include the 
velvet revolutions of the late 1980s and early 1990s in Europe, 
which led to the overthrow of Communist regimes throughout 
central and Eastern Europe, the civil rights movement in 
America, and the feminist and gay rights movements of the 1960s 
to the present day. Other examples of collective action have failed 
owing to crushing counteractions by authorities and advantaged 
groups, exemplified in the Tiananmen Square massacre of student 
protestors in 1989 in China. At the time of writing, other examples of collective 
action are ongoing and are meeting both success and failure, as in the Arab Spring 
pro-democracy protests and insurgencies in North Africa and the Middle East. 
What motivates people to take collective action to improve their group’s situa-
tion? After meta-analysis of many studies of collective action, van Zomeren, 
Postmes et al. (2008) concluded that three interrelated variables are of crucial 
importance. In their integrative social identity model of collective action (SIMCA), 
identity is central. People who are highly identified with their group are more 
likely to coordinate with others and act on its behalf. As we saw in Chapters 8 and 
11, strong identifiers are more willing to make personal sacrifices in the interests 
of their group, more likely to trust and feel close to other members of their group, 
and more likely to share their emotional reactions to situations (Mackie, Smith 
and Ray, 2008). Thus, it is not surprising that identification straightforwardly 
promotes collective action. 
The relationship between identification and collective action is not only direct, 
however. It is also mediated by two other variables, which themselves affect the 
likelihood of collective action. One of these is perceived injustice. The more people 
perceive intergroup relations to be unjust, the more motivated they are to take 
collective action to repair the injustice. As we shall see in Chapter 14, justice is 
important to people, and under the right conditions, they will go to considerable 
lengths to correct injustices. In particular, feelings of relative deprivation are 
important (we shall learn more about this concept in Chapter 13). Relative depriva-
tion is the sense that one, or one’s group, is deprived of benefits that others enjoy. 
Feeling relative deprivation as individuals, people often respond in counterproduc-
tive ways, including with aggression. But when they share with others a sense that 
their group is relatively deprived – a feeling known as fraternal, or group-based 
relative deprivation, they are likely to take collective action (Dubé-Simard and 
Guimond, 1986; Runciman, 1966; van Zomeren, Spears and Leach, 2008). The 
more strongly people identify with their disadvantaged group, the more they tend 
to perceive its situation as unjust. Finally, an important variable is the perceived 
efficacy of the group to change its situation. When collective action seems destined 
to fail, or to achieve only small gains, people are less likely to engage. People who

strongly identify with their disadvantaged group are 
more likely to perceive that it has the power to make a 
difference to its own situation (Mummendey, Kessler, 
Klinke and Mielke, 1999) (see Figure 12.15). Other 
models of collective action are broadly similar to the 
SIMCA model, but some emphasize other factors such 
as intergroup emotions, including anger (van Stekelen-
burg and Klandermans, 2012).

Improving intergroup relations is a primary concern for social 
psychologists. In this chapter we considered the major 
strategies to do so. Specifically, you have learned that:
•  One method of prejudice reduction is to favour minority 
groups over majorities in isolated episodes. this is called 
tokenism, and although it may be well intentioned, one 
problem is that it can be used unconsciously as a means to 
disguise one’s prejudices. Other specific forms of tokenism 
are affirmative action and the positive feedback bias. 
•  A more extreme version of tokenism is reverse 
discrimination, where people who harbour negative 
attitudes towards particular minority groups display pro-
minority behaviour or public behaviour that favours the 
minority, as a way to deflect accusations of prejudice. A 
challenge for social psychologists is to separate well-
intentioned behaviour from behaviour that has intentions to 
conceal underlying negative attitudes. 
•  Intergroup contact has become the most studied method of 
reducing prejudice. the basic tenet of contact theory is that 
bringing together members of opposing groups should 
improve intergroup relations and reduce prejudice and 
discrimination, if certain optimal conditions are met 
(equality of status, common goals, intergroup cooperation 
and the support of authorities, law or custom). Research 
suggests that contact is generally effective in reducing 
prejudice. 
•  When contact is not possible, research shows that 
participants who are asked to think about vicarious contact – 
contact that friends or acquaintances have with minorities – 
show reduced prejudice. this is called extended contact. 
Simply imagining positive contact with an outgroup 
member can reduce prejudice in laboratory settings. 
•  techniques based on the cognitive process of categorization 
have also been used to reduce prejudice. For example, the 
common ingroup identity model suggests that if members 
of opposing groups are encouraged to recategorize 
themselves as members of the same ingroup, intergroup 
attitudes will improve. However, it may be 

555
Improving intergroup relations
counterproductive to ignore identification with smaller, 
more distinct groups. It is best to complement this 
identification with superordinate identities that can include 
other groups. Another model – the social identity complexity 
model – argues that the more complex a person’s social 
identity, that is, the less their group memberships overlap or 
are related to each other, the more positive they are likely to 
feel about the outgroup. 
•  Other approaches have been concerned with values such as 
tolerance, multiculturalism and egalitarianism, which may 
encourage positive attitudes and behaviours towards 
outgroups. In particular, multiculturalism – the ideology that 
diversity should be acknowledged and celebrated – is 
successful compared to approaches that downplay 
differences between groups (e.g., colour blindness).
•  Social psychologists have investigated the extent to which 
people are able to suppress prejudice. Social norms suggest 
it is no longer acceptable to express overt prejudice towards 
many groups. Suppression, however, can sometimes 
backfire as in the case of stereotype rebound – once a person 
has finished suppressing an unwanted thought, it can come 
back stronger than ever. 
•  Another approach that is more directly related to real-world 
conflict is the role of the media in shaping (and potentially 
changing for the better) people’s beliefs and behaviours. It 
is argued that using the media overcomes many of the 
limitations of laboratory experimentation. 
•  Apology is seen as an obligation of a group that has 
transgressed against another group. there are said to be 
several features that make a good apology. 
•  Direct communication and negotiation may be a useful way 
to reduce intergroup tensions, through processes of 
bargaining, mediation and arbitration. 
•  Another way of improving intergroup relations is to take 
collective action. Here, group members work together to 
promote a common cause. this cause may be the interests of 
their own group, or wider causes such as justice, peace and 
equality. Social identity, perceived injustice and the 
perceived efficacy of the group in being able to bring about 
positive changes are important to collective action. 
Intergroup emotions may also play a key role. Collective 
action is often aimed at eliminating inequality and injustice, 
rather than creating goodwill or reducing prejudice.
In this chapter, you have acquired a comprehensive knowledge 
of social psychologists’ progress on the important issue of 
reducing intergroup conflict. We have outlined a wide range of 
strategies that continue to change (and new techniques 
emerge) as social psychologists get to grips with the 
complexities of intergroup conflict. In Chapter 13, we focus on 
yet another dark side of human behaviour – human aggression.

In the past decade or so, researchers have begun to look beyond 
simple prejudice – a negative emotional reaction or attitude to 
an outgroup – and have explored more textured, nuanced 
emotions towards other groups (Iyer, 2008; Mackie and Smith, 
2004; Mackie et al., 2008; thomas et al., 2009a). We can 
experience a range of negative emotions such as anger, fear, 
disgust and envy towards other groups. When people’s social 
categorization is salient, they are more likely to share these 
emotions with other members of their group, meaning that it

found that the emotion of disgust towards gay people was 
more important than overall prejudice towards them in 
predicting people’s support for gay rights, and pity towards 
Mexican migrants to the USA was more important than 
prejudice in predicting support for caps on immigration. In the 
context of Northern Ireland, tam, Hewstone, Cairns et al. (2007) 
found that anger towards the outgroup predicted decreased 
forgiveness – and that this anger could be reduced by 
intergroup contact. 
Intergroup emotions and intergroup behaviour are involved 
in a complex interplay. this is consistent with contemporary 
theories of emotion, which stress that emotions have 
important functions and are not just by-products of our 
experience. For evolutionary theorists, emotions function to 
control our responses to threats and opportunities in the 
environment (Levenson, 1994; tooby and Cosmides, 1990). 
emotions also serve to resolve problems in relationships

Improving intergroup relations
(keltner and Haidt, 1999). From this functional perspective, we 
would expect emotions to be related to specific action 
tendencies towards outgroups. From intergroup anger, but not 
necessarily disgust, for example, we would expect intergroup 
aggression to follow. Indeed, when groups are unable to 
respond with aggression to an outgroup that has angered 
them, intergroup anger intensifies, and when groups have the 
opportunity to aggress successfully, the emotion dissipates 
(Maitner, Mackie and Smith, 2006). 
Collective guilt is an important intergroup emotion, which 
can motivate perpetrator groups to make amends for their 
behaviour and seek reconciliation with victim groups (Wohl, 
Branscombe and klar, 2006). In two longitudinal studies, Brown, 
González, Zagefka et al. (2008) found that non-indigenous 
Chileans who felt guilty about their group’s actions towards 
indigenous Chileans (the Mapuche) throughout colonial history 
were later more likely to support reparation. Ironically, the 
atrocities committed against the ingroup can reduce feelings of 
guilt about the harmful aspects of its own behaviour. For 
example, Wohl and Branscombe (2008) found that Jewish 
participants, when reminded of the Holocaust, felt less guilty 
about Israeli treatment of Palestinians. Sometimes, people feel 
angry about the perceived transgressions of their group. this 
feeling of ingroup-directed anger, over and above guilt, predicts 
non-Indigenous Australians’ willingness to engage in political 
action to improve the lot of Indigenous Australians (Leach et al., 
2006). British people who felt angry about their country’s 
participation in the war against Iraq were more likely to want to 
compensate Iraq, to confront people seen as responsible for the 
war, such as tony Blair, and to withdraw British troops from Iraq 
(Iyer, Schmader and Lickel, 2007). 
this approach to understanding intergroup relations may 
suggest ways in which intergroup relations can improve. If we 
pay attention not just to the relatively coarse outcome of 
generalized prejudice, but also to the specific emotions that 
people feel towards their own and other groups, we may be 
able to improve intergroup relations.

As we have seen, research thus far has been unable to 
demonstrate a consistent, substantial benefit of intergroup 
apology (Páez, 2010). there have been some studies in which 
an apology from a perpetrator group seems to promote 
forgiveness from members of the victim group (Brown, Wohl 
and exline, 2008), but more that appear to show that 
intergroup apologies fail to elicit forgiveness (Philpot and 
Hornsey, 2008, 2011). Indeed, when the victim group appears 
to reject an apology, members of the perpetrator group may 
react with adverse intergroup emotions including anger, as well 
as a reduced desire to compensate victim groups (Harth et al., 
2011). this is not to say that there is not a strong moral case for 
groups to apologize. the rights and wrongs of apology may not 
reduce, in a utilitarian way, to the costs and benefits of apology 
(Barkan, 2000; Blatz and Philpot, 2010; Wohl et al., 2011). Still, 
the case for making intergroup apologies would be stronger if 
we had evidence for positive effects. As Philpot and Hornsey 
(2008, p. 486) put it, ‘the time is ripe for a systematic 
exploration of what effects intergroup apologies have’. there 
are reasons to suggest that intergroup apologies may have 
some or all of the following benefits to the victim group, which 
remain largely neglected by research thus far. Specifically, 
intergroup apologies may:
1 Boost the collective self-esteem of the victim group. 
Research on interpersonal apologies suggests they may 
enhance the dignity or ‘face’ of both perpetrator and victim 
(Gonzales, 1992; Hodgins and Liebeskind, 2003). Receiving 
an apology may enhance victim group members’ 
perceptions of the worth of the group, and may help them 
feel that their group is valued by others. this is known as 
private and public collective self-esteem, respectively.

(Philpot, Balvin, Mellor and Bretherton, 2011). this may 
translate into optimism that efforts to gain concessions 
from the perpetrator group will be successful. 
•  Strengthening the identification of members of the 
victim group. An intergroup apology acknowledges the 
reality of transgression and confirms a dichotomous 
categorization of groups. It acknowledges that the

Student project 
The effectiveness of imagined contact
Zara Christie studied as an 
undergraduate student at the 
University of Leeds and her final-
year dissertation was supervised 
by Dr Rhiannon turner. Her 
research investigated the 
effectiveness of imagined contact – 
an innovative way to reduce 
prejudice which we considered in 
this chapter.
My topic and aims
My study examined whether imagined contact (that is, 
imagining a social interaction) with an asylum seeker would 
reduce prejudice towards asylum seekers. 
I volunteered with Student Action for Refugees (StAR) 
throughout my degree, teaching english and providing 
support to asylum seekers and refugees. Asylum seekers are a 
stigmatized group and through my volunteering I met many 
who had experienced prejudice in the Uk. After reading about 
imagined contact and discussing my ideas with my 
supervisor, I was able to design a research proposal using this 
paradigm to explore the attitudes of British teenagers 
towards asylum seekers. At the time, neither teenagers nor 
asylum seekers had been used in research exploring the 
efficacy of imagined contact.
My methods
I used the imagined contact paradigm, which is the mental 
simulation of a social interaction with a member of another 
social group. eighty-two 16- and 17-year-olds were randomly 
allocated to one of three conditions: an interaction with an 
asylum seeker, an interaction with an asylum seeker with 
reciprocal disclosure of personal information, or a control 
condition where participants imagined an interaction with an 
ingroup stranger. 
Prior to receiving the instructions, participants read a few 
neutral facts about asylum seekers. Participants in the control 
condition were given this factual information after their 
imagination task. to reinforce the effect of the imagination 
tasks, all participants were instructed to write down details of 
the scenario they had imagined. Following this, participants 
completed a multiple choice questionnaire which assessed 
intergroup bias, specifically measuring intergroup anxiety, 
intergroup trust, outgroup attitudes, approach behavioural 
tendencies, and outgroup stereotypes.
My findings and their implications
Participants in both the imagined contact conditions reported 
significantly more positive attitudes towards asylum seekers 
than those in the control condition. No significant differences 
were found between the three conditions on outgroup 
stereotypes.

Improving intergroup relations
Participants who imagined interacting with an asylum 
seeker, compared to those who imagined self-disclosing 
information to an asylum seeker or interacting with an ingroup 
stranger, reported significantly higher levels of intergroup trust, 
were significantly more likely to report wanting to approach an 
asylum seeker, and also reported significantly lower levels of 
intergroup anxiety. therefore, imagined contact proved to be a 
better intervention than imagined self-disclosure. 
Furthermore, the effect of imagined contact on approach 
behavioural tendencies was mediated by increased intergroup 
trust. this novel finding is valuable as it highlights the 
importance of intergroup trust as well as the possibility of 
imagined contact increasing future intergroup contact. 
My research project was successful in strengthening the 
imagined contact paradigm and further reinforcing the 
paradigm as a prejudice reduction mechanism. Furthermore, it 
demonstrated that imagined contact can successfully reduce 
prejudice within a school environment, suggesting that policy 
makers and educators should implement such interventions to 
promote harmony and tolerance within schools.  
My research has also identified a new mediator – intergroup 
trust – which significantly increased the likelihood of wanting 
to interact with an outgroup member. My work has been 
accepted for publication (turner, West and Christie, in press).   
My journey
After graduating, I worked as a research assistant with my 
project supervisor, before volunteering in Indonesia teaching 
english to survivors of the 2004 Boxing Day tsunami and 
spending a few months travelling around Southeast Asia. On 
my return to the Uk, I volunteered in the audit and evaluation 
team in the Medical Foundation for the Care of Victims of 
torture in London. Following this I was employed by the NHS in 
Ayrshire as a research assistant participating in quantitative 
and qualitative research in psychosocial oncology. After this I 
worked as an assistant psychologist in Oxford and was 
involved in a national craniofacial audit. I have two further 
publications (Snowden et al., 2011, 2012). Recently, I started a 
doctorate in clinical psychology at the University of Glasgow 
and I am currently on an adult mental health placement. I hope 
to be able to work with refugees and asylum seekers during 
my training and once I qualify. 
In choosing my student research project, I learned that it was 
possible to combine different issues I was passionate about: 
working with refugees, and social psychology. While conducting 
my research, I became efficient in managing my time and 
working to personally set deadlines. For example I collected my 
data very early on in the process which gave me more time to 
focus on my analysis and write-up. time management is an 
invaluable skill and allows me to combine my current work as a 
trainee clinical psychologist with attending classes, conducting 
audits, and undertaking assessments. 
My advice
I believe that it is important to choose a research area you are 
really interested in. you will have to read a lot of articles on the 
subject and if you are genuinely interested in it, you will enjoy 
the process and get more out of your research. I worked as a 
research assistant the summer before my final year. I would 
recommend this, as it gives you the opportunity to conduct 
research and enables you to think more concretely about your 
project. I would also advise you to be organized – plan different 
stages of your research (e.g. design, data collection, analysis, 
write-up) and not to leave things to the last minute. 

In this chapter, we outline the causes of aggression and discuss the means by which aggres-
sion may be reduced. We outline the basic types of aggression that researchers have studied. 
We discuss the biological, social and cultural roots of aggressive behaviour, and consider the 
intergroup as well as the interpersonal aspects of aggression. At the end of this chapter, you 
will have learned about the key theories and perspectives in the study of aggression.

Questions to consider
1 Your friend has a punch bag and lets the bag have it 
whenever someone really annoys them. they say it’s a 
good way to let off steam and stops them from doing 
or saying aggressive things to people. Is this coping 
strategy a good idea?
2 Johnny plays a lot of violent video games. Should his 
parents worry that this will make him aggressive? 
3 You are discussing the latest war and one of your female 
friends says: ‘Why are men always so aggressive? If the 
world were run by women, there would be fewer wars!’ 
Is she right? 

562
Applying
Wherever you go in the world, you will encounter human aggression. At whatever 
time of human history (not to mention prehistory) you care to examine, you will 
also find evidence of human aggression. Since time immemorial, people have 
beaten, clubbed, stabbed, choked, hung, shot and tortured each other, applying 
not just their animal strength but also their human ingenuity to the problem of 
how to hurt other people. Indeed, for philosophers such as Hobbes ([1651] 2007), 
extreme levels of aggression are natural for human beings. Hobbes argued that a 
stable infrastructure of laws, institutions and governments is required to keep 
human aggression in check; without it, human life is ‘nasty, brutish, and short’. 
As we shall see in this chapter, there are all sorts of reasons why human beings 
are so aggressive. To some extent, evolution appears to have hard-wired aggres-
sion into our biology, as it has all animals whose survival has depended on the 
ability to fight and kill. Matters are not helped by our ability to feel deprived rela-
tive to others, to experience injustice keenly, to attribute responsibility and inten-
tionality to the annoying or frustrating behaviour of others, and to experience 
anger when we do so. Finally, many of the social processes that begin when we 
gather in groups also seem to lead to aggression. 
Realistically, human beings will always display some aggression, although many 
of our instincts and aspirations are much more noble, as other philosophers such 
as Dryden (see Scott, 1883) and Rousseau ([1749]1998) have pointed out. The 
hope motivating research on aggression is that by understanding its causes, we can 
begin to reduce the terrible toll it takes on the lives of people worldwide. Social 
psychology is well placed to do this. With its commitment to scientific methods, it 
can add evidence and discovery to the insights of philosophers such as Hobbes. 
There is hope, then, that we may be able to alleviate the problem of humanity’s 
inhumanity to humanity. 
What is aggression? This is a difficult question and you will encounter different 
definitions in the literature. At first, you might think of it as doing harm to others. 
However, if you think about it for a while, you will realize that doing harm is not 
a necessary component of aggression. You might try to hit someone, and miss, so 
you have not hurt them – but your act was surely aggressive. Neither is hurt suffi-
cient for aggression. If you make the mistake of going to the dentist, there is a 
good chance they will hurt you. But not all dentists are bad people, and their goal 
is not necessarily to hurt you. Most researchers now think that the intention to 
hurt is a key component of aggression (e.g., Geen, 1990). Thus, a decent working 
definition for aggression is behaviour primarily intended to harm another living 
being. Note that ‘harm’ is a broad term and this is deliberate. Although physical 
aggression is probably the form of aggression that comes most easily to mind, and 
is discussed the most in this chapter, much aggression does not involve physical 
harm. Insults, malicious gossip, ostracism and hate speech are all acts of social 
aggression that are intended to harm, but will not break your bones or directly 
cause you any kind of physical damage. 
Among nonhuman animals, it is also useful to distinguish two types of aggres-
sion. Hostile aggression occurs between members of the same species, is accompa-

Understanding and controlling aggression
nied by displays of anger and is often triggered by competition over resources 
such as food, mates or status. Instrumental (or ‘silent’) aggression occurs between 
animals of different species, such as predator–prey pairs, and is not accompanied 
by displays of anger (Bushman and Anderson, 1998; Renfrew, 1993). This distinc-
tion has often been applied to human aggression, too. In humans, hostile aggres-
sion (also known as ‘impulsive’, ‘affective’, or ‘angry’ aggression) is said to be 
accompanied and motivated by angry feelings, typically impulsive rather than 
thought out, and motivated entirely to hurt someone. In contrast, instrumental 
aggression is premeditated, rather more coolly calculated behaviour that is moti-
vated to hurt someone, but in the service of some other goal, such as for money or 
revenge. However, its application to human beings has been heavily criticized, 
largely on the basis that many acts of human aggression have hostile and instru-
mental components. Premeditated murder is often motivated by anger, and impul-
sive acts of aggression may be triggered by threats to one’s status or a sense of 
injustice (Bushman and Anderson, 2001). Thus, we will not distinguish between 
these forms of aggression in this chapter.
The human animal: biological bases of aggression
Although human beings’ approach to aggression is uniquely diverse, clever and 
technological, many thinkers have seen our willingness to aggress as part of our 
animal heritage. In their view, human beings, like other animals, have been equipped 
by evolution with a biology that predisposes us to aggress. The most thorough and 
influential statement of this biological view of aggression was made by Lorenz 
(1966), an Austrian ethologist who was awarded the Nobel Prize for his work. 
Biological drive theories of aggression
Lorenz’s analysis of aggression was heavily influenced by two great thinkers. 
From Freud ([1930]2004), he got the idea that human behaviour is instinctive and 
affected by the psychodynamic build-up and release of energies within the indi-
vidual. From Darwin ([1859]1996), he got the idea that instincts are acquired 
through natural selection, and that natural selection is driven by struggle between 
rivals. For Lorenz (1966, p. 27), it is ‘always favourable for the species if the 
stronger of two rivals takes possession of the territory or of the desired female’. 
As a result of this evolutionary pressure, human beings and most other animals 
have developed a ‘fighting instinct’, causing them to aggress against members of 
the same species. This fighting instinct drives our behaviour in much the same way 
as our instinctive desire to eat, drink and have sex – all activities that are central to 
our ability to pass on our genes to our descendants. Lorenz (1966) argued that in 
much the same way as hunger and thirst, the desire to aggress is a kind of energy 
that builds up within the organism, getting stronger and stronger. It is released 
when external circumstances, such as the annoying or provocative behaviour of 
another person, allow the organism to ‘consummate’ its desire to aggress. 
Ethology the study of animal 
behaviour.

Applying
Lorenz’s analysis has two important and rather depressing implications for 
human aggression. First, it implies that aggression is inevitable, being caused by a 
biologically programmed, hormonally regulated build-up of aggressive energy 
that needs to find some release. Second, it implies that in much the same way as 
hungry people go looking for food, people whose aggressive energy has built up 
to uncomfortable levels will seek out opportunities to aggress – to pick fights and 
look for trouble. Is this level of pessimism warranted? This depends on how well 
Lorenz’s theory stacks up conceptually, and whether it is supported by evidence. 
Although it is important that we treat theories and findings on their scientific 
merits (as we saw in Chapter 3, people are inclined to wishful thinking, being 
sceptical of strong science that contradicts their cherished beliefs, and uncritically 
accepting of weak science that reinforces their preconceptions), it is perhaps fortu-
nate that there are some important reasons to be sceptical about the pessimistic 
implications of Lorenz’s theory. 
For one thing, his analysis was built on a flawed understanding of evolutionary 
theory. You will note that Lorenz (1966) argued that aggression is ‘favourable for 
the species’, but natural selection is not driven by the survival of the species. 
Evolution is driven much more strongly by what is good for individuals and their 
families than what is good for larger groups – especially groups as large as an 
entire species (Dawkins, 1976; Dunbar, 1993, 1998). And although it is clear that 
aggression has been an important part of the success of individual human beings 
and the species as a whole, it is not clear that aggression is always a good thing for 
perpetrators. In human societies, at least, individuals who are overly or inappro-
priately aggressive, even if they manage to avoid incurring serious injury or death 
in the process, often find themselves punished and excluded by the group (e.g., 
Barner-Barry, 1986). This is scarcely a recipe for reproductive success. Thus, it 
would seem unlikely that there would be any advantage in having a hard-wired 
need to aggress that gets stronger the longer it is pent up. 
Another major problem for Lorenz’s theory arises from one of its most central 
ideas. For Lorenz, the build-up of aggressive energy within an individual may not 
lead to disastrous acts of aggression if it is released in a process known as catharsis. 
This is the familiar idea that if you can harmlessly release pent-up feelings of anger 
and frustration, you are less likely to actually take them out on someone else. As 
the idea goes, if you whack a punch bag, burn an effigy of your lecturer or even 
engage in revenge fantasies, your aggressive energy will dissipate. You may not be 
restored to a Zen-like calm, but at least you will be less likely to hurt people. 
Lorenz’s thinking on catharsis was similar to, and no doubt influenced by, Freud’s. 
Freud attributed human aggression to thanatos, a death instinct he thought was 
activated when eros, the innate desire to survive and to foster life, was frustrated 
(although Freud did not himself use the term thanatos, which was later introduced 
by his secretary, Paul Federn). Rather than aggress against themselves, people 
displace their aggressive energy and aggress towards others. Civilized societies are 
able to manage aggression by providing opportunities for catharsis: viewing 
aggressive or blood sports, for example, and expressing anger in milder forms. 
Catharsis the release of pent-
up aggressive energy through 
vicarious or symbolic acts of 
aggression.

Understanding and controlling aggression
The problem with the idea of catharsis, as plausible and in tune with our intui-
tions as it may be, is that it appears to be wrong. Many studies have been 
conducted examining whether catharsis reduces aggression. Cathartic techniques 
that have been studied include using verbal rather than physical aggression to a 
provocateur (Mallick and McCandless, 1966), watching violent films (Siegel, 
1956), taking out one’s aggressive energy on other people (Konecni and Doob, 
1972) or engaging in vigorous physical exercise or contact sports (Frinter and 
Rubinson, 1993). The clear majority of studies show that these attempts to 
cathartically release aggressive impulses do not work (Bushman, Baumeister and 
Phillips, 2001; Geen and Quanty, 1977). Catharsis tends either to have no effect 
or actually makes matters worse, increasing the likelihood of aggression. One 
reason for this may be that precisely because catharsis feels good, it is rewarding. 
Thus, when people engage in cathartic release by watching other people aggress, 
or engaging in symbolic substitutes for aggression, they risk teaching themselves, 
subtly and unconsciously, that aggression is rewarding (see the material on social 
learning theory, below). 
So why is the notion of catharsis so intuitively appealing? This is an interesting 
question that, as far as we can tell, has not been researched. Indeed, this ‘blind 
spot’ in social psychology might make an interesting student research project. 
Probably, we have all found it rewarding to engage in some kind of cathartic 
activity. If the activity is physically demanding, exciting or rewarding, then the 
flood of hormones such as adrenaline and endorphins is likely to have an imme-
diate, short-term, positive effect on our sense of wellbeing. Indeed, Bushman et al. 
(2001) found that people engage in cathartic acts of aggression in order to improve 
their mood. For example, if they were told that a pill they had just taken as part of 
the experiment had the effect of freezing their mood, they no longer engaged in 
cathartic aggression. If something feels good, we may be inclined to feel that it is 
good for us in other ways, such as releasing our aggressive feelings. The fact that 
we are effectively training ourselves to be aggressive when we engage in cathartic 
feelings is less likely to be available to conscious awareness. 
Another interesting possibility is suggested by the ‘embodied social cognition’ 
perspective we considered in Chapter 4. Lakoff and Johnson (1999) argue that 
people’s understanding of the world is often based on their bodily experiences. 
Because anger and frustration lead to muscular tension and rising blood pressure 
(e.g., Kamarck, Shiffman, Smithline et al., 1998), we experience a bodily feeling of 
heat and pressure. As a result, we talk about anger in terms of related physical 
metaphors (Eatough and Smith, 2006). Very angry people are ‘at boiling point’, 
and need to ‘vent’ or ‘let off steam’, otherwise they will ‘blow their top’, and so 
on. The notion of catharsis makes sense to us because, arguably, it corresponds to 
the metaphorical sense we make of anger and aggression. In this case, we are 
perhaps misled by our metaphors. Those who believe that catharsis is effective 
may be drawn to the very behaviours that will make their aggression worse. 
Indeed, a study of participants in nonaggressive and aggressive sports found that 
participants who believed in catharsis were more likely to engage heavily in 

566
Applying
aggressive sport (Wann, Carlson, Holland et al., 1999). As we shall see later in this 
chapter, engaging in aggressive physical sports is a highly counterproductive way 
to reduce off-field aggression. 
Exploring further You can do a quick informal test to highlight the intuitive appeal of drive theories and 
catharsis in the popular understanding of aggression. Referring to question 1 at the start of the chapter, ask some 
friends this question, without mentioning the ‘letting off steam’ part. Get them to explain their answer. Without 
you prompting them with these ideas, do they spontaneously talk about anger and aggression in terms of energy, 
pressure, heat, release, cooling down and venting? Scientists rely partly on metaphor and intuition when building 
theories (Fletcher, 1995). Do you think that theorists such as lorenz (1966) may have been informed by 
commonsense metaphors of anger and aggression when they postulated that catharsis is an effective means of 
defusing aggressive tendencies? 
There are some final points worth making about catharsis. First, there are some 
instances where being able to aggress works, as if there were indeed a cathartic 
release of energy. In a set of studies conducted in the 1960s, Hokanson (1974) 
found that being able to retaliate against an aggressor allowed people’s blood pres-
sure to return more quickly to normal. However, this only happened when partici-
pants could retaliate against the original wrongdoer, when the retaliation was seen 
as justifiable, and when the wrongdoer was not intimidating. This looks less like 
the mechanical release of energy than satisfaction that justice has finally been done 
(see Chapter 14) – ‘I’ve given this person what they deserve, and it’s over now’. 
The second point about catharsis is that its failure to work does not disconfirm 
the biological approach to aggression. It simply disconfirms aspects of some 
biological theories of aggression, such as Lorenz’s (1966). As we shall see in the rest 
of this chapter, there is plenty of evidence that aggression is influenced by biological 
factors, including our genes, our brain chemistry and our brain structure. 
Question to consider Now that you have read the material on the notion of catharsis, reread question 1 at the 
start of the chapter. Do you think your friend’s aggression levels are likely to drop by using the punch bag?
Genetic influences on aggression
The core of the biological approach to aggression is that the predisposition to 
aggress, under some circumstances, must have been of survival value to our ances-
tors and therefore must have been shaped by evolution. If so, we should expect to 
see some evidence that the tendency to aggress can be inherited. The answer seems 
to be clearly yes, at least in studies of nonhuman animals. In a striking study, 
Swedish researchers Lagerspetz and Lagerspetz (1971; Lagerspetz, 1979) isolated 
mice that appeared to be aggressive from those that displayed low levels of aggres-
sion, breeding these mice in two separate bloodlines. After 26 generations, they 
had created a race of aggressive, territorial, difficult to handle ‘warrior mice’, and 
another race of ‘pacifist’ mice. 
In a larger scale study conducted in Siberia, the biologists Belyaev (1979) and 
Trut (1999) bred from a semi-wild population of Russian silver foxes. When the 
breeding programme started in 1959, the vast majority of these foxes behaved as 

567
Understanding and controlling aggression
we would expect wild animals to behave. They displayed intense fear when human 
beings approached them and would often try to bite the handlers. Belyaev and 
Trut selected those foxes that were least wild and bred from them, for generation 
after generation. Each generation became successively tamer, showing less fear and 
more willingness to be handled. After a few generations, foxes with an ‘elite’ level 
of domestication began to appear. These foxes did more than tolerate their human 
handlers, indeed, they actively sought out contact with humans and displayed 
affectionate, friendly behaviours towards them, much as a domestic dog would 
normally do. Although these animals were a small minority even after 10 genera-
tions of breeding for tameness, they comprised over two-thirds of the population 
after 30 or so generations of breeding (see Figure 13.1).

Notably, these behavioural characteristics were accompanied by some striking 
physical changes. Much more often than in the first, wild generation, the later, 
tame generations tended to have tails that were short or rolled in a circle and to 
have floppy ears. Most particularly, they displayed changes in their colour (that is, 
pigmentation). They tended to be more mottled, have a higher incidence of grey 
hairs and to show a white (depigmented) ‘star’ pattern on their face. The 
researchers point out that this pattern of depigmentation is common to many 
breeds of domestic dog. Indeed, large white patches are common to many domes-
ticated animals, and relatively rare in the wild. It seems that the genes controlling 
aggression in many animals are also responsible for a number of physical charac-
teristics. For biologists like Belyaev (1979) and Trut (1999), this makes sense – 
behaviour, aggression included, is regulated by hormones and neurochemicals, so 
selecting for tameness and against aggression amounts to selecting animals 
according to their endocrinology. These biochemical features regulate not just 
behaviour but all sorts of physical characteristics as the animal grows. 
The Siberian silver fox experiment, like Lagerspetz’s (1979) ‘warrior mice’ 
study, provides a controlled demonstration of commonsense wisdom about 
animals. Wild animals tend to be born wild and cannot be tamed. Some species are 
more aggressive than others. Some breeds within species are more aggressive than 
others, which is why certain dogs, such as the American pit bull, are banned in

several countries (e.g., DEFRA, 2009). Indeed, these experiments can be seen 
merely as accelerated simulations of the selective breeding to which people have 
been subjecting their animals for millennia, giving us the array of domesticated 
animals we see today. This seems to provide compelling evidence that the level of 
aggression shown by nonhuman animals, and potentially ourselves, is indeed 
influenced by genes. 
Time to reflect A central plank of evolutionary psychology is that important aspects of our behaviour are 
controlled by our genes. Are the silver fox and warrior mice studies definitive evidence that this point is right? 
For obvious ethical and practical reasons, there has not been a study on human 
beings to determine whether levels of aggression can be affected by breeding. One 
hopes there never will be. In the absence of controlled experimental evidence that 
aggression is heritable, researchers have instead relied on two main types of 
research to determine whether our genes can help to cause us become aggressive. 
The first is a type of correlational study known as a twin study. Monozygotic or 
‘identical’ twins have exactly the same genetic makeup because they are the 
product of the splitting of a single fertilized egg. If aggression is caused partly by 
genetic variations, then we would expect to find a close relationship between the 
aggression levels of monozygotic twins. This relationship should be less strong 
between dizygotic twins and between other siblings, who share less genetic mate-
rial in common (see Figure 13.2). For example, Raine (1993) studied twins of 
convicted criminals in the USA. Half of convicts’ identical twins but only one-
fifth of their non-identical twins also had criminal records. Thus, the more genes 
that twins of convicts have in common, the more likely they are to share their 
criminality. Many studies produce similarly stronger relationships between the 
aggression levels of monozygotic twins than dizygotic twins (e.g., Tuvblad, Raine, 
Zheng and Baker, 2009). A study of 234 Canadian six-year-old twins suggested 
that physical but not social forms of aggression may have a genetic basis (Brendgen, 
Dionne, Girard et al., 2005). 
Twin studies suggest that roughly 50 per cent of the variation in human aggres-
sion is attributable to our genes (Miles and Carey, 1997). However, this method-
ology has a number of weaknesses. First, it is hard to pin down cause and effect 
because twin studies are essentially correlational, relating naturally occurring genetic 
and behavioural variations to each other. The obvious potential confound or ‘third 
cause’ in this research is that genetic similarities normally go hand in hand with 
environmental similarities. Siblings not only share genetic material but are normally 
raised in the same households. Identical twins may share exactly the same genetic 
makeup but also are often treated and even dressed more similarly than other 
siblings. Although researchers normally attempt some control over these variables, 
it is difficult and probably impossible in practice to measure and control for all the 
complex environmental variables that affect our aggression levels as we grow up. 
Some studies attempt to deal with this problem by focusing on twins who 
were separated at, or soon after, birth. Obviously, twins reared apart may have

twins are compared to those

seen as heritable if they are 
shared significantly more 
among monozygotic twins. 
Stronger evidence of a genetic 
component comes from 
studies of twins reared apart.

quite different environments even if they are genetically identical. These studies, 
too, suggest that the aggression levels of monozygotic twins are more similar 
than those of less closely related, dizygotic twins. In an early example of such 
a study, Tellegen, Lykken, Bouchard et al. (1988) not only observed this result, 
but also found that the relationship between the self-reported aggression levels 
of monozygotic twins was equally as strong when they were raised apart as when 
raised together (see Figure 13.3). They concluded that the environment alone 
cannot explain aggression. However, these studies also have their problems. Twins 
reared apart developed in the same womb, within 
which hormonal exposure to chemicals such as 
testosterone may have lasting effects on aggres-
sion (Ramirez, 2003). Their physical similarity, for 
example their size and level of physical attractive-
ness, is likely to mean that they will still be treated 
more similarly than other sibling pairs (you may 
recall the effects of physical attractiveness on 
social judgements in Chapter 3). Also, some meta-
analyses have suggested that the apparent effect of 
genetics is strong in self-reports of aggression, as 
in questionnaires, but small or nonexistent when 
aggressive behaviour is observed in the laboratory 
(Miles and Carey, 1997).
Generally, studies that have attempted to link genes to human behaviour 
produce mixed results (Ebstein, 2006). Even if we are prepared to accept that our 
behaviour is affected by our genes, the relationship is bound to be complicated, 
normally involving more than one gene, and certainly involving a raft of environ-
mental factors that shape the way our genetics are expressed. But there is some 
direct evidence of a genetic component of aggression in human beings. For 
example, women with a mutation on a gene known as AP-2 have been found to 
show increased rates of indirect or social aggression (Damberg, 2005). These find-
ings come from a second type of correlational research, which looks for relation-
ships between genes and behaviours. 
Mutations in a gene called monoamine oxidase A (MAO-A), located on the X 
chromosome, have received considerable research attention as a possible cause of 
aggression. This makes some sense because MAO-A acts to effectively ‘switch off’ 
neurotransmitters, including serotonin, which control many aspects of our mood 
and behaviour. For this reason, MAO-A has been found to be related to depres-
sion (Yu, Tsi, Hong et al., 2005). Crucially, as we shall see, low levels of serotonin 
are associated with increased rates of aggression. Indeed, variations in MAO-A 
levels in the brain have been linked to increased aggression and delinquency rates 
in teenagers and young adults (Guo, Ou, Roettger and Shih, 2008). 
Although there is some evidence for genetic involvement in aggression, the 
relationship between genes and human behaviour is generally complicated, rather 
weak and dependent on a number of environmental factors. Thus, we should not

expect genes to have a strong or straightforward effect on our behaviour. They 
may have no impact whatsoever, until an environmental trigger comes along 
(Ebstein, 2006). Some findings suggest that the MAO-A gene interacts with envi-
ronmental factors to shape human aggression, and authors have even suggested 
that it may play a role in aggravating the ‘cycle of violence’, by which maltreated 
children themselves grow up to be more aggressive adults. In one study, a specific 
variation in the MAO-A gene was found to elevate the chance that maltreated 
children would go on to develop psychopathy (Caspi, McClay, Moffitt et al., 2002). 
Psychopathy is a personality disorder featuring reduced empathy and conscience, 
and is associated with an increased willingness to exploit and aggress against 
others. This finding led Gibbons (2004) to label the mutated MAO-A as the 
warrior gene. However, Caspi et al. were only able to find this effect of MAO-A 
among ethnically European participants, and not among other ethnic groups 
(Crampton and Parkin, 2007). 
Some controversies surrounding MAO-A research illustrate the social and 
political implications of explaining human behaviour in terms of genetic influ-
ences. The labelling of a specific mutation as ‘the warrior gene’ is a striking 
example of how scientific concepts are sometimes ‘branded’ in vivid ways that 
capture public attention but overstate their importance. Fully 34 per cent of 
ethnically white participants have the ‘warrior gene’ (Caspi et al., 2002), of whom 
only a small proportion could, presumably, be termed ‘warriors’. Nonetheless, 
this concept has been used successfully to reduce the sentence of a convicted 
murderer. In the American state of Tennessee, Bradley Waldroup attempted to 
kill his estranged wife with a machete and shot dead her friend. The defence 
argued that because Waldroup had the warrior gene, he should be held less 
responsible for his crimes. The jury agreed and commuted his sentence from 
death to 32 years’ imprisonment (Barber, 2010). Whatever one thinks about the 
rights and wrongs of the death penalty, it is remarkable that a jury perceived this 
man to be less responsible for his crime because he possessed a gene linked so 
weakly to aggressive behaviour. 
There has also been considerable controversy regarding ethnic differences in 
the incidence of the so-called ‘warrior gene’. For example, this gene is more 
common among the indigenous Ma¯ori of New Zealand. In a 
conference presentation, some researchers commented on this 
finding and suggested that it might be because of the increased 
adaptive value of warrior-like behaviour among the Ma¯ori as they 
migrated across the Pacific and established new colonies (Lea, 
Hall, Green and Chambers, 2005, cited in Lea and Chambers,

incidence of psychopathy 
and aggression among 
ethnically european samples.
FigurE 13.4 Who has the ‘warrior gene’? Most if not all the people in this crowd are 
white. We can therefore expect roughly a third of them to possess the MAo-A gene 
(Caspi et al., 2002). Yet, there is no evidence in this photograph that members of this 
crowd are hacking each other to pieces. the extremely high frequency of this gene 
suggests that it does not deserve to be labelled the ‘warrior gene’. Relationships 
between genes and behaviour are generally inconsistent and dependent upon 
environmental triggers.

2007). The argument is that the aggression encoded by the ‘warrior gene’ might 
have become more common among the Ma¯ori because those who were more 
warlike were more likely to survive, and pass on their genes, under these circum-
stances. This theorizing was based on a sample that included only 46 Ma¯ori 
participants. Unfortunately, this argument was picked up by the media and some 
politicians as an ‘explanation’ of elevated offending rates among Ma¯ori (Crampton 
and Parkin, 2007). There is no evidence that links MAO-A mutations to offending 
rates among Ma¯ori (Merriman and Cameron, 2007), and as we have seen, the rela-
tionship between these mutations and aggression in other ethnic groups is weak 
and dependent on environmental factors. The tendency to explain ethnic differ-
ences in behaviour in terms of differences in genetic makeup is disturbingly remi-
niscent of the old-fashioned racism that has been so damaging in world history, as 
we saw in Chapter 11. 
Biochemical influences on aggression
Serotonin 
The biological approach assumes not only that behaviour is heritable but that it is 
controlled by chemical processes within the brain and the wider body. Indeed, it 
turns out that aggression is influenced by endocrinological processes. Deficits in 
the levels or the neural uptake of serotonin, a key neurochemical, have been repeat-
edly linked to aggression in both animals and humans. Correlational studies 
examining levels of chemicals in the blood, urine or cerebrospinal fluid show that 
human beings who have chronically low levels of serotonin activity are more 
prone to aggression (Berman, Tracy and Coccaro, 1997; Moore, Scarpa and Raine, 
2002). Evidence of causality is provided by experiments. For example, tryptophan 
is an amino acid found in protein-rich foods such as cheese, soya beans, sesame 
and sunflower seeds, which is used by the body to manufacture serotonin. If 
people are deprived of dietary sources of tryptophan, their serotonin levels drop, 
causing them to be more aggressive (Bjork, Dougherty, Moeller et al., 1999; Bond, 
Wingrove and Critchlow, 2001). 
Drugs that affect serotonin also have an immediate impact on aggressive behav-
iour. Berman, McCloskey, Fanning et al. (2009) gave groups of previously aggres-
sive and nonaggressive participants either a placebo or a dose of paroxetine, a drug 
that increases serotonin activity. Participants in both groups were provoked by a 
fictitious confederate who gave them increasingly intense electric shocks as part of 
a competitive reaction time game. Later, participants were given an opportunity to 
retaliate by delivering shocks back to the confederate. The drug had little effect on 
participants who did not have a history of significant aggression in their lives – 
these participants seldom retaliated, so there was no scope for the drug to make a 
difference. However, among those with a previous history of aggression, the 
paroxetine had a dramatic effect. Those who received the paroxetine dose were 
much less likely to retaliate, giving fewer than one-third as many shocks at the end 
of the experiment than those given the placebo. Intriguingly, a low status or

levels of aggression.

Applying
‘subdominant’ social position seems to reduce serotonin activity, in both animals 
and humans (Manuck, Flory, Ferrell and Muldoon, 2004). Serotonin depletion 
may therefore be a kind of signal that there’s little to lose, that it is worth taking a 
risk by aggressing in order to try to improve one’s position (see Figure 13.5). 
Testosterone 
Men are more likely to engage in acts of serious physical aggression than women 
(Björkqvist, 1994), and have much higher levels of testosterone. Research suggests 
that this could be more than coincidence – aggression really can be heightened, if 
not literally ‘fuelled’, by this chemical (Archer, 1991). Individuals who are chroni-
cally high in testosterone report stronger feelings of tension and agitation, are 
more aggressive, and are more likely to be in prison for unprovoked violent crimes 
(Book, Starzyk and Quinsey, 2001). However, the perennial question – does X 
cause Y, or Y cause X – is posed by a number of studies that suggest that aggres-
sion is associated with testosterone.
One line of studies shows that levels of testosterone rise when men win 
competitive encounters, and drop when they lose. Mazur and Lamb (1980) 
found that testosterone levels rose in men as a result of winning a doubles tennis 
match, and receiving a university degree. Similar results were observed in further 
studies of men (e.g., Booth, Shelley, Mazur et al., 1989) and other animals 
engaging in competitive encounters, including sparrows (Wingfield, 1985), mice 
(Leshner, 1983), fish (Hannes, Franck and Liemann, 1984) and monkeys (Bern-
stein, Rose, Gordon and Grady, 2006). However, research also suggests that 
among humans, who have higher cognitive capacities than other animals, the 
link between winning and elevated testosterone is not a direct one. Gonzalez-
Bono, Salvador, Serrano and Ricarte (1999) found that after a match between 
two professional basketball teams, testosterone only increased if the winners 
made internal attributions for their victory, assigning credit to themselves rather 
than to external circumstances.

with increased risk taking,

Understanding and controlling aggression
Experimental research on animals has shown that if testosterone levels are artifi-
cially increased under controlled conditions, increases in aggression will follow 
(e.g., Bronson and Desjardins, 1968; DeBold and Miczek, 1985). However, the case 
is less clear with humans. Abusers of anabolic steroids offer uncontrolled but natu-
rally occurring experiments – steroids mimic the function of testosterone and users 
report increases in aggressive feelings (Perry, Anderson and Yates, 1990). However, 
people have expectations about the drugs they are taking, which can result in 
placebo effects. Björkqvist, Nygren, Björkland and Björkqvist (1994) found that 
men given testosterone over a one-week period showed no increase in feelings of 
anger, irritation, impulsivity or frustration relative to a group given placebo pills. 
As always, it is hard to interpret experimental results that are null (show no 
effects) or inconsistent. We should not necessarily conclude that testosterone does 
not cause aggression in people. It is possible that testosterone is already at such a 
level in males that introducing more testosterone does not make much of a differ-
ence (Anderson, Bancroft and Wu, 1992). Indeed, it is possible that administering 
testosterone to men experimentally causes their bodies to produce less testosterone, 
undermining the attempt to experimentally alter levels of testosterone in the body 
(Björkqvist et al., 1994). Alternatively, it may be that testosterone affects aggression 
by changing the development of the nervous system over the long term (Bronson 
and Desjardins, 1968), more than by inducing immediate behavioural effects. 
Although the jury is out on the role testosterone plays in aggression, it is often 
cited as a factor that may cause gender differences in aggression (Archer, 1991, 
2009). Meta-analyses of hundreds of studies show that men and boys are more 
likely to engage in physical aggression than women and girls (e.g., Card, Stucky, 
Sawalani and Little, 2008). Roughly 10 times more murders are committed by 
men than by women (Bjorkqvist, Lagerspetz and Osterman, 2002). Approxi-
mately 97 per cent of murders in which offender and victim are the same sex 
involve men, meaning that only 3 per cent involve women (Daly and Wilson, 
1990). However, men and boys do not appear to be any more prone than women 
to social aggression (Card et al., 2008). Also, the role of testosterone in higher 
rates of male physical aggression is unclear (Archer, 1991). Other factors such as 
men’s greater strength, impulsivity and social understandings of gender roles may 
also play a role. For example, Crick, Bigbee and Howes (1996) found that children 
viewed physical aggression as normal outlets of anger among boys, but social 
aggression as a normal outlet for girls. 
Time to reflect the Y chromosome is possessed by roughly one half of the human population (that is, males). 
Research has shown that males are more prone to aggression than females, therefore the Y chromosome is clearly 
related to aggression. Compare this to the much weaker relationship between aggression and possession of the 
MAo-A or ‘warrior gene’ on the X chromosome that we read about earlier. Should we call the Y chromosome the 
‘warrior chromosome’? Should men being tried for murder be able to plead diminished responsibility because they 
possess the Y chromosome? If you are interested in reading more about this topic, we recommend you search the 
internet with the key terms ‘genetic determinism’ and ‘responsibility’.

Alcohol and aggression
In many countries over the past decade or two, a blaze of 
publicity has surrounded the problem of alcohol-fuelled 
aggression in town centres. how real is this concern? Well, 
if you are looking for a statistically powerful cause of 
aggression, look no further than alcohol. here are some 
statistics that are staggering in more than one sense of the 
word. According to the best estimates of many studies, at 
least two-thirds of all murders are committed under the 
influence of alcohol, at least half of sexual offences, and 
around half of all domestic violence offences perpetrated 
by men against their spouses (e.g., Bègue and Subra, 
2008; Roizen, 1997). this is not just correlation, it is also 
causation – any number of experimental studies have 
shown that having participants drink alcohol makes them 
more aggressive (e.g., taylor and Gammon, 1975). If we 
were to eliminate the consumption of alcohol, therefore, 
it is clear that undreamt-of reductions in violence would 
follow. If we were to limit or control its consumption more 
Neuroanatomical influences on aggression
Another line of evidence that biology matters comes from studies on the structure 
of the brain. If it is possible to show that structures in the brain are specialized for 
aggression, then there is evidence that humans and other animals have been hard-
wired with a propensity to aggress. In a series of studies conducted during the 
1950s and 60s, Yale University researcher José Delgado used electrical stimulation 
of specific brain regions (usually the hypothalamus) to achieve more and more 
refined control over the aggressive responses of monkeys and cats. By the mid-
1960s, Delgado (1967) had successfully created what might be termed ‘remote-
controlled monkeys’, whose aggressive and defensive responses could be 
controlled by means of remote-controlled electrodes in their brains. It even 
seemed that monkeys could control each other – a small monkey, for example, was 
able to ‘turn off’ a larger animal when it began to display aggressive tendencies. In 
a notorious, showman-like demonstration of the power of brain stimulation, 
Delgado put himself in a ring with a charging bull and stopped its charge with one 
of his remote-controlled devices. 
Exploring further Delgado pulled off his bullfighting stunt in 1963. use the internet to find out more about it and 
to see still and moving image files. 
People are not immune from this technique of brain control (Blank, 2005). A 
psychiatrist narrowly escaped injury after his client became enraged and smashed 
her guitar after she had received painless electrical stimulation in the amygdala 
(Moyer, 1976). However, more recently evolved brain structures such as the 
prefrontal cortex can sometimes step in, saving us from enacting the aggressive 
impulses being suggested by brainstem and limbic systems deep in our brains. 
Notably, studies using positron emission tomography scanning suggest that the 
prefrontal cortex is significantly less active in murderers and other violent 
offenders than in the general population (e.g., Davidson, Putnam and Larson, 
2000; Raine, Buchsbaum and LaCasse, 1997).

Understanding and controlling aggression
effectively, it is clear 
that substantial 
reductions could also 
be achieved. Ideally, 
campaigns to reduce 
alcohol consumption 
should be targeted at 
those most at risk of 
aggressing. those 
who are aggressive 
even when they are 
sober are more likely 
to drink heavily 
(Gustafson, 1994). 
And when they do 
drink, alcohol has an especially powerful effect on their 
aggression (Bailey and taylor, 1991). unfortunately, big 
men, who are capable of doing the most damage to 
others, are also most prone to becoming aggressive when 
they drink. A recent pair of experiments showed that 
smaller men’s aggression levels are less affected by the 
consumption of alcohol. So, watch out for the ‘big, the 
bad, and the boozed-up’, as the researchers colourfully put 
it (DeWall, Bushman, Giancola and Webster, 2010). 
how does alcohol exert such a massive effect on 
aggression? It is a complex drug and works in many ways. 
It seems to interact with testosterone – mice and human 
beings with high testosterone levels are especially prone 
to the effects of alcohol (deBold and Miczek, 1985). It can 
also interact with other drugs, such as the party drug 
flunitrazepam – mice and rats given combinations of 
alcohol and this drug were especially aggressive (de 
Almeida, Saft, Rosa and Miczek, 2010). Alcohol also works 
to impair the function of the prefrontal cortex, meaning 
that people fall victim to ‘alcohol myopia’ (Steele and 
Josephs, 1990). this is an inability to control their 
behaviour, linked to a failure of imagination – people 
cannot foresee the consequences of their behaviour. 
undoubtedly, there are biochemical pathways, meaning 
that we can see the influence of alcohol on aggression as 
being consistent with the biological approach. however, 
this is not quite the whole story. 
For one thing, it is not always necessary to actually 
drink alcohol; sometimes, it is enough merely to think that 
one has drunk it. there is a small but apparently significant 
placebo effect across studies – if people take a drink that 
contains no alcohol but are told it is alcoholic, they will 
tend to be more aggressive (exum, 2006). this effect may 
be larger when experiments are carefully designed to 
disentangle the effect of real and ‘pretend’ alcohol. In a 
recent study, Bègue, Subra, Arvers et al. (2009) gave one-
third of male participants a non-alcoholic drink, one-third 
a moderately alcoholic drink and one-third a highly 
alcoholic drink. Within each of these experimental 
conditions, one-third of participants were told they were 
drinking a non-alcoholic drink that tasted alcoholic, one-
third were told they were drinking a moderately alcoholic 
drink, and the rest were told they were drinking a highly 
alcoholic drink. In the placebo (no-alcohol) conditions, the 
rims of the glasses were sprayed with a trace of alcohol to 
ensure that all drinks tasted alcoholic. As in several 
previous studies, aggression was measured by the amount 
of hot spice and salt that participants gave to a 
confederate as part of a taste test. In this set-up, 
aggression was affected by what participants believed 
they had drunk, not what they had actually consumed. 
thus, the beliefs, and the culture, that surround alcohol 
seem to be an important determinant of its effects on 
behaviour. Indeed, being primed with alcohol-related 
words on a computer screen appears to activate the 
concept of aggression, making aggression-related words 
easier to identify (Bartholow and heinz, 2006). even 
showing alcohol-related imagery to children who have 
not yet consumed alcohol increases the likelihood that 
they will subsequently aggress in a laboratory task 
(Brown, Coyne, Barlow and Qualter, 2010).
All this means that it will not be enough merely to 
control the consumption of alcohol, although this must be 
an important part of the story. It is also going to be 
necessary to change the way that people think about 
alcohol and its effects. A big problem is that people 
associate alcohol with aggression. Indeed, qualitative 
interviews of untreated heavy drinkers in the West 
Midlands repeatedly showed that these ‘problem’ drinkers 
thought that alcohol was very much to blame for violent 
conduct (Rolfe, Dalton, krishnan et al., 2006). Another 
qualitative study, this time involving men who had been 
involved in violence in pubs and bars in england, also 
revealed a strong cultural equation of alcohol and 
violence. In the words of one participant in the study: ‘It 
feels like you’re drinking testosterone by the glass, liquid 
strength or something. You just feel invincible when 
you’re really hammered or drunk, I guess’ (Graham and 
Wells, 2003, p. 551).

The social animal: social causes of aggression
It is clear by now that human biology plays an important role in aggression. 
However, researchers studying aggression from a biological perspective would 
seldom argue that biology is the only important dimension. Social factors – varia-
bles that arise from our social relationships with others and the social situations in 
which we find ourselves – are also important. Some of the social factors we are 
about to consider are also experienced by other animals (e.g., frustration, heat, 
crowding and pain), whereas others appear to be unique to humans (e.g., the 
perception of relative deprivation and injustice). 
Self-esteem and narcissism
As we saw in Chapter 2, self-esteem can be considered a social rather than a purely 
personality variable. It reflects and is affected by the quality of our relationships 
with other people. Findings of correlational studies attempting to link self-esteem 
to aggression have been mixed (Bushman and Baumeister, 1998). Different facets of 
self-esteem, which are themselves positively related to each other precisely because 
they are dimensions of self-esteem, may have opposite effects on aggression. 
This point was demonstrated by Kirkpatrick, Waugh, Valencia and Webster 
(2002). They examined two aspects of self-esteem: self-perceived superiority 
(feeling better than others) and social inclusion (number of positive social rela-
tionships). Participants high in self-perceived superiority were more likely to 
aggress against a confederate who had marked their essay harshly. Participants 
high in social inclusion were less likely to aggress against the confederate. These 
opposing effects of the two aspects of self-esteem could be detected when each 
was considered separately. However, no relation between overall self-esteem and 
aggression was found, because the different aspects of self-esteem were effectively 
cancelling each other out. Interestingly, Kirkpatrick et al. found that the relation-

578
Applying
ship of the different aspects of self-esteem to aggression occurred over and above 
the effects of narcissism, which was also measured in their study. Finally, the rela-
tionship between self-esteem and aggression may be different among different 
people. For example, Taylor, Davis-Kean and Malanchuk (2007) found that 
although low self-esteem (specifically relating to achievement at school) was 
related to aggression among most of the children in their study, a minority of the 
children showed aggression in response to threats to high self-esteem. 
In recent decades, some researchers have argued that we can expect to find only 
weak or mixed relationships between normal self-esteem and aggression. For these 
researchers, what really matters is a particularly elevated but insecure form of self-
esteem known as narcissism (e.g., Baumeister, Smart and Boden, 1996). Narcissists 
display a positive, even boastful self-image but tend to have implicit doubts about 
their worth. As a result, they go to great lengths to obtain positive feedback from 
others and respond to criticism or other threats to their self-image with hostility. 
Bushman and Baumeister (1998) did indeed find that participants who scored 
highly on a measure of narcissism were more likely to aggress. Participants wrote 
a pro-life or pro-choice essay on the topic of abortion. They were then given 
negative feedback, ostensibly from another participant, such as: ‘This is one of 
the worst essays I have read!’ Later, they were asked to deliver blasts of noise to 
the person they thought had given them this negative feedback, or another 
participant – whoever was slower to answer a series of questions. Crucially, the 
participant was able to adjust the level of the noise, between 60 dB and 105 dB. 
The latter level of noise is very unpleasant indeed, although short bursts are not 
dangerous. Narcissistic participants gave the person they thought had criticized 
their essay louder bursts of noise. They did not give the other participant louder 
bursts of noise any more than non-narcissistic participants. This suggests that 
narcissism leads to aggression that is directed squarely at people who threaten the 
self-image, and does not lead to displaced aggression. However, this experiment 
gave participants a clear choice to vent their aggression either at the person who 
had slighted them or an innocent third party. More recent findings suggest that 
narcissists will indeed be more likely to aggress against innocent people when 
they are unable to retaliate against the person who provoked them (Reidy, Foster 
and Zeichner, 2010). Also, Martinez, Zeichner, Reidy and Miller (2008) found 
that narcissists would deliver stronger shocks to innocent confederates after 
having received negative feedback on their writing skills by a computer. Indeed, 
such participants were especially likely to deliver shocks to innocent confeder-
ates when they were expecting to receive feedback from the computer but did not 
know what it contained. Apparently, narcissists may use aggression to boost their 
self-image when it is threatened, even against people who have not insulted them, 
and even when they only anticipate that they might be insulted. Research also 
suggests that people can be narcissistic about their groups, as well as themselves, 
and respond aggressively to threats to the positive image of their group (Golec de 
Zavala, Cichocka, Eidelson and Jayawickreme, 2009).

Understanding and controlling aggression
Cues in the social environment
One of the earliest and simplest accounts of human aggression is the frustration-
aggression hypothesis. Frustration occurs when an individual is prevented from 
achieving a goal they are pursuing. For Dollard, Doob, Miller et al. (1939), who 
pioneered this hypothesis, ‘frustration always leads to some form of aggression’, 
and conversely, all acts of aggression stem from the frustration of a goal. If you 
have read Chapter 1, scientific alarm bells should already be ringing – any psycho-
logical principle that does not allow for exceptions is setting itself up for a fall. 
Nonetheless, there is plenty of evidence that frustration does facilitate aggression, 
especially if one or more of the following applies (Miller, 1941):
1 The individual anticipated that they would feel satisfied when they achieved the 
goal that was eventually frustrated.
2 The frustration is total, so that all hope of achieving the goal is lost.
3 The individual is frustrated more than once.
4 The individual was frustrated when they had nearly achieved their goal.
Later research allowed scientists to better predict when frustration does, and 
does not, cause aggression. As is so often the case with people, causal attribution – 
the perceived cause of the frustration, in this case – is of central importance. This 
was demonstrated in a classic experiment by Burnstein and Worschel (1962). They 
had participants work together to solve problems in groups. Eventually, a male 
confederate planted in the group caused it to fail the task because he had not taken 
in some important information. Whether or not aggression followed depended on 
the ostensible cause for the confederate’s frustrating behaviour – it did, if he 
‘wasn’t paying attention’, and it did not, if his ‘hearing aid failed’. What seemed to 
matter was whether the person’s frustrating behaviour was controllable. 
Still later, other research suggested why frustration so often triggers aggres-
sion – it is unpleasant to be frustrated. Technically, frustration can be described as 
an aversive condition, and any number of ‘aversive conditions’ have been linked to 
aggression. These include uncomfortable levels of heat, the feeling of being 
crowded, and physical pain (Berkowitz, 1982). These will cause animals and 
humans to lash out. For example, Berkowitz (1982) had an experimental group of 
participants keep their hand in cold water, which, after a while, becomes very 
painful. Compared to the luckier control participants who had their hands in 
lukewarm water, they were more prone to subject confederates who annoyed 
them to loud blasts of noise. Also, the effect of heat on aggression is rather 
powerful. Extrapolating from the results of earlier experiments (Anderson, Deuser 
and DeNeve, 1995), Anderson, Bushman and Groom (1997) calculated that 
predicted increases in temperature due to global warming would result in more 
than 100,000 extra serious assaults per year in the USA alone by 2050. 
Why does practically any aversive condition appear to have the power to elicit 
aggression? We have already touched upon one reason – it makes some evolu-
tionary sense (Malamuth and Addison, 2001). To survive and thrive, organisms

need to be able to escape from or transform dire situations; fighting their way out 
of them may be an appropriate response. Another reason was presented by 
Berkowitz’s (1990) cognitive neoassociation model. For Berkowitz (1990), aver-
sive conditions will trigger aggression when they help make people angry. This 
emotion is associated in people’s minds with aggression, and makes the possibility 
of aggressive responses more salient to them. Thus, they are more prone to aggress, 
without necessarily thinking through the consequences. This is a form of auto-
matic social cognition, with potentially disastrous effects. 
Indeed, some research suggests that the mere cognitive availability of aggressive 
responses can make people more prone to aggress. In a famous but controversial 
study, Berkowitz and LePage (1967) found that the presence of a gun in a room 
can make people more aggressive. In a later study, Berkowitz (1988) showed boys 
a clip of a violent ice hockey game (as if there were any other type), in which some 
of the players were wearing toy radios. Boys were subsequently more aggressive if 
a similar walkie-talkie was in the room with them. The object appeared to cue the 
possibility of violence akin to that the boys had just seen.

that were made of this study? 
Hostile attribution bias
In Chapter 3 we encountered attribution theory, an influential model of social 
cognition, which suggests that our emotional and behavioural reactions to events 
are determined by the causes we perceive to underlie them. From this perspective, 
Dodge (1986) and Crick and Dodge (1994) argued that errors in attribution may 
underpin much aggressive behaviour. According to their model, responding appro-
priately to people’s behaviour requires an effective attribution process. When 
someone knocks into you, there is a good chance it is an accident. When someone 
pulls a face, it may have nothing to do with you. If you interpret these ambiguous 
situations as evidence that their intentions are hostile, there’s a much greater chance 
that you will form the intention to retaliate. Indeed, many studies show that aggres-
sive people are prone to the hostile attribution bias, seeing innocent or ambiguous 
behaviours by other people (e.g., bumping into you) as deliberate acts of provoca-
tion (Orobio de Castro, Veerman, Koops et al., 2002; Pornari and Wood, 2010). 
Longitudinal studies have shown that if children at age five are predisposed to 
interpreting ambiguous behaviours in this way, they are more likely to be aggres-
sive 12 years after (Lansford, Malone, Castellino et al., 2006). Although findings 
are mixed, a meta-analysis of many studies found that the effect is reliable, and is 
bigger in studies where participants are in an actual social interaction rather than 
reflecting on a hypothetical situation (Orobio de Castro et al., 2002).

and Muller (2006). Read it and complete the questions. You might also want to try it on family or friends you think

Understanding and controlling aggression
You are about to sit down on a spare seat at a table in the university café to eat some lunch. As you do so, someone at 
the table says: ‘You can’t sit here, that seat is taken.’ 
1  on a scale from 0 (not at all likely ) to 10 (extremely likely), how likely is it that what the person said is false – that 
the seat really isn’t taken? 
2 on the same scale, how likely is it that the person’s intention towards you was hostile? 
the higher your scores, the more you might be prone to the hostile attribution bias. of course, this is a hypothetical 
task. As we have just seen, the correlation between aggression and the hostile attribution bias is stronger when 
people are confronted with actual ambiguous situations. Why do you think this is? Read the paper by orobio de 
Castro et al. (2002) and related works on the hostile attribution bias in real-life situations to find out why. 
Relative deprivation and perceived injustice
Another powerful social trigger of aggression is relative deprivation – the percep-
tion that, relative to others, one is not receiving good treatment or experiencing 
desired outcomes (Crosby, 1976; Smith and Kim, 2007). Relative deprivation is 
especially aversive when it is perceived as unjust. Although there is surprisingly 
little experimental research into the effects of relative deprivation on interpersonal 
aggression, it is widely linked by social scientists to the incidence of crime and 
forms of intergroup aggression such as terrorism, as we shall see (Moghaddam, 
2005). Relative deprivation is also linked to increases in behaviours such as theft 
(Hennigan, Del Rosario, Heath et al., 1982) and gambling (Callan et al., 2008), 
which may, like aggression, appear to present a ‘way out’ of disadvantage. 
Ironically, the human love of justice often provides a powerful motive to 
aggress. Legal punishments such as fines and imprisonments can be seen as acts of 
aggression, in that they are acts designed to harm offenders. Indeed, people seem 
to be most satisfied with legal punishments that are seen as ‘just deserts’ for those 
who have done wrong, in keeping with the biblical proverb ‘An eye for an eye’ 
(Darley, Carlsmith and Robinson, 2000). Similarly, those who murder, assault or 
verbally abuse others often appear to have been motivated, in part, to punish them 
for their wrongdoing (Tedeschi and Quigley, 1996). People who are chronically 
concerned with justice and who react with negative emotions to injustice are also 
more prone to aggress against people they perceive to be wrongdoers (Gollwitzer, 
Rothmund, Pfeiffer and Ensenbach, 2009). Justice-driven aggression is not neces-
sarily motivated simply by the desire to see the wrongdoer suffer for their sins, 
however. It is perhaps more important that wrongdoers get the message and 
understand why they are being punished. Seeing victims get the message is more 
satisfying than seeing them suffer (Gollwitzer and Denzler, 2009). 
Learning aggression from others
Aggression is not just triggered by cues in the environment but can be learned 
from observation of others. Bandura’s highly influential social learning theory 
offered the first explanation of this phenomenon. This theory emerged as the 
so-called ‘cognitive revolution’ was moving psychology away from a behaviourist 
period to take into account mental processes. For Bandura, a key concept was 
relative deprivation the 
perception that, relative 
to others, one is not 
receiving good treatment 
or experiencing desired 
outcomes.

582
Applying
vicarious conditioning – we learn not only by being rewarded and punished for 
our behaviour, but also by observing others being rewarded and punished for 
theirs. Thus, if a person appears to enjoy themselves while committing aggressive 
acts, or is otherwise rewarded for doing so, and if they escape punishment, 
observers learn that it might also be safe and rewarding to aggress themselves. 
Bandura, Ross and Ross (1961) illustrated this point with a set of studies in which 
children watched an adult pound an inflatable ‘Bobo’ doll with their fists, feet and 
weapons. When children were later frustrated and given access to a similar doll, 
they copied the aggressive behaviour they had just seen. Not only did watching 
the aggression make the children more aggressive, but they frequently copied the 
specific forms and ‘catchphrases’ of the aggressive model, who in some conditions 
had verbally taunted the unfortunate doll during the aggressive acts. 
These studies have been criticized on various grounds, most tellingly by Tede-
schi and Quigley (1996), who pointed out that as far as the children were 
concerned, they might well have been engaging in harmless play. If they do not 
intend to commit harm, their behaviour does not count as aggression. However, 
these studies and Bandura’s theoretical edifice called attention to the point that 
aggression is all too often learned and copied from others. Indeed, children who 
witness domestic violence between their parents are more likely to assault their 
own partners when they grow up (Foshee, Bauman and Fletcher, 1999). Oliver 
Stone’s 1994 film Natural Born Killers has been the target of a lawsuit after it was 
apparently the basis of a ‘copycat’ killing (Boyle, 2001). Two 18-year-olds from 
Oklahoma, Sarah Edmondson and Ben Darrus, went out with a .38 calibre 
handgun and shot two strangers after having repeatedly watched the film while 
high on LSD. This is but one case of many that has been attributed to learned, 
copycat violence (Kunich, 2000).
Of course, it is impossible to explain, with any certainty, individual cases of 
copycat violence in terms of social learning theory. These cases almost certainly 
were caused by additional factors. Berkowitz’s (1990) cognitive neoassociation 
model, for example, would suggest that violence simply becomes more salient to 
people as a possible response when they have witnessed it repeatedly. People may 
be more prone to the hostile attribution bias – seeing aggressive intent when it is 
not there – when they have seen many instances of deliberate violence (Crick and 
Dodge, 1994). However, some findings do provide additional support for social 
learning theory. For example, Perry, Perry and Rasmussen (1986) found that more 
aggressive children reported that they felt able to engage in aggression and that it 
would bring them rewards. Some of the findings we will encounter soon about the 
effect of sporting outcomes on violence among spectators also provide some 
support for social learning theory.
Time to reflect Are the findings of Perry et al. (1986) consistent only with social learning theory? What else would 
be needed for this study to provide strong support for social learning theory?

Understanding and controlling aggression
Measuring aggression in the laboratory
As we have just seen, Bandura et al.’s (1961) Bobo doll 
studies have been heavily criticized for measuring 
aggression in an unrealistic and invalid way. For the most 
part, researchers of aggression are attempting to explain 
real-world cases of physical or social aggression that have 
real and important consequences. But for ethical reasons, 
it is difficult and perhaps impossible to allow participants 
to really hurt each other, or risk really hurting each other, 
in the laboratory. You will not find laboratory experiments 
in which the dependent measure is the number of 
punches that participants throw at each other. the 
importance of ensuring that participants do not come to 
serious harm is one factor that prevents researchers from 
accurately simulating real-life forms of aggression. 
Another obstacle to the realistic study of aggression in 
the laboratory is that ‘normal’ participants are often 
reluctant to aggress unless features of the situation clearly 
make aggression seem an available and acceptable 
response. Many laboratory studies are set up so that 
participants are not only allowed but actually required to 
deliver some aversive stimulus to the targets of aggression. 
Very often, the set-up is that the participant is supposed to 
‘train’ the target of aggression by punishing them with an 
aversive stimulus when they give a wrong answer. the 
participants are often given access to some apparatus that 
is expressly designed to deliver these aversive stimuli. 
these include the delivery of electric shocks, loud noises 
and hot chilli sauces of mild to severe intensity. the 
measure of aggression is effectively a measure of 
participants’ willingness to inflict nastier experiences than 
necessary on a person in their fulfilment of a role that 
already requires them to impose some nasty experiences. 
this lack of realism casts a pall over laboratory studies 
of aggression. Some laboratory studies get around the 
problem by measuring angry feelings, intentions or 
physiological responses that are known ‘precursors of 
aggression’. these studies are clever and important, but 
the question that must hang over them is whether the 
laboratory simulations would translate into violence in 
everyday life. As in all areas of social psychology, but 
perhaps more so than some, the experimental study of 
aggression is only viable when it is done as part of a wider 
research programme that includes other research 
methods, including observational and archival studies, 
field experiments and surveys. As we shall see, the study 
of media violence is an excellent example of how many 
methods have been used to obtain findings that have 
pointed in the same direction – exposure to media 
violence is both related to and causes aggression.

Media effects
One of the hottest debates in popular culture over the past 50 years or so has been 
the link between media violence and aggression. Does exposure to media violence

really lead to increased levels of violence? Although the debate rages on TV, in the 
press and the blogosphere, and academics from some other fields of enquiry remain 
sceptical (e.g., Trend, 2007), social psychological research has uncovered abundant 
evidence for a causal relationship (Bushman and Anderson, 2001). In their review 
of the literature, Bushman and Anderson point out that the observed link between 
media violence and aggression, in meta-analytic studies, is two to three times as 
strong as the link between homework and academic achievement, and exposure to 
lead and IQ scores in children. One study estimated that, at the end of the 1980s, 
the average 13-year-old American child had witnessed 100,000 violent acts on TV 
(Huston, Donnerstein, Fairchild et al., 1992). The relationship between exposure to 
violent media material and violent behaviour appears to be getting stronger, perhaps 
in part because of the advent of increasingly realistic special effects in films and 
computer games (Bushman and Cantor, 2003). Further, although correlations are 
always to be questioned – violent kids may gravitate to violent films and games, for 
example – there are any number of experiments showing that exposure to media 
violence causes increases in aggressive behaviour (Bushman and Cantor, 2003). 
Thus, ‘research has shifted from whether media priming exists to how media 
priming works’ (Roskos-Ewoldsen, Roskos-Ewoldsen and Carpentier, 2002, p. 
97). Meta-analyses show that the effect linking the consumption of media violence 
to aggression is larger than many of the effects that grip the public imagination, 
such as the effect of homework on academic achievement, or passive smoking in 
the workplace and lung cancer (Bushman and Huesmann, 2006; Huesmann, 2007) 
(see Figure 13.6).

This link is explained by several major social psychological theories of aggres-
sion. We have just touched on three of the causal mechanisms that can link media 
consumption to violence – encountering violence in the mass media makes it a 
more cognitively salient response possibility (social cognitive theory), may make 
it seem safe and rewarding (social learning theory), and may contribute to the 
hostile attribution bias by leading people to believe that violent, antisocial inten-
tions are more common than they really are. 
This last point is echoed by the claim that excessive consumption of mass media 
results in a mean world syndrome, in which ordinary citizens become paranoid about 
the risk of crime (Gerbner, Gross, Eleey et al., 1977). Ironically, this paranoia may

Understanding and controlling aggression
make crime actually more likely, as law-abiding people withdraw from public space 
and become less engaged in society (Putnam, 2000). This effect of television viewing 
on trust and civic engagement has been questioned by some authors, such as 
Uslaner (2002). Uslaner found that when he controlled for Americans’ optimism 
about the future, the relationship between television viewing and decreased trust 
and civic engagement disappeared. Uslaner (2002, p. 467) concludes that ‘it is not 
television that makes people less trusting, but optimism for the future that makes 
people more trusting’. However, his analysis does not exclude the possibility that 
declining optimism mediates the relationship between television viewing and trust. 
Using similar measures with a Flemish sample, Hooghe (2002) found robust rela-
tionships between watching television, and especially entertainment shows and 
commercial channels, and reduced civic engagement. 
Another way in which media violence may promote aggression is that repeated 
viewing may reduce the fearful, negative reactions to violence that people normally 
experience. This process is termed desensitization (Bandura, 1978). It is essentially 
an example of normal associative learning processes. Whereas in real life, aggres-
sion is normally paired with fear and danger, in violent media, aggression is often 
paired with fun, laughter and bad characters getting their comeuppance. Thus, 
violent media can cause people to unlearn the normal negative emotional associa-
tions of violence (Bushman and Huesmann, 2006). The theory is that when people 
contemplate aggressive responses or ‘scripts’ in real-life situations, they are 
normally deterred by their strong, negative emotional associations. If the prospect 
of aggressive responses arouses less fear and anxiety, they will seem more attrac-
tive (Huesmann, 1998). Although there is little direct evidence linking desensitiza-
tion to aggressive behaviour, there is plenty of evidence showing that exposure to 
violence in films (Linz, Donnerstein and Adams, 1989; Thomas, Horton, Lippin-
cott and Drabman, 1977) and video games (Carnagey, Anderson and Bartholow, 
2007) reduces physiological responses to real-life violence.
In the past decade, research has uncovered a neurological mechanism by which 
desensitization may occur and lead to increased violence. A structure called the 
anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), located in the frontal lobe, has been linked to 
aggressive behaviour (Sterzer, Stadler, Krebs et al., 2003). It is associated with links 
between cognition and emotion, and inhibition of part of the ACC may be indica-
tive of the suppression of emotional information processing (Bush, Luu and 
Posner, 2000). In other words, it may play a part in the suppression of emotional 
reactions to violence, or desensitization (Carnagey et al., 2007). In one study of 
adolescents diagnosed with a clinical disorder but who were not necessarily 
violent or disruptive, participants who reported consuming a great deal of violent 
media showed reduced ACC activity compared to those who did not. In fact, high 
consumers of violent media showed the same lowering of ACC activity as a group 
of adolescents with antisocial conduct disorders (Matthews, Kronenberger, Want 
et al., 2005). An fMRI study by Weber, Ritterfeld and Mathiak (2006) analysed 
patterns of brain activation frame by frame and revealed modified ACC activity at 
the moment of violent actions in the game.

Time to reflect We first encountered the ACC in Chapter 2, where it was associated with self-awareness. It is often 
the case that the same part of the brain can be associated with many functions. If you search ‘functions of the 
amygdala’ on the internet, you will find a long list. It is worth considering whether this means that specific brain 
regions really have a multitude of precisely identified functions, or whether specific brain regions affect many 
different aspects of our psychology, but in ways that are not precisely understood. With regard to the present 
findings, perhaps desensitization works by causing people to think less about themselves, and perhaps less about 
their moral standards, when encountering violence. It could be seen as a neurological parallel of ‘moral 
disengagement’ or ‘deindividuation’. You can read about these topics in Chapter 14 and Chapter 9 respectively. 
In sum, media violence affects violent behaviour in real life in many ways. 
Watching violent material or playing violent games can cause people to develop 
more positive attitudes towards aggression (e.g., as described by social learning 
theory), can desensitize them, can cause them to be more likely to perceive aggres-
sion in the environment (e.g., as described by hostile attribution bias), can lead 
them to be more likely to expect aggression from others or themselves, and can 
make aggressive ‘scripts’ more cognitively available to people as viable response 
options. All these mechanisms are incorporated in Anderson and Bushman’s (2002) 
general aggression model (gAM). This model describes the situational and personality 
variables that combine to produce human aggression (see Figure 13.7). Use of 
violent media changes people’s personality, over time. The GAM also suggests that 
these personality factors along with situational factors, such as pain, provocation, 
drugs and incentives to aggress, affect the social encounters that people experience. 
They may seek more aggressive social encounters. They may also respond to iden-
tical social encounters differently. Specifically, they may respond with higher levels 
of arousal, more negative, angry emotions, and more aggressive thoughts. In turn, 
these responses affect their decisions, for example whether to engage in a thoughtful 
or an impulsive action. People’s actions change the social encounters they are in, 
for example by provoking or frightening others. Thus, people’s behaviour affects 
their personality and the situations in which they find themselves.

Understanding and controlling aggression
Sometimes, violent media may interplay with people’s personalities in a kind of 
vicious cycle. Recall the commonly held belief that aggressive energy builds up 
inside people over time, or as they are provoked, and that it can be released by 
catharsis. People who hold these ‘catharsis beliefs’ particularly strongly are more 
likely to play violent video games when they are angered (Bushman and Whitaker, 
2010). Unfortunately, this attempt to expunge angry feelings and aggressive 
impulses is more likely to make them stronger. 
Question to consider having read the material on media effects, reread question 2 at the start of the chapter. Do 
you think there is a good chance Johnny is more likely to be aggressive as a result of playing video games? 
Sport and aggression
The media are an important cultural source of ideas about aggression that can 
shape our behaviour. Sport is another, but its relationship with aggression is 
complex. Of course, sports vary widely in the extent to which they allow physical 
contact between players and hence behaviours that, in other contexts, would be 
regarded as straightforwardly aggressive (e.g., pushing, hitting and knocking to 
the ground). They also vary in the extent to which, outside the rules, aggressive 
conduct takes place. Theories of the function of sport have characterized it as a 
symbolic equivalent of war, in that sportspeople, like military personnel, engage 
in competitive, physically strenuous activity in order to win prestige for the 
wider national or regional groups they are representing. One line of thought 
portrays sport as a substitute or alternative to war. Writing from a psychody-
namic perspective under the influence of Freud, Fenichel (1945, p. 558) claimed 
that sport is a kind of ‘substitute discharge’ of aggressive energy that might 
otherwise be devoted to making war. This is clearly related to the notion that 
aggression can be released by means of catharsis. Indeed, Lorenz (1966, p. 271), 
who is most closely associated with the catharsis model, claimed that ‘the main 
function of sport today lies in the cathartic discharge of aggressive urge’ and 
argued that, in particular, it provided an alternative outlet for ‘collective militant 
enthusiasm’ (p. 273). Another line of thought portrays sport as a complement to 
war. For Lüschen (1970, p. 9), for example, ‘sports are not only representative of 
societal norms and values … [but] socialize toward such patterns’. Thus, cultures 
that valorize group-based aggression and physical competition (that is, see these 
as good things), which are norms that might predict support for war, are more 
likely to engage in aggressive contact sports.
These two theoretical views of the relationship between sport and aggression 
generate different predictions. If sport is a cathartic outlet for aggressive energy 
that would otherwise lead to war (Fenichel, 1945; Lorenz, 1966), we would expect 
a negative relationship between sport and war at the societal level. Thus, we would 
expect more warlike societies to engage in fewer aggressive contact sports, and we 
might also expect that, during times of war, a given society will engage in such 
sports with lower intensity. This is because aggressive energy can be ‘released’ by 
either sport or war, and if one is present, there is no need for the other. On the 

588
Applying
other hand, if sport is the symbolic ‘acting out’ of cultural norms and values that 
can lead to war, we would expect exactly the opposite relationship: that aggressive 
sporting activity will be more common in warlike cultures and at times of war (see 
Figure 13.8). 
When Sipes (1973) examined data from a number of anthropological studies, he 
found that 87 per cent of warlike cultures featured aggressive contact sports, 
whereas only 11 per cent of cultures not classified as warlike did so. Similarly, 
when Sipes analysed sporting activity in the USA in the middle part of the 20th 
century, he found that sports such as hunting and football showed modest 
increases during the Second World War and the Korean War. In contrast, baseball 
did not show such an increase. Far from being a cathartic outlet for collective 
aggression that makes war less likely, aggressive, physical sports seem to be part 
and parcel of a cultural mindset that underpins war. 
Possibly, this cultural mindset is captured by the concept of social dominance 
orientation (SDO) (Pratto et al., 1994), the opposition to inequality and desire for 
group-based dominance that we encountered in Chapter 11. Although there is no 
evidence linking SDO to aggressive sports, there is abundant evidence associating 
it with support for war, as we shall see later. This ‘blind spot’ in knowledge is one 
that could be addressed with student research projects (see the Blind spot in social 
psychology exercise at the end of the chapter).
The fact that physical contact and struggle is inherent in some sports led Fields, 
Collins and Comstock (2007) to argue that researchers should not overlook the 
fact that some sports are inherently aggressive and so should not focus exclusively 
on illegal acts when they study aggression within sports (e.g., Fields, Collins and 
Comstock, 2010). Nonetheless, these same researchers (Collins, Fields and 
Comstock, 2008) found that illegal acts of aggressive cheating make a dispropor-
tionate contribution to sporting injuries. Some 6.4 per cent of nearly 100,000 
sporting injuries included in their survey came from foul play, with a third of these 
afflicting the head or face and a quarter leading to concussion. An earlier study of 
injuries among British rugby players found that up to 31 per cent of reported

the more aggressive contact 
sports that are played, the 
less aggressive energy there 
is, and so the less war there 
is (it also suggests that since 
war is an outlet for aggressive 
energy, warlike cultures would 
have little spare aggressive 
energy to vent by means of 
sport). the right-hand ‘norms’ 
model suggests that sport and 
war both reinforce a cultural 
norm of aggression. the more 
aggressive contact sports are 
played, the more aggression 
is seen as appropriate, and 
thus the more warlike a 
culture will be (likewise, 
the more war is waged, the 
more aggressive norms are 
reinforced, and these norms 
will be increasingly expressed 
in aggressive contact sports). 
So, there will be a positive 
rather than a negative relation 
between aggressive contact 
sports and war. Research 
supports the latter, norms 
model, dealing another blow 
to the notion of catharsis.

Understanding and controlling aggression
injuries were attributable to foul play (Davies and Gibson, 1978). Foul play, along 
with reckless play, was cited as the most common cause of sporting injuries among 
Irish school children (Watson, 1994). 
Given the number of sporting injuries that arise from foul play, it is important 
to examine its causes. Research has uncovered several situational and personality 
factors that underpin aggression on the sports field. By and large, the best 
predictor of aggressiveness on the field is aggressiveness off the field – much the 
same factors predict aggression in sport elsewhere (e.g., Maxwell and Visek, 2009). 
But also, a recurring finding, from both qualitative and quantitative research, is 
that participants in physical sports regard aggression on the field as more normal 
and acceptable than in everyday life (Traclet, Rascle, Souchon et al., 2009). Just as 
we saw with alcohol, we should not see sport as an automatic trigger of violent 
conduct. The cultural meaning that people attach to sport is important and guides 
their expectancies and motivation (Russell, 2008). 
Frank and Gilovich (1988) uncovered a surprising influence on aggression 
among sportspeople. They reasoned that since black is associated across many 
cultures with evil and death (for experimental evidence of this association, see 
Meier, Robinson and Clore, 2004; Sherman and Clore, 2009), teams who wear 
black jerseys may be penalized more for foul play. To test this idea, they first 
conducted an archival study of penalty rates in professional American football 
and ice hockey leagues. This revealed that teams wearing black were among the 
most penalized. When these teams changed their colours, for example when they 
wore their away strip, they were penalized less often. These findings are upheld 
by more a recent archival investigation of ice hockey matches (Webster, Urland 
and Correll, 2012). They are also consistent with other findings that support the 
notion of ‘enclothed cognition’ – what we wear profoundly influences how we 
think and act (Adam and Galinsky, 2012). Adam and Galinsky found, for example, 
that people paid more attention and made fewer errors on experimental tasks 
when wearing a white coat, as worn by doctors and scientists. 
Frank and Gilovich (1988) also reasoned that the associative connotations of 
the colour black can affect penalty rates in two ways. First, it may cause referees 
to be quicker to penalize teams wearing black than some other colour, because the 
team kit almost literally colours the way they perceive the teams’ play. Second, it 
may cause the players themselves to change their behaviour. Wearing black may 
subtly influence their self-image and motivation, causing them to be more prone 
to foul play. In a pair of experiments, Frank and Gilovich found support for both 
mechanisms. In the first of these experiments, participants watching videos of 
identical sequences of play were more likely to hypothetically penalize a player 
wearing black (rather than white) team kit. In the second, participants wearing 
black (rather than white) were more likely to choose to play aggressive games 
(e.g., ‘dart gun duel’ as opposed to ‘stacking blocks’). Donning a black team kit 
caused the experimental group to choose these games more than when they were 
wearing no team kit, whereas the white kit had no effect on their choices. Black 
kit, then, appears to be a bad influence, but white does not improve people’s 

590
Applying
morality on the sports field. Of course, this last experiment does not exactly repli-
cate on-field aggression, so its external validity is open to question. However, in 
tandem with Frank and Gilovich’s archival findings, it is more convincing: we 
have converging evidence that wearing black worsens conduct in sport. 
Time to reflect It seems to be clear that the colour of the clothing people wear on the sports field can affect their 
aggression. Can you think of examples where this might happen off the sports field? Do you think certain kinds of 
clothing worn on the street might trigger aggression – either by changing the psychology of the person wearing the 
clothes, or by changing other people’s reactions to those clothes? You might want to conduct a database or Google 
Scholar search of terms like ‘clothing’ and ‘aggression’ to see if there is any support for your intuitions.
Sport elicits aggression not only in players but also in spectators. One of the 
biggest global sporting events is the American football Super Bowl final. Sachs 
and Chu (2000, p. 1192) found that domestic violence calls to the local police and 
emergency admissions of women spiked after the final, leading them to conclude 
that ‘Super Bowl Sunday is often the biggest day of the year for domestic violence’. 
Following Welsh international rugby and football matches between 1995 and 
2002, emergency admissions to Cardiff hospitals also increased (Sivarajasingam, 
Moore and Shepherd, 2005). Findings like these cause charities to brace themselves 
for increases in violence after major sporting events such as the Rugby World Cup 
(e.g., New Zealand Women’s Refuge, 2011). 
The effect of the outcome of sporting events is of key theoretical interest. 
Consider the predictions of social learning theory and the frustration-aggression 
model. Which one predicts more spectator violence among the supporters of the 
winning team, and which one predicts more spectator violence among the losing 
teams’ fans? Losing is frustrating, and should generate more aggression among 
spectators according to the latter model. Conversely, to the extent that the sports 
match entails some kind of aggression, watching your team win amounts to 
watching it being rewarded for aggression. Social learning theory therefore 
predicts that more violence will be perpetrated by winning rather than losing fans. 
Studies that have analysed the effect of the outcome of matches on aggression 
point consistently in the direction of social learning theory. In their study, Sivara-
jasingam et al. (2005) found that Cardiff hospital admissions were higher after the 
Welsh team had won rather than lost. Earlier, White, Katz and Scarborough (1992) 
found that aggravated assaults of women increased in Washington, DC, after the 
Washington Redskins, the local ice hockey team, won. When the team lost, this 
type of violence was the same as on non-match days. 
Here, as always, it is important to consider alternative explanations for these 
correlations. Can you think of any? A clear possibility is the consumption of 
alcohol, which we have already seen to be a major contributing factor to aggres-
sion. Intuitively, we might guess that supporters stay out for longer, and drink 
more, after their team has won, because they are in a happy, celebratory mood – 
but go home with their tail between their legs if their team loses.
However, research by Moore, Shepherd, Ede and Sivarajasingam (2007) 
suggests that this increase in alcohol consumption is not responsible for the effect

of victory on spectators’ aggression. Moore et al. (2007) sampled from male fans 
attending rugby union matches at the Millennium Stadium in Cardiff, Wales. 
Some (115) were sampled before the match started, and served as a baseline against 
which the responses of the remaining (87) participants, who were sampled after 
the match, could be compared. Results showed that men whose team had just won 
reported feeling more aggressive than the baseline, pre-match group. Losing had 
no effect on their aggressive feelings. Interestingly, men’s happiness did not 
increase when their team won – although losing decreased their happiness. Further, 
men who were happy were no more likely to indicate that they planned to drink. 
These findings suggest that men were not likely to stay out drinking because they 
were in an especially celebratory mood. While the intention to drink was not 
correlated with happiness, it was correlated with aggressive feelings. The more 
aggressive men were feeling, the more they wanted to drink. It would seem that 
we cannot use alcohol to explain away the effect of winning on aggression. If 
anything, alcohol may magnify the effect, by seeming especially attractive to those 
who have developed aggressive feelings. It seems that the cultural equation of 
alcohol and aggression discussed earlier (see the Social psychology in the real 
world box) plays an important part in the social consequences of sporting wins. 
The tribal animal: the group dimension of aggression
Group processes and aggression
The amazing sociality of human beings – our ability to form coalitions, identify 
with groups and act together – has been the secret of our extraordinary successes, 
and has also, very often, been our downfall. In the colourful terminology of 
Brewer (1999), ‘ingroup love’ is all too often accompanied by ‘outgroup hate’, 
with sometimes terrible impacts on our behaviour. As we saw in Chapter 10, there 
are powerful social facilitation effects on aggression. Recall, for example, Mullen’s 
(1986) research into lynchings, the appalling violence inflicted on African Amer-
ican victims by Whites in southern parts of the USA. The more ingroup members 
(White lynchers) present, compared to outgroup members (the Black victims), the 
more horrific and degrading the lynchings became. 
The southern part of the USA has been the venue for another important break-
through in the scientific understanding of how group processes can facilitate aggres-
sion. Social facilitation is normally defined as the effects of the mere presence of 
others on our behaviour, but the norms, values and cultures that groups of people 
create are also important. The southern part of the USA has historically been more 
violent than the North (Fischer, 1989). We have already seen that heat is a trigger for 
aggression – but it is not that Southerners are more aggressive in every which way. 
Rather, they are more aggressive than Northerners specifically in situations where 
they are required to defend themselves and their reputation, and when they are 
insulted (Nisbett, 1993). This led Cohen and Nisbett (1994) to suggest that the 
American South is characterized by a culture of honour – a particular concern for 
honour and reputation, and the belief that violence is justified and sometimes even 
Culture of honour A culture 
in which honour and 
reputation, especially of 
men, is held to be important, 
and in which violence is

defending one’s honour.

required to defend it. For Cohen and Nisbett, this culture emerged because, for 
many years, the South was populated by herders who were left vulnerable to crimes 
such as banditry and cattle theft due to insufficient law enforcement. In this envi-
ronment, it became important for men to establish a reputation that meant would-be 
criminals would not mess with them. Thus, in a vacuum of official law enforcement, 
it became normal to use violence in order to punish and deter wrongdoers.
Manifestations of this culture have been cleverly explored by this group of 
researchers. Cohen, Nisbett, Bowdle and Schwartz (1996) brought men from the 
North and South into the laboratory to complete a study. While they thought 
they were waiting to participate, a man bumped into them, adding a verbal insult 
while he was at it, and kept walking down the hall. Unbeknown to the partici-
pants, this man was, of course, a confederate of the experimenters. Compared to 
the Northerners, the Southerners subsequently displayed a spectacular array of 
aggressive responses, and cognitive and physiological precursors of aggression. 
The stress hormone cortisol increased, as did testosterone. They were more likely 
to believe that the confederate had harmed their reputation as a ‘real man’, were 
more likely to be rude to the experimenter, behaved more aggressively in an 
experimental game and wrote more aggressive stories. 
In a subsequent field experiment, Cohen and Nisbett (1997) wrote unsolicited 
and fictional job applications to hundreds of retail shops in different parts of the 
USA. In the letter, the applicant (a 27-year-old, apparently local man) disclosed 
that he had been convicted of a crime. This was either a car theft or a crime of 
passion, in which he had hit a man with a pipe, because he had taunted him in a bar, 
in front of his friends, about sleeping with his fiancée. The taunter died of his inju-
ries, resulting in a manslaughter conviction for the applicant. He asked the managers 
to send him an application form, to invite him to drop by, or to give him the name 
of a contact person. Responses to the ‘motor vehicle theft’ letter were the same 
across different regions of the USA. But responses to the ‘murder’ condition were 
markedly different in the South and West (which had inherited a culture of honour 
from their colonial past) than in the North. In the North, return letters were much 
colder in tone (as rated by coders who did not know where the businesses were 
located) and much less likely to comply with the applicant’s requests. It seems that 
in a culture of honour, it is okay to meet insult with injury (see Figure 13.10).

Understanding and controlling aggression
Exploring further Might there be other cultures of honour around the world? the key characteristics of the 
American South are that men were vulnerable to property crime and were not adequately protected by a state 
apparatus. there is some evidence that compared to northern european cultures such as Germany, southern 
european cultures, such as Italy, have a stronger concern with male honour (see Rodriguez Mosquera, Manstead and 
Fischer, 2002). using internet searches, can you find any research demonstrating a relation between such cultures 
and aggression levels, outside the uSA? Do we have evidence that, in general, cultures of honour lead to higher 
aggression levels?
It is important to note, however, that the honour motivation is not restricted to 
highly patriarchal ‘honour’ cultures. Subcultures exist in many places in which 
aggression is deemed an acceptable way to resolve disputes, have fun and win 
honour. A qualitative investigation of pub brawls in England revealed that male 
honour played a big part in participants’ accounts of their own aggressive behav-
iour. For example, one young male accounted for his violent reaction to a perceived 
provocation by saying: ‘because I don’t want some guy pushing me around, that’s 
normal for me … I’m not going to let some guy do that, then I’m not a real man 
right, if some guy can tell me who I can talk to and not, right’ (Graham and Wells, 
2003, p. 557).
Intergroup violence: hate crimes
Lynching, the horrific form of violence investigated by Mullen (1986), not only 
illustrates a social facilitation effect, it also exemplifies the intergroup nature of 
much human aggression. Frequently, people do violence to each other not because 
of their individual qualities but because of their social identities. Intergroup 
violence, therefore, can be seen as one manifestation of prejudice – the innate 
dislike of other groups. When individuals are attacked because of their member-
ship of a disliked group, the offence is known legally as a hate crime (McDevitt, 
Levin and Bennett, 2002). In several countries including the UK, hate crimes 
attract harsher penalties in law, so that the group-based nature of violent crimes is 
treated as an aggravating circumstance (Bleich, 2011). Verbal aggression, in which 
hatred and insults towards groups are expressed, is described as ‘hate speech’ and 
is also outlawed in many countries (Josey, 2010). Hate speech and hate crimes have 
been shown to create a raft of mental and physical health problems both for people 
who are directly its victims and other members of the stigmatized groups (Boeck-
mann and Turpin-Petrosino, 2002; Meyer, 2003). 
Although hate crimes are officially disapproved of, some research suggests that 
unofficial attitudes to hate crimes may be more ambivalent (Craig and Waldo, 
1996; Lyons, 2006). For example, Lieberman, Arndt, Personius and Cook (1999) 
conducted two studies investigating people’s attitudes to hate crimes from a terror 
management theory (TMT) perspective. In TMT, awareness of our own mortality 
encourages us to symbolically seek immortality. In particular, TMT suggests that 
people respond to the fear of death by affirming cultural worldviews that promise 
to outlive them. Lieberman et al. reasoned that this may have a double-edged

Applying
Violence against women
Imagine that one group in society brutalizes another 
group in a modern Western society like the uk, murdering 
hundreds of its people, severely beating and raping 
thousands more. Associated with this violence, the 
perpetrator group tends to endorse a set of hostile 
stereotypes and ideologies about the group it is 
victimizing that consign the group to a relatively 
powerless, subordinate social position (Glick and Fiske, 
1996). Well, there is actually no need to use your 
imagination, because we are referring to the violence that 
is actually perpetrated by men against women. 
Admittedly, we are being provocative, but this is a 
factually accurate description of what happens in the uk, 
and elsewhere. According to official statistics (Walby and 
Allen, 2004), twice as many women than men in the uk 
(21% compared to 10%) have been subject to domestic 
violence as an adult. the domestic abuse inflicted by men 
upon women tends to be much more severe than the 
other way around – women comprise 89% of the 
population of those who are subject to repeated and 
serious physical abuse in which injuries are inflicted. For 
women in their reproductive years, being murdered by a 
current or former partner is one of the leading causes of 
death, and has been estimated to be roughly as common a 
killer as cancer (Garcia-Moreno, heise, Jansen et al., 2005; 
World Bank, 1993). Seventeen per cent of women and 2% 
of men have been subjected to sexual victimization in 
their adulthood. And although our opening here is a little 
provocative, it is nothing compared to Brownmiller’s 
(1975) landmark feminist treatise of the 1970s. 
Brownmiller (1975, p. 15) claimed that rape, perhaps the 
most salient of all forms of violence, is ‘nothing more or 
less than a conscious process of intimidation by which all 
men keep all women in a state of fear’.
What are we to make of this claim? It has all sorts of 
problems if we treat it literally as a scientific hypothesis – 
and you can explore these for yourself in the Applying 
social psychology exercise at the end of the chapter. But 
the statistics we have quoted and the role that sexism 
seems to play in violence towards women (see, e.g., 
Abrams, Viki, Masser and Bohner, 2003) suggest that 
Brownmiller may have had a point. the point is that 
violence by men against women has an intergroup 
dimension, even though it generally occurs 
interpersonally, between individual men and women. It is 
much more frequent and serious than violence by women 
against men, it is supported by and associated with men’s 
prejudice towards women and ideologies about women’s 
effect on attitudes to hate crime. On one hand, the perpetrators of hate crimes 
violate cherished social norms against violence and prejudice, and so threaten 
culturally shared worldviews. And in Lieberman et al.’s first study, participants 
were indeed more likely to support legislation targeting hate crimes after their 
own mortality had been made salient. On the other hand, the targets of hate crimes 
may themselves be perceived as a threat to culturally shared worldviews. For 
example, in homophobic cultures, gay men and women are perceived as a threat to 
‘normal’ marriage and family life. In Lieberman et al.’s second study, participants 
were presented with descriptions of specific hate crimes, against either a Jewish or 
a homosexual victim. They were then asked to set a ‘bail’ amount that the perpe-
trator would have to pay to avoid being detained in prison while awaiting trial. 
Participants whose mortality had recently been made salient set lower bail 
amounts. Putting the two studies together, mortality salience seems to encourage 
opposition to hate crimes in the abstract, when a specific victim is not mentioned. 
However, when victims represent worldviews that are perceived to be different 
from their own, mortality salience may cause people to be relatively condoning of 
hate crimes.

Understanding and controlling aggression
Hate crimes are a manifestation of prejudice. However, intergroup violence can 
happen even in the absence of prejudice – sometimes, mere stereotypes are enough. 
In research on the ‘weapons effect’, Payne (2001; Payne, Lambert and Jacoby, 
2002) presented American participants with a picture of either a Black or a White 
face, sometimes subliminally, that is, so fast that people were unable to consciously 
identify what they had just seen. Immediately afterwards, they were presented 
with a picture of either a handgun or a hand tool (e.g., a screwdriver) (see Figure 
role, and, in turn, it has detrimental and restrictive effects 
on women, even those who have not themselves been 
directly raped or assaulted. 
If we read Brownmiller’s (1975) claim in this way, 
there is extensive research support for it. Women are 
more afraid of crime than men (hale, 1996). In large part, 
this is because women are much more afraid of being 
raped, which means that other crimes, such as burglary 
and robbery, take on a much more sinister meaning for 
them (Warr and Stafford, 1983). this fear of crime is 
accompanied by feelings of vulnerability, meaning that 
women perceive themselves as more likely to be the 
victim of an unprovoked attack, and less likely to be able 
to defend themselves (Jackson, 2009; Riger and Gordon, 
1981; Smith and torstensson, 1997). Fear of crime 
generally and rape in particular deters women from 
using public spaces, especially by themselves and 
especially at night (e.g., Riger and Gordon, 1981). After 
reading newspaper reports of rape, women who have 
not themselves been raped experience reduced self-
esteem, and tend to be more likely to endorse a 
subordinate social role for women (e.g., Bohner, 
Weisbrod, Raymond et al., 1993; Schwarz and Brand, 
1983). In a cruel irony, the moral burden for the 
victimization of women tends to fall on women, who are 
expected to be the guardians of their sexuality and are 
often blamed when they are raped (e.g., Viki and Abrams, 
2002). Recent research also suggests that women 
experience pressure to be fearful and cautious, and are 
judged more favourably if they are fearful (Sutton, 
Robinson and Farrall, 2011). According to research and 
theory, then, the fear of crime disempowers women in 
several ways – it deters them from activities perceived to 
increase the risk of victimization, it causes them to 
internalize ideologies and prejudices that are 
detrimental to their gender group, and it imposes on 
them a perceived duty to be cautious and even fearful.
We therefore think – although you may disagree – that 
we should view the violence that men do to women, in 
the social and ideological context in which it happens, as a 
form of intergroup violence. It is not an easy or 
comfortable position to take, and it is debatable. But it is 
worth taking seriously. the way we opened this section 
was crafted not just to provoke this consideration but also 
to encourage you to look at this aspect of gender relations 
with fresh eyes. As we saw in Chapter 5 on 
communication, we often ‘normalize’ or take for granted 
the status quo between the genders. thus, we accept 
sexist language such as the masculine generic when we 
would not accept similarly racist language; for example, 
‘throughout man’s history, there has been violent 
intergroup conflict’ does not read as oddly and 
unacceptably as ‘through whites’ history, there has been 
violent intergroup conflict’, because we are accustomed to 
it and it is supported by gender ideologies we 
unconsciously accept. there is a real possibility that we 
have taken for granted, if not quite accepted, gendered 
violence in much the same way. 
Questions 
1 Brownmiller’s claim is often attacked as either 
implausible or too vague to be tested scientifically. 
What is wrong with it? take a careful look, for example, 
at some of the key words – ‘all’ men keep ‘all’ women 
down. Do you think this is true? And do you think 
keeping women in their place in this way is something 
that men do ‘consciously’? Can you find research in this 
textbook or on the internet to support your view?
2 using an internet search engine, find research on 
‘domestic violence’ or ‘partner violence’. Do you think 
it could be explained in the same way as Brownmiller 
explains rape, that is, it serves to keep women in their 
place generally (not just its direct victims)?

13.11). If they had just seen a Black face, participants 
were quicker to correctly identify the handguns; if they 
had just seen a White face, they were quicker to correctly 
identify the hand tools. One reason this might have 
happened is that in America, Black people are stereotypi-
cally associated with crime and violence, because of race 
biases in the objective incidence of crime and, perhaps 
especially, in media portrayals of crime. Even participants 
who do not have an emotional aversion to Black people 
have been exposed, many times, to this stereotype. 
In support of this interpretation of the weapons effect, 
Judd, Blair and Chapleau (2004) presented Black and 
White faces in a similar way, but in their experiment, 
followed these with pictures of positive and negative 
stimuli that were not stereotypically associated with 
Black people, such as fruit and insects, respectively. 
Exposure to Black faces had no effect on the time taken 
to recognize these objects. If a generally negative attitude 
towards Black people was the driving force in Payne’s 
(2001) study, we would expect people to be subsequently quicker to identify 
insects (the negative stimuli) than fruit (the positive stimuli). Another important 
finding, making the same point, was that exposure to Black faces not only facili-
tated recognition of handguns, it also facilitated recognition of sports equipment 
(e.g., American footballs). These are positively valued stimuli that are also stereo-
typically associated with Black people in the USA. 
Why might this weapons effect matter? What if you were a police officer 
working in poor visibility and you saw a Black person emerge, appearing to carry 
something that might be a gun? Having cottoned on to the potential for this bias 
to result in disaster, researchers have begun to employ computerized ‘shooting 
games’; ingroup or outgroup members appear suddenly on the screen and the 
participants’ job is to ‘shoot’ them by depressing a computer key – if they are 
armed. In the USA, participants are more likely to mistakenly shoot unarmed 
targets if they are Black (rather than White), and are also less likely to mistakenly 
fail to shoot armed Black targets (Correll, Park, Judd and Wittenbrink, 2002). 
A recent study confirmed that, once again, stereotypes, rather than prejudice, 
appear to be largely responsible for this effect. When Australian participants were 
exposed to a mood induction procedure that put them in a good mood, they were 
more likely to show an intergroup bias, being especially prone to shooting targets 
wearing Muslim headdress (Unkelbach, Forgas and Denson, 2008). When placed 
in a negative mood, they were less likely to show this bias. Previous research 
shows that positive mood increases reliance on stereotypes, because people are 
less motivated to be careful or accurate in their decision making (Forgas, 1998). In 
contrast, negative mood states encourage caution and accuracy. The pattern of 
results makes sense from a stereotyping perspective – Muslim headdress is stereo-

this is thought to be due to 
the stereotypical association 
of Black people with violence 
and weapons.

typically associated with aggression and thus elicits biased responses when people 
are in a good mood. If prejudice was the key to the shooting bias, we would 
expect, if anything, the negative mood to heighten it.
It is reassuring, in a sense, that intergroup violence is not always due to out and 
out prejudice. Biases may stem from innocent mistakes triggered only by widely 
known, shared stereotypes. However, this is a double-edged sword – it suggests 
that intergroup aggression can erupt even when groups do not hate each other. In 
the next section, we shall see how large-scale forms of intergroup aggression 
emerge from conflicts over resources and the fear of coming last. 
Corporate intergroup aggression: when aggression is a group behaviour
A strong feature of human aggression is that it is often a coordinated, group-level 
activity. Groups, as well as individuals, aggress against each other. War is one 
mode of intergroup aggression, in which groups act collectively to do harm to 
each other, by means of military personnel and specialized military technology. 
Terrorism is another mode of intergroup aggression in which members of one 
group carry out aggressive actions designed to inflict fear on another group in 
order to achieve some political objective. Genocide occurs when members of one 
group attempt to systematically remove or eliminate another group. 
As we saw in Chapter 11, we have known since Sherif et al.’s Robbers Cave 
study ([1954]1961) that intergroup conflict, including acts of verbal and physical 
aggression, is often triggered by conflicts over resources. Large-scale conflicts such 
as war and genocide are often triggered by the competing demands of rival groups 
for land, power or other resources. In a crude economic sense, these conflicts, 
setting aside the moral questions and the appalling suffering they inflict, may make 
sense. In a zero-sum game, groups benefit if they can grab resources. However, 
there is plenty of theory and evidence to suggest that these kinds of conflicts are 
not coolly calculated. Groups will sometimes engage in mutually destructive 
conflicts over resources that could never be valuable enough to replace those being 
expended, even leaving moral questions aside (Sidanius and Pratto, 1999). 
One reason they do this appears to be the desire to ensure that whatever 
happens, the ingroup comes out ahead of, or at least not behind, the outgroup in 
relative terms. So, people acting on behalf of their group sometimes make what 
has been called ‘Vladimir’s choice’ – a decision that amounts to sacrificing the 
wellbeing of the ingroup in an effort to ensure that the outgroup does even worse 
(Wildschut, Insko and Gaertner, 2002). Thus, when playing intergroup social 
dilemma games (there is more on social dilemmas in Chapter 14), people prefer to 
secure, say, 90 credits for the ingroup in order to ensure that the outgroup gets less 
(say, 80), rather than secure 120 credits for the ingroup and risk the outgroup 
getting still more. This has been linked to social dominance orientation (SDO). In 
one study, participants who were higher in SDO were more likely to make 
Vladimir’s choice in a social dilemma (Sidanius, Prato and Levin, 2006). 
As is often the case, social comparison processes are important. It is not so 
much what we have, as what we have relative to others. When groups find them-

598
Applying
selves relatively worse off, the situation they strive so hard to avoid, aggression 
often follows. A sense of relative deprivation may be important in triggering indi-
viduals to be aggressive, but appears to be even more important in triggering 
groups to be aggressive. A sense of relative deprivation has been found to be an 
important trigger, blamed for actions as diverse as riots, terrorism (Moghaddam, 
2005), international aggression and genocide (Staub, 2000). 
Different forms of intergroup violence, such as war, terrorism and genocide, 
may have different social psychological underpinnings. Although war and 
terrorism are both ways of securing symbolic victories for the ingroup over the 
outgroup, they may appeal to different groups for different reasons. War, for 
example, may be the method of choice for economically and politically dominant 
groups, who perceive that they have the means to protect and reinforce their 
dominant position. Terrorism, on the other hand, may be favoured by groups that 
are economically and politically weaker, who may perceive acts of terror as a 
means of ‘freedom fighting’, that is, counteracting the dominance they feel other 
groups exert over them (Bueno de Mesquita and Dickson, 2007; White, 1991). 
This analysis was supported by an intriguing study of support for war and 
terrorism in the Middle East conflict by Henry, Sidanius, Levin and Pratto (2005). 
Among an American sample, both SDO and right-wing authoritarianism (RWA) 
were positively correlated with support for military action by the USA and its 
allies against Afghanistan and Islamist terrorists. Thus, Americans who were high 
in either SDO or RWA agreed more strongly with state-
ments such as ‘Afghanistan should be invaded or bombed 
until they surrender bin Laden’. These results contrasted 
with a Lebanese sample, who were asked whether they 
supported anti-Western violence that would traditionally 
be labelled as terrorism. Lebanese participants who were 
high in SDO were less likely to endorse this type of anti-
Western aggression, and so tended to agree less strongly 
with statements such as ‘The attack on the World Trade 
Center was justified’. Even so, just as RWA was positively 
correlated with support for warlike actions among Amer-
ican participants, it was also positively correlated with 
support for terrorist actions among Lebanese participants (see Figure 13.12). RWA 
is associated with adherence to traditional values and deference to authority, so 
can be expected to lead to support for aggressive actions, sanctioned by ingroup 
authority figures, against an outgroup that appears to have different values. 
However, SDO is associated with a preference for hierarchical, dominance-based 
intergroup relations. The different patterns observed on the two sides of the 
Middle East conflict suggest that, at least in this context, intergroup aggression in 
the form of military action, for Americans, serves the purpose of dominance. On 
the other hand, for Lebanese, intergroup aggression in the form of terrorism 
serves the purpose of counteracting group-based dominance.

Understanding and controlling aggression
Evolutionary bases of intergroup violence
We started this chapter by considering whether, as many thinkers have argued, 
human beings’ biological heritage has hard-wired aggressive responses into them 
(e.g., Lorenz, 1966). For other scholars, the extent and nature of aggression is 
primarily, or entirely, a matter of culture – what we learn and observe from others 
and the responses that are readily available to us (Bandura, 1978). A recent mani-
festation of this fundamental debate between evolutionary social psychologists 
and scholars from other theoretical perspectives has surrounded the topic of 
gender differences in support for intergroup aggression. 
Of course, males are more likely to be active participants in armed conflicts, 
but this could be explained purely in terms of gender role specialization: men are 
physically bigger and stronger on average and so, in a way, it makes sense to ‘give’ 
them this role (Eagly and Wood, 1999). However, recent findings have been used 
to suggest that evolutionary processes have predisposed males towards warfare. 
The argument is that competition between males is a feature of any species in 
which they are the sex that invests less in parenting (Trivers, 1972). In such species, 
males are the bigger sex, mature later, take more risks, vie for mates and show 
higher levels of intra-sex aggression. Evolutionary anthropologists have argued 
that males who are successful warriors have privileged access to women. For 
example, one estimate based on studies of the Y chromosome suggests that 16 
million men worldwide and up to 8 per cent of Asian men are descended from 
Genghis Khan (Zerjal, Xue, Bertorelle et al., 2003). For evolutionary psycholo-
gists, war is a manifestation of a tendency to compete with each other, ultimately 
for access to mates, that has been built into men by these evolutionary forces (e.g., 
van Vugt, de Cremer and Janssen, 2007). 
In an attempt to test this idea, van Vugt et al. (2007) had undergraduate students 
in an English university play a social dilemma game. We will discuss social 
dilemmas further in Chapter 14, but the basic structure of these games is that 
participants are allocated money, which they can either keep for themselves or 
donate to their group. Each individual participant is always better off if they keep 
their own money, but, overall, everyone in the group benefits if participants are 
willing to sacrifice some of their money for the good of the group. The twist in 
this study was that an experimental group of participants were led to believe there 
was an intergroup dimension to the social dilemma. Specifically, they were told 
that groups of students from other English universities were playing the game too, 
and that the aim of the task was to compare how well students at different univer-
sities did the task. In the control, ‘individual’ condition, participants were told 
that the purpose of the experiment was to compare how well different individuals 
did the task. In this ‘individual’ control condition, men were less willing than 
women to donate their money to the group cause. However, in the intergroup 
condition, when participants thought they were collectively competing against 
other universities, men were much more willing to donate their money to the 
group cause, and in fact donated more money than women. 

600
Applying
Van Vugt et al. (2007) argued that their experiments reveal how in times of 
intergroup conflict, men are predisposed to sacrifice their personal interests for 
the sake of the ingroup. They term this idea the male warrior hypothesis. The extent 
to which you accept this label should depend on whether the experiments are 
really an accurate model of the choices confronting men at times of war. There is 
no physical aggression displayed in these studies, and no overt reference to war or 
aggression is made in the experiments. There is no animosity towards the 
outgroups. The experiment is also open to other interpretations. Perhaps male 
participants were more motivated simply to be competitive and thus responded to 
the instructions more sensitively than women. Thus, when they were led to believe 
they could ‘win’ as individuals, they hoarded their money, and when they thought 
they were trying to ensure their group would ‘win’, they donated to the group. 
On the basis of this experiment alone, the ‘male warrior’, like the ‘warrior gene’ 
before it, may turn out to be a good example of scientific marketing that does not 
necessarily reflect empirical findings. 
However, other studies also appear to provide some support for the evolu-
tionary argument that males are predisposed towards war. In a series of experi-
ments with Chinese participants, Chang, Lu, Li and Li (2011) assessed male and 
female heterosexual participants’ expressed support for warlike statements, and 
their attentional bias towards warlike stimuli such as soldiers and tanks. All 
participants had first been shown photos of attractive, opposite-sex stimulus 
persons. When these faces were attractive, male participants later expressed more 
support for war and responded more quickly to warlike stimuli. Female partici-
pants were not affected by the attractiveness of the stimulus photos. Chang et al. 
(2011) argued that these findings reflect the effect of mating goals in promoting 
warlike behaviour in men. They appeal poetically to the notion that Helen of Troy 
was the ‘face that launched a thousand ships’ in the Trojan War – that female 
beauty inspires warlike behaviour. An alternative interpretation might be precisely 
that there is a widespread cultural idea that there is something chivalrous or sexu-
ally glamorous about war. In other words, perhaps we inherit entirely from our 
culture, and not from our biological heritage, the idea that warlike activity is a 
way for men to win the favour of attractive women. 
Still more evidence gives reason to think that perhaps there could be a cultur-
ally universal male orientation towards war and other forms of intergroup aggres-
sion. As we have noted, men tend to be higher in social dominance orientation 
than women. However, this finding may emerge simply because men tend to 
occupy a dominant position in society. Sidanius, Pratto and Bobo (1994) found 
that men reported higher SDO scores than women when their cultural, demo-
graphic or political persuasion was held constant. That is, among participants of 
the same cultural, demographic and/or political persuasion, men tended to be 
higher in SDO than women. Sidanius et al. interpreted this finding as support for 
the notion that SDO should be expected to be higher in men than women across 
cultures. Social dominance theory attempts to integrate evolutionary and cultural 
analyses of masculinity and warfare. It suggests that the selective evolutionary 
The male warrior hypothesis 
the argument that men 
who are effective warriors 
have had an advantage in 
accessing mates and thus 
passing on their genes. As a 
result, through evolutionary 
processes, men have 
acquired a psychological 
makeup that predisposes 
them to warlike behaviour.

601
Understanding and controlling aggression
pressures in favour of male aggression have contributed to cultural ideologies that 
venerate male dominance and aggression. 
A single sample of Los Angeles residents such as in Sidanius et al.’s study is not 
enough to provide convincing support for the claim that men are universally 
higher in SDO than women. The fact remains that within any group in society, 
matched on other variables, men will also be members of the higher status group. 
It is difficult, if not impossible, to rule out the possibility that they are higher in 
SDO simply because of their relatively dominant position. In fact, a recent article 
by Batalha, Reynolds and Newbigin (2011) suggests that this social, rather than 
evolutionary, explanation for the gender difference might be more likely. In one of 
their studies, Batalha et al. found that men endorsed SDO more than women in 
Australia but not in Sweden – the latter being a more egalitarian society in which 
social hierarchies between women and men are less marked. In another study, they 
found a significant gender difference in SDO when participants were assigned to 
low status but not high status groups. They divided Australian undergraduate 
students into small groups of men and women and got each group to solve 
anagram tasks. In a bogus feedback manipulation, each small group was told that 
they were either doing much better (high status) or much worse (low status) than 
the opposite gender group. When assigned to low status groups, men reported 
higher SDO than women, but when assigned to high status groups, the gender 
difference in SDO was no longer significant. 
Try it yourself Complete the social dominance orientation scale and compare your mean to that of established studies.
Which of the following objects or statements do you have a positive or negative feeling towards? Beside each 
statement, place a number from 1 = very negative to 7 = very positive.
 1 Some groups of people are simply inferior to other groups. 
 2 In getting what you want, it is sometimes necessary to use force against other groups. 
 3 It’s ok if some groups have more of a chance in life than others. 
 4 to get ahead in life, it is sometimes necessary to step on other groups.
 5 If certain groups stayed in their place, we would have fewer problems.
 6 It’s probably a good thing that certain groups are at the top and other groups are at the bottom. 
 7 Inferior groups should stay in their place. 
 8 Sometimes other groups must be kept in their place. 
 9 It would be good if groups could be equal. 
10 Group equality should be our ideal. 
11 All groups should be given an equal chance in life.
12 We should do what we can to equalize conditions for different groups. 
13 Increased social inequality is beneficial to society.
14 We would have fewer problems if we treated people more equally.
15 We should strive to make incomes as equal as possible.

this is the scale developed by Pratto et al. (1994). It, or shorter versions, have been widely used in subsequent 
studies. You can add up and then calculate the mean of your 16 responses. Items 9–16 should be reverse scored: 7s 
should become 1s, 6s become 2s, and so on, because they reflect negative reactions to social dominance. Note how 
abstract the scale is – it takes care not to refer to specific groups or specific aspects of intergroup relations. 

602
Applying
If nothing else, the study by Batalha et al. (2011) shows that men are not always 
significantly more oriented to social dominance than women. However, it has to 
be said that in each of their studies, there was always a ‘main effect’ of gender – 
meaning that averaging across all the experimental conditions, men’s SDO was 
significantly higher than women’s. Also, even in the conditions where the gender 
difference was no longer significant, the trend was for men to report higher SDO – 
their mean was higher, but not significantly so, than women’s. Finally, it is not 
clear why men’s SDO should have been higher when they were told they were 
doing worse (the low status condition) than women in the anagram group rather 
than better (the high status condition). A control group in which men and women 
were of equal status – simulating the relatively egalitarian social conditions of 
Sweden, in their first study – would have been useful. 
All in all, it appears that men are generally, if not always, higher in SDO (Sida-
nius et al., 1994; Batalha et al., 2011) and are more likely to act like traditional 
warriors. Exposure to attractive women appears to heighten their interest in war 
(Chang et al., 2011), and involvement in intergroup competition seems to enhance 
their willingness to sacrifice their interests to the group (van Vugt et al., 2007). But 
these conclusions are based on just a handful of articles, and much more research 
is needed before we can generalize across cultures and make claims about human 
universality. In principle, it is going to be difficult to tease apart any evolutionary 
mechanisms from culture in explaining these effects. Sex role specialization, in 
which men take on physically risky and combative roles, appears to be a more or 
less universal feature of human cultures. Whether this is simply because of men’s 
greater size and strength (Eagly and Wood, 1999) or evolved differences in men 
and women’s psychology is difficult to determine, no matter how many research 
findings we have at our disposal. 
Question to consider Now that you have read about gender differences in warlike ideology and behaviour, and 
the material earlier on gender differences in aggression, reread question 3 at the start of the chapter. Do you think 
your friend was right to say there would be fewer wars if women had greater control over world events?
This recent debate is but one aspect of the still more general conundrum – is 
human aggression hard-wired, and does culture do much more than merely shape 
the form it takes? In this chapter, we have seen evidence that in other animals, 
levels of aggression can be inherited, so much so that it is possible to breed 
aggressive and nonaggressive strains. In humans as in other animals, specific brain 
structures and chemistries seem to play a role in aggressive behaviour. Humans, 
like other animals, respond with predictably heightened aggression when 
confronted with aversive conditions like heat, overcrowding and frustration. 
Aggression between individuals and groups appears to feature in all known 
human societies. However, the level and the form of aggression appear to change 
radically between cultures. Norms, values, the media and recreational drugs play 
a unique role in shaping human levels of aggression. Aggressive responses in the 
aftermath of the use of alcohol or violent media content appear to depend on the

Understanding and controlling aggression
In this chapter, we have outlined how social psychologists, and 
scientists from other disciplines such as biology, have 
approached the problem of aggression. We have discussed the 
forms and the causes of human aggression. In particular, we 
have discussed the ways in which biological, social and cultural 
forces interact to produce aggressive behaviour. the key points 
to take away from this chapter are as follows:
• Aggression is behaviour intended to harm another. the 
intended harm may be social or physical. 
• Philosophers and biologists have argued that aggression is 
hard-wired into human beings, like other animals, because 
of its evolutionary value in competition for resources. 
• Some biological approaches to aggression have suggested 
that humans and other animals are subject to an aggressive 
drive or energy that requires release by means of aggressive 
behaviour. however, there is little support for this notion 
that catharsis reduces aggressive energy. If anything, 
attempting to reduce aggression by means of catharsis is 
counterproductive. 
• however, there is plenty of evidence that aggression does 
have a biological basis in humans and other animals. 
Aggression has been experimentally bred into, and out of, 
mammalian species. twin studies have some profound 
methodological problems but suggest that the more 
genetically related two people are, the more similar their 
levels of aggression will be. Specific chemicals and 
structures in the brain have been linked to aggressive 
behaviour. thus far, there is no compelling evidence linking 
specific genes to aggressive behaviour. 
• Alcohol is a major cause of aggression in humans, but its 
effects are not purely biological. they also depend on 
cultural beliefs about alcohol and its effects. 
• Social forces are important in human aggression. When 
people are narcissistic (have inflated but insecure views of 
themselves), they require others to bolster their self-view 
and react aggressively when their self-image is threatened 
by others. People respond to frustration, the feeling of 
relative deprivation and the modelling of aggression by 
others. their aggression also depends on whether they 
perceive others’ intentions to be hostile.
• Mass entertainments, such as the media and sport, have a 
powerful role in shaping aggressive behaviour. 
Consumption of violent media material and participation in 
and viewing of aggressive sports contribute to aggressive 
behaviour. this is especially so when the aggression in sport 
and media is rewarding, consistent with major social 
psychological theories such as social learning theory. 
Repeated exposure to violence in the media also 
desensitizes people to aggression: they become less 
sympathetic to victims and respond to aggression with 
lower levels of negative emotion. 
• Culture affects aggression. For example, aggression is more 
common in cultures of honour, in which reputation and 
honour (especially of men) are highly prized. Also, the 
cultural metaphors that people have about aggression can 
contribute to aggressive behaviour. For example, the notion 
that anger is a kind of heat or pressure can lead people to try 
to control their emotions and aggressive tendencies by 
engaging in aggression. 
• Many forms of aggression are not directed solely at 
individuals but also at the groups to which they belong. 
these can be termed ‘hate crimes’. examples include 
lynching, genocide and, arguably, rape.
• Aggressive behaviour is fostered when cues in the 
environment bring the possibility of aggressive responses to 
the forefront of people’s minds. thus, the presence of guns 
or other weapons may elicit aggressive responses. this has 
an intergroup dimension: people from certain cultural 
backgrounds may experience outgroup clothing, such as 
religious headdress, as a prime that reminds them of 
aggression. Black sports kit may also prime aggression.
• Some catastrophic forms of human aggression are 
perpetrated not only by individuals but also by social 
groups – individuals from one group acting in concert 
against another. War, terrorism and genocide are examples 
of this ‘corporate’ aspect of human aggression. 
cultural meaning attached to these cues – if people expect them to lead to aggres-
sion, their expectancies tend to become self-fulfilling. Clearly, human aggression 
is the joint product of biological and cultural evolution. Major questions about 
the interplay between these two forces, and the extent to which biological evolu-
tion has shaped much more than the basic tendency to aggress, remain for new 
generations of researchers to answer.

• human beings, and men in particular, may have evolved to 
engage in this kind of corporate intergroup aggression. 
however, the experimental evidence for this argument is 
currently weak and controversial.
our focus in this chapter has been on one of the darkest aspects 
of human behaviour. In Chapter 14, we consider nobler features 
of human nature – a love of justice, the willingness to cooperate 
with each other and preserve the environment. 
At the beginning of the chapter, we asked you to consider  
these questions:
1 Your friend has a punch bag and lets the bag have it whenever 
someone really annoys them. they say it’s a good way to let 
off steam and stops them from doing or saying aggressive 
things to people. Is this coping strategy a good idea?
2 Johnny plays a lot of violent video games. Should his parents 
be worried about this making him aggressive? 
3 You are discussing the latest war and one of your female 
friends says: ‘Why are men always so aggressive? If the world 
were run by women, there would be fewer wars!’ Is she right? 
having read this chapter, these questions could also be framed 
as the following essay questions, which you can attempt in 
preparation for your examinations:
1 evaluate the claim that aggression can be reduced by means 
of catharsis. 
2 how does consumption of violent media material, such as 
violent video games, contribute to real-life aggression? 
3 evaluate theory and research findings suggesting that men 
are more aggressive in interpersonal and intergroup 
relations.

Understanding and controlling aggression
Bullying interventions
Bullying is a common and problematic form of aggression, 
which features repeated acts of aggression against people who 
cannot easily defend themselves (olweus, 1993; Salmivalli, 
kaukiainen and Voeten, 2005). It is a pattern of behaviour that 
exploits and widens a power imbalance between bully and 
victim, and is associated with bad outcomes for victim and 
bully. Although bullying can involve physical and social acts of 
aggression, its overall flavour is social, as its principal aim 
seems to be to do emotional and social harm to the victim 
(Merrell, Gueldner, Ross and Isava, 2008).
Imagine that, as a social psychology consultant, you have 
been asked by a local school to advise it as it designs an 
intervention to try to reduce bullying in the school. In 
consultancies like this, your first job is normally to search the 
psychological literature for theory and evidence on the topic. 
You would then make recommendations for an intervention 
based on what appears to be the most promising and effective 
principles of intervention. the exercises below are designed to 
provide an approximate simulation of this process.
1 Do an internet search using a database such as Google 
Scholar to find at least three anti-bullying interventions 
designed in the past 20 years. Note the full citations in APA 
format. Also note how often each has been cited in academic 
and other sources (this information is provided by most 
databases along with the title and abstract). this gives you 
some idea of how influential and widely applied the 
intervention has been, although newer papers will have 
been cited less often. Good search terms would include 
‘bullying’ and ‘intervention’.
2 there are many such interventions, and articles outlining and 
testing interventions will be available to you for free through 
your institution’s library or on publicly accessible websites. 
Retrieve three of these articles. they should be original 
empirical papers describing and outlining a single intervention 
with method and results sections, rather than review articles. 
Write a paragraph on each aspect of each paper: 
• Interventions are informed by a theoretical 
understanding of the causes of the problem. What 
theoretical assumptions does each article make about 
the causes of bullying?
• What are the key features of each intervention? how 
thoroughly described are they and how do they relate to 
the underlying theoretical assumption?
• how was the effectiveness of the manipulation tested? 
What outcomes were assessed, how, and with what 
results?
3 In addition to original empirical papers, meta-analyses and 
other reviews of the literature (literature reviews that do not 
include a meta-analysis are sometimes called qualitative 
reviews) are useful sources in consultancies like this. they 
typically compare and contrast different theories, 
interventions and methods for testing the effectiveness of 
interventions. thus, they provide you with an excellent 
overview of the research literature and also help you find 
empirical articles that may have escaped your attention. 
Find at least one review article published within the past 10 
years on bullying interventions. 
4 Write down the full citation of the review paper you have 
found, and summarize its key conclusions in one or two 
paragraphs. Notably, how effective generally do bullying 
interventions seem to be? Which type of intervention seems 
to be most effective? What outcomes are most likely to be 
affected by bullying interventions? Note that some 
interventions do not affect actual rates of bullying 
behaviour, and may not be designed to do so: instead, some 
bullying interventions target attitudes to bullying.
5 Finally, restrict the search you did in exercise 1 above to the 
past two years, to find a new bullying intervention. this 
will help give you some idea of the ‘state of the art’ in the 
field. Note down the full citation and summarize as you did 
in 2 above. 
6 Now, write a brief summary of the report you would provide 
for the school. this should fit on two sides of an A4 page. 
Your report summary should include:
• a title
• a definition of bullying and a summary of its 
consequences for school children
• major theoretical accounts of bullying
• an evaluation of different approaches to intervention – 
which is most likely to be effective?
• recommendations for steps that the school should take 
to reduce bullying
• recommendations for how the school should test the 
success of its intervention
• a reference list (citations should be made in text, in  
APA format).

Applying
ideology, sport and war
As we saw in this chapter, there is no research on the ideological 
nature of aggressive contact sports. however, several theorists 
have described sport as a kind of symbolic substitute for war, 
with many of the same elements of physical struggle and a 
quest for dominance. thus, it is reasonable to expect that 
enjoyment and approval of aggressive contact sports will be 
positively associated with positive attitudes to warfare. It is 
also possible that personality and ideological variables like 
SDo, which underpin support for war, are also related to 
aggressive contact sports. however, these ideas have not been 
directly tested, as far as we can tell.
1 Design a project that assesses whether positive attitudes to 
aggressive contact sports are correlated with positive 
attitudes to warfare and also with SDo. the SDo scale is 
included in the chapter, but you will need to adapt or 
develop scales to measure attitudes to sport and war. 
usually, it is best to try to adapt tried and tested scales from 
published articles. that way, you do not have to worry about 
the scales you have developed being unreliable or invalid, 
and it will be easier to interpret your results. using 
databases or search engines such as Google Scholar, try to 
find reliable and valid scales. (In the chapter, we have also 
cited papers that assess attitudes to war and participation 
and enjoyment of aggressive sports.) If you cannot find 
them, then develop the scales. Write a structured abstract of 
no more than 500 words for your project. this should include 
the following headings: background, aims, participants, 
measures and hypotheses. Also include a copy of your 
proposed questionnaire in an appendix.
2 If the competitive, dominance-oriented worldview is 
reinforced by aggressive contact sports, we might expect 
that SDo, and support for war, would be increased 
immediately after watching or participating in such sports. 
In no more than 250 words, outline an experimental or 
quasi-experimental study to test this hypothesis. You can 
use the same measure of attitudes to war that you 
employed in the first study.

Policing of crowd behaviour and violence
Jade Norris studied as an 
undergraduate student at 
Aberystwyth university, and her 
final-year dissertation was 
supervised by Dr Gareth hall. In 
this chapter, we spent some time 
discussing the problem of violence 
among sport followers. Jade’s 
research explores aspects of the 
policing of crowd behaviour and violence. It is also relevant to 
group behaviour (Chapter 10) and us/them thinking in 
intergroup relations (Chapter 11). 
My topic and aims
My research examined whether police discourse regarding 
public order policing (e.g., protest policing and police presence 
at football matches) reflects outdated perceptions of crowd 
behaviour. I also asked whether police officers’ discourse 
changes over time – for example, does discourse change after 
training as a special constable?
‘outdated’ perceptions of crowd behaviour refer to the ideas 
of le Bon (1896) and Allport (1924) towards crowds as 
inherently barbaric and dangerous, with a tendency to be easily 
led by a violent minority. My study aimed to assess the impact 
of such perceptions on practical policing tactics, media coverage 
and accountability. It is possible that the unnecessary use of 
indiscriminate force and physical tactics is perpetuated by 
outdated perceptions of crowds. this is applicable to tragic 
incidents such as the death of Ian tomlinson in 2009, which 
sparked debate in the uk about a seemingly deteriorating 
relationship between the police and the public.
In 2010, I began training as a special constable with Dyfed-
Powys police. the training materials and delivery methods 
intrigued me. In particular, I was keen to understand to what 
extent training discourse can impact perceptions, and how these 
perceptions can potentially influence behaviour. At around this 
time, the student protests and london riots occurred. As the 
media began to place blame on either the rioters or the police, I 
was keen to investigate how these perceptions of accountability, 
crowd behaviour, and the efficacy of tactics could influence 
practical application of public order policing.  

607
Understanding and controlling aggression
My methods
My project used a longitudinal design and qualitative methods. 
Semi-structured interviews were conducted with four trainee 
police constables before and after their six-month training 
period. the longitudinal design accounted for any perceptual 
changes after receiving training, and the pre-training 
interviews allowed for perceptions minimally influenced by 
immersion within the police institution. All interviews were 
transcribed, and were analysed using discourse analysis. this 
method was utilized to investigate the ways in which different 
constructions of blame and accountability were used, to create 
a picture of the interviewee’s perceptions of crowd behaviour, 
and to understand their perceptions of the efficacy of public 
order policing tactics.  
My findings and their implications
It was found that both before and after the training period, the 
interviewees constructed the crowd in terms of ‘outdated’ 
attitudes. For example, they provided examples of ‘mob 
mentality’ and its implications for the behaviour of the crowd as 
a whole. these examples tended to increase in frequency 
throughout the constructions at post-training, suggesting that 
the institutional discourse may reflect outdated perceptions. this 
would imply that institutional discourse has not shifted towards 
more recent theories of crowd behaviour, such as social identity 
theories. It was concluded that these outdated perceptions could 
be harmful when mixed with the practical application of public 
order tactics, in that the assumption that a crowd is inherently 
dangerous could lead to increased use of indiscriminate force, 
and perhaps create a self-fulfilling prophecy. Practical 
limitations of the study were acknowledged – in particular, it is 
difficult during a public order situation to utilize discriminate 
force (that is, target each individual breaking the law separately, 
without using controversial tactics such as kettling, that detain 
ordinary bystanders as well as law breakers).  
Although previous literature had examined the use of tactics 
fuelled by outdated perceptions of crowd behaviour, few had 
undertaken a qualitative analysis of these perceptions within 
the police service. Stott and Reicher (1998) introduced the 
police perspective by interviewing public order trained officers. 
however, the current study interviewed the trainees both 
before and after training, which allowed for the investigation of 
perceptions of crowds from the ‘public’ perspective before 
training. the analysis suggests that pre-training constructions of 
crowds were only further solidified throughout training, 
suggesting that outdated perceptions of crowd behaviour could 
be more commonly held than simply within the police service. 
the interviewees did not receive any formal public order 
training, which suggests that the perceptions talked about 
during interview reflect institutional everyday discourse. My 
dissertation concluded by acknowledging the need for explicit 
introduction of newer theories of crowd behaviour, and reduced 
reliance on le Bonian literature within training materials.  
My journey
I am starting a PhD in September. I intend to work within 
academia, continuing with research and also teaching.
My project opened my eyes to complicated methods of 
policing, but also to the value of qualitative analysis. My 
interviewing skills have been enhanced by the experience, and 
my flexibility and open-mindedness in terms of analysis have 
increased. As a whole, conducting the research increased my 
self-confidence, not only in research and writing skills, but in 
professional self-presentation. this was achieved through 
integration with other institutions leading to the effective 
management of data collection.
My advice
My advice would be to start on your project early, gather up key 
articles both old and new, and always try to take a critical 
approach to the literature you use. look for a ‘gap’ in the 
literature which you could address through your research 
project to ensure you have a relatively ‘new’ idea. I think it is 
also important that the project could be applicable in the real 
world, and that your findings could be useful in terms of 
practical application.

In this chapter, we examine some of the positive aspects of social behaviour, considering what 
leads people to perform acts of kindness and generosity towards others. First, we consider 
how people make sacrifices for the benefit of others (altruism), but also whether this can, 
in part, fulfil selfish motives. We consider how people respond to social dilemmas and how 
cooperative behaviour can be encouraged. We then outline why people defend justice and 
how the importance of social justice influences the way people think, feel and act towards 
others. By the end of this chapter, you will have a good understanding of altruism and justice.

city streets, you notice a heated argument between a 
man and a woman. the man is shouting and looks like 
he is about to hit the woman, who is clearly distressed. 
Rather than helping, everyone appears to be walking 
past, ignoring the woman’s plight. Is this unusual, and 
why is it happening? Under what conditions are people 
more likely to help?

Much of this book has been concerned with the worst in human nature – the 
defective thinking, self-centredness, mindlessness, parochialism, cruelty and 
violence of which we, as a species, are so capable. In doing so, the focus of this 
book simply reflects that of the discipline of social psychology, which has always 
been concerned with finding solutions to social problems such as aggression and 
prejudice. As we saw in Chapter 9, much of the impetus for experimental social 
psychology was provided by the Holocaust that took place during the Second 
World War. While Milgram, Asch and Sherif built up a theoretical and empirical 
edifice to try to explain the horrors of the Holocaust, Oliner and Oliner (1988) 
set out to document, and explain, the extraordinary acts of kindness that 
occurred during this darkest period of human history. In their estimate, between 
50,000 and 500,000 non-Jewish people risked their own and their families’ lives 
in Nazi-occupied Europe in order to shelter Jewish people from the death 
camps. For every one of these people, Oliner and Oliner estimated that some 10 
more risked their lives to help indirectly, for example by donating food or trans-
mitting messages. 
Exploring further Search popular media sites for accounts of two or more acts of individual heroism, altruism or 
bravery. How are these behaviours explained in the popular media accounts? Read on and see how these popular 
explanations compare with those developed by social psychologists.
As social psychologists, we are interested in what leads so many people to 
perform these amazing acts of kindness. Just as the worst of human behaviours 
needs to be explained and controlled, so do the best of behaviours. In this chapter, 
our concern is how to realize some of the best, noblest impulses of human beings – 
to make sacrifices in order to help others and to love and defend justice. To some 
extent, then, this is where social psychology intersects with positive psychology – a 
humanistic tradition that focuses on the best aspects of human nature and experi-
ence rather than the worst (Seligman and Csikszentmihalyi, 2000). 
Although generosity and striving for justice represent some of the most noble 
aspects of human psychology, this chapter is by no means devoid of studies that 
document human failings. Often, and under predictable circumstances, people do 
not act according to these prosocial motivations. Sometimes, as we shall see, these 
motivations ironically lead people to engage in antisocial behaviour, such as the 
blame and derogation of the victims of injustice. Also, we shall see how even 
prosocial behaviours, such as helping others, may be inspired by selfish motives, 
such as the desire to feel better about ourselves. The ‘good’ and the ‘evil’ in human 
nature appear to be more closely related than most people would normally think. 
In this chapter, we begin by examining the social psychological literature on 
altruism, in which we consider the human capacity to sacrifice one’s own interests 
to benefit others. We then consider the importance of social justice to people and 
the effect – sometimes paradoxical – this has on the way they think, feel and act 
towards others. 
Positive psychology A 
movement within psychology 
that emphasizes how positive 
aspects of human nature 
and experience can be 
enhanced. It is informed by 
the philosophical position of 
humanism, which assumes 
that human nature is 
ultimately good.

Altruism and justice
Altruism
Altruism refers to an action that is performed to benefit another person without 
benefiting the self. It is a more specific example of helping behaviour, which is an 
action that is performed with the explicit intention of helping another person. The 
key difference between the two is that altruistic behaviour, unlike helping behav-
iour, does not benefit, and can sometimes be to the detriment of, the self. Both are 
examples of an even broader category of behaviour known as prosocial behaviours. 
These are behaviours that are valued by others in society – in contrast with behav-
iours that are antisocial. 
Two great puzzles have motivated research on human altruism. First, it is 
unclear why human beings are as altruistic as they are. The science of economics 
has long been built on the assumption that people 
pursue their own interests, selecting courses of 
action according to whether they maximize benefits 
and minimize costs to themselves. This notion of 
self-interest is at the heart of capitalism (e.g., Buch-
holz, 2009; Smith, [1759]2007), which is now the 
dominant mode of political and economic organiza-
tion worldwide (Hall and Soskice, 2001). However, 
if we accept this starting position, it is not obvious 
why people would act in defiance of their own self-
interest in order to help other people. In particular, 
one puzzling finding is that lower income individ-
uals tend to give more money to charity than high-
income earners (Greve, 2009; Piff, Kraus, Côté et al., 
2010) (see Figure 14.1). Why would they do this? Similarly, evolutionary biolo-
gists have struggled to explain altruistic behaviour, which poses a threat to the 
survival of an individual organism for the benefit of other organisms – even organ-
isms with which it may be competing to survive and reproduce. These major intel-
lectual traditions tend to assume that individuals must be supremely selfish. 
Conversely, although people are sometimes helpful in ways that are hard to 
relate to dominant understandings of human nature, historians and social psychol-
ogists alike have documented many cases in which people have shown a shocking 
failure to help others, even in ways that would cost them very little and even in 
circumstances where failure to help has potentially lethal consequences. These 
examples confound our commonsense understanding of people as possessing 
empathy, conscience and a desire to do the right thing. And, of course, they pose a 
practical problem for social psychologists, whose collective job, arguably, is to 
employ psychological methods and concepts in order to improve socially valued 
outcomes such as helping behaviour. 
Time to reflect Why are the poor the most charitable when this does not fulfil human self-serving tendencies?

suggest that those with the

charity, whereas the highest 
income earners (earning an 
average of $158,888 per year) 
gave only 2.1%. the national 
average was 2.2%.

The study of altruism has focused on three key themes. First, there has been 
extensive study of bystander intervention. Second, there has been a lot of research 
on the situational and dispositional determinants of helping behaviour more 
generally. Third, there has been a great deal of research on helping behaviour in 
the context of social dilemmas, where people must decide either to help themselves 
or to help the collective of which they are a part.
Bystander intervention
When people witness the suffering of others, they have two basic choices – to help 
or do nothing. Under what circumstances do they help? Social psychologists’ 
interest in altruism was captured by the phenomenon of bystander intervention. 
Research on bystander intervention was triggered by a tragic and shocking case in 
which it appeared that many people chose to do nothing while a woman was raped 
and murdered right outside their homes.
In 1964, at about 3.15am on a cold New York night, Kitty Genovese drove 
back to her apartment block after a night working as a manager of a bar in Queens. 
While walking from her car to the building, she was brutally stabbed by a complete 
stranger, who left the scene, only to return some 10 minutes later to rape and kill 
her in a stairwell. Media reports of the attack caused an outrage, not least because 
it was reported that some 38 residents in nearby apartment buildings heard her 
cries for help and witnessed the attack but did nothing, not even taking the trouble 
to call the police. As we shall see, the numbers of witnesses and exactly what they 
knew about the attack, and the extent of their inaction, have since been called into 
question. Nonetheless, so shocking was the apparent inaction of the bystanders 
that, in the popular press and in social psychology alike, its significance came to 
overshadow the appalling and apparently sexually motivated murder itself (e.g., 
Latané and Darley, 1968). The alleged failure of these 38 witnesses to act became 
an emblem of the all-too-frequent failure of bystanders to intervene. Further, it 
inspired a plethora of studies that demonstrated the failure of bystanders to inter-
vene in a number of simulated emergencies (Manning, Levine and Collins, 2007). 
These studies also yielded valuable insights into the reasons underlying the 
apathy of bystanders, and the factors that encourage bystander intervention. The 
first experimental research into bystander intervention in the wake of the Kitty 
Genovese case was conducted by Darley and Latané (1968). Participants were 
seated in rooms alone and communicated with other participants through an 
intercom. One ‘participant’ was actually a confederate of the experimenters, who 
during the experiment pretended to have a seizure, asked for help and then began 
to choke. Participants believed that just they, one other participant, or four other 
participants could hear the emergency unfolding. The dependent variable was 
whether the participant made an attempt to help the confederate. As Figure 14.2 
shows, participants’ willingness to help sharply declined as the number of other 
bystanders increased. Further, participants hesitated for much longer as group 
size increased. 
Bystander intervention the 
act of helping a person in 
danger or distress by people 
who are not its cause.

613
Altruism and justice
Why does the presence of other bystanders stop people from helping? Latané 
and Darley (1968) thought that as the number of bystanders increased, people 
were less likely to notice the incident, less likely to interpret it as a problem at all, 
and less likely to assume responsibility for taking action (see Figure 14.3). 
More specifically, this adverse effect 
of group size points to the notion that 
bystander intervention is impaired by 
the diffusion of responsibility – the percep-
tion that ‘it’s none of my business’ or that 
‘someone else will deal with this’ (Darley 
and Latané, 1968). This is rather like the 
phenomenon of social loafing encoun-
tered in Chapter 10, where you are likely 
to pull harder in a tug-of-war if it is just 
you against one other person than if you 
are in a large team. Other studies have 
shown that diffusion of responsibility is not the only reason why bystanders fail 
to intervene. Another reason is pluralistic ignorance – the situation where people 
wrongly assume, based on others’ actions, that they endorse a particular norm 
(Latané and Rodin, 1969; Prentice and Miller, 1996). In other words, if you 
observe others standing by doing nothing about an unfolding emergency, you 
may wrongly infer that they believe intervention is not necessary. The problem is, 
they may be committing the same error, and inferring from your inaction that you 
think intervention is not necessary. In the worst-case scenario, the collective effect 
of this fallacy is that nobody does anything. Latané and Darley (1968) demon-
strated this by pumping large quantities of smoke into a room in which partici-
pants were completing questionnaires (see Figure 14.4). When participants were 
alone in the room, 75% of them reported the smoke. When the room contained 
three participants, only 38% reported the smoke. When the room contained the 
participant and two passive confederates, just 10% reported the smoke.

Still other studies implicate further barriers to bystander intervention. If people 
are in a hurry, they help less, perhaps because they are less likely even to notice the 
emergency (Darley and Batson, 1973). Even if they do notice an emergency 
unfolding, motivated cognition processes may kick in that are designed to mini-
mize anxiety and distress (as we saw in Chapters 2, 3 and 4). This means, for 
example, that people are sometimes inclined to interpret emergencies in ways that 
downplay their seriousness, just as some of the witnesses in the Kitty Genovese 
case assumed that a domestic dispute or minor assault was occurring (Wilson and 
Petruska, 1984). Conversely, research has uncovered factors that promote 
bystander intervention. Groups of individuals who have drunk alcohol (Steele, 
Critchlow and Liu, 1985) or who are friends (Rutkowski, Gruder and Romer, 
1983) are less inhibited about intervening. Bystanders are more likely to help if 
they believe those around them are willing to intervene, particularly if these 
bystanders are ‘ingroup’ as opposed to ‘outgroup’ (Levine, Cassidy, Brazier and 
Reicher, 2002). However, as we shall see in the Critical focus box, there is contro-
versy over the facts of the Kitty Genovese case and the mark it has made on social 
psychological thinking about altruism.

Bystander intervention and the tragic case of 
Kitty genovese
In a review article, manning, Levine and Collins (2007) 
examined the role the Kitty Genovese story has played in 
social psychology, both in research on helping and in 
textbook coverage. they found that the original media 
reports contained inaccuracies, unsubstantiated reports 
and omissions, which together exaggerate the extent 
of bystander intervention in the Kitty Genovese case. 
For example:
• Despite the number of witnesses (38) cited in media 
reports, no list of these was ever made.
• the public prosecutor in the case could fi nd only ‘about 
half a dozen witnesses that saw what was going on, 
that we could use’.
• the fi rst and second attack on Kitty Genovese took 
place in diff erent locations, meaning that few people 
could have seen the whole episode and understood 
its magnitude.
• trial witnesses reported that they believed they were 
witnessing the aftermath of an assault, rather than a 
stabbing.
• Witnesses later claimed that they or others had 
reported the fi rst attack to the police. At the time, there 
was no emergency number (911) system in place. 
Police had a reputation for hostile or indiff erent 
responses to some emergency calls, and received many 
calls for aff rays associated with a bar on the street on 
which Kitty Genovese was murdered. After the attack, 
the emergency call system was reformed.
• the murderer left the scene after one witness had 
shouted out of his window to scare him off . 
the attack occurred after 3am, when people had their 
windows closed and were unlikely to be able to identify 
the noises they might have heard as a cry for help. All this 
in an inner-city street accustomed to disturbances in the 
middle of the night. However tragic, lamentable and even 
inexcusable the inaction of some local residents may have 

615
Altruism and justice
been, there is no evidence that a large number of people 
were aware of what was happening to Kitty Genovese but 
did nothing. manning et al. (2007, p. 561) describe the 
Kitty Genovese story, as it was reported, as ‘a stubborn and 
intractable urban myth’, which, for them, ‘makes its 
continued presence at the heart of the social psychology 
of helping even more unfortunate’. 
In addition, manning et al. (2007, p. 555) argue that 
despite the undoubted quality and importance of the 
research on bystander intervention, which media reports 
of this case inspired, those reports have also contributed 
to a biased view of helping behaviour in social 
psychology: 
We suggest that, almost from its inception, the story of 
the 38 witnesses became a kind of modern parable – 
the antonym of the parable of the good Samaritan. 
Whereas the good Samaritan parable venerates the 
individual who helps while others walk by, the story of 
the 38 witnesses in psychology tells of the malign 
influence of others to overwhelm the will of the 
individual. the power of the story comes from the 
moral lesson about the dangers of the group and how 
the presence of others can undermine the bonds of 
neighborly concern. We argue that the repeated 
telling of the parable of the 38 witnesses has served to 
curtail the imaginative space of helping research in 
social psychology.
What manning et al. (2007) mean is that the effect of the 
mistold Kitty Genovese story has been to constrain the 
way researchers, textbook authors and students of social 
psychology think about helping behaviour. the notion 
that people are unwilling to help, especially when in the 
presence of others, has taken an undue hold on social 
psychological thinking. It has caused less attention to be 
paid to the possibility that under some conditions, the 
presence of others, especially when those others comprise 
a meaningful ‘group’, may be a boon to bystander 
intervention and helping behaviour more generally. 
Indeed, Levine and Crowther (2008) argued that under 
some circumstances, group size may actually increase 
helping behaviour. When people in a bystander situation 
feel that helping is normative – the expected, normal 
thing to do – they are more likely to help. For example, 
friends are accustomed to helping and supporting each 
other, and so when the other bystanders are your friends, 
rather than strangers, a norm of helping is likely to be 
more salient to you. Likewise, when the victim is an 
ingroup rather than an outgroup member, the norm that 
one helps other ingroup members (see Chapter 11) may 
be reinforced by the presence of other bystanders who 
belong to the same group. thus, the presence of 
bystanders who are friends and who, like you, share group 
membership with the victim may actually increase 
bystander intervention. Levine and Crowther conducted 
studies to test these predictions and found they were 
supported. In one study, British undergraduates indicated 
they would be more likely to help in a bystander 
intervention scenario if they were with a group of five 
friends rather than just one friend. Conversely, echoing the 
Latané and Darley (1968) findings, participants indicated 
they would be less likely to help when in the presence of 
five strangers as opposed to one. In another study, 
increasing the group size of women led to increased 
helping of a female confederate, whereas increasing the 
group size of men did not. 
Levine and Crowther were not the first to demonstrate 
that the presence of others can promote helping. In a 
rather extreme version of the bystander intervention 
paradigm, Harari, Harari and White (1985) staged a 
simulated rape in the corner of a car park. they found that 
male bystanders were significantly more likely to 
intervene when they were accompanied by other men 
than when they were alone. Presumably, in some 
situations where it might be dangerous for people to act 
alone, they feel empowered to intervene by the presence 
of other people, whose help they might be able to recruit. 
manning et al. (2007) point out a lesson that can be 
drawn about social psychology more generally from 
bystander research. One way of doing social psychology is 
not only to test hypotheses derived from a particular 
theoretical argument and accept or reject the argument 
accordingly, but also to think about each argument as 
being balanced by an opposing position. this is what Billig 
(1987) calls a rhetorical approach to social psychology, in 
which knowledge of the subject is understood as the 
balance of opposing arguments. In principle, each 
argument has an opposite. It can enrich our understanding 
enormously if we are prepared at least to entertain the 
opposite of our position. So, manning et al. (2007, p. 561) 
write: ‘In the helping tradition, the argument that groups 
inhibit helping should be haunted by the possibility (at 
least) of the opposite – that groups can facilitate helping.’ 
Among other benefits, this helps us clarify the scope of our 
ideas and identify cases where opposing arguments hold – 
as in Levine and Crowther’s (2008) studies. 

616
Applying
more generally, here we have another case in which, 
throughout the 1950s and 60s, when many of the most 
important breakthroughs were being made in social 
psychology, there was a strong tendency to assume that 
groups were a pernicious influence on society. Not only in 
the case of altruism but also in the literatures on 
aggression, prejudice and decision making, groups were 
seen to corrupt or override the rationality and morality of 
the individual. more recently, in particular since the 
advent of social identity theory (tajfel and turner, 1986), 
social psychologists have paid more careful attention to 
the positive, facilitating and enabling effect that groups 
can have on our lives. thus, if we apply the terms of 
Billig’s (1987) rhetorical framework, the generally 
unspoken sentiment that ‘groups are bad’ is now being 
balanced by more attention to the opposite assertion that 
‘groups are good’. Both sentiments capture important 
aspects of social life but neither can be said to be entirely 
true or entirely false.

different results than have been obtained in the article 
you have just read, for example? Find and read an 
article and try it for yourself. It may also help you find 
studies and theories in the literature that draw

Determinants of altruism
Helpfulness is not only important in the case of emergency bystander situations. 
In a host of other situations and in other ways, we can choose whether or not to 
help, for example by donating to the needy, offering support to family members 
or friends going through difficult times, or volunteering time to work for chari-
table causes. A great deal of research has examined what causes people to offer 
these kinds of help. The research has centred around three key questions. First, is 
the personality or the situation a more important determinant of helping behav-
iour? Second, in what sense (if any) is helping behaviour truly altruistic, designed 
to help with no thought for any benefit to the helper? And third, might the human 
willingness to help under some circumstances have evolved? 
Personality and situational factors that give rise to helping
Some of the early research on altruism was inspired by a sliver of light that emerged 
from the moral darkness of the Second World War. Specifically, what caused some 
individuals to risk their own lives in order to shelter Jewish people from the Holo-
caust, while others did nothing to intervene or even collaborated with the Nazis 
(Oliner, 2004)? These stark differences between people in their response to the 
Holocaust led early thinkers to postulate that there must be some important person-
ality variables at play. Theory and research were devoted to determining whether 
there was such a thing as an ‘altruistic personality’, that is, a stable psychological 

617
Altruism and justice
makeup that predisposes people to help others. Research attention was also paid to 
finding out what traits this altruistic personality might be made up of (Oliner and 
Oliner, 1988; Rushton, 1980; Rushton, Chrisjohn and Fekken, 1981; Staub, 1978). 
Much of the research involved correlational studies in which researchers attempted 
to find relationships between personality characteristics, other individual factors, 
and helpful behaviours. The following have been identified:
1 Machiavellianism: This personality trait is associated with a willingness and 
preparedness to exploit or manipulate others in the pursuit of one’s own goals. 
As we might expect, it is negatively correlated with willingness to help – as 
Machiavellianism goes up, helping goes down (McHoskey, 1999).
2 The belief in a just world: People who believe the world is a just place in which 
people get what they deserve are, in some cases, more inclined to help others. 
However, the belief in a just world may only encourage helping behaviour 
among people who are awaiting an important outcome for themselves. Under 
such conditions, people may help others, guided by a superstitious and prob-
ably unconscious belief that doing so will help them. This was exactly what 
Zuckerman (1975) observed. University students who scored high on a scale 
measuring the strength of just world beliefs were more likely to help (e.g., by 
volunteering to participate in experiments or act as a reader for a blind student) 
than those who scored low on the same scale. However, this difference only 
emerged shortly before their examinations and was not present in the middle of 
term (Zuckerman, 1975). In general, the belief in a just world is likely to 
discourage people from doing wrong or failing in moral duties (Hafer, 2000; 
Sutton and Winnard, 2007), but is less likely to encourage people to help when 
they do not feel they have a strong obligation to do so (Dalbert, 1999; Strelan 
and Sutton, 2011). 
3 Empathy: People are more helpful when they empathize with a victim who is in 
need of help. This involves taking the perspective of the victim, and is associ-
ated with emotional reactions such as compassion, tenderness, soft-heartedness 
and sympathy, which together can be termed empathic concern (Batson and 
Shaw, 1991). Personality psychologists have shown that people who are gener-
ally prone to empathic concern tend be able to take the perspective of others, 
and also to be more helpful across situations (Bierhoff, Klein and Kramp, 1991; 
Eisenberg and Miller, 1987). For example, people who score high on empathy 
tend to donate to charity more (Davis, 1983) and take the place of a person who 
is engaging in an upsetting task (Carlo, Eisenberg, Troyer et al., 1991). Indi-
vidual differences in empathy and perspective-taking show up in childhood 
(Knight, Johnson, Carlo and Eisenberg, 1994) and are therefore argued to have 
some genetic basis. 
4 Moral reasoning: The extent to which a person’s willingness to help is a function 
of their own needs versus overarching moral standards (Eisenberg and Miller, 
1987). People who use higher level reasoning to solve moral dilemmas tend to 
show greater empathy and altruism. For example, children who watched a 
video of an injured child and were then given the opportunity to play with 
Machiavellianism Individual 
differences variable 
associated with the tendency 
to manipulate others for 
personal gain.

some toys, or organize toys to be sent to a hospital, chose the latter option 
more to the extent that they used higher level moral reasoning (Miller, Eisen-
berg, Fabes and Shell, 1996). 
5 Widened feelings of responsibility: Oliner and Oliner (1988) argued that exten-
sivity is a characteristic of helpful people. Part of extensivity is a person’s sense 
that they are obligated to help not just those in their immediate social circle, 
such as close friends and family, but also those more distant from themselves. 
In other words, extensivity is the belief that ‘I should help everyone in my 
society, not just those close to me’. Einolf (2010) developed a measure of exten-
sivity (see the Try it yourself feature below) and found scores to be associated 
with helping behaviours such as donations of time and money to various causes. 
Later in this chapter, we will encounter a related idea, namely Opotow’s (1990) 
concept of moral inclusion and exclusion. We all consider some beings as 
worthy of moral regard, who have moral rights and who can be wronged. We 
differ in how closely to ourselves we draw the line – at the ingroup, at certain 
outgroups, at humans, or at animals more generally. 
6 Religiosity: In some research, religious beliefs have been associated with more 
altruistic behaviour. For example, Hansen, Vandenberg and Patterson (1995) 
showed that university students who described themselves as more religious 
spent more time volunteering with various university organizations. However, 
this is not always the case. For example, Jackson and Esses (1997) found that 
people holding strong conservative religious beliefs (e.g., fundamentalists) were 
likely to help some people, but not others. Their willingness to help was deter-
mined by perceived deservingness of help. Specifically, people were likely to 
help those they felt were deserving, but not those whose behaviour went against 
their religious beliefs (e.g., homosexuals) (see also Batson, Floyd, Meyer and 
Winner, 1999; Skitka and Tetlock, 1993). 
7 Gender: Findings suggest that men and women differ considerably in their like-
lihood of helping in various types of situations (Becker and Eagly, 2004; Eagly, 
1987). For example, men tend to show more acts of altruism than women in 
situations where heroism and bravery are involved (e.g., saving someone from a 
fire) and this finding generalizes across cultures (Johnson, Danko, Darvill et al., 
1989). One explanation for these gender differences comes from an evolutionary 
perspective. Specifically, Kelly and Dunbar (2001) argue that women prefer men 
who are brave over those who are less brave – men are aware of this preference 
and are therefore motivated to act bravely. On the other hand, women appear to 
be more likely to help in situations that call for long-term care and volunteering 
(Becker and Eagly, 2004). However, gender differences like these can also be 
explained in terms of socially constructed norms and gender roles. 
8 Mood: Research suggests that both positive and negative moods can lead to 
helping. For example, if people are put into a good mood by being offered a 
biscuit (Isen and Levin, 1972) or listening to uplifting music (North, Tarrant 
and Hargreaves, 2004), they tend to be more helpful. These findings suggest 
that people act altruistically in order to maintain a positive mood. Thus, people

who are in a good mood may help in order not to have their mood ‘brought 
down’ by others’ suffering (Wegener and Petty, 1994). Perhaps, people in a 
good mood focus more generally on the positives rather than the negatives, 
which leads to increased helping. Or, being in a good mood may make people 
more aware of their values (e.g., Batson et al., 1999). This may all sound good, 
but other findings suggest that bad moods can increase altruistic behaviour 
(Regan, Williams and Sparling, 1972). As we will see later, people who are made 
to feel guilty are more likely to help (Regan, 1971). One reason why this may 
occur is because being in a bad mood makes people more motivated to make up 
for whatever happened to induce the negative feeling. However, as we will also 
see later, sometimes being in a bad mood can make people less altruistic. In 
particular, being ostracized makes people less likely to want to help (Twenge, 
Baumeister, DeWall et al., 2007). 
9 Having positive role models: Some findings suggest that people are more altru-
istic if they have witnessed altruistic behaviour from role models such as parents 
and peers (Schroeder, Penner, Dovidio and Piliavin, 1995). Seeing others 
perform helping behaviour provides people with strong examples of how to 
behave and reinforces positive prosocial norms and the social value of helping. 
For example, Bryan and Test (1967) showed that people were 10 times more 
likely to stop for a woman with a flat tyre on the side of the road if a quarter of 
a mile earlier they saw someone being helped in a similar situation.

Applying
However, there are also situational factors that determine helping behaviour, 
such as culture and similarity, which we discuss briefly here: 
1 Culture: The likelihood of helping behaviour differs significantly across 
cultures. Levine, Norenzayan and Philbrick (2001) examined three types of 
helping behaviour in 23 different countries – assisting a blind person across the 
street, picking up a dropped pen, and picking up magazines for an injured 
person. They found that helping behaviour was strongest in Brazil (100%, 
100% and 80% for the different scenarios respectively), followed by Costa 
Rica, Malawi and India. Malaysia was at the bottom (53%, 26% and 41% for 
the different scenarios respectively), with the USA a close second last, and 
Singapore in third last place. One factor that appears to determine cultural 
differences in altruism is productivity. Specifically, countries in which people 
earn more actually help less. Those who witness economic deprivation more 
often are perhaps more able to empathize with others and thus help more. Reli-
gion could also be a factor in determining cultural differences in helping behav-
iour. Differences may also be the result of different cultural norms for helping 
behaviour. For example, cultures differ with respect to the norm of reciprocity 
(Miller and Bersoff, 1994), with some countries such as the USA seeing reci-
procity as a matter of choice, but others seeing it as a matter of obligation. We 
will return to culture throughout this chapter, especially when we discuss the 
topic of justice. 
2 Similarity: As you learned in Chapter 7, similarity is a significant factor in deter-
mining who we like. It is probably not surprising therefore that people are also 
more empathic and helpful towards people who are similar to them (Miller, 
Kozu and Davis, 2001; Stürmer, Snyder, Kropp and Siem, 2006). For example, 
students who have been through a romantic breakup feel more empathy for 
someone who has had a similar experience (Batson, Sympson, Hindman et al., 
1996). People are more likely to help those who are similar in dress, nationality 
and various attitudes (Dovidio and Morris, 1975; Holloway, Tucker and Horn-
stein, 1977). DeBruine (2002) morphed participants’ faces with strangers’ faces 
to make a composite face and found that participants were more generous to the 
composite face rather than the stranger’s face, presumably because it was more 
similar to the self. One important type of similarity relates to the groups we 
belong to. For example, in a study by Levine, Prosser, Evans and Reicher (2005), 
Manchester United football supporters completed a series of questionnaires and 
were then asked to walk to a different part of the building to complete the next 
part of the study. As they walked down a hallway, they saw another person (a 
confederate) slip and fall, appearing to have hurt their ankle. In one condition, 
the person was wearing a Manchester United jersey, in another condition they 
wore a Liverpool jersey (a rival football team) and in a control condition, the 
victim wore a generic shirt with no name on it. Levine et al. then examined 
whether the participants stopped to help the person. As they expected, partici-
pants were more likely to help someone who was wearing a Manchester United 
jersey rather than either of the others. Specifically, 92% of those wearing the 

621
Altruism and justice
Manchester United jersey were helped, in comparison with 33% of those 
wearing Liverpool shirts and 30% with no-name shirts. Ingroup similarity is 
therefore a key factor in determining a person’s willingness to help another. 
3 The power of the situation: Guided by the prevailing notion of ‘the power of 
the situation’ that had led social psychologists to examine how normal people 
could perform monstrous acts (e.g., Milgram, 1965; see Chapter 9), researchers 
in the 1970s began to examine how social situations could lead people to help 
or not, whatever their character. As we have seen, one strand of this research 
focused on bystander intervention. Other lines of research examined what 
might drive individuals to help in more private settings. Regan (1971) led 
participants to believe that the experiment in which they were taking part had 
been ruined. Half the participants were also led to believe that this was their 
fault. Compared to control participants, they subsequently donated more to a 
charity. Later, Regan, Williams and Sparling (1972) replicated this effect under 
more realistic conditions in a field experiment. Female shoppers were 
approached by a male experimenter who asked if they could take his photo-
graph. The camera failed to work. The experimenter led half the women to 
think they had broken the camera (this was the experimental condition), and 
the control group of women to believe it was not their fault. Soon afterwards, a 
female experimenter walked across the women’s path, carrying a broken shop-
ping bag from which groceries were spilling. Over half (55%) of the women in 
the experimental group went out of their way to tell her, whereas only 15% of 
control group women did. Apparently, the incidental experience of guilt was 
powerful enough to more than triple the incidence of altruism. These experi-
ments shaped later research on helping behaviour in two key ways. First, they 
demonstrated the power of the situation to shape helping behaviour. As a result, 
most researchers since have taken an experimental approach, examining the 
situational factors that influence helping. Second, they seemed to show that 
people help others for a selfish reason – to make themselves feel better. Much of 
the research has followed up this paradoxical result.

traits and individual differences associated with prosocial behaviour.
Altruism: inspired by empathy or more selfish motives? 
Some researchers, most notably Cialdini (1991) and Cialdini, Brown, Lewis et al. 
(1997), reached an unsettling conclusion – if people help others in order to help 
themselves, there may be no such thing as ‘true’ or ‘pure’ altruism, which is 
supposed to have no thought for the self. In direct contrast, other researchers, 
most notably Batson (1987) and Batson and Shaw (1991), sought to show that at 
least sometimes, people are truly motivated to help others with no regard for 
themselves. In particular, Batson argued that helping behaviour is sometimes 
motivated purely by empathic concern for the welfare of others. According to this 

622
Applying
empathy-altruism hypothesis, some helpful actions are genuinely motivated by a 
desire to do something good for someone else. 
This controversy over whether there is such a thing as truly unselfish empathic 
helping generated many research and review papers. Both sides of the debate 
seemed to gain some support from research findings. For example, an early study 
of the ‘empathy’ view showed that helping behaviour increased after participants 
were asked directly to take the perspective of the victim (Toi and Batson, 1982). 
Other studies seemed to suggest that both empathic concern and selfish motives 
have a role to play. This is consistent with Batson’s (1991) view of altruism, because 
he admits that selfish motives can be important. Where Batson differs from Cial-
dini is that he argues that in the right conditions, purely selfless altruism will also 
emerge, whereas Cialdini (1991) argues that there is always some kind of self-
interest involved in a decision to help.
One study that seemed to uncover a mixture of selfless and selfish motives for 
altruism was conducted by Carlo et al. (1991). These researchers exposed partici-
pants to a woman who seemed to be distressed as a result of reading a highly 
upsetting account of an assault. Two features of this situation were manipulated. 
First, the woman’s distress seemed either to be strong or weak. Second, partici-
pants’ ability to escape from the situation was varied. In the easy-escape condition, 
participants were told that they could choose not to watch any more of the 
woman’s suffering. In the difficult-escape condition, they were told they would 
have to watch the woman read 15 upsetting assault accounts. As we might expect 
from Cialdini’s (1991) approach to altruism, those who could not easily escape 
from the situation were most helpful, especially when the woman’s distress seemed 
to be intense. As we might expect from Batson’s (1991) approach to altruism, 
those who had scored highly on proneness to empathy and other altruistic person-
ality traits were especially likely to help when escape was easy. Altruistic person-
ality traits were less powerful predictors of helping when escape was difficult. 
Thus, the results suggested that there are some people who are dispositionally 
ready to help even in distressing situations from which they could easily walk 
away. But, they also suggest that the situation determines when altruistic person-
ality traits will promote helping. If situational cues are powerful enough and 
provide people with enough incentive to help, it does not necessarily matter 
whether or not they are innately helpful. 
Still other studies appear to offer strong support for the hypothesis that, ulti-
mately, it is self-interest that drives people to help others. A classic experiment 
conducted by Cialdini, Schaller, Houlihan et al. (1987) is a case in point. They had 
participants watch an upsetting (but fictional) video about the plight of a univer-
sity student who had broken both her legs and needed the help of a student, such 
as the participants themselves, to take lecture notes for her. To test the hypothesis 
that people help in order to improve their mood, they gave an experimental group 
of participants a pill immediately after watching the video. The pill was a placebo 
with no active ingredients, but participants were told that it was a mood-fixing 
pill – it would ‘freeze’ their current emotional state, meaning that it could not be

changed for the next half hour or so. So, these participants had been led to believe 
that helping the woman in the video would not help them feel any better. Results 
showed that despite reporting high levels of empathic distress, participants given 
this mood-fixing ‘drug’ agreed to help the injured woman much less than control 
participants who might still have imagined that helping would make them feel 
better. Further, empathic concern no longer affected helping behaviour.
As the authors of this textbook, one of our jobs is to help you consider which 
of two competing arguments is more plausible in the light of mixed findings. 
Usually, the key to resolving apparently contradictory results is to look closely at 
the methods employed by different studies. Typically, you will find that a certain 
methodological feature causes results to go one way, and if this is changed, results 
go another, allowing you to make sense of mixed results and what processes might 
be responsible for them. Alas, this does not seem to be the case in this area of 
research. For example, a study much like the one by Carlo et al. (1991), set up in a 
similar way, produced quite different findings – empathic concern was related to 
helping behaviour when escape was difficult, rather than easy (Batson, Bolen, 
Cross and Neuringer-Benefiel, 1986). Likewise, a study employing similar 
methods to Cialdini et al. (1987) produced very different results, showing that 
leading participants to think their mood was fixed did not change helping behav-
iour (Schroeder, Dovidio, Sibicky et al., 1988). We do not have an easy take-home 
message, therefore, about whether Batson (1991) or Cialdini (1991) are right. 
However, we think we can place these different results in an overall context 
that makes some sense. In short, it may not matter ultimately whether people help 
others in order to make themselves feel better. Indeed, it may be a conceptual 
mistake to assume that this apparently ‘selfish’ motive makes helping behaviour 
any less altruistic. The point is, people who help in order to make themselves feel 
better are pursuing an internal, rather than an external reward. And it feels good 
to help only because people are equipped with deeply moral capacities. One of 
these moral capacities is the ability to feel empathy for the plight of others, even to 
experience a sense of ‘oneness’ with them (Cialdini et al., 1997; Maner, Luce, 
Neuberg et al., 2002). Another moral capacity we have is to respond emotionally 
to our own actions and their outcomes – feeling good if we help and bad if we do 
not, especially if we think we could have done something. Thus, we need to 
consider people in their entirety. If they are prepared to help others without 
concern for external rewards like money or reputation, they are being altruistic. If 
they experience internal rewards for altruistic behaviour, this is because moral 
capacities are ingrained in their character (see Figure 14.5).
Exploring further you may be familiar with the tV programme The Secret Millionaire, where each week, a 
wealthy individual takes time out of their privileged life to live in an impoverished community. At the end of the 
programme, the secret millionaire donates money to a worthy cause (or causes) they have identified throughout the 
programme. they also identify themselves as the altruist at the end of the programme. Based on what you have read 
so far, what do you see as the motives for their actions?

624
Applying
Time to reflect Giving presents makes us feel happy. Using the knowledge you have gained so far, can you say 
why this is the case?
Indeed, some thinkers such as Staub (1978, p. 10) have put forward exactly this 
view of altruism:
A prosocial act may be judged altruistic if it appears to have been intended to 
benefit others rather than to gain either material or social rewards. Altruistic 
prosocial acts are likely to be associated, however, with internal rewards (and 
the expectation of such rewards) and with empathic reinforcing experiences.
We therefore think that altruism should be defined as behaviour to help others 
without thought of external reward. The important question is not whether 
internal rewards matter – researchers generally agree that they do – but why? Why 
are we equipped with the moral capacities that make us willing to help others even 
when doing so may be costly and thankless? Many theorists have argued that 
evolution has played a role in this phenomenon (e.g., Bowles, 2006; Fehr and 
Fischbacher, 2003; Trivers, 1971). At first glance, this hypothesis does not make 
sense. If evolution favours organisms who survive long enough to reproduce and 
nurture their offspring, how can it cause organisms to sacrifice their own interests 
to help others? Intuitively, for many people at least, it would 
seem that uniquely human characteristics such as empathy are 
required in order for altruism to triumph over our innately 
selfish, animal nature. However, studies of animal behaviour 
show that they do engage in acts of altruism. Birds will incur 
risks by crying out a warning to nearby birds when they spot a 
predator, animals will share food with relatives (see Figure 
14.6), or defend them from attack (Hamilton, 1963; Trivers, 
1971). Chimpanzees act in much the same way as young 
human children and demonstrate spontaneous acts of helping 
and kindness towards unrelated individuals (Warneken, Hare, 
Melis et al., 2007).

FigurE 14.5 Simple model of the internal and external 
rewards of altruism If individuals are motivated by the 
rewards they expect to receive from the person they are 
helping, or from others, by gaining a positive reputation, 
their helping behaviour does not count as ‘altruism’. A person 
without any built-in moral capacities, such as empathy or 
conscience, might help others in order to accrue such rewards. 
However, individuals also appear to be motivated by internal 
rewards, such as the prospect that their empathic distress 
would be relieved by helping, or that they would feel better 
about themselves if they helped. Such internal rewards can 
be seen as evidence that the normal human personality is 
effectively engineered to be altruistic.

Question to consider Reread question 2 at the start of the chapter. Do you think that Ziva’s donation to charity 
was purely selfless?
Exploring further One interesting example of altruistic behaviour is that of volunteering – spontaneous altruism 
for the common good. you may be familiar with high-profile examples of volunteering, such as Bob Geldof and 
midge Ure who organized the Live Aid concert in 1985 to raise funds for the ethiopian famine. Some researchers 
argue that volunteering is a difficult task that should be seen as a case of genuine altruism (Clary and Snyder, 1991, 
1999; Omoto and Snyder 2002). However, people’s motives for making even the grandest and most difficult 
humanitarian gestures are often questioned. Are even the noblest volunteers, at some level, being self-serving? 
Familiarize yourself with the literature on volunteerism and decide whether community volunteering can be driven 
by egoistic motives. 
The discovery of altruistic behaviour in nonhuman animals led early evolu-
tionary theorists to identify two reasons why they, as well as humans, help each 
other. The first is that by helping one’s relatives or kin, one is promoting the 
successful reproduction of one’s own genes. This is because we share many of our 
genes with our relatives. As we discussed in Chapter 13, evolutionary theory does 
not entail the survival of the fittest organisms, but of the fittest genes (Dawkins, 
1976). For this model, kin selection is important. Genes that programme animals to 
help their relatives will be more likely to be successfully copied. There is strong 
evidence that nonhuman animals are selectively altruistic towards their relatives 
(Clutton-Brock, 2002). Human beings also prefer to help those who are more 
closely related to them (Burnstein, Crandall and Kitayama, 1994) (see Figure 14.7), 
but, as we have seen, show remarkable willingness to help even strangers.

have helped them before, then the prospects of mutual survival are enhanced. 
Leider, Möbius, Rosenblat and Do (2009) ran a study on Facebook in which 
participants were able to exchange money with strangers or friends in a range of 
‘social dilemma’ games that we will encounter later in this chapter. Predictably, 
participants were 52 per cent more likely to donate money to friends than stran-
gers. This is consistent with the principle of reciprocal altruism, because friends 
are more likely to reciprocate one’s acts of generosity than strangers. Leider et 
al. (2009) also manipulated whether participants expected to interact with each 
other in the future. This prospect of future interaction increased giving by a 
further 24 per cent. 
Although these studies show that altruism is more commonly directed at rela-
tives or those who are likely to reciprocate, altruism does not disappear when 
these conditions are not met. Human beings selectively make sacrifices to help 
ingroup rather than outgroup members, even when ingroup members are not able 
to reciprocate (Bernhard, Fischbacher and Fehr, 2006). De Waal (2008) argues that 
the adaptive value of altruism has shaped our emotional and cognitive makeup, so 
that we have evolved the capacity for empathy. Success in reproduction and 
parenthood requires us, and other mammalian species, to have the capacity to 
form emotional ties and develop empathic concern for children very quickly 
(MacLean, 1985). This ability to empathize and quickly care for others may then 
have generalized to other cases. Indeed, de Waal (2008) argues that in most situa-
tions confronting our ancestors, who lived in small, interrelated groups, the people 
they had opportunities to help were somewhat related to them and were likely to 
reciprocate. The tendency to feel empathic concern for others has taken on a moti-
vational life of its own. As de Waal (2008, p. 281) puts it: 
Once evolved, behavior often assumes motivational autonomy, that is, its moti-
vation becomes disconnected from its ultimate goals. A good example is sexual 
behavior, which arose to serve reproduction. Since animals are, as far as we 
know, unaware of the link between sex and reproduction, they must be 
engaging in sex (as do humans much of the time) without progeny in mind. 
A similar argument has often been run with the emotion of disgust (Haidt, 2003; 
Oaten, Stevenson and Case, 2009; Phillips, Young, Senior et al., 1997). Disgust 
deterred our ancestors from interacting with slimy, rotten things that could make 
them sick, and the same emotional machinery has now generalized to shape the 
way we think about outgroups (Fincher and Thornhill, 2012; Inbar, Pizarro, 
Knobe and Bloom, 2009; see Chapter 12), other people’s moral violations (Schnall, 
Haidt, Clore and Jordan, 2008; see Chapter 4) and political ideology (Inbar, 
Pizarro and Bloom, 2008).

related, it is by no means directed exclusively to cases in which it makes evolutionary sense to be kind. In fact, there 
are cases of extreme altruism that appear to make no logical sense. try searching ‘man punches shark to save dog’ 
on the internet to find one example of altruism across species. Can you find other examples? these cases seem to 
highlight scholars’ argument (e.g., de Waal, 2008) that evolution has equipped us with broad emotional and 
cognitive tendencies that support altruistic behaviour. Once evolved, altruism takes on a life of its own and 
generalizes beyond cases in which it ‘makes sense’ to make sacrifices to help other organisms. 
Who gets help?
Research suggests that aspects of the person significantly influence whether or not 
they receive help. Specifically, factors like age, gender, attractiveness and person-
ality determine the degree of help received:
1 Age: As we get older, we become more reluctant to seek help. For example, 
research shows that children are very willing to seek and accept help, arguably 
because they need it more, but also because they do not regard it as a sign of 
weakness. Unfortunately, this is not true of older children and adults, who may 
be less likely to get help when they need it, because they do not ask (Shell and 
Eisenberg, 1992).
2 Gender: Research suggests that women are more likely to receive help than men 
(Bruder-Mattson and Hovanitz, 1990). For example, strangers are more likely to 
respond to simple questions (e.g., asking for the time) if they are made by 
women rather than men (Pearce, 1980). One of the suspected reasons for this 
tendency is that it is more difficult for men to accept help than it is for women 
(Bruder-Mattson and Hovanitz, 1990). For men, it is argued that accepting help 
is a sign of weakness and has more personal costs than it does for women. 
3 Attractiveness: Attractive people receive more help than unattractive people 
(Wilson and Dovidio, 1985). For example, people are more likely to receive 
directions (and people take longer to give directions) if the recipient is attrac-
tive (Harrell, 1978). Interestingly, this happens in cases where there may or 
may not be a benefit for the help-giver. One might assume that attractive 
people receive more help because people perceive the possibility of future 
interactions with them, but this does not appear to be the case (Benson, Kara-
benick and Lerner, 1976). 
4 Personality: Personality influences the likelihood of receiving help. For 
example, people who are socially anxious receive less support from their peers 
(Caldwell and Reinhart, 1988). However, some studies suggest that people who 
are high in self-esteem receive less help, mainly because they do not ask for it, 
or need it (Nadler, Altman and Fisher, 1979). On the other hand, people with 
high self-esteem benefit more from social support networks (Caldwell and 
Reinhart, 1988).

Applying
Social dilemmas
The study of altruism has an important implication that extends beyond situa-
tions in everyday life where we can choose whether or not to help a victim. In 
particular, a kind of altruism is crucial to the very success of our society. In many 
situations, what is best for the individual is not best for the group as a whole. 
Very often, if the group is going to achieve its goals for the benefit of all, it 
requires individuals to pool together and sacrifice their own interests. These situ-
ations are known as social dilemmas (Dawes, 1980). When people put aside their 
own interests in order to help the group as a whole, their behaviour is termed 
cooperation, and when they act in their own interests at the expense of the group, 
their behaviour is termed defection. 
Real-life examples of social dilemmas abound. In war, soldiers’ interests and 
indeed their very lives may be better protected if they desert the field of battle, but 
the interests of their group – their platoon, or their entire nation – normally 
require that they fight. Recycling and environmental behaviours can be expensive 
for the individual but benefit wider society. Team sports often require that a player 
sacrifice their own performance to ensure the success of their team, rather than 
going for individual glory. In cricket, for example, when a team needs to score 
many runs quickly to win, individual batters are expected to risk getting out, 
potentially damaging their own career statistics, in pursuit of quick runs. Another 
less entertaining but probably more important example is taxation. Individuals are 
materially better off if they can avoid paying tax. However, without tax revenue, it 
would be difficult, if not impossible, to finance hospitals, schools, roads or the 
streetlights to illuminate them. These are just a few of the goods and services 
provided by governments for the good of all, using tax revenue.

social dilemmas studied by social psychologists. 
Types of social dilemma
Experimental social psychologists (and researchers in related fields such as behav-
ioural economics and evolutionary biology) attempt to distil the essence of these 
real-life dilemmas into experimental games. The simplest and most studied is the 
prisoner’s dilemma. This is played by two people, who are asked to imagine that 
they are suspects caught by the police and charged with a joint crime. The police 
offer each of them a bargain. Each is told that if they confess to the joint crime, 
effectively betraying their partner as well as themselves, they will receive a reduced 
sentence. If one prisoner confesses and their partner does not, the confessor’s 
sentence will be greatly reduced, and their partner’s will be increased. If they both 
confess, they will receive a somewhat shorter sentence of intermediate length. If 
neither confesses, they will both receive quite short sentences (see Figure 14.8). 
This is a social dilemma because the overall interests of this ‘group’ of two 
people, defined as the total amount of time served in prison, are better served if

each prisoner does not confess. On the other 
hand, each individual prisoner is always better 
off if they confess. Therefore, refusing to 
confess is an example of ‘cooperation’, serving 
the group’s interest, whereas confession is 
‘defection’, in which the individual does what 
is best for them despite the overall interests of 
the group. 
Try it yourself to help illustrate why not confessing is the cooperative choice in the prisoner’s dilemma, calculate 
the total amount of prison time served by both prisoners in all combinations. the mean sentence served by both is 
an index of their joint interests. the lower this is, the better off they are as a ‘group’ of two people. your calculations 
should show that, on average, both are better off if they do not confess, but one prisoner is always personally better 
off confessing. this is why the prisoner’s dilemma is truly a social dilemma, pitting individual interests against those 
of the whole group.
Thus far, we have looked at the prisoner’s dilemma from the perspective of the 
prisoner who is immediately faced with a decision – do I betray my partner to 
save my own skin? But the flipside of this perspective is that as well as being a 
moral agent who has to make their own decision, each prisoner is a moral patient 
whose fate depends on the other’s decision. As you can see in Figure 14.8, regard-
less of their own decision, a prisoner is better off if their partner decides to coop-
erate. Many social situations are rather like that – you can enjoy a park, use a road 
or a hospital that others have paid for, regardless of whether you have personally 
contributed to it through taxes, for example. Thus, the prisoner’s dilemma is 
sometimes described as a two-person public goods dilemma (e.g., Andreoni, 1988). 
A public good is one that people cannot feasibly be prevented from using, even if 
they have not paid their share – such as a park or a public hospital. The group as a 
whole is better off if everybody cooperates by contributing to such goods, but 
each individual within the group is better off, at least in material terms, if they 
avoid paying their share. The parks, roads and hospitals will still be there, and are 
unlikely to be noticeably worse off because one individual does not cooperate. 
Defection in a public goods dilemma is termed free riding – benefiting from 
others’ contribution while choosing not to follow their example (e.g., Yamagishi 
and Sato, 1986).
The other type of social dilemma that has received a lot of attention is the 
commons dilemma. Whereas public goods dilemmas involve a resource that is to

some extent built up by the group, commons dilemmas feature 
a resource that is taken away by the group. The original example 
of this dilemma was described as the tragedy of the commons 
(Hardin, 1968). Hardin uses the example of a common grazing 
land shared by a group of herders who each have open access to 
this common resource. Each herder is individually better off if 
they graze as many animals as they can on this land, but the other herders will suffer 
as a result of the damage caused to the common by the excess of animals. If too 
many herders graze more than their share, eventually the common is exhausted and 
may even be permanently destroyed by overuse. It is easy to think of real-life 
commons dilemmas, such as global warming (see Figure 14.9) and the depletion of 
global fish stocks. Each fishing boat, and each country, benefits by overfishing. 
Doing so, however, both reduces the resources available for others and threatens to 
destroy the resource altogether, because intense overfishing makes it impossible for 
the fish population to replenish itself through breeding. 
Time to reflect Can you think of other examples of commons dilemmas or specific situations of dilemmas? 
What happened in these cases?
Encouraging cooperation
Learning to build and share resources for the common good is one of the most 
fundamental challenges facing human beings, and is likely to be ever more pressing 
now that there are more and more of ‘us’, the human population having recently 
reached seven billion. Thus, it is apt that social psychologists have spent a good 
deal of effort identifying conditions that facilitate cooperation for the common 
good. Broadly speaking, four types of factors seem to be helpful:
 o if people in a social dilemma value the common interest as well as their own 
 o if they have a strong sense of identification with the wider group 
 o if they are able to communicate with each other and establish principles and 
ground rules before they have to make decisions 
 o if their own strategic decisions effectively reward cooperators and punish 
defectors as the social dilemma unfolds. 
Encouraging prosocial versus pro-self orientation
Situational factors determine behaviour in social dilemmas, but personality factors 
also play a role. Some people will tend to cooperate across social dilemmas, 
FigurE 14.9 global warming as a commons dilemma the problem of global 
warming or climate change has many of the characteristics of a commons 
dilemma. the earth’s atmosphere is a resource shared by all, and collectively 
human beings have a strong interest to ensure that the proportion of gases 
does not get out of balance. But individual people, companies and countries’ 
economic interests are served by discharging carbon dioxide and other 
greenhouse gases into the atmosphere (van Vugt, 2009).

Altruism and justice
whereas others will defect in the same situations. One personality variable that 
captures this difference between people is known as social value orientation (van 
Lange and Liebrand, 1991). Essentially, some people are ‘pro-self’, and indicate on 
questionnaires that given the choice, they will prioritize getting resources for 
themselves without concern for the resources that others gain (Liebrand and 
McClintock, 1988). Indeed, some pro-self individuals may actively seek to ensure 
that others get less than themselves (van Lange, Otten, de Bruin and Joireman, 
1997). In contrast, others are ‘prosocial’, indicating concern with maximizing the 
resources available to others as well as themselves (van Lange, 1999). It may not 
surprise you to learn that pro-self individuals are much less likely to cooperate in 
social dilemmas than prosocial people (for reviews, see Bogaert, Boone and 
Declerck, 2008; van Lange, de Cremer, van Dijk and van Vugt, 2007). One impli-
cation of these findings is that people who are in charge of group situations such 
as work teams, which have the characteristics of a group dilemma – people some-
times have to sacrifice their own interests for the sake of the group – might do well 
to select individuals who are prosocial, rather than pro-self. Another implication 
is that the group’s interests would be served if it were somehow possible to ‘make’ 
people more prosocial, whether temporarily or permanently, but no research has 
examined whether this is possible (see the Blind spot in social psychology exercise 
at the end of this chapter).

Encouraging strong social identification
In this chapter, we have already seen how bystanders’ sense of shared social 
identification with a victim can encourage helping behaviour. A strong sense of 
social identification with the group also encourages people to cooperate in public 
goods dilemmas. This is especially true of people who are pro-self, suggesting that 
social identification increases cooperation by encouraging people to see helping 
the group as tantamount to helping themselves. De Cremer and van Vugt (1999) 
obtained support for this hypothesis with a study of behaviour in public goods 
dilemmas among students at Southampton University in the UK. De Cremer 
and van Vugt pretested the social value orientation of their participants according 
to their choices in hypothetical social dilemmas. On the basis of the pretest, 61 
per cent of the participants were classified as prosocial, and 24 per cent as pro-
self. Before participants played the public goods dilemma game, the researchers 
manipulated the level of group identification by describing the experiment either as 
a comparison of the behaviour of different individuals in such games (low identifi-
cation) or of the behaviour of students at different universities (high identification, 
the group in question being Southampton University students). Pro-self partici-
pants contributed more money when in the high, rather than the low, identification 
condition. In fact, in the high group identification condition, they donated as much 
money as prosocial participants. In the low group identification condition, pro-

self participants gave significantly less money than 
prosocial participants, as we might normally expect. For 
their part, prosocial participants were unaffected by the 
group identification manipulation (see Figure 14.10). 
Communication
Part of the problem facing participants in social 
dilemmas is their uncertainty about how others will 
behave. Presumably, most people would like to live in a 
world where people do not behave with absolute self-
ishness but also take into account the common good. 
However, a significant problem is that we cannot neces-
sarily trust others to do that, and perhaps because of 
that mistrust, we are more inclined to pursue our own interests. No one likes to 
lose out, and no one likes to find their prosocial behaviour exploited by others 
(Yamagishi, Cook and Watabe, 1998). This mistrust can be resolved by communi-
cation. In an early demonstration of this effect, Dawes, McTavish and Shaklee 
(1977) put participants into groups of eight and either gave them a chance to 
communicate about how they should behave in an upcoming commons dilemma, 
to communicate about irrelevant topics, or deprived them of the opportunity to 
communicate before playing the game. Cooperation was significantly higher in 
the ‘relevant communication’ condition than in the other two conditions. 
Communicating about irrelevant topics did not increase cooperative behaviour. It 
seems that cooperative behaviour can be increased if people have a chance to 
discuss the ground rules and establish a norm of cooperative behaviour. Associ-
ated with this change is an increased trust that others will cooperate. The finding 
that communicating about irrelevant topics does not increase cooperative behav-
iour suggests that the effect of communication does not boil down simply to 
participants getting to know each other. 
Subsequent research has suggested that the beneficial effect of communication 
only works under some conditions. Specifically, communication most effectively 
increases cooperation when:
 o group members discuss appropriate behaviour and advocate cooperation in a 
constructive way, rather than merely taking the opportunity to threaten those 
who would defect (Stech and McClintock, 1981)
 o the social dilemma is relatively easy to understand or ‘demonstrable’, so that 
group members can explain to each other how their common interest is served 
by cooperation (Hopthrow and Hulbert, 2005; Laughlin, 1980)
 o individuals make clear and emphatic personal promises to cooperate, and estab-
lish a strong norm of cooperation (Kerr and Kaufman-Gilliland, 1994).
Under the right conditions, communication can be powerful in bringing coopera-
tion about, as demonstrated by a recent study with English undergraduate students.

the participants in this study favoured cooperation or defection as a strategy in a 
social dilemma. They then put participants together in groups of six, several of 
which were unanimously opposed to cooperation at the start of the experiment. 
Surprisingly, even these groups showed high levels of cooperation in a subsequent 
dilemma if they were first given a chance to communicate with each other. This is a 
remarkable exception to the group polarization effect we have seen in earlier chap-
ters (notably Chapter 10), where groups tend to act in line with a stronger version 
of their members’ initial attitudes. Communication had this striking effect of over-
turning members’ initial attitudes only if the social dilemma was demonstrable, 
making the benefits of cooperation easy to explain to group members. 
Strategies during the game: punishing others’ defection and rewarding 
their cooperation
Participants in a social dilemma often have the chance to modify each others’ 
behaviour during the game even if they have not first had a chance to lay down the 
norms and ground rules through communication. They can do this by making 
strategic decisions that tend to reward cooperators and punish defectors. A simple 
example is the so-called tit-for-tat strategy. In a two-person social dilemma such 
as the prisoner’s dilemma, a player can opt to cooperate if the other player has just 
cooperated, and to defect if they have just defected. This simple strategy is an 
example of the principle of reciprocity – responding in kind to others’ coopera-
tion and defection. The strategy works because it encourages other players to 
cooperate. Indeed, the tit-for-tat strategy has consistently been shown to be the 
best, or ‘optimal’ strategy in the prisoner’s dilemma, especially when the dilemma 
is set up so that players take alternating turns (e.g., Wedekind and Milinski, 1996). 
Indeed, the success of tit for tat has led some theorists to suggest that it may have 
evolved in humans and other animals (e.g., Axelrod and Hamilton, 1981) – one 
study even showed that fish use this strategy (Milinski, 1987). 
Doing unto others as they do unto others: indirect reciprocity and altruistic 
punishment
As we have seen, biologists, economists and psychologists have long been puzzled 
by the extent to which people are altruistic (e.g., cooperate), when they would be 
better off, at least in purely material terms, if they defected. Scientists’ under-
standing of this puzzle has been greatly advanced by recent research into altruistic 
punishment and indirect reciprocity. In social dilemmas, people frequently choose 
to punish defections by other member of the group, even at personal expense. For 
example, a person may sacrifice €1 of their own payoff to reduce a defector’s 
payoff by €2. This is known as altruistic punishment, because of its self-sacrificing 
quality (e.g., Fehr and Gächter, 2002). Also, people incur personal costs to reward 
cooperative behaviour and punish defection. They do this, for example, by 
donating money to people who have previously donated to others, even when 
they know the person they are donating to will have no chance to give them 
money in turn. This behaviour is known as indirect reciprocity (e.g., Wedekind and

Milinski, 2000). It can be distinguished from direct reciprocity – the form of recip-
rocal altruism we learned about earlier in this chapter. In direct reciprocity, an 
altruist is rewarded by the beneficiary of their altruism – not by a third party. 
Time to reflect Before you read on, what do you think might motivate people to sacrifice their own interests to 
punish defectors?
In a classic series of experiments, Fehr and Gächter (2002) showed that altruistic 
punishment may be commonplace and has the effect of increasing cooperative 
behaviour. Fehr and Gächter’s (2002) public goods dilemmas ran in blocks of six 
rounds. In some of these blocks, participants were able to punish other players who 
had defected. Each unit of their own money they spent to do this cost the punished 
member three units of their money. Punishment was performed anonymously – 
other group members could not tell who was doing the punishment. In these blocks, 
punishment was frequent, with over 84 per cent of participants choosing to punish 
at least once, and it was harsh. For example, imagine you are playing in round five 
or six, by which time punishment systems are entrenched, and you pay approxi-
mately 15 fewer monetary units to the group than the other participants. In this 
case, your ‘crime’ definitely does not pay – you can expect to pay just about double 
your original underpayment – nearly 30 monetary units – in punishments imposed 
by the rest of the group. In blocks of rounds where this kind of punishment was 
possible, cooperation levels across the group gradually increased (see Figure 14.11). 
In stark contrast, blocks in which participants were deprived of the opportunity to 
punish saw cooperation levels gradually decrease from round to round. In the final 
round of a block of trials, the average contribution to the group in each round was 
around three times greater if punishment was allowed than if it was not. 
Here, then, is a case of an ‘altruistic’ behaviour that is a deliberate infliction 
of harm on another person. Indeed, it qualifies as an act of aggression, according 
to the definition we adopted in Chapter 
13. If it deserves to be called altruistic, it 
is because it is self-sacrificing, and because 
it appears to be an attempt to preserve the 
interests of the group by discouraging 
Direct reciprocity the case 
where a person incurs 
personal cost to reward a 
person who has cooperated 
with them personally. Both 
altruistic punishment and 
indirect reciprocity encourage 
people to cooperate rather 
than defect.
FigurE 14.11 The power of altruistic punishment to 
increase cooperation When participants initially have 
the ability to punish each other, cooperation levels are 
high and increase over time. When this ability is taken 
away (on the seventh trial), cooperation levels drop 
dramatically and keep dropping. Conversely, when 
participants are initially unable to punish, cooperation 
starts at a reasonably good level but declines over 
trials. When the ability to punish is introduced, 
cooperation levels rise and keep increasing. these 
results vividly demonstrate the power of altruistic 
punishment to increase cooperation.

defection. Thus, it would seem that altruistic punishment is an attempt at being 
‘cruel to be kind’. However, while it is obviously cruel in a sense to the punished 
individual, it is not yet entirely clear whether it is really kind to the group in the 
way that punishers presumably intend. 
One problem was raised by Dreber, Rand, Fudenberg and Nowak (2008), who 
ran prisoner’s dilemma games under two different conditions. In one condition, 
participants could either cooperate (paying one unit for the other player to get two 
or three units) or defect (gaining one unit at a cost to the other person of one unit), 
with no opportunity to punish. In the other condition, participants had a third 
option of punishing (spending one unit for the other player to lose four units). 
Dreber et al. (2008) found that cooperation was increased in the punishment condi-
tion, as it was in Fehr and Gächter’s (2002) studies. Crucially though, this did not 
seem to do anyone much good. The problem is that punishment is costly, reducing 
the payoffs received by those who punish and who are punished alike. This cost 
counteracts the effect of increased cooperation on the average payoffs received by 
participants in the dilemma. In the case of the experiments by Dreber et al. (2008) 
and some others they reviewed, the net effect was to reduce the average payoff 
received by participants, compared to the no-punishment condition. Far from 
benefiting the group, altruistic punishment harmed it in material terms. 
As Dreber et al. (2008) acknowledged, there could well be circumstances in 
which altruistic punishment does increase the average payoff received by all group 
members, for example in games where the price of cooperation, defection and 
punishments is changed, or where games continue for longer. However, one key 
finding is bad news for the idea that evolutionary forces may have equipped 
human beings with a disposition towards altruistic punishment. Specifically, 
among Dreber et al.’s (2008) participants, those who punished received substan-
tially smaller payoffs than those who refrained from punishment. The best strategy 
was ‘tit for tat’ – to respond with cooperation after the other player cooperates, 
and with defection when they defect. Thus, altruistic punishment may not benefit 
the group, and costs the punishers dearly. In light of these results, it is difficult to 
see how altruistic punishment may have been favoured by natural selection. 
Still, we think there is room to believe that it might have been. Notably, the 
experimental games conducted thus far, however ingenious, elegant and tightly 
controlled, differ from many real-life contexts in important respects. One is that 
the currency of punishment in these experiments is exactly the same as the 
currency of cooperation and defection – money. In reality, the range of human 
motivation and emotion equips us with many more ways to punish effectively, 
including violence, ostracism, malicious gossip and disdain. These forms of 
punishment do not necessarily cost the punisher or even the punished individual 
in the same way. Thus, a group whose primary goal is to make money is likely to 
do better if it has available to it a punishment scheme that is effective but does not 
require the expenditure of money. Indeed, one study suggests that the use of a 
non-monetary punishment can increase monetary cooperation. Specifically, 
participants in a social dilemma contribute more to the group if they believe they 

636
Applying
will be ostracized if they do not (Ouwerkerk, Kerr, Gallucci and van Lange, 2005) 
(see the Blind spot in social psychology at the end of Chapter 8). By definition, 
because punishing by means of ostracism costs no money and because average 
payoffs increase as cooperation increases, the group is better off in monetary 
terms. Further, there are perhaps less tangible benefits of altruistic punishment, 
such as improved satisfaction with the group and increased adherence to its norms 
and its leadership. These might stand groups in good stead in less narrow, more 
realistic circumstances than those found in the experimental social dilemmas 
conducted thus far. Imagine, for example, that a group has to confront a collective 
crisis such as a flood or an invasion of its territory – those with strongly enforced 
norms of cooperation are more likely to win through. These less tangible benefits 
are of great interest to social psychologists and probably to participants them-
selves, but typically are not measured as outcomes in the experiments. 
A specific feature of the experiments by Dreber et al. (2008) also suggests that 
altruistic punishment may be more obviously beneficial in other social situations. 
Specifically, their social dilemma was the dyadic (that is, two-player) prisoner’s 
dilemma. If you punish the other player, they are hardly going to be impressed 
with you, which may undermine their cooperation with you. However, if you 
punish a defector in a larger group, the third, fourth, fifth and any other players 
may be impressed with your firm action. In this case, they may be inclined to 
reward you, much as they reward those who make generous donations to others 
(Wedekind and Milinski, 2000). Indeed, when given the opportunity, they may 
choose to punish you if you fail to punish a defector. If you are in a social dilemma, 
your reputation can be important to you. Concern about your reputation, and 
therefore how others will treat you, is likely to motivate you to cooperate and 
punish those who do not. Computer simulations suggest that altruistic punish-
ment will have a marginal effect on cooperation in dyadic dilemmas, but a large 
effect in dilemmas involving 16 people (Fehr and Fischbacher, 2003). 
Time to reflect What parallels or similarities can you draw between this research and what else you have learned 
about behaviour within groups (e.g., social facilitation, social loafing)?

The social psychology of justice
We have seen that altruism and cooperation are important principles of social 
organization in human life. Another principle is also important – justice. Justice is 
a broad term with many meanings and nuances, but at heart, it exists when people 
treat each other as they are entitled or deserve to be treated. Entitlement refers to

the positive treatments (e.g., respect, autonomy, inheritances) people should 
receive according to agreed upon laws, customs and moral principles. Deserving-
ness refers to the treatments, positive or negative, that a person is perceived to 
have earned because of their good or bad behaviour (Feather, 2003, 2008). Distribu-
tive justice is concerned with the apportionment of privileges, duties and goods in 
consonance with the merits of the individual and in the best interest of society. 
Procedural justice is concerned with the fairness of the procedures that resolve 
disputes and allocate resources. Normally, fair procedures produce fair outcomes, 
but not always. It is possible, for example, for 
a referee to incorrectly rule a penalty. This 
violates a principle of distributive justice. 
However, if the referee’s mistake is an honest 
one, and they explain the basis for the decision 
clearly, then there has been no violation of 
procedural justice (see Figure 14.12). 
Justice permeates all aspects of our lives. 
For example, we think about justice and injus-
tice in the context of the criminal justice 
system, in the allocation of economic resources 
and costs such as taxes and benefits, in 
discrimination and equality between groups, 
in education (have you always felt your marks 
and comments were fair?) and in our personal 
lives. Why is it that justice is such an ever 
present concern to human beings? According 
to most theories that have addressed this ques-
tion, justice has two important functions. 
First, if people are, or think they have been, 
treated justly in life, their own functioning is 
improved; for example, they are happier, less 
prone to negative affect and anxiety, more 
confident that if they work hard and respect 
social norms they will receive good outcomes 
and so on (Jost and Banaji, 1994; Lerner, 1980). 
Second, justice has a benefit to the collective if 
people work hard, respect social rules, are not 
motivated to abuse others and so on (Jost and 
Kay, 2010; Tyler, 2007). 
Culture and justice
Culture plays a crucial role in shaping perceptions of the treatment that people are 
entitled or deserve to receive. In some cultures, for example, theft is seen as a crime 
deserving amputation of hands or even execution, whereas in others, thieves are 
required to meet and discuss their offence with their victims. Nonetheless, some

Applying
basic, universally regarded principles of justice seem to underpin these widely 
varying cultural practices. Deutsch (1975) articulated three key principles of 
justice – the equity, equality and need principles (see also Rai and Fiske, 2011): 
 o According to the equity principle, the outcomes that people receive should be 
proportional to their merit and contribution. So, the harder you work or the 
more you produce, the more you should be rewarded. 
 o According to the equality principle, resources should be distributed equally in 
the community. 
 o According to the need principle, the focus should be on what people need to 
survive and thrive. 
Thus, regardless of how hard people work or their moral qualities, the need prin-
ciple would suggest they should receive support from others. Although people in all 
cultures seem to invoke these principles and regard them as important, their relative 
importance varies (Bond, Leung and Schwartz, 1992). In collectivist cultures, where 
harmony within a community is given the highest priority, equality assumes more 
importance (Leung and Bond, 1984). On the other hand, where the focus is on the 
job of maximizing wealth and productivity, the equity principle tends to be most 
important. And when the group confronts grave shortages of resources or threats to 
its survival, need may become a more important principle (Deutsch, 1975). 
Exploring further Using an internet search engine, can you find examples of people complaining that money or 
some other resource is not being distributed fairly? In the cases you find, do the perceived violations of justice seem 
to be violations of equity, principle or need? 
The importance of justice for human beings
In the following pages, we review in more detail some of the leading theories of 
the universal psychological importance of justice. In so doing, we pay attention to 
two important questions at the heart of research on justice. The first is, what effect 
does the deep psychological commitment to justice have on people’s behaviour – 
how do they attempt to preserve justice when it appears to be threatened? The 
second, related but more general question is, what are some of the factors that lead 
people to act justly or unjustly, and how can social psychologists play their part in 
promoting justice? 
Social exchange and equity theories 
Of all the theoretical approaches to the human desire for justice, social exchange 
theory (Homans, 1961; Thibaut and Kelley, 1959) is most consistent with the view 
of classical economics and evolutionary biology that people pursue their own 
interests first and foremost. Like those frameworks, social exchange theory 
assumes that people try to maximize personal benefits and minimize personal 
costs in their social relationships. People see relationships with others as incurring 
costs to themselves and accruing benefits. In a romantic relationship, the benefits 
might include the warm feelings, intimacy and pleasure of spending time with

your partner; the costs might include the arguments and the time you invest in the 
relationship at the expense of other activities you enjoy (see Chapter 7). In a 
working relationship, the benefits might include the pay you get and the recogni-
tion you receive, and the costs include the time and energy you sink into your 
work. The principal of reciprocity is therefore at the heart of social exchange 
theory – we invest in relationships and expect our partners to invest in kind. 
To varying degrees, people expect the benefits of relationships to outweigh the 
costs. Thibaut and Kelley (1959) describe this expectation as a comparison level. If 
you have a high comparison level, you expect the benefits of a social relationship to 
greatly outweigh its costs. If you have a low comparison level, you might expect to 
just about ‘break even’. Either way, if the relationship does not meet with your 
expectations, you are likely to be dissatisfied. This motivates you to change the 
relationship to make it more personally rewarding, or to leave it altogether (and so 
to seek a new job or a new companion). You are especially likely to walk away if 
you have a high comparison level for alternatives, that is, if you feel there is an alter-
native relationship available to you that will be more rewarding (see Chapter 7). 
Where social exchange theory differs from some economic perspectives is that 
it does not view the decision-making process as entirely rational or cold-blooded. 
A major factor that prevents people from simply walking away from underre-
warding relationships is their previous investment in the relationship. Ironically, 
the more people feel they have invested in the relationship – the jobs they turned 
down, the hard work they put in at the beginning, for example – the more attached 
they feel to the relationship (Rusbult and Buunk, 1993). Having invested heavily 
in a relationship, your heart may tell you to stay, even though your head knows 
that it is no longer rewarding. Also, people often feel a sense of mutual fate with 
their relationship partners, and understand that each partner needs to make some 
sacrifices so that the relationship can bring everyone rewards. In other words, 
social exchange theory acknowledges that people often feel that they are better off 
in relationships of all kinds rather than going it alone. 
Emotions and concerns with justice are also important, as was made clear by 
Adams’ (1965) equity theory, which builds on core principles of social exchange 
theory. According to equity theory, people compare and evaluate the net benefits 
they are receiving with those received by their relationship partners. In doing so, 
they calculate something like the ratio below:
     My rewards 
 Their rewards
_______________ : _________________
My contributions   Their contributions
Of course, it is distressing to people when they feel they are underbenefiting – 
when they get fewer rewards, in proportion to the contribution they make, than 
their partner does. But also, it is distressing to people when they feel they are 
overbenefiting – that is, doing better out of the relationship than the other person. 
This is decidedly not what a classical economic framework, which assumes that 
people are only concerned to maximize personal gain, would predict. And it

happens, according to equity theory, because people are fundamentally concerned 
with the fairness of the relationships they are in. A fair distribution of resources is 
one expressed in the following equation:
     My rewards 
  Their rewards
_______________ = _________________
My contributions    Their contributions
More specifically, when partners feel they are underbenefiting, they feel angry 
and resentful. When they feel they are overbenefiting, they feel guilty. In either 
case, people will try to restore equity if they feel they can. Crucially, this means 
that if people feel they are overbenefiting, they will try to reduce the rewards they 
receive or increase their contributions. Research findings largely support this 
prediction. For example, people in romantic relationships will seek to restore 
equity whether they feel they are over- or underbenefiting in some way (e.g., 
Walster, Traupmann and Walster, 1978). 
However, people are not necessarily perfectly selfless in their reactions to unfair-
ness. For one thing, as we saw in Chapter 2, people tend to be somewhat self-
serving and so overestimate their contribution to relationships, distorting their 
perception of fairness. Ross and Sicoly (1979) separately interviewed men and 
women in married couples, asking them to list the jobs around the house they did 
and those their spouses did. Participants indicated that they did more jobs (approx-
imately 11) than their spouse (approximately 9). When asked to indicate what 
proportion of the housework they did overall, the scores of the husbands and wives 
added up to more than 100 per cent, suggesting that either the husbands, the wives, 
or both were overestimating their own contribution. Thus, people in relationships 
that might be described as objectively equitable may feel that they are underbene-
fiting; those who are overbenefiting may feel that their relationship is equitable. 
Further, reactions to overbenefiting are more complicated than reactions to 
underbenefiting. If you are getting too much out of a relationship, you may indeed 
feel guilty, but at some level it is also intrinsically satisfying to be doing well. 
According to some theorists, self-interest has a fast, largely unconscious, gut-level 
effect on our satisfaction levels, whereas it takes more cognitive effort to process 
and evaluate information about fairness and unfairness (Moore and Lowenstein, 
2004). Consistent with this reasoning, people are less likely to express dissatisfac-
tion with being overpaid when they are under cognitive load, that is, distracted by 
a second task such as trying to remember the following string of symbols: 
@*%#?$±§ (van den Bos, Peters, Bobocel and Ybema, 2006). Presumably, cogni-
tive load deprives overpaid people of the cognitive resources they need to fully 
realize, and feel bad about, the injustice of their privileged position. 
Time to reflect  As we shall see below, a recent study by Callan, Sutton and Dovale (2010) showed that people 
tend to construe outcomes as just when under cognitive load. In keeping with Lerner’s (1980) just world theory, they 
suggest that people preconsciously interpret events as if the world were a just place. Do you think this offers a viable 
alternative interpretation of the findings by van den Bos et al. (2006)? How?

Altruism and justice
Along the same lines, Peters, van den Bos and Karremans (2008) measured the 
time it took for people to make judgements about the fairness or unfairness of 
their pay. When they were being underpaid, they were relatively quick to indicate 
that their pay was unfair, but when they were being overpaid, it took them longer. 
Apparently, the inherent ambivalence of being overpaid – it is nice to have lots of 
money but not nice that it is not necessarily fair – creates mixed emotions that 
slow people’s reactions down. There is an emotional reason to say ‘Yes, it is fair’ 
and another to say ‘It is not fair’, and the conflict causes delay.
Social exchange and equity theories have been widely applied in the science of 
management and organizational behaviour (Cohen-Charash and Spector, 2001), as 
well as the science of intimate personal relationships, where they have been 
successful in predicting which marriages and long-term partnerships last and 
which fail (e.g., Frisco and Williams, 2003). However, there are some problems 
facing these theories. Most importantly, they explain why people are concerned 
when they appear to be being unfairly treated compared to people who are in 
some kind of relationship with us, but do not readily explain why we care more 
generally about the justice received by people with little or no connection to us 
(Lerner, 1980; van den Bos and Lind, 2001). They also do not explain why we 
react to injustices that appear to occur outside the context of ongoing social rela-
tionships – such as when people are struck down undeservedly with disease, injury 
or famine. These concerns motivated the formulation of the most influential of all 
theories of justice, the just world theory. 
Just world theory
According to Lerner’s (1980) just world theory, people have a deep-seated need to 
perceive the world as a just place. For Lerner (1980), this need arises early in life, 
at the stage where parents are socializing their children to follow rules and work 
towards their goals. Influenced by Freud’s theorizing about human development, 
Lerner speculated that at a certain stage in childhood, children switch from living 
according to the pleasure principle, in which they pursue immediate gratification 
regardless of the longer term consequences, to the reality principle, in which they 
learn to delay and moderate gratification in order to avoid punishments and earn 
rewards in the longer term. To illustrate, a very young child will probably follow 
the pleasure principle by simply taking a toy or a sweet, regardless of whether it 
belongs to someone else or if they have been told not to do it. In contrast, an older 
child is more likely to refrain from doing so, because they realize that such behav-
iour is likely to be punished. Lerner suggests that around this time, children form 
an implicit ‘personal contract’ with the world, in which they commit to following 
moral rules, but expect to receive good (that is, deserved) outcomes in exchange 
for doing so. 
Effectively, the essence of just world theory is that in childhood, most people 
make a commitment to live according to the principles of justice. Faith in the 
personal contract – that life will treat them fairly – becomes an organizing prin-
ciple in their lives. It gives them the confidence to make and pursue goals,

expecting their lives to be orderly, meaningful and controllable. In turn, this 
expectation promotes mental health, meaning that the belief in a just world (BJW) 
can be seen as a ‘positive illusion’ (Taylor and Brown, 1988). Indeed, research links 
it to many measures of psychological health, including positive affect (Dalbert, 
1999), optimism (Littrell and Beck, 1999), effective coping with stress (Tomaka 
and Blascovich, 1994), better sleep (Jensen, Dehlin, Hagberg et al., 1998), low 
levels of depression (Ritter, Benson and Synder, 1990) and less loneliness (Jones, 
Freemon and Goswick, 2006).
However, according to this theory, BJW is a double-edged sword because its 
psychological benefits motivate individuals to defend it against contradictory 
evidence, thereby minimizing the injustices they see happening to others. Where 
possible, observers may do this by actively helping victims (e.g., Zuckerman, 1975), 
but where not, individuals may adopt cognitive strategies such as blame and dero-
gation to minimize the apparent injustice being suffered (Lerner and Miller, 1978). 
This tendency was illustrated in a classic experiment by Lerner and Simmons 
(1966). Women volunteers watched a female confederate who seemed to be a 
participant in a learning experiment and who was receiving painful electric shocks 
when she got the answers wrong (the task was difficult, so that observers would 
not be tempted to think the confederate was stupid). Lerner and Simmons wanted 
to test the idea that observers would compensate the suffering victim where they 
could, but would devalue and reject her if they could not defend justice in this 
behavioural way. To up the ante, Lerner and Simmons informed their participants 
that they would have to watch a second session of the learning experiment, that is, 
witness more of the victim’s suffering. Results supported their predictions. When 
observers could help the victim, they did so (by assigning her to a condition where 
she received money rather than shocks), and did not devalue or reject her. 
However, when observers were told there was nothing they could do to help the 
victim, their attitudes towards her were more harsh. 
Lerner and Simmons (1966) also included a condition in which the victim 
seemed to be especially undeserving of the suffering she was going through. 
Specifically, they led participants to believe that the victim was taking the shocks 
so as to prevent them from going through a similar experience. This creates a situ-
ation in which bad things seem to be happening to a good person, which is espe-
cially threatening to the BJW. Under these conditions, attitudes to the victim were, 
ironically, the harshest of all. Other early experiments supported the core idea that 
people will help when they can, but restore the ‘just world’ with distorted thinking 
about victims when they could not (for reviews, see Hafer and Bègue, 2005; Lerner 
and Miller, 1978). 
This line of thought has important implications for charities; ironically, if they 
ask the public for help to solve huge problems, such as mass famine or eradicating 
widespread and devastating diseases, the public may think there is little they can 
do to help, which, far from encouraging helping behaviour, is likely to lead to 
devaluation of the victims. On the other hand, if they ask the public to help just 
one victim, they are much more likely to do so. It is probably for this reason that 

643
Altruism and justice
charitable appeals often ask us to ‘adopt a polar bear’ rather than do something 
small to save them all. Indeed, Miller (1977) found that Canadian participants who 
believed strongly in a just world were more likely to help the victims of a rare 
rather than a common disease, or a temporary financial setback rather than 
ongoing poverty. Those who did not believe so strongly in a just world were not 
affected by whether the problems they were asked to help solve were large or 
small. It seems that making a small contribution to alleviate a big problem is unat-
tractive to many people because it provides a painful reminder that there is a lot of 
injustice in the world; resolving a small, local injustice feels more like making the 
world a just place. 
Exploring further Look at advertisements for charity appeals for some major environmental, animal welfare, 
medical and children’s charities. Research suggests that these appeals may be more successful when, instead of 
presenting a huge, widespread problem, they invite the public to help just one victim of the problem. to what extent 
do they ‘personalize’ or ‘particularize’ the problems they are trying to solve in this way?
In line with these experimental findings, research shows that 
individuals who have a strong BJW also tend to be prejudiced 
towards a range of disadvantaged groups, including refugees 
(Montada, 1998), people with AIDS (Connors and Heaven, 
1990), the unemployed (Reichle, Schneider and Montada, 1998), 
the elderly (Lipkus and Siegler, 1993) and the poor (Furnham 
and Gunter, 1984). Thus, there seems to be something like a 
social dilemma at play – believing in a just world is good for the 
individual, but may, in some respects, be bad for the group, 
insofar as it can breed prejudice towards the most vulnerable 
and disadvantaged in society. 
However, recent research suggests that in principle, this 
dilemma can be resolved. Specifically, researchers have distin-
guished between the belief that the world is a just place to the self (BJW-self) and 
the belief that it is a just place for other people generally (BJW-others). Lipkus, 
Dalbert and Siegler (1996) measured BJW-self and BJW-others with 16 closely 
matched items (e.g., ‘I feel that I get what I deserve’ and ‘I feel that people get 
what they deserve’). These two spheres of BJW are positively correlated, but only 
moderately so. Among relatively privileged samples such as professionals and 
university students in developed economies, scores on the BJW-self scale were 
much higher than on the BJW-others scale (Bègue, 2002; Bègue and Bastounis, 
2003). Crucially, it turns out that BJW-self is correlated with psychological well-
being but not harsh social attitudes. In contrast, BJW-others is correlated with 
harsh social attitudes but not wellbeing (Bègue and Bastounis, 2003; Dalbert, 2001; 
Lipkus et al., 1996; Sutton and Douglas, 2005). Indeed, the two spheres of belief 
are sometimes associated with the same outcomes but in opposite directions. For 
example, a study of at-risk British teenagers found that strong beliefs in the justice 
of the world to the self were associated with reduced intentions to engage in anti-

social behaviour, whereas the more strongly teenagers believed the world was a 
just place for others, the more they intended to be antisocial (Sutton and Winnard, 
2007). Moreover, a study of Australian students showed that BJW-self is positively 
correlated with the tendency to forgive those who do us wrong, whereas BJW-
others is negatively correlated with forgiveness and is associated with the desire to 
take revenge or cut the transgressor out of our lives (Strelan and Sutton, 2011; see 
also Lucas, Young, Zhdanova and Alexander, 2010). Thus, in principle, it seems 
that individuals can ‘have their cake’, by endorsing BJW-self and accruing psycho-
logical benefits, and ‘eat it too’, by rejecting BJW-others and its harsher social 
connotations (see Figure 14.15). This makes sense from the perspective of just 
world theory, because it is the personal contract that matters. Thus the belief that 
‘I get what I deserve’ is of primary psychological interest. This belief is related to, 
but separate from, the belief that others get what they deserve. 
Time to reflect Research on the effects of the belief in a just world is correlational: individual differences in the 
strength of this belief are measured and then related to outcome variables of interest. Of course, this leaves the 
crucial question of causality open. Do you think the belief in a just world can be experimentally manipulated? How 
much does longitudinal research help? you can search the research literature to help you, if you like. 
Just world theory has undoubtedly been one of the most influential and 
successful theories in social psychology, able to relate variables as diverse as 
altruism, impression formation, prejudice, physical and psychological health, and 
even gambling (Callan, Ellard Shead and Hodgins, 2008) to an underlying human 
commitment to justice. That said, the theory has not been without its controver-
sies. One issue has been whether the belief in the just world is really delusional. It 
is clear that the human need for justice influences our behaviour in surprising and

Although BJW-self and BJW-others are positively related 
to each other, they are related to quite different variables, 
and sometimes related to the same variable in opposite 
directions. BJW-self but not BJW-others is related to indices of 
psychological wellbeing, including life satisfaction (Sutton 
and Douglas, 2005) and purpose in life (Sutton, Douglas, 
Wilkin et al., 2008). BJW-others but not BJW-self is related to 
intergroup attitudes that justify inequality and the misfortunes 
of lower status groups such as the poor (Sutton and Douglas, 
2005). BJW-self is negatively related to antisocial behavioural 
tendencies, such as delinquent intentions among at-risk youth, 
whereas BJW-others is positively related to them (Sutton 
and Winnard, 2007). Finally, BJW-self is positively related to 
forgiveness, whereas BJW-others is negatively related to the 
same variable (Strelan and Sutton, 2011). the overall pattern 
of these results suggests that BJW-self is adaptive, bringing 
both social and psychological benefits, whereas BJW-others 
is maladaptive, incurring social costs with no apparent 
psychological benefit.

sometimes unfortunate ways, which can ironically sometimes cause us to 
compound the original injustice. But it is not clear that these reactions are neces-
sarily out of touch with reality. 
Let us illustrate with one of the most striking and convincing tests of just world 
theory. Hafer (2000) had participants watch an upsetting video in which a young 
woman recounted how she had contracted HIV as a result of bad luck (a condom 
broke). Before watching the video, an experimental group of participants had been 
asked to list their long-term life goals. According to just world theory, the personal 
contract is at the heart of just world beliefs – people need to plan in order to reap 
long-term rewards; this, in turn, requires a certain degree of faith in justice – that 
our efforts and sacrifices will pay off. Thus, planning for the future should make 
people even more motivated to somehow construe the innocent victim’s situation 
as just. And that is what happened. Compared to control participants, the experi-
mental group were more prone to attributing blame and negative personality 
characteristics to the victim. Undoubtedly, this is strong evidence for just world 
theory, but the issue we are considering here is whether the claim that just world 
beliefs are delusional is warranted. A problem is that in this as in other experi-
ments, there is no right or wrong answer on the scales that participants complete. 
Rather, participants are required to circle a number from one to seven, say, which 
best represents their opinion. 
ETHiCS AND rESEArCH METHODS 
Eliciting distress in studies of the ‘just world’
In Chapter 9, we considered the ethics of milgram’s (1974) 
well-known studies of obedience. Participants displayed 
signs of intense anxiety and emotional distress. 
Zimbardo’s Prison experiment was also intensely 
distressful for participants, and Zimbardo (2006) himself 
criticized Haslam and Reicher’s (2006a, 2006b, 2007, 
2008) BBC Prison Study on the grounds that it was 
unethical to run such a study again. In these studies of 
social influence, however, the distress that participants 
experienced was not the outcome the experimenters 
wanted to elicit. It was more or less a by-product, 
although interesting in its own right, of processes such as 
obedience, tyranny and intergroup conflict. 
In contrast, research on the justice motive, particularly 
research concerned with the blame and derogation of 
victims, often sets out to cause participants distress. the 
reason for this is that theory assumes people consciously 
acknowledge that the world is an unjust place, but at a less 
rational, preconscious level, they defend their implicit faith 
in the justice of the world by any means they can. Intense 
emotional impact is therefore assumed to be required in 
order to break through the veneer of rationality. Lerner 
(1998, p. 389) stated that in experiments that do not 
emotionally impact participants sufficiently: 
With little at stake to be gained or lost, the participants’ 
main incentives are not to re-establish justice … but 
rather to manage their impressions. For the most part, 
they try to be cooperative participants, and, of course, 
not do anything that would threaten their self or public 
esteem by appearing foolish or embarrassing. 
many just world studies require participants to blame 
and derogate innocent victims of misfortune, such as rape 
survivors (Bal and van den Bos, 2010; Kleinke and meyer, 
1990), people living with HIV/AIDS (Hafer, 2000) and 
children who suffer horrendous injuries as a result of 
electrocution (Correia, Vala and Aguiar, 2007). to overtly 
blame and derogate such people cuts strongly against 
social and moral norms and so comprises a threat to 
participants’ self-image, and probably seems to them to 
threaten their image in the eyes of the experimenter, too.

Applying
thus, to disrupt socially desirable responding, and 
motivate people to defend the belief in a just world, 
researchers set out to create materials that are 
emotionally impactful and distressing. they use videos in 
which victims, sometimes real people rather than actors, 
recount upsetting personal stories of misfortune, loss and 
ongoing suffering (Callan, Kay, Davidenko and ellard, 
2009; Hafer, 2000) or place participants directly in front of 
a victim who appears to be suffering intensely (Lerner and 
Simmons, 1966). 
Is this ethically warranted? A key issue is informed 
consent. Participants need to know they are signing up for 
a potentially distressing experience. the problem is that 
by telling participants this, researchers may make 
participants aware that intense emotions are an intrinsic 
part of the scientific theory behind the experiment. this 
might cause them to hold privately held hypotheses about 
the experiment that can interfere with their responses (cf. 
Silver, Wortman and Klos, 1982). Neither is it scientifically 
acceptable to alert participants to the fact that they will be 
asked to blame and derogate the victims, even though 
this is likely to come across as a nasty surprise to many 
participants. By signalling to participants that the study is 
about perceived justice, researchers are likely to invalidate 
their studies since participants’ normal efforts to present 
themselves as rational, decent people are likely to be 
bolstered (Lerner, 1998). As far as possible, researchers 
need to inform participants about the nature and even the 
aims of the study in advance, but they cannot do so with 
complete candour, otherwise the scientific integrity of the 
experiment is lost. to inform participants that they may 
experience distress in the experiment is an absolute must, 
but to inform them exactly how or why they might find 
their experience distressing is, unfortunately, not possible. 
Questions
1 What other ethical considerations are important in 
determining whether these studies are ethically 
warranted? What ethical safeguards should researchers 
build in to such studies? you might want to reread the 
section on ethics in Chapter 1.
2 Although Lerner (1998) distinguishes between low-
impact and high-impact studies, which elicit moderate 
or high levels of psychological distress, there has not 
been a study that systematically manipulates the 
emotional impact of an experiment and determines 
whether this affects victim derogation and other forms 
of just world defence. Also, no study to our knowledge 
has even correlated the extent of emotional arousal 
with just world defences. So, we do not have the kind 
of firm evidence that emotional impact matters that 
we would normally require to accept a scientific 
hypothesis. What ethical implications does this have 
for the conduct of just world studies?
Fortunately for just world theory, recent studies suggest that the concern with 
justice can indeed cause people to distort reality. For example, Callan, Powell and 
Ellard (2007) asked participants to look at a photo of a young woman and told 
them they would have to identify her later on. They then told participants that 
there had been a fire at her house and she had either suffered greatly or not very 
much. Finally, they presented a set of photographs that were digitally altered 
versions of the original they had earlier seen. The researchers had subtly altered 
these photographs in order to make the woman more or less physically attractive. 
When asked which photograph was the original they had seen, participants 
selected photographs in which the woman was significantly less attractive than the 
original. Put differently, they misremembered the woman, thinking she was less 
attractive than she was in reality. This is true victim derogation – evaluating a 
victim more negatively than is objectively warranted. 
In a follow-up paper, Callan et al. (2009) found that participants misremem-
bered the amount won by a lottery winner, recalling a sum of money too low if 
they had learned that the winner was a ‘bad’ person. Participants especially did 

647
Altruism and justice
this if their justice beliefs had already been threatened by watching a distressing 
video of a victim (see Figure 14.16). These findings are in line with suggestions 
that memory is essentially a constructive process in which a reality is built rather 
than faithfully reproduced. They show specifically that it is a process in which a 
just world can be created without our awareness.
Although responses to individual victims can be shown to be irrational, to date 
there is no real evidence that people consciously endorse just world beliefs that are 
irrational. Again, BJW questionnaires ask participants to make responses on scales 
in which there is no right or wrong answer. At first glance, the finding that people 
endorse the BJW-self view more than the BJW-others view looks like delusional 
thinking – another manifestation of the self-enhancing biases we noted in Chapter 
2. How can the world be especially just to you, while being unjust to others? 
However, these findings are typically obtained from privileged samples who may 
have a point – they are immune from the famine, diseases and political oppression 
that affect many of the less fortunate people in the world. Indeed, when we ask less 
privileged samples about the justice of the world, they do not show this bias (Sutton 
and Winnard, 2007). Further, even privileged individuals do not think they are 
unique in their receipt of justice – they rate the world as more just to themselves 
than to others generally, but do not think they get any more justice than other 
people in the same social demographic as themselves (Sutton et al., 2008). 
Recent versions of just world theory explain why people sometimes look like 
they have irrational worldviews but other times seem to be able to acknowledge 
that the world is not necessarily a just place. The key is that people’s commitment 
to justice is deep-rooted since childhood and by adulthood is largely preconscious 
or automatic (Lerner, 1998; Lerner and Clayton, 2011). They are confronted with 
evidence of injustice almost every day of their lives, through personal experience 
and the media, and it would be absurd – and undesirable – to say out loud that, in 
general, victims deserve what they get or are not worthy of concern. Thus, at a 
conscious level, we are able to acknowledge that, at least as far as other people are 
concerned, the world is not a just place. But unconsciously, we are inclined to 
FigurE 14.16 recall and justice beliefs Participants were told 
that a man had won CAN$18.42 million in a lottery, and were 
given information that he was of good or bad moral character 
(friendly and a good tipper, or an unfriendly non-tipper). 
Later, they were asked to recall this number. they recalled a 
lower number when the lottery winner was ‘bad’ and after 
watching an apparently unrelated video that threatened the 
just world (a videoed interview with a young woman who had 
contracted HIV/AIDS because a condom broke, and for whom 
antiviral drugs were not effective; a manipulation borrowed 
from a study by Hafer, 2000, we read about earlier). In all 
except this condition, participants accurately recalled the size 
of the lottery win (the mean recalled win was not significantly 
different than the actual win).

Applying
construe events as if they were just. Thus, if our cognitive resources are over-
whelmed by strong emotions or we are cognitively busy, the tendency to see the 
world as a just place should be heightened. 
Recent research supports this view. Callan et al. (2010) presented carefully 
constructed fake newspaper reports of an accident to participants, complete with 
photographs. For example, a story related how a swimming coach had been killed 
when a tree fell onto his car. The newspaper story mentioned either that the swim-
ming coach was much beloved by his community for all the work he did, or that he 
was in disgrace, having been caught stealing from his class. Clearly, there was no 
plausible causal relationship between the moral character of the swimming coach 
and the freak accident that killed him. Nonetheless, participants made this link, 
agreeing that the accident was a consequence of his behaviour more when he had 
been stealing than when his conduct had been unimpeachable. This is an example 
of immanent justice reasoning – the superstitious attribution of good and bad 
outcomes to unrelated good and bad deeds, which was once thought to be the 
preserve of children (Jose, 1990; Piaget, 1932), but has more recently been shown to 
be a pitfall into which adults fall, too (e.g., Raman and Winer, 2004). Further, this 
effect was only significant when participants were under cognitive load, that is, 
trying to mentally rehearse a 12-digit as opposed to a 2-digit number in order to 
recall it later. Thus, when we consciously think things through in a calm and 
collected way, we do not necessarily conclude that, in general terms, justice reigns 
and people get what they deserve. When we do not think things through, we appear 
to be prone to an automatic tendency to appraise events as if they were just. 
The group-value model
Just world theory has shaped later theorizing about the need for justice in particular 
contexts. One such theory is the group-value model proposed by Lind and Tyler 
(1988; also Tyler, 1994). According to this model, people care about justice not only 
because of the outcomes they expect to receive (as assumed by equity theory), but 
also because their social identity is important. In particular, people care about the 
status and respect they receive within their social groups. The fairness of the 
outcomes they experience (distributive justice) and the processes they are subjected 
to (procedural justice) tell them about their status. If they are treated fairly, they 
assume they are held in high regard. As a result, they are more likely to identify 
with the group and work hard in the interests of the group, making sacrifices for it 
if necessary. If they are not treated fairly, they experience a state of threat in which 
they are not confident about their status within the group. Many research findings 
support this model. For example, employees who perceive that they receive proce-
dural justice are more likely to perform so-called ‘extra-role’ behaviours, working 
harder than they are obliged to in order to serve the organization for which they 
work (Moorman, Blakely and Niehoff, 1998). Receiving more procedural justice 
from authorities such as the police and managers makes people more inclined to 
respect their authority and comply with their requests, crucially, because it also 
encourages them to identify more strongly with the group (Tyler and Blader, 2003).

649
Altruism and justice
The moral is clear for all authorities – treat people with fairness, or, at the very 
least, convince them that you are treating them fairly.
Although the distinction between distributive and procedural justice is inter-
esting and important (e.g., Leonardelli and Toh, 2011; Lucas et al., 2010; Tyler, 
2012), people do not always have enough knowledge to determine whether their 
outcomes are fair. If you do not know how much the person in the office next to 
you is getting paid, or the grades that other students are getting for similar work, 
then you cannot evaluate the distributive justice of your outcomes. In such cases, 
there is a good chance that you will rely on information as to whether the process 
by which your pay and grades are determined appears to be fair. For example, 
were you given feedback with your grade? Did a second person also mark your 
work, or check the grade? In such situations, if you feel that you have received 
procedural justice, you will also tend to assume that you have received distributive 
justice, that is, your final outcome was fair, relative to other people. Van den Bos, 
Lind, Vermunt and Wilke (1997) demonstrated this effect in a study with Dutch 
students from Leiden University. Participants worked on tasks, ostensibly in 
pairs, in order to earn lottery tickets. Some participants were given ‘voice’ – a 
chance to express their opinion on how the lottery tickets should be divided 
between themselves and their partner. Other students were given no ‘voice’ and so 
were not able to express this opinion. ‘Voice’ is a key aspect of procedural justice – 
people tend to perceive processes that give them voice as fair, and processes that 
do not give them voice as unfair (Lind, Kanfer and Earley, 1990). Results showed 
that after receiving their payment, participants relied on whether or not they had 
‘voice’ to evaluate the outcome itself, but only when they had no idea how much 
their partner had been paid. When they knew whether their partner had been paid, 
they relied on social comparison to determine whether their payments were just 
or not, and their satisfaction with the payment they received did not depend on 
whether or not they had voice. Thus, van den Bos et al. (1997) argued that people 
use procedural justice indicators as a heuristic (Chapter 3), because they often – 
even typically – lack all the information they need to evaluate the distributive 
justice (Figure 14.17).

Applying
System justification theory
Another major theory spawned by the just world theory is system justification 
theory (Jost and Banaji, 1994). The core idea of this theory is that people’s depend-
ence on social systems for wealth and security motivates them to justify those 
social systems – to see them as essentially fair and functional. Thus, dissonance is 
aroused when there is a patent defect in the system, so that people are subject to 
unfair inequalities, for example. 
Early work on system justification focused on how people in low status 
groups react to the injustices they experience. As much or even more than high 
status group members, members of low status groups often internalize negative 
stereotypes of their group that serve to justify their lowly position (as in, ‘no 
wonder we are poor – look how lazy we are!’), to believe that the government 
acts in the interests of the people, and that economic inequality is legitimate and 
necessary (Jost, Pelham, Sheldon and Sullivan, 2003). As if justifying the 
tendency for women to be paid less than men for the same work, female partici-
pants display a depressed entitlement effect (Callahan-Levy and Meese, 1979; 
Major, 1994). In a study, when given the chance to determine their own pay for 
work done in an experimental task, they paid themselves less than male partici-
pants, even though independent judges rated their work as being of the same 
quality (Jost, 1997). 
More recently, research on system justification has gone beyond the reactions 
of low status individuals to their plight. For example, one way that people justify a 
system, regardless of their own status, is to use complementary stereotyping – as 
in ‘poor but happy’. These stereotypes imply that ‘poverty has its rewards and 
affluence its drawbacks’, making economic inequality feel somewhat more legiti-
mate (Kay and Jost, 2003, p. 823). Other work highlights how the motive to justify 
social systems is especially strong when one depends on the system and it is seen 
as something that cannot be changed. In a set of experiments by Kay, Gaucher, 
Peach et al. (2009), for example, Canadians were more likely to endorse current 
inequalities in Canadian society if they were reminded how much their lives 
depended on the political system in Canada (‘system dependence’), if they were 
led to believe that it was relatively difficult to leave Canada (‘system inescapa-
bility’), and if they were exposed to a passage suggesting that the Canadian system 
was not working (‘system threat’). 
The communication and social construction of justice
For the most part, the social psychological perspectives on justice we have 
encountered are concerned with why individuals ‘need’ to perceive that the world 
and/or specific social systems are just. More specifically, they are concerned with 
how and why individuals defend their beliefs in justice, and the specific psycho-
logical consequences of beliefs in justice and injustice. However, justice is not ‘all 
in the mind’. As system justification theory points out (Jost and Banaji, 1994; Jost 
and van der Toorn, 2012), people also benefit by sharing a perception that their 
system is just. Sharing perceptions of justice with others not only bolsters your

dependence on social systems 
for wealth and security

own certainty, but allows you to feel that you have a basis for reality. One impli-
cation of this is that people collaborate to socially construct a just world. In addi-
tion to all the thinking processes that uphold a just world, there are also likely to 
be communication processes that contribute to the shared assumption that our 
lives are basically just. 
Researchers in experimental social psychology are beginning to investigate 
these processes. Alves and Correia (2008) found that participants rated a fictional 
person higher if they had expressed a high, rather than low, belief in a just world. 
Such people are rated as more trustworthy, a better leader and co-worker, more 
likeable and so on. This effect is independent of participants’ own level of BJW 
(Alves and Correia, 2010). It is not that participants are more likely to agree with 
others who express a high belief in a just world. Rather, they are seen as more 
constructive, socially desirable and socially useful people. 
Researchers in the discourse analysis tradition (Durrheim, Quayle, Whitehead 
and Kriel, 2005; Potter and Wetherell, 1987; van Dijk, 1993, 2011; Wetherell, Stiven 
and Potter, 1987) have always been concerned with the use of language to establish 
the legitimacy of social arrangements. Wetherell et al. (1987) argue that people’s 
use of language when discussing inequality, gender roles and other topics related 
to social hierarchy and specialization embodies and reveals ‘practical ideologies’. 
These are not coherent, rigidly formulated bodies of knowledge, but rather 
‘montages of incoherently related themes’ or ‘fragmentary complexes of notions, 
norms and models which guide conduct and allow for its justification and ration-
alization’ (p. 60). We saw in Chapter 11 how Pakeha (White) interviewees in New 
Zealand used contradictory statements as part of discourses to establish that they 
were not racist, while justifying the disadvantages of Ma¯ori in New Zealand. The 
use of discourse enables people to legitimize the social status quo and their own 
position in relation to it. 
Wetherell et al. (1987) illustrated how people use discourse in sophisticated 
ways to justify social inequality in a study of final-year students at the University 
of St Andrews in Scotland. They were asked to discuss gender and employment 
opportunities. Participants were generally keen to establish that they supported 
the principle of equality. Thus, ‘Male Three’ in the study said:
I’ve never been a male chauvinist so I mean I just, on the business side, women are 
just as good as men, I mean if not better, I mean obviously perfectly equal. (p. 62) 
At the same time, participants gave voice to the discourse that gender differences 
are natural and may explain inequality, as voiced by ‘Female Two’:
I [was talking] ... to some friends the other night who have got children … and 
one of them was high up in management but once her children came along that 
was it, she just, all these maternal urges came surging out of her and she just 
couldn’t go back again. (p. 62) 
Sometimes conflicts between cultural notions force people into awkward posi-
tions and lead them to contradict themselves fairly obviously. Take this extract:

Interviewer: So if it was a decision between you and your wife as to who was to 
stay at home, you would rather go to work than stay at home?
Male One: Well, no, that would have to be a unanimous decision, in other 
words if my wife was adamant that she wanted to go out to work, uh and if I 
were 90 per cent convinced that I wanted to go out to work, then it is possible 
that I would look after the children. But I would say that it’s unlikely that I 
would marry a person who would be so closeted in her views anyway. So you 
know, it’s not really likely to happen. I will be going to work. (p. 63) 
Later, the same interviewee said ‘there should be equalities for both men and 
women at the workplace’, and ‘I think they [women] should look after the chil-
dren’. Through these and several other ways of using language and argument, 
participants in this study both distanced themselves from inequality in the context 
of gender roles and said things that justified it. The study of talk – what people 
say – reveals how the status quo can be justified in everyday conversation.

SOCiAL PSYCHOLOgY iN THE rEAL WOrLD 
Economic inequality and economic crisis
In the world’s developed economies, economic 
inequality – the difference between the wealth of the 
richest and poorest sections of society – has risen steadily 
over recent decades (Galbraith, 2012; Western, Bloome, 
Sosnaud and tach, 2012). In a sustained investigation of 
the effects that this might have, sociologists Wilkinson and 
Pickett (2010) explored correlations between the extent 
of inequality in 25 of the world’s richest countries and a 
range of important outcomes. It turns out that many so-
called ‘modern ills’ are closely associated with inequality. 
Inequality was correlated with mental illness (r = .73), 
lower levels of trust (r = .66), shorter life expectancy (r = 
.44), infant mortality (r = .42), obesity (r = .57), poor 
children’s educational performance (r = .45), teenage 
births (r = .73), homicides (r = .47) and imprisonment rates 
(r = .75). these correlation coefficients (r values) reflect 
much larger effect sizes than we are used to seeing in 
social psychology (see Chapter 15 for discussion of typical 
effect sizes). Squaring them suggests that anything 
between 20 and 50 per cent of the differences between 
countries on these measures of wellbeing are explained 
by differences in social inequality. the relationship 
between inequality and reduced wellbeing holds even 
when poverty levels in societies are controlled for. thus, 
the increasing levels of poverty that are associated with 
inequality do not account for their results. Also, even 
richer citizens of countries with high levels of inequality 
tend to suffer more from these ‘modern ills’ than their rich 
equivalents in more egalitarian countries. However, it is 
not entirely clear why inequality is such a problem.

Altruism and justice
Social psychology suggests a few answers to this 
question. As we have seen, people across cultures value 
equality (Deutsch, 1975; Schwarz, 1992). It is strongly 
associated in people’s minds with fairness and justice 
(Chen, 1999), is a crucial concept in the field of human 
rights (Conte, Davidson and Burchill, 2004), and is a simple 
and popular rule for allocating resources (Samuelson and 
Allison, 1994). In experimental games involving decisions 
about the allocation of money, people will pay money out 
of their own accounts in order to ensure that allocations 
are reasonably equal (Camerer, 2003). A recent survey 
showed that Americans underestimated the extent of 
wealth inequality in their country, yet wanted it to be still 
more equal than their rose-tinted beliefs suggested 
(Norton and Ariely, 2011). In keeping with a line from 
Shakespeare’s Hamlet (Act II, Scene II) that ‘there is 
nothing good or bad, but thinking makes it so’, many 
negative outcomes of inequality arise because, in general, 
people do not like it. 
System justification theory and just world theory both 
suggest that people are threatened by the perceived 
injustice associated with high levels of inequality (social 
dominance theory does not necessarily make this 
presumption). Processes of motivated social cognition 
(see Chapters 2 and 3) cause them to think in ways that 
minimize the perceived size or unfairness of inequality 
(O’Brien and major, 2005; Sutton et al., 2008; Jost and van 
der toorn, 2012). thus, increases in inequality may 
strengthen the motivation to blame and derogate the less 
well-off in society, not just by those better off, but also by 
themselves. It may also demotivate people from 
perceiving injustice and resolving to change it through 
protest and other forms of collective action (van Zomeren, 
Spears and Leach, 2008) (see Chapter 12). there is 
considerable evidence that inequality and relative 
deprivation are more distressing for people who perceive 
them as unjust (Kessler and mummendey, 2002; Napier 
and Jost, 2008). this led Sutton, Cichocka and van der 
toorn (2012, p. 132) to argue that ‘the essential dilemma 
facing individuals is a choice between coping with 
inequality and combating inequality’, since ‘psychological 
mechanisms that support one tend to be at odds with 
those that support the other’.
this argument suggests that inequality can be self-
perpetuating – as it increases, so does the desire to 
legitimize and comply with society’s hierarchies. there 
are other ways in which inequality perpetuates itself. 
Some evidence suggests that people experimentally 
assigned to a powerful ‘leader’ role subsequently act less 
morally but evaluate themselves as more moral than 
those assigned to a ‘subordinate’ role. In other words, 
inequality may promote the hypocrisy of elites, causing 
them to act in their own interests without realizing they 
are doing so (Lammers, Stapel and Galinsky, 2010). 
Consistent with this notion that privilege may erode 
moral motivation, we saw earlier in this chapter that 
richer people tend to give proportionately less of their 
income to charity than poorer people (Greve, 2009; Piff et 
al., 2010). Also, in social dilemma games, people are less 
cooperative if their initial allocations of money are 
unequal than if they are all given the same amount 
(Anderson, mellor and milyo, 2008). this may happen 
because inequality undermines the trust that is essential 
for social cooperation (Putnam, 2000). Less sharing in 
social dilemmas means less for all – and also means that 
players will end up with more unequal sums of money. 
Further, as inequality increases, children and adolescents 
from less wealthy backgrounds tend increasingly to 
disengage from education (teachman, 1987). 
there is controversy about whether economic 
inequality is the price we have to pay for economic 
growth. Correlations between inequality and growth are 
mixed and depend on factors such as the type of 
government a country has (Banerjee and Duflo, 2003; 
Bjørnskov, 2008; Forbes, 2000). However, research by 
economic historians suggests that periods of heightened 
inequality tend to precipitate economic crises (Reich, 
2010). Greater wealth inequality means there is more 
capital available for risky, speculative investments and 
‘bubbles’, in which assets become increasingly overpriced 
until they crash in value. Research like that of Lammers et 
al. (2010) also suggests that it may erode the moral 
judgements of those in charge of the resources. 
this appears to have been the backdrop for the recent 
international banking crisis, which continues to have 
disastrous effects on the finances of many countries. In 
September 2008, the global financial crisis that had been 
brewing for a year went critical. A cascade of bad debts 
meant that the value of financial assets evaporated, and 
normal lending between banks ceased. It was widely 
thought within government and banking circles that 
within days, if not hours, Atms would be unable to 
dispense money (Brown, 2011). thanks to the actions of 
world governments, this looming cataclysm was avoided.

In this chapter, we considered the positive social psychological 
phenomenon of altruism and the reasons why people make 
personal sacrifices for others. We also discussed how people 
respond to social dilemmas and how cooperation can be 
encouraged. Finally, we considered why justice is such an 
important factor for people. you will have learned that:
• Altruism is an action that is performed to benefit another 
person without benefiting the self. It is a specific example of 
the more general phenomena of helping behaviour and 
prosocial behaviour. 
• Social psychologists’ interest in altruism was captured by the 
phenomenon of bystander intervention – why do people 
often stand by and fail to help when something terrible 
happens? theorists have argued that as bystander numbers 
increase, people are less likely to interpret the situation as a 
problem and are therefore less likely to assume 
responsibility (diffusion of responsibility). Another reason is 
pluralistic ignorance, where people wrongly assume, based 
on others’ actions, that they endorse a particular norm of 
‘standing by’. 
But in averting disaster, governments suspended 
principles such as justice and equality. Instead, 
governments took on the bad debts of investment banks. 
In this way, bank debts were transferred to taxpayers, who 
were also to be affected by the resulting cuts in public 
services. to illustrate, after the Irish government agreed to 
bail out its banks, the average Irish person owed 
something in the order of US$500,000 to international 
lenders (CNBC, 2011). Sutton et al. (2012, p. 116) conclude 
that ‘just as violence begets violence, inequality tends to 
breed still more inequality’.
Questions
1 there must be some limit to the rather pessimistic 
conclusion of Sutton, Cichocka and van der toorn 
(2012) that inequality is self-perpetuating, since 
history shows that levels of inequality peak and then 
fall again. Based on what you have read in this chapter 
(much of Chapter 12 is also relevant), what factors do 
you think might help reduce inequality again?
2 there is remarkably little experimental evidence that 
inequality causes reductions in wellbeing. the 
evidence cited by Wilkinson and Pickett (2010) is 
overwhelmingly correlational. What barriers are there 
to manipulating inequality and seeing what effects it 
has? How might you do this in experiments?

to find interesting material on the correlation  
between high-rise building developments and 
subsequent crashes.

Altruism and justice
• early theorists argued that there may be an ‘altruistic 
personality’, or a stable psychological makeup that 
predisposes people to help others. Several individual 
differences characteristics such as machiavellianism, 
empathy and the belief in a just world have been found to 
correlate with altruistic behaviours. However, situational 
factors such as culture and perceived similarity of the target 
to the self also influence altruistic behaviour. 
• Some researchers have concluded that people often help 
others in order to help themselves, therefore there is no 
such thing as ‘true’ or ‘pure’ altruism. However, other 
theorists have argued that the act of altruism can indeed be 
‘pure’, and driven by empathic concern for the welfare of 
others. there is evidence for both perspectives. Altruism may 
serve internal rather than external rewards. 
• Some theorists posit that altruism has an evolutionary origin 
and that people are altruistic (to their own kin) as a way of 
promoting the successful reproduction of their own genes. 
Others argue that altruism occurs because it is also repaid. 
• Aspects of the target requiring help significantly influence 
whether or not they receive it. In particular, age, gender, 
attractiveness and personality determine the degree of 
help received. 
• the study of altruism is also influenced by the study of how 
people deal with social dilemmas such as the prisoner’s 
dilemma, public goods dilemmas and commons dilemmas. 
When they set aside their own interests for the collective, 
they are cooperating, whereas when they act in their own 
interests at the expense of the collective, they are defecting. 
Both situational and personality factors determine 
behaviour in social dilemmas. A strong sense of 
identification with the group also encourages cooperation. 
mistrust can be resolved by communication. Cooperation can 
also be improved by rewarding cooperators and punishing 
defectors, even at personal expense to the self (e.g., 
altruistic punishment).
• Justice exists when people treat each other as they are 
entitled or deserve to be treated. Distributive justice refers 
to the justice of the outcome and procedural justice refers to 
the justice of the procedures. theorists argue that justice has 
two important functions – it improves functioning and 
benefits the collective. Culture plays a crucial role in shaping 
perceptions of justice, but three key principles (equity, 
equality and need) of justice appear to be universal. 
• Social psychological theories explain the importance of 
justice to people. Social exchange theory explains that 
people try to maximize personal benefits and minimize 
personal costs. People invest and so that things are fair, they 
expect that others will do the same. equity theory explains 
that people compare and evaluate the net benefits they 
receive compared to those received by others. Fairness 
means that nobody over- or underbenefits. According to just 
world theory, people have a deep-seated need to perceive 
the world as a just place. In childhood, people make a 
‘personal contract’ with the world to commit to the rules of 
justice. the belief in a just world predicts many psychological 
and health outcomes. However, it may not always be good 
for the group insofar as it can breed prejudice towards the 
disadvantaged. Belief in a just world for the self and for 
others predicts different outcomes. According to the group-
value model, people’s social identity is important to their 
perception of justice. the fairness of the outcomes they 
experience and the process tell people about their status 
within the group. System justification theory proposes that 
people’s dependence on social systems for wealth and 
security motivates them to justify those social systems as 
fair and just. 
• People also collaborate to socially construct a just world 
through communication processes, as can be seen in work 
from the discourse analysis tradition on the role of language 
in legitimizing social arrangements. 
Essay questions
At the beginning of the chapter, we asked you to consider  
these questions:
1 you are out one evening and while walking through the city 
streets, you notice a heated argument between a man and a 
woman. the man is shouting and looks like he is about to hit 
the woman, who is clearly distressed. Rather than helping, 
everyone appears to be walking past, ignoring the woman’s 
plight. Is this unusual, and why is it happening? Under what 
conditions are people more likely to help? 
2 Ziva describes why she gives to a charity in support of 
famine victims. ‘Once I saw those starving children on tV, I 
just knew I’d feel awful if I didn’t do something. I feel much 
better now that I’ve given a bit of money away.’ Was Ziva’s 
donation a selfless act of charity, or was she being selfish?

Applying social psychology
Encouraging energy saving among students
Ultimately, everybody wins if people save energy. However, 
when people engage in prosocial behaviour such as this, there 
are also personal prices to pay. For example, energy saving can 
be inconvenient because it can interfere with everyday 
activities. Also, going out of one’s way to save energy can feel 
rather fruitless if one feels that others are not pulling their 
weight to do the same. Of course, there are personal as well as 
group-level advantages. For example, homeowners who 
conserve energy also save money on their bills. energy-saving 
campaigners can therefore appeal to people’s desire to keep 
their costs down. But what about university students, for whom 
such incentives may be less relevant? Perhaps these individuals 
are renting student property and have no say in the types of 
light bulbs they use. Perhaps they are unable to personally

Altruism and justice
control thermostats. Potentially, they share bills with other 
students and cannot limit the amount of energy used by others. 
How does one design an intervention to reduce energy use 
among students?
Imagine you are a social psychology consultant who has 
been approached by the local council. the council has observed 
that university students in the town are relatively high energy 
users and would like to design an intervention to reduce energy 
usage among this group. your job is to help the council, with 
your knowledge and expertise in social psychology, to put 
together this intervention.
In a job such as this, your first task is typically to search the 
psychological literature for theory and evidence on the topic. 
Based on this knowledge, you would then make 
recommendations for an intervention based on what appears 
to be the most promising and effective principles of 
intervention.
the following questions are designed to guide you through 
this type of process:
1 Conduct an internet search using a database such as Google 
Scholar to find at least three energy use interventions that 
have been designed in the past 10 years. What search terms 
would you use?
2 Read the articles and take some notes about the nature of 
the interventions. For example, what theories did the 
researchers draw upon? What was involved in the 
interventions? Were the interventions successful? How did 
the researchers measure the success of the interventions?
3 Crucially, who were the targets (that is, participants) of the 
interventions? Note again that you have been asked to 
design an intervention to apply to university students. In 
what ways are students potentially different from the 
samples tested in the studies concerned? Specifically, are 
students’ energy-saving concerns and behaviours likely to 
be different from previously tested samples? Would the 
interventions you have found be relevant to students, or 
could they be modified to apply to students? In thinking 
about these issues, consider carefully what students are able 
to do to reduce the amount of energy they use. It may be 
useful to find a list of behaviours that are recommended to 
reduce energy use in general (e.g., closing curtains, 
switching off lights in empty rooms, using thermostats 
correctly, using tumble dryers less), and think about the 
feasibility of recommending each of these to students.
4 think about other features of the intervention. For example, 
if the intervention involves recommending that students 
switch off lights and so on, what is the reason for them to do 
so? Will an argument that appeals to the fight against 
climate change be more likely to succeed? Or, would 
students respond better to an argument based on a financial 
incentive (that is, saving money)? On what evidence are you 
basing this choice?
5 Decide exactly what you plan to do and why.
6 Now, write a brief summary of a report you would provide 
to the council. this should fit on two sides of an A4 page. 
your report summary should include:
• A title.
• theoretical accounts that have dealt with energy-saving 
behaviour and the barriers to energy-saving behaviour.
• An evaluation of different approaches to intervention – 
which is most likely to be effective? In particular, what 
should be involved in a potential intervention for a 
student sample?
• Recommendations for steps that the council should take 
to reduce energy use among students.
• Recommendations for how the council should test the 
success of its intervention.
• A reference list (citations should be made in text, in  
APA format).
Blind spot in social psychology
Changing social value orientation: Can people be 
made more prosocial?
As we learned earlier in the chapter, an individual’s social value 
orientation (van Lange and Liebrand, 1991) can predict how they 
behave in social dilemmas. Research suggests that some people 
are more pro-self and are less likely to cooperate (Liebrand and 
mcClintock, 1988), whereas others are more prosocial and are 
more likely to cooperate (van Lange, 1999). thus, the interests of 
groups would appear to be served better if its members were 
more prosocial. So, one question is whether it would be possible 
to ‘make’ people more prosocial, either temporarily or 
permanently. In doing so, it may be possible to influence people 
to become more cooperative in social dilemmas, with many 
positive consequences. At present, however, no research has 
examined this possibility. In particular, there is no research that 
has treated pro-self and prosocial orientation as a dependent 
measure to examine whether or not it can be influenced by the 
manipulation of other variables. We would like you to think 
about this issue here.

Student project 
The psychology of ‘retail therapy’
Stephanie Barrows studied as an 
undergraduate student at the 
University of essex and her final-
year dissertation was supervised 
by Dr mitch Callan. Her research 
investigates whether the feeling 
of relative deprivation – a 
consequence, in part, of economic 
inequality, and a driver of feelings 
of injustice – can be linked to 
impulsive consumerism.  
My topic and aims
Working in retail, I have always been intrigued by the 
psychological aspects of impulsiveness, which prompted me to 
consider the concept of ‘retail therapy’ and how therapeutic it 
is. Impulsive purchases appear to provide immediate relief from 
anxiety and emotional discomfort, where the primary intention 
is to improve the buyer’s affect temporarily. Along these lines, 
my project explored the extent to which personal relative 
deprivation predicts an individual’s tendency to engage in 
impulsive buying depending on their ability to delay 
gratification. Previous research suggests that feeling relatively 
deprived predicts the urge to gamble, but little research had 
explored the link between relative deprivation and impulsive 
buying. I investigated whether the ability to delay gratification 
interacts with personal relative deprivation on impulsive 
buying, and predicted that the relation between relative 
deprivation and impulsive buying depends on an individual’s 
willingness to delay gratification. 
My methods
One hundred volunteers from the University of essex completed 
a paper-based questionnaire containing validated scales 
measuring personal relative deprivation, willingness to delay 
gratification, and impulsive buying. Participants were informed 
that the questionnaire measured their consumer intentions and 
behaviours.   
My findings and their implications
Contrary to the hypothesis, overall there was no interaction 
between relative deprivation and willingness to delay 
gratification on impulse buying. Interestingly, however, further 
analyses revealed that the expected interaction pattern 
occurred for women but not for men. Personal relative 
deprivation positively predicted impulsive buying only among 
women who were less willing to delay gratification. Women 
who had a higher willingness to delay gratification did not 
engage in impulsive buying as a function of their relative 
deprivation levels. thus, a willingness to delay gratification is a 
limiting factor to the effects of relative deprivation and appears 
to act as a buffer for women who are able to delay gratification. 
this pattern was not observed for men, which opens the 
possibility that men may respond to their feelings of relative 
deprivation in ways other than impulsive buying.
My journey
I always had an interest in the application of psychology to 
banking and finance so I decided to continue my education by 
pursing a masters degree in occupational psychology at the 
University of Hertfordshire. I then had the opportunity to apply

1 Do you think it is possible to change a person’s social value 
orientation? In other words, do you think it is a stable trait, or 
would it be responsive to situational variables? It might help 
you to search this textbook, or the internet, to see whether 
some variables can be seen as both stable personality 
variables and as sensitive to the situation or context. 
2 Do you think it would be possible to do so permanently, or 
only temporarily?
3 think about specific strategies that might work in changing a 
person’s social value orientation. For example, you will 
remember from Chapter 3 on social cognition that the 
priming of stimuli can activate particular concepts. What 
stimuli might prime a prosocial value orientation? Do you 
think that doing this would ‘make’ a person more prosocial? 
Alternatively, can you think of other manipulations to make 
people more prosocial? Would norm manipulations (e.g., 
telling people that prosocial norms are prevalent within a 
group) be effective? Could you somehow manipulate 
empathy to influence a person’s social value orientation? 
Perhaps focus on one or two of these ideas, and come up 
with some methods to change people’s social value 
orientation. Or, perhaps you have a novel way of 
manipulating social value orientation. 
4 Finally, how would you measure the effectiveness of your 
manipulation?

software firm pitching to banks and selling services. Six months 
later, I moved into a financial consultancy role working as a 
consultant on various projects for some of the largest financial 
institutions. Psychology has given me many transferable skills 
and the ability to successfully manage people in demanding 
environments. In the future, I aim to earn more responsibility by 
moving up the management chain and, ultimately, I expect my 
company to grow where I am a critical player of its success. the 
plan for this goal is continuous learning and determination – key 
skills learnt throughout my degree.
my project was my own piece of work, which I researched, 
analysed and wrote throughout nine months. During those 
months, I learnt how to be extremely disciplined in managing 
my time around other work commitments. Using SPSS to 
analyse my data allowed me to revisit statistics, skills that have 
aided me in my current role. I was able to be creative in certain 
parts of the project, encouraging me to think out of the box and 
make important decisions. I was surprised to see how well my 
written skills had developed through drafts of the project and I 
quickly learnt that attention to detail is vital. this has led me to 
ensure I proofread more than once. Receiving a first class mark 
for my project has given me the confidence to apply the skills I 
learnt to my job and career.
My advice
I believe my project was successful because I was organized and 
interested in my research proposal. Focus on something you’re 
interested in, and having a supervisor who is helpful is 
valuable. Look at some project examples as they can build a 
picture of what your final piece will look like. Before I started, I 
ensured I had a collection of previous studies and understood 
the literature as a whole. It’s always best to set yourself smaller 
goals and focus on certain headings. I began on the introduction 
first and lastly the abstract. Finally, do your best – there are 
opportunities to get your project published which would look 
fantastic on your CV.

Now that you have encountered the major concerns, concepts and methods of social 
psychology, it is time to take an overview. In this chapter, we consider the wisdom of social 
psychology. In doing so, we outline some overarching principles you can apply not only to your 
study of the discipline but to your future lives. We consider the major limitations of the disci-
pline and the challenges confronting it, and consider future directions for the discipline. Finally, 
we highlight some of the many skills and benefits that students of social psychology take away 
with them and discuss career options and opportunities for students of social psychology.

Questions to consider
1 Imagine you are having a conversation with your friend 
in which you discuss an interesting social psychological 
finding you have just read about – specifically, that 
meat eaters deny mental qualities to animals they 
eat as a way of justifying their meat eating (Bastian, 
loughnan, Haslam and Radke, 2012). Your friend says 
this is rubbish because they are a meat eater and 
they love animals. as an expert on social psychology 
research methodologies, how might you respond to 
your friend’s statement?
2 Imagine reading about another interesting finding that 
people are often influenced by conspiracy theories – 
theories arguing that secret plots and deals determine 
major political events – without their awareness 
(Douglas and Sutton, 2008). Your friend again says that 
this cannot be the case. People would know if they had 
been influenced. Is this true?
3 The discussion with your friend takes an unpleasant 
turn and they say to you: ‘Social psychology is a pseudo-
science.’ What would you say in response?

Social Psychology
As we have seen throughout this book, social psychology has cast light on many 
aspects of human thought, feeling and behaviour. Its insights are being applied to 
help people deal with depression, improve their personal relationships, reduce 
aggression, conserve natural resources, and improve relationships within and 
between communities. Social psychology has informed social debate, raising 
popular awareness of social identity processes, sexism, and system justification 
(e.g., Hanson, 2009). A number of social psychologists have published bestselling 
books outlining what social psychology has to offer to topics such as how to 
persuade people (Cialdini, 2008), how to be happy (Gilbert, 2007), the power of 
unconscious thought (Wilson, 2002) and the limits of classical economic theory 
(Ariely, 2011). 
The contribution of social psychology has been based on a set of unique 
strengths. Compared to other social sciences, it has an emphasis on building 
relatively simple explanations of human behaviour and social phenomena. As a 
branch of psychology, it has retained the virtues of using experiments and related 
methods to test causal explanations of behaviour. Rather like physics, it strives to 
relate the very large and the very small, attempting to explain interactions 
between complex social and political processes and the intimate details of indi-
vidual lives and minds (see Figure 15.1). This means that social psychology has a 
lot to offer to the efforts of policy makers, who are trying to address the social 
causes and cumulative effects of individual decision making in domains such as 
crime, taxation and health. 
By now, you have read about the theories and concepts of social psychology. The 
journey you have been on is not just a process of accumulating knowledge to get 
you through your coursework and examinations. Along the way, we hope, guided 
by your teachers, peers, our writing and the exercises we have suggested for you, 
you have developed a set of thinking and problem-solving tools. In your hands, 
these tools can enrich whatever professional and personal journey you take in the 
future. One of the reasons we have written this chapter is to help you reflect on 
everything you have learned. What are the key insights of social psychology to date?

Social psychology: an overview 
What concepts, skills and perspectives can you take forward into the next phase of 
your lives? We also hope that this chapter will enhance your critical reflection on the 
discipline of social psychology as a whole. In so doing, we hope that your ability to 
critically evaluate specific theories and findings within social psychology will be 
enhanced. This is likely to help you in your coursework, and, in the future, help you 
evaluate claims about human behaviour, relationships and society. 
In the first section of this chapter, we attempt to distil some of the most impor-
tant items of wisdom that have emerged from social psychology. We think all 
readers may find these useful. We also think you are likely to find these items of 
wisdom useful in providing you with an overview of social psychology, consid-
ered both as a body of knowledge and as a set of processes by which knowledge is 
produced. In the second section, we consider some of the most important prob-
lems confronting the discipline. In the third section, we consider some of the 
future directions that social psychology is likely to take over the next years and 
decades. The chapter concludes with a discussion of career and further study 
opportunities available to students of social psychology.
Time to reflect make a list of some of the social issues that can potentially benefit from social psychological 
theories and findings. Jot down a few points to explain why social psychology is relevant and how insights from 
social psychology could help. 
The wisdom of social psychology
Lying behind the many theories that social psychology has produced, and the 
findings that have been obtained, what does the study of social psychology teach 
us? In the following paragraphs, we have tried to distil some of the key pieces of 
wisdom that we feel we have acquired over a decade and a half of studying social 
psychology. We expect that the wisdom of social psychology is relevant to the 
personal and professional lives of just about anyone who has picked up this book. 
We therefore hope that the wisdom of social psychology will enrich your life, even 
if the course you are taking will be your last formal contact with the discipline. In 
the meantime, while you are studying social psychology, we also think that under-
standing its key themes will help you approach specific theories, findings and 
pieces of coursework wisely. 
This could never be an exhaustive list of the insights and pieces of wisdom that 
you can expect to acquire from the study of social psychology. No doubt some 
social psychologists would disagree with some of the items in our list, and would 
want to see other items in their place. Indeed, some social psychologists are 
extremely critical of the discipline and are inclined not to put faith in most of its 
findings. But this list reflects the way we see it. Based on our experiences of doing 
social psychological research, reading about it, and talking to colleagues at home 
and abroad, we think that most social psychologists would essentially agree with 
the following take-home principles.

Social Psychology
Do not succumb to mysticism: social psychology can be studied scientifically
You may often hear it said that psychology, still less social psychology, is not a 
legitimate scientific subject. Love, hatred, envy, sexual desire, happiness, culture and 
personal philosophies are too intangible, intricate or inchoate to be properly studied 
by scientific means. Many people have a strong intuition that the private and unique 
character of each person’s individual experiences make them impossible for other 
people to study. Take the example of love, which we considered in Chapter 7. Intui-
tively, there is no topic more magical, subjective and resistant to scientific analysis. 
But, as we have learned, qualitative methods allow participants to articulate their 
experiences of love and relationships. Self-report questionnaires capture meaningful 
variation in the intensity and nature of love. Correlational and experimental studies 
have uncovered some of the factors that determine how intense love is and how long 
it lasts. However imperfectly or incompletely, even this aspect of human behaviour 
can be explained, scientifically studied and modified. 
The intuition that social psychological topics such as love cannot be scientifi-
cally studied probably stems from two principal sources. The first is the uneven 
reach of introspection. We are aware of many of our thoughts, feelings and behav-
iours, but we lack introspective awareness of many of the psychological processes 
that shape them (Nisbett and Wilson, 1977). In other words, we have a much 
better grasp of what we are thinking, feeling and doing, than why. Our thoughts, 
feelings and actions at any given time may be more or less unique, but the proc-
esses that shape them are, by and large, similar to those that shape other people’s. 
This bias in experience leads people to doubt the existence of many psychological 
processes and to consider themselves as unique, rather than governed by much the 
same processes as other people are. This is a manifestation of naive realism: the 
tendency to assume that one’s own perceptions and judgements are objective, 
comprehensive reflections of reality (Liberman, Minson, Bryan and Ross, 2011; 
Pronin, Gilovich and Ross, 2004; Ross and Ward, 1985).
The second source is a misunderstanding of science. People typically underesti-
mate the uncertainty, imprecision and controversy inherent in science (Miller, 
2001; Osborne, 2010). When scientists disagree, or do not know the answer to 
important questions, they are still scientists. It is true that some unique challenges 
confront the social sciences. As social and cultural forces change, so will many 
aspects of social behaviour. Thus, in social psychology we are studying a ‘moving 
target’ – theories and findings that work in one period of time, in one social 
context, may not work in another. For example, the prejudice and discrimination 
facing racial minorities today is different in many ways from that faced 50, 20 and 
even 10 years ago, and social psychological work reflects these changes. Thus, 
studies of ‘old-fashioned’ racism, in which certain groups were overtly seen as less 
intelligent, are now outnumbered by studies of concepts such as ‘modern’ and 
‘aversive’ racism, which are concerned with the allegedly special treatment that 
minority groups receive (Chapter 11). Further, social science is reactive, in that 
concepts such as self-esteem, prejudice and other variables percolate into public 
consciousness and change the way people think, feel and act (Moscovici, 1988).

has led to various reforms in employment practices and language use in everyday 
life (Chapters 11 and 12). Thus, in social psychology and other social sciences, we 
are also moving the target – our findings and concepts change the way people 
think, feel and behave. But this does not mean that social psychology is not a 
science, or that scientific progress is impossible. 
Exploring further Think of a current topic of scientific debate. This can be anything from the debate over the 
existence of climate change, explanations for apoptosis or ‘programmed cell suicide’, or the debate over the theory 
of plate tectonics – what drives the movement of the earth’s tectonic plates? Such topics have generated much 
interest, heated debate and media interest. But they have also generated a great deal of scientific investigation. 
examine one of these topics for yourself using internet searches and decide whether disagreement and debate has 
made its study any less scientific. 
Be realistic: scientific explanations are incomplete, imperfect and in flux
One thing you must have noticed about social psychology as you have been reading 
this book is that there are often several explanations for the same phenomenon. 
Take aggression (Chapter 13) as an example. We discussed explanations for aggres-
sive behaviour that invoked genes, specific hormones and neurotransmitters, 
gender roles, alcohol, frustration, learning from others, cultural scripts, attribu-
tions, and ideologies. Many of these specific causes of aggression are theoretically 
related to two underlying views of aggression and, through aggression, human 
behaviour more generally. These, essentially, are nature and nurture – the view that 
human behaviour is primarily determined by biologically determined causes 
(nature) or people’s social and cultural experiences (nurture). 
It is important to understand that any one explanation of human behaviour is 
not invalidated by the presence of other explanations. This is true even when other 
explanations are plausible and supported by evidence. This is because human 
behaviour is affected by many causes, including those to be found under the 
umbrellas of nature and nurture, or personality and situation. It is also affected by 
interactions between these causes. Further, the effects of one variable on another 
are typically small. In social psychology, the average effect size enables researchers 
to say that just a little more than 4 per cent of the variance in a dependent variable 
can be explained in terms of a given cause (Richard, Bond and Stokes-Zoota, 
2003). Thus, there is plenty of room for the operation of other causes. To say that 
‘theory X does not explain behaviour Z, because theory Y has been shown to 
explain Z’ is generally not valid, since no theory is likely to explain all of Z. 
Of course, theories sometimes make competing predictions, and can be tested 
against each other. For example, recall from Chapter 13 how social learning theory 
predicts increased aggression among fans of a winning team, whereas the frustration-
aggression hypothesis predicts increased aggression among losing teams. Critical 
tests like this are vital for the development of theory. However, they do not always 
mean that the ‘losing’ theory should be discarded altogether. Often, one theory 
provides a good model of human behaviour under a particular set of circum-

stances, and another theory works better in different situations. For example, you 
may remember that social facilitation explains how people can perform optimally 
in groups when they are being observed or evaluated (Zajonc, 1965), but that 
social loafing explains why people perform poorly in groups when they are not 
being observed or evaluated (see also Latané, Williams and Harkins, 1979) (see 
Chapter 10). As different findings emerge, theories are modified or integrated, 
rather than rejected completely. 
The fact that human behaviour is so adaptable, diverse and changeable means 
that, in principle, findings obtained with one sample, in one context, can easily be 
altered. Introduce different cultural, situational or personality factors and quite 
different, even reversed patterns might be observed. It also means that exceptions 
do not necessarily falsify rules. Thus, it is not a powerful criticism of theory X if 
you, a friend or anyone you know clearly bucks its predictions. (Of course, it is a 
serious, and perhaps fatal problem if people on average do not conform to a 
theory’s prediction.) The flipside is that one can seldom use theory and evidence 
to predict with great confidence what a given person will do in a given situation. 
But when theories of human behaviour are built logically and insightfully, when 
they are tested well, and the results are interpreted properly, you can begin to 
explain and predict what people will tend to do with levels of confidence that are 
vastly superior to chance. 
Question to consider Reread question 1 at the start of this chapter. What would you say in response to 
such a statement?
People are not billiard balls: they interpret and react to influence attempts
One of the reasons that theories in social psychology can explain only a minority 
of the variance in people’s behaviour is that in laboratory studies, as in real-life 
contexts, people are not easily manipulated. In general, autonomy and distinctive-
ness are important to people (Chapter 2). As a result, they do not like to be 
manipulated, and to protect their autonomy, they will often produce behaviour 
change that is diametrically opposed to that which was intended (e.g., Imhoff and 
Erb, 2008; Snyder and Fromkin, 1980). As we know from Chapter 9, this ‘reverse 
psychology’ phenomenon, known as ‘reactance’ (Brehm, 1966), occurs especially 
when influence attempts are blatant or obvious. 
People are generally skilled at detecting when an attempt at manipulation has 
been made, even when the attempt is fairly subtle. When people are motivated to 
cooperate, this can facilitate social influence (Chapter 6). However, many influ-
ence attempts fail because of people’s fundamental desire for control and distinc-
tiveness, coupled with their ability to detect attempts to influence them. This 
unique human skill presents a significant challenge for social psychology. If people 
can so readily detect challenges to their autonomy, how can researchers ever hope 
to achieve attitude or behaviour change? How can they be sure that the attitudes 
and behaviours they are measuring reflect participants’ true inclinations, or reac-
tions against the researchers’ wishes? To complicate matters further, research 

667
Social psychology: an overview 
participants may be motivated to give the researcher exactly the responses they 
want, so that the response set is subject to demand characteristics (Chapter 1). 
Social psychologists need to carefully craft their investigations with these factors 
in mind; as do governments and other agencies, as we suggest in our analysis of 
nudge theory in the Social psychology in the real world box later in this chapter.
This is not the only barrier that confronts attempts to change people’s behav-
iours. Health behaviours, such as diet, smoking and exercise, may be embedded in 
cherished social identities (Tarrant and Butler, 2011). Many attempts to change 
behaviour in domains such as health and the environment rely on fear and other 
negative emotions. These campaigns can be effective, but often trigger anxiety and 
‘threat appraisals’, in which people feel unable to change their behaviour (O’Neill 
and Nicholson-Cole, 2009; Tomaka, Blascovich, Kelsey and Leitten, 1993). 
Social cognition is creative and motivated
Much of the early research in social cognition set out to show that human beings 
are prone to all sorts of mistakes (e.g., see the ‘Heuristics and biases’ section of 
Chapter 3). This programme uncovered many limitations in the way people 
process information. However, in recent years, researchers have demonstrated 
that people are capable of being more rational than these early studies suggested. 
Errors in attribution such as the ‘fundamental attribution error’ may reflect some 
degree of cognitive bias, but also reflect mistakes made by researchers, who did 
not give participants enough information to make unbiased attributions. 
It is also important to remember that people have many goals in life, only some 
of which involve being truthful and logical. Other ‘rational’ goals include meeting 
the apparent expectations of others in social situations, which, for participants in 
laboratory studies, include those of experimenters. This desire to behave in ways 
that seem to be expected can lead people to do bizarre things, such as walking 
more slowly in response to words related to the elderly (Doyen, Klein, Pichon 
and Cleeremans, 2012), and to commit logical fallacies (Dulany and Hilton, 1991; 
Slugoski and Wilson, 1998). Another includes preserving the global coherence of 
one’s belief system, at the expense of local contradictions. For example, people 
who harbour extreme prejudice towards Jewish people may hold simultaneous, 
contradictory beliefs about them – they are believed to be clannish and insular, but 
also rootless and cosmopolitan (Adorno et al., 1950). People who have extreme 
distrust in authority may simultaneously entertain multiple, mutually inconsistent 
‘conspiracy’ theories. So, for example, the more participants believe that Princess 
Diana faked her own death, the more they tend to believe that Princess Diana was 
murdered by the MI6. Likewise, the more they believe that Osama bin Laden is 
still alive, the more they appear to believe that he was already dead at the time of 
the American forces’ raid in 2011 (Wood, Douglas and Sutton, in press). 
This research demonstrates that people forsake one type of ‘rationality’ for 
another, depending on the goals they are pursuing in a specific social situation 
(Fiedler and Wänke, 2009). They do not necessarily prioritize traditional standards 
of truth or logic. People’s ability to choose from standards of rationality highlights

easily and cheaply in a more

by relatively small, subtle 
situational cues.

the creativity of their thinking. Since the cognitive revolution in psychology in the 
1960s, we have known that people do not passively process information received 
from the environment, but instead actively manipulate, synthesize and create 
information in their minds (Baars, 1986; Gardner, 1987; Miller, 2003). In so doing, 
they invest their environment with meaning. Crucially, people’s ability to suspend 
truth or logic as their other goals require means that they tend to believe what 
they want to believe. This basic principle of motivated social cognition is one of 
the core lessons of social psychology. In this book, we have seen how people use 
attention, inference and memory to preserve optimistic views of their personali-
ties, control over life events and future prospects (Chapter 2), their intimate part-
ners and relationships (Chapter 7), their social groups (Chapters 8 and 11) and the 
society in which they live (Chapter 14). Other relevant goals include finding 
people to blame, to defend cherished worldviews, and to stave off the fear of death 
(Chapter 4). It is increasingly clear that processes such as stereotyping do not 
simply reflect the need to take simplifying shortcuts in the face of limited time and 
cognitive resources (c.f. Pendry and Macrae, 1994). They also reflect myriad other 
needs, including constructing a positive image of the self, the ingroup, and justi-
fying the inequalities of society (Chapter 11). 
Reality is socially constructed
Although individuals are capable of much creativity in their interpretation of their 
world, they do not do this unaided. They inherit a vast reservoir of knowledge 
from their culture, in the form of what have been called ‘social representations’ 
(Moscovici, 1988). People not only passively adopt collective beliefs, but also 
actively collaborate to construct them (see Chapter 3). Beliefs, memories and deci-
sions are formed collectively as well as individually (Mesoudi, Whiten and Laland, 
2006; Smith and Collins, 2009). Ideologies that provide a shared sense of what is 
right and wrong, such as political conservatism and liberalism, sexism and racism, 
wax, wane and mutate over time. They change people’s perceptions of what is so, 
as well as what ought to be so. For example, conservatives are less likely than 
liberals to believe that the world’s climate is changing as a result of human activity 
(Feygina, Jost and Goldsmith, 2010). 
Returning to stereotypes, these have been seen as the products of faulty or 
biased thinking, but equally are perpetuated by the biased way that people share 
information with each other (Sutton, 2010) (see Chapters 5 and 11). For example, 
recall from Chapter 5 how people describe the negative behaviours of rival groups, 
and the positive behaviour of their own group abstractly (we are kind, they are 
violent). Conversely, they describe the negative behaviour of their own group, and 
the positive behaviour of rival groups concretely (we hit, they donated) (Maass, 
1999). Recall, also from Chapter 5, how Australian participants in ‘communica-
tion chains’ tended to relay information from stories that was consistent with 
shared stereotypes and to omit information that contradicted stereotypes (Lyons 
and Kashima, 2003). Thus, they passed on details of the oafish, more than the 
poetic, behaviour of football fans. 

669
Social psychology: an overview 
Interestingly, this collective construction of 
reality sometimes seems to be part of an effort 
to serve the collective. For example, biased 
descriptions of behaviour often appear to be 
motivated by perceived threats from the 
outgroup, which motivate people to portray 
‘them’ negatively compared to ‘us’ (Maass, 
1999). However, sometimes people bolster 
socially shared realities in the pursuit of small, 
personal goals such as being understood (Lyons 
and Kashima, 2003) or liked (Clark and 
Kashima, 2007). Here, people implicitly under-
stand that saying things that cohere with, rather 
than challenge, socially shared understandings 
is more likely to help them in their day-to-day 
lives. Likewise, people perpetuate ideologies 
without necessarily meaning to do so, because thinking, feeling and acting in line 
with ideologies helps them solve personal dilemmas and pursue personal goals. 
Thus, conservative ideology may help people to cope with fear and uncertainty 
(Jost and van der Toorn, 2012). Nonetheless, under certain conditions, people will 
take concerted, collective action to deliberately generate, contest and change ideol-
ogies, as we saw in Chapter 12 (Dixon, Levine, Reicher and Durrheim, in press). 
In recent human history, the advent of mass media has accelerated the social 
construction of reality. Recall, for example, the fascinating study by Weisbuch, 
Pauker and Ambady (2009) encountered in Chapter 4. They analysed US televi-
sion shows and found that the nonverbal behaviour of white characters towards 
black characters displayed a subtly negative, avoidant bias. After watching excerpts 
from these shows, white participants’ racial prejudice increased. Television and the 
internet represent an enormously powerful mechanism of social influence, which 
cause millions of people to share the same reality – even in ways they cannot 
consciously recognize. The point that people are not self-contained individuals is 
at the heart of social psychology, and is underlined further by our next point – the 
self-perpetuating nature of social reality. 
Social reality is self-perpetuating
The social psychological experiment is, at its heart, concerned with simple A 
causes B relationships, where independent variables have more or less immediate 
effects on dependent variables. But causal relationships in real life are much more 
complicated. Once a behavioural pattern, a thinking style, or a set of relationships 
takes hold, it tends to perpetuate itself. Habits are one mechanism by which this 
happens. Habits of thought and decision carve neural pathways in our brains and 
hijack or bypass the deliberative mental processes (Verplanken, 2006; Wood and 
Neal, 2007) (see Chapter 4). Distrust (Brewer and Kramer, 1985), loneliness 
(Bartholomew, 1990), aggression (Huesmann, 1986) and inequality (Sutton,

cultural ‘common ground’ 
and ‘shared reality’ that binds 
societies, cultures and social 
groups together.

Cichocka and van der Toorn, 2012) all 
create 
self-perpetuating 
cycles 
of 
thought, emotion and action. As we 
have just seen, stereotypes also create 
self-perpetuating patterns of communi-
cation, causing people to communicate 
information that supports stereotypes 
more often and more abstractly. A 
social psychological experiment in 
which A causes B is always a snapshot 
of some broader, more intricate causal 
process involving A, B and other varia-
bles (see Figure 15.3). 
This means that often, without 
concerted action, undesirable patterns of thought, feeling and action at all levels, 
from the individual, to relationships, groups and societies, are likely to persist. An 
interesting and important manifestation of this self-perpetuating quality of social 
reality is the self-fulfilling prophecy encountered in Chapter 1. Again and again, 
we have encountered evidence that people are prone to behaving in line with their 
own or others’ expectancies (Merton, 1948). When people seem to act in line with 
stereotypes, this is often because they are expected to. We saw this, for example, in 
the research on stereotype threat effects in Chapter 11. If people are conscious 
that they belong to a group that is stereotypically assumed to be worse at a task, 
then their performance suffers. So, women and girls do less well at maths, and 
people from disadvantaged socioeconomic backgrounds do worse at a range of 
academic tests. For example, if people are expected to be kind, or cruel, then there 
is a good chance they will pick up on this effect. If parents think their children will 
grow up to be drinkers, the odds are increased, all else being equal, that they will 
(Madon, Guyll, Spoth and Willard, 2004). In this book, we have seen evidence that 
the effects of alcohol, fatigue and blood sugar are prone to the power of self-
fulfilling prophecies. For example, people who think that alcohol is strongly 
disinhibiting are more likely to become violent when drunk (Chapter 13). People 
who think that self-control is a limited resource are more prone to ego depletion 
effects, in which after exercising self-control for a considerable length of time, 
people show reduced self-control on a second task (Chapter 2). So when people’s 
behaviour seems to confirm expectations, whether in an experiment or in a real-
life context, and whether the expectations are based on situational factors, personal 
factors, group-based stereotypes or ideologies, always ask yourself, could this be 
an example of a self-fulfilling prophecy?

means confined to drug trials. look up mechanisms underlying the placebo effect or find out about the magnitude of

once a social stereotype

communicators recognize 
that the people they are

share that stereotype. They 
then select information 
that is consistent with that 
stereotype (e.g., a story 
about the mindless behaviour 
of a football fan) over 
information that contradicts 
it (e.g., a story about a

selectively communicating 
this stereotype-consistent

lyons and Kashima, 2003).

671
Social psychology: an overview 
The power of the group
Although we are all individuals with our unique characteristics, thoughts, feelings 
and beliefs, the study of social psychology has another clear message: group 
memberships and social identities largely define who we are. This is another way 
in which social psychology punctures the individualistic assumptions of Western 
societies. We are members of groups in almost every facet of life, from our daily 
work (e.g., project teams, research groups) to our social lives (e.g., friends, sports 
groups). When we think and talk about ourselves, we refer to things like our 
gender, race and occupation and the important social identities that make us who 
we are. In turn, these social identities influence what we think and do. As we saw 
in Chapter 8, we are guided by explicit and implicit social norms that provide 
useful frames of reference from which to judge and recalibrate our own behaviour 
in social situations (Cialdini, Reno and Kallgren, 1990). We are also guided by 
social roles such as gender roles (e.g., Eagly and Steffen, 2000; Twenge, 2001) and 
status within groups and organizations – roles that often arise as a result of social 
comparisons with other group members (Festinger, 1954).
It is also clear from the study of social psychology that people need groups. 
Deviant group members who do not adhere to the norms and standards of the 
group are often disliked and derogated (Marques et al., 1988). People who pose as 
group members when in fact they are not (e.g., occasional meat-eating ‘vegetar-
ians’) are dealt with harshly by the group (Jetten et al., 2005). And as we know 
from the research on social exclusion (Chapter 8), being left out of groups – even 
groups we dislike – can have disastrous consequences for individuals’ psycholog-
ical wellbeing (Williams, 2001). Being left out of a group can cause significant 
psychological stress, which – as shown by studies of brain activity – resembles the 
same processes as physical pain (Eisenberger et al., 2003). Once in groups, people 
work together to solve problems and pursue goals that cannot be realized by any 
individual acting alone (Chapter 10). 
The power of the situation
People do not only act in line with their personal attitudes, values and traits. The 
‘power of the situation’ (e.g., Benjamin and Simpson, 2009) was originally demon-
strated by the classic studies of Solomon Asch, in which participants would 
proffer answers they must have known were false in order to conform to the opin-
ions being voiced by other people. This tradition followed in Milgram’s and 
Zimbardo’s shocking studies of obedience and tyranny. As we have outlined in 
our critical discussion of these studies (especially in Chapter 9), they involved 
situations that were carefully designed to manipulate participants’ behaviour. 
Since individuals designed and commanded these situations, just like those of real-
world tyrannies, we cannot blame the situation entirely for the behaviour people 
displayed (Mandel, 1998). 
More generally, different people respond in different ways to the same situa-
tion. Thus, the most comprehensive models of human behaviour are interactionist, 
specifying the interplay between personality and situational variables (Carnahan 

672
Social Psychology
and McFarland, 2007; Haslam and Reicher, 2007; Mischel and Shoda, 1995; Shibu-
tani, 1961). However, these studies remain iconic, vivid demonstrations that the 
situation powerfully shapes our behaviour.
Other lines of research also corroborate this central take-home message of social 
psychology. Every time we conduct an experiment in social psychology, we are 
exploiting the power of the situation to reveal something about why people think, 
feel and act the way they do. Situational factors like a lack of blood sugar (Chapter 
2), the brief appearance of words or pictures related to stereotypes (Chapter 3), the 
body language of the people we interact with (Chapters 4 and 5), standing on a 
wobbly bridge (Chapter 7), the film we have just watched or the game we have just 
played (Chapter 12), and thinking that we have just broken a computer (Chapter 
14) can affect how racist, aggressive, kind, sexually attracted and sexually attractive 
we are. Goals, beliefs and emotions are primed by situations, and our bodily 
responses to situations also play a key role in influencing our responses to them. 
The fact that we can adapt to the situations we find ourselves in is enormously 
helpful to us. Think what life would be like if we were incapable of flexibly 
responding to the different demands that situations place on us. At the same time, 
our responses to situations are often so rapid, subtle and automatic that we do not 
notice them and are unable to control them. It also means that in our personal and 
professional lives, we should not assume that a person’s behaviour in a given situ-
ation reflects who they really are. 
Be conscious of the unconscious
People cannot always tell what influences them (Nisbett and Wilson, 1977). 
Consider the results of an interesting study in environmental social psychology. 
When asked what kinds of messages would cause them to save energy in their 
homes, people thought they would be most responsive to the message that saving 
energy will save them money. But when this message was displayed in people’s 
homes, it did not influence their behaviour. The message that did cause householders 
to save energy was simply the information that their neighbours were doing so. 
Participants had earlier dismissed the idea that this social norm information would 
be enough to change their behaviour (Nolan, Schultz, Cialdini et al., 2008). 
These studies suggest that people cannot always tell what is going to influence 
them. As we have seen, they cannot always tell when they have been influenced 
either. Their attitudes can be changed by persuasive messages (Douglas and Sutton, 
2004, 2008) and other sources of social influence, such as peer pressure, without 
their awareness (Pronin, Berger and Molouki, 2007). This means that situations 
and social systems can alter the way people think, feel and behave in ways that 
escape their attention. As we saw in Chapters 3 and 4, people form and pursue 
goals of which they are not conscious. And as we saw in Chapter 5, people uncon-
sciously hold attitudes towards social objects, including other people and groups, 
which may be at odds with their conscious attitudes (Nisbett and Wilson, 1977). 
Thus, it is important not to be complacent about your own goals, beliefs, 
actions and the things that influence you. You may not think you are being 
changed by the company you keep, the place you work or the media you consume, 

673
Social psychology: an overview 
but this does not mean that you are not being changed. You may not be aware that 
you harbour stereotypes and prejudice, but this does not guarantee that you do 
not. And do not take people’s accounts of their own goals, beliefs and actions at 
face value either. Even if they sincerely want to tell the truth, they may not be able 
to. A final implication of the unconsciousness of human psychology is that we 
should take our intuitions with a pinch of salt. Intuitions can be valuable and 
accurate, but it is not a criticism of a theory, or a finding, that it runs counter to 
our intuitions. 
Question to consider Reread question 2 at the start of this chapter. Just how good are people at detecting when 
they have been influenced by pieces of information? In general, how aware are people of social psychological 
phenomena that determine their thoughts, feelings and behaviours? 
Behaviour matters
Social psychological research suggests that our behaviours have the power to 
influence who we are and what we think. For example, as we saw in Chapter 4, the 
theory of cognitive dissonance suggests that when there is a discrepancy between 
beliefs and behaviours, something must change (Festinger, 1957; Festinger and 
Carlsmith, 1959). Self-perception theory suggests that we infer our own attitudes 
from our behaviour. Thus, you are more likely to enjoy exercising if you make 
large sacrifices to do so, and you are more likely to adopt green attitudes if you 
recycle and save energy. Thus, social psychologists have conclusively demon-
strated that beyond the commonsense understanding that our attitudes shape our 
behaviour, our behaviour changes our attitudes. Social psychologists have 
witnessed similar effects in communication, as we saw in Chapter 5. For example, 
the ‘saying is believing’ effect demonstrates that in articulating an argument for an 
audience, people’s opinions change to become more in line with what they said to 
their audience, irrespective of what they originally thought (Echterhoff, Higgins 
and Levine, 2009; Hausmann, Levine and Higgins, 2008). For example, if we 
dislike a group, saying that we like them (for whatever reason) may subsequently 
cause us to change our minds about them, even if only a little. 
In short, our behaviour is crucial. Not only is behaviour the central means by 
which social psychologists and laypeople alike understand human nature, but it 
also has the power to change what we think and who we are. Therefore, another 
message of social psychology is that it may not always be wise to rely on winning 
hearts and minds – whether your own or others’. One implication of the social 
psychological phenomena mentioned above is that you sometimes ought to ‘do’ 
what you want to be. 
Human beings are not disembodied
In the heyday of the cognitive revolution in psychology (Baars, 1986), and the 
development of computers in the years following the Second World War, the 
computer was adopted as a powerful metaphor for the human being. Like 
computers, humans had a short-term memory (analogous to random access 
memory), a long-term memory (analogous to information stored permanently on

a disk or flash drive), and an executive system, like a central processing unit, that 
organized the whole system (e.g., Boden, 1998; Broadbent, 1987; Neisser, 1963). 
In this view, the fact that the computer runs on a physical platform of silicon and 
the human mind inhabits a brain made of water, fats and other chemicals hardly 
matters. This model of human nature was always controversial. Philosophers such 
as Koestler ([1967]1990) and Ryle (1949) argued that what we call the ‘mind’ 
cannot be sharply separated from the brain, and the entire body, in which it 
resides. Emotions and thoughts are based in bodily events. 
With the passing of time, research has increasingly revealed the social psycho-
logical importance of the body. We are not information processors whose motiva-
tions and behaviours are shaped only by socialization. To illustrate, we are more 
prone to impulsivity and stereotyping when blood sugar levels are low (Chapter 
2), and the extent to which we like other people depends on the movements of our 
arms and facial muscles. Although not conclusive, there is evidence that our atti-
tudes, including our left–right political orientation, are partly hereditable, that is, 
influenced by genes (see Chapter 4). There is strong evidence that aggression levels 
are hereditable in other animals, which means that the same is likely to be true of 
human beings – a conclusion supported by studies of twins (Chapter 13). Different 
aspects of our brains are specialized for aspects of judging other people’s traits, 
emotions and intentions (Chapter 3). The presence of ‘mirror neurons’ has been 
demonstrated in human beings, which cause us to automatically engage in 
empathic mimicry of others (Chapter 4). 
None of these effects are straightforward. They tend to be small and dependent 
on other variables. As we have just discussed in relation to self-fulfilling prophe-
cies, the effects of some bodily variables such as circadian rhythms and blood 
sugar may depend on people’s beliefs about their effects, in a kind of placebo effect 
(Chapter 2). Not only does alcohol lead to aggressive behaviour, but people who 
are feeling aggressive seek alcohol, perhaps because they think it will allow them 
to aggress (Chapter 13). Further, the extent to which we embrace biological expla-
nations for behaviour is highly controversial. One reason for this is that we run 
into severe political problems when we argue that differences between ethnic 
groups (see Chapter 13 on the ‘warrior gene’) and gender groups (see the Critical 
focus box in Chapter 8 on gender roles) are determined by biology, since this can 
be used as a justification of stereotypes and inequality (Reicher, 2011). However, 
the study of evolutionary and biological processes in social psychology does not 
require us to postulate or study biological differences between social groups. 
Setting aside this specific research question, social psychologists cannot ignore the 
biological and bodily basis of behaviour. Research has suggested all kinds of inter-
esting interactions between bodily, mental and social processes.
Some challenges and limitations
Having talked about the achievements, value and potential of social psychology, it 
is important to recognize some of its limitations and controversies. These are 

675
Social psychology: an overview 
important to bear in mind when considering the history of the discipline and its 
future directions. Again, this list by no means exhausts the criticisms that have 
been levelled at social psychology. Our conclusions may be strongly disputed by 
some social psychologists. Nonetheless, we think this is a reasonable summary of 
some of the main criticisms frequently levelled at social psychology as it stands. 
One of the main limitations of social psychological research thus far has been an 
overreliance on so-called ‘convenience samples’ of undergraduate university 
students. We deal with this limitation in the Critical focus box below. 
CriTiCAL FOCuS 
Sampling bias in social psychology
one of the key limitations of mainstream social 
psychology over the past few decades is that researchers 
have relied too heavily on convenience samples of 
undergraduate university students, who are typically aged 
17–25. Sears (1986) found that 82 per cent of studies 
published in three of the leading journals of social 
psychology used student samples (Journal of Personality 
and Social Psychology, Personality and Social Psychology 
Bulletin and Journal of Experimental Social Psychology). 
Reviewing the literature on changes through the life span, 
Sears (1986) argued that this cross-section of society, 
compared to older adults, are likely to have less 
crystallized attitudes and self-concepts, stronger cognitive 
capabilities, and less stable peer group relationships. 
Sears (1986) therefore concluded that sampling bias may 
help explain why so many studies in social psychology 
have found people to be compliant, quick to change their 
attitudes, behave inconsistently with their attitudes, and 
use situational cues rather than introspection to make 
inferences about themselves. 
other authors have added weight to Sears’ (1986) 
troubling critique of sampling bias in social psychology. 
arnett (2008) reviewed the samples found in studies 
published in the Journal of Personality and Social 
Psychology, the most prestigious outlet in social 
psychology. He found that 67 per cent of samples from the 
uSa were students. much has been written about the 
differences between social psychology as it is conducted in 
america versus elsewhere, but this is not peculiarly a uS 
problem. In fact, 80 per cent of the samples from non-
american papers were students. This gives rise to a striking 
statistic. a randomly selected american university student 
is over 4,000 times more likely to participate in a study 
published in the Journal of Personality and Social 
Psychology than a person selected randomly from the 
populations of non-Western countries. This is the most 
prestigious journal devoted to the publication of research 
in social and personality psychology, meaning that the 
most influential findings tend to be based on samples that 
are non-representative of the global population.
If arnett (2008) highlighted the scale of the sampling 
bias in social psychology, Peterson (2001) underlined its 
importance. Peterson conducted a systematic review of 
meta-analyses comparing student and non-student 
samples and found a range of differences. In some cases, 
effects found in student samples were completely reversed 
in non-student samples. For example, Byrnes, miller and 
Schafer (1999) found that in studies of students, women 
showed a greater propensity to engage in risky sexual and 
drink-driving behaviour than men. In studies of other 
sections of the community, men were found to take more 
risks than women (Byrnes et al., 1999).

critique of sampling bias in the behavioural sciences,

Social Psychology
including social psychology. They argue that social 
scientists have grossly overrelied on WeIRD participants – 
WeIRD standing for Western, educated, industrialized, rich 
and democratic. The middle classes of Western countries 
represent a relatively small minority of the world’s 
population but a large majority of the samples in 
published articles. This group show remarkable differences 
to other portions of the world’s population in terms of 
their self-concept, styles of thought and perception, and 
social behaviours. It is therefore difficult to make 
generalizations about human nature across the board on 
the basis of the evidence that social psychologists and 
other social scientists have accrued. This is especially 
important, given that experimental procedures are often 
designed for WeIRD samples and tried out on other 
populations later (Bennis and medin, 2010).
This is a major challenge to the validity of the social 
psychology you have been learning about. However, 
studies have shown that there are some cross-cultural 
universals in human behaviour. We have seen an example 
in the criteria that people use to choose mates (Chapter 7). 
across cultures, men report placing greater emphasis than 
women on physical characteristics (the waist-to-hip ratio 
of 0.70 being an example), and less emphasis on status-
related characteristics such as intelligence or wealth. 
across cultures, people are also willing to make personal 
sacrifices in order to punish defectors in social dilemmas 
(as we saw in Chapter 14). Thus, it is by no means certain 
that a finding obtained from WeIRD participants will differ 
markedly when tested on a different sample. While we 
cannot glibly assume that findings will generalize across 
cultures, neither should we assume that findings will not. 
In forming hypotheses about whether a particular finding 
will apply across cultures, we should be guided by 
theories implying that findings will hold or will differ. We 
should not be overly confident that findings will, or will 
not, generalize until we have tested these hypotheses. 
other things can be said in defence of social psychology 
in light of its sampling bias. For one thing, when you are 
concerned with a specific behaviour characteristic of 
reasonably affluent Westerners, you may not have any 
practical need to worry about whether findings from such 
samples generalize to other people. also, if one has good 
theoretical and empirical reasons to believe that little 
variability should exist across diverse populations in a 
particular domain, then it may be reasonable to infer that 
a process is universal based on an investigation utilizing a 
WeIRD sample. Further, globalization means that more 
and more people in the world find themselves living in 
Western-style cultures with similar economic and political 
models, so it is likely that WeIRD samples have become, 
and will become, relevant to more and more of the 
world’s population (Rozin, 2010). also, some cultural 
differences may be superficially different but have similar 
functions. For example, markedly different cultural rituals, 
such as circumcision, sex acts and debutant balls, may 
fulfil essentially the same social psychological purpose. In 
each of these cases, the rituals are an initiation of young 
people into adulthood (gaertner, Sedikides, Cai and 
Brown, 2010). 
Finally, different experimental results obtained across 
cultures may not always reflect genuine differences in 
psychological processes. Instead, they may reflect 
different interpretations of the experimental task – what 
the task means and what is required of participants. 
Baumard and Sperber (2010) illustrate this point with an 
example from studies of behaviour during economic 
games. In such experiments, people are given money 
and are asked to share it with someone they do not 
know. For a start, both are unusual events that do not 
typically occur in everyday life. many things are unclear 
in such a study. For example, is the money to be given as 
a gift? Who owns it? Who is the other participant and 
what is their right to the money? Such ambiguities 
inherent in the research methodology raise the 
possibility that cultural differences on such tasks are not 
down to psychological differences per se, but are instead 
the result of different interpretations of the situation. The 
authors cite some interesting findings whereby, for 
example, participants from collective hunter-gatherer 
societies are typically generous in economic games, 
perhaps because they see the money as jointly owned by 
the participants in the study. on the other hand, findings 
from solitary horticulturalist societies are less generous, 
arguably because they may see the money as their own 
property and are therefore unwilling to share it. going 
back to WeIRD samples, reluctance to share the money 
may be a result of contextual factors (e.g., living in large 
capitalist societies) and may reflect different 
assumptions about economic games rather than 
fundamental psychological processes that differ across 
cultures. all in all, we think the sampling bias in social 
psychology should be a cause of serious concern, but not 
a total loss of confidence in the discipline.

Social psychology: an overview 
Questions
1 of course, we cite many, many studies in this textbook. 
We do not always describe the samples that were 
recruited. If you pick a random selection of, say, 10 
pages from this textbook (not Chapters 1 or 15), how 
many studies do we describe, and for how many of 
these studies do we indicate whether a student sample 
was employed? 
2 Can you identify a finding described in this textbook, 
obtained with a sample of undergraduate students, 
that you think would be different if it were conducted 
on a different sample? Can you articulate why? 
3 If you wanted to test whether people from a Western 
european country differed from people from, say, a 
North african sample on some variable, let us say in 
their attachment style (Chapter 7), how would you go 
about it? What problems would you expect to 
encounter when designing the materials for the study 
and in interpreting its results?
Exploring further Women now outnumber men by roughly 58:42 at university. This ratio is significantly larger 
among psychology students, who are overrepresented as participants in psychological research. using an internet 
database or search engine, find recent research, published within the last 10 years or so, reviewing the magnitude 
and nature of gender differences. To what extent, and in what ways, are female-dominated samples 
unrepresentative of the population as a whole? 
Narrow methods and assumptions
As you will have noticed through reading this book (and as we discussed in 
Chapter 1), social psychologists use a variety of research methods, but tend to use 
some more than others. For example, experimental and correlational research 
designs tend to dominate mainstream social psychological research. Thus, much 
of our knowledge of social psychology is derived from investigations that use 
similar methods. Social psychological research also tends to employ question-
naires more than any other empirical tool. Researchers who are trained in a 
particular method and perspective are prone to sticking to what they know. Of 
course, most of the time this reflects a researcher’s methodological expertise. Much 
like scholars in other disciplines and professions, social psychologists specialize in 
certain topics and research methods. For example, an experimentalist may not 
attempt a conversational analysis simply because they will not know where to 
begin. However, researchers’ preference for particular research methods means 
that specific research questions tend to be examined in a fairly uniform manner. 
We have seen, for example, that the laboratory experiment has dominated the 
study of prejudice reduction techniques (Paluck and Green, 2009). This raises two 
issues. First, can we be sure that the methods used to examine a specific research 
question are the most optimal methods? Could other methods do a better job? 
Attachment to a particular method may mean that the insights and findings poten-
tially gained by using other methods can be overlooked. 
Another issue is the ecological validity of social psychological studies. Specifi-
cally, many studies attempt to simulate real-life thoughts and contexts and apply 
the findings to non-simulated situations. For example, a significant body of 

678
Social Psychology
research on social power tends to ask people to imagine a time when they were in 
a position of power or one when they were not in a position of power (see 
Galinsky, Gruenfeld and Magee, 2003; Guinote and Vescio, 2010; Guinote, Weick 
and Cai, 2012). We have learned a great deal from such findings, but to what extent 
is it possible to generalize them to real-life situations where people have, or lack, 
power? Similar questions could be asked about research on prejudice, attitudes 
and, indeed, most other areas of social psychology. In general, mainstream social 
psychologists tend to rely heavily on the use of experiments, which often have 
limited ecological validity or take insufficient account of moderating factors in the 
situation or sample. 
Exploring further ecological validity may or may not be an issue in many areas of social psychology. Take some 
time to read around an area such as social power, prejudice or attitudes. To what extent does it rely on experiments 
conducted in laboratory settings? make up your own mind about whether or not this is problematic.
Finally, it is arguably easier to publish social psychological research if it finds 
‘closure’ on a research question and provides the reader with a coherent and 
compelling ‘story’. Again, this phenomenon is not unique to social psychology. 
This publication bias – or tendency to report experimental results that are positive or 
show a significant finding differently from those that are negative – is well known 
across the sciences and social sciences (Rosenthal, 1979). Indeed, it has been 
reported in clinical trials research that statistically significant results are three times 
more likely to be published than research that affirms a null result (Dickersin, 
Chan, Chalmers et al., 1987). This means that many potentially important find-
ings – particularly those that fail to find support for hypotheses – are not in the 
public domain. As an attempt to decrease this problem, some medical journals now 
require registration of trials before they begin so that negative results are not with-
held from publication. However, such a strategy does not exist within social 
psychology at this point. The bias not only applies to research that is published, but 
also extends to work that researchers are prepared to submit for publication in the 
first place. Typically, researchers will not even attempt to publish non-significant 
findings, leading to what is commonly known as the file drawer effect – many studies 
are simply not reported because they either yield non-significant results or yield 
results that run contrary to established research findings (Rosenthal, 1979). It is 
important, therefore, to question whether what is published on a topic reflects the 
truth. The epistemic drive towards certainty could lead to a bias in the way social 
psychologists report their work (Billig, 1996). 
Insufficient attention to behaviour
Attitudes are important for individuals to satisfy their various psychological needs 
and motivational drives (see Chapter 4). So it is unsurprising that attitudes and the 
measurement of attitudes figure prominently in social psychological research. 
However, attitudes are only one facet of social psychology. Behaviours and social 
action are also important. One criticism often levelled at social psychology is its 
Publication bias The tendency 
for researchers to report 
positive results (or those that 
show a significant finding) 
differently from those that 
show negative results 
(or those that show non-
significant findings).

Social psychology: an overview 
overreliance on measures of attitudes over behaviours and social action (Durrheim, 
in press). This reliance on attitudes is largely motivated by practical rather than 
theoretical concerns. It is relatively easy for a researcher to ask someone what 
their attitudes are in an interview or survey. It tends to be more difficult, time-
consuming and expensive to measure behaviour. Therefore, for practical reasons, 
social psychological studies of attitudes are more common than observational 
studies that measure behaviour. A major worry is that researchers are paying less 
attention to behaviour than they used to. Over half the studies published by the 
leading Journal of Personality and Social Psychology in the 1960s and 70s included 
behavioural measures. By the 2000s, this proportion had dropped to something 
like 20 per cent (Baumeister, Vohs and Funder, 2007). In a pithy, witty conclusion, 
Baumeister et al. (p. 402) wrote:
There is no need to stop asking for ratings or analyzing reaction times, but 
perhaps psychologists could all push themselves to include an occasional study 
that includes direct observation of what Knee et al. (2005) poignantly called 
‘actual behavior.’
We are happy to report that since this plea was published, there have been serious 
moves to bring behaviour more into the centre of social psychology. Journal 
editors are increasingly calling for behavioural measures (e.g., Simpson, 2009). 
However, as we know from the research outlined in Chapter 4, there is ample 
evidence from mainstream social psychology that attitudes do predict behaviour. 
So, using attitudes as a proxy for what people do may not always be a major 
problem. Critical social psychologists disagree, arguing that mainstream attitude–
behaviour research is based on a fallacy that attitudes somehow belong to indi-
viduals. From this perspective, attitudes are constructed by people in the course of 
their interactions with others and cannot be studied at the level of individuals. 
Indeed, critical social psychologists argue that the construction of meaning 
through talk is a type of social action (e.g., Billig, 1992, 1996; Durrheim, in press; 
Potter, 1996). We think talk is different from other types of behaviour, and since 
many studies of talk come from specific contexts such as interviews with 
researchers, we are not sure that it necessarily counts as social action any more 
than does (say) the completion of a survey. But it is clear that mainstream social 
psychology needs to pay greater attention to behaviour. 
Time to reflect many attitude scales are subjected to examinations of test-retest reliability. They are taken once, 
and some weeks or months later they are taken again by the same participants. The scores between the two tests 
are then correlated. The resulting indices of test-retest reliability are often impressive, showing correlations of over 
0.50 or 0.60. What does this mean for the argument made by critical social psychologists that attitudes cannot be 
considered to be stable or associated with individuals?
Disciplinary isolation and fragmentation
As we discussed in Chapter 1, social psychology is a subject that bridges some of 
the gaps between psychology and sociology. Indeed, social psychologists and 

680
Social Psychology
sociologists are concerned with some of the same issues and, in the 1940s and 50s, 
social psychologists and sociologists frequently worked together. However the 
two disciplines have become increasingly isolated from each other, as each has 
become more specialized and focused on different methods of data collection. 
Typically nowadays, sociologists are more concerned with ‘macro-social’ varia-
bles, such as social structure, hierarchy, power and historical contexts, whereas 
social psychologists focus more on ‘micro-social’ variables, such as features of 
individuals and small groups that determine social behaviours and outcomes 
(Oishi, Kesebir and Snyder, 2009). 
A good example of the difference in sociological and psychological perspectives 
is to be found in the case of racism. Social psychologists generally regard racism as 
the product of individual-level variables, such as the desire to achieve cognitive 
closure and identification with a racial ingroup, whereas sociologists might look 
for the ‘ways in which institutions encourage racist acts by motivating people to 
behave in a racist manner or behave in a manner that motivates others to do so’ 
(Frymer, 2005, p. 373). Institutional racism is different from individual racism. As 
we have seen, social psychologists do examine genuinely social predictors of 
racism such as group norms and ideologies. However, we typically do so through 
the lens of individual differences in measures of endorsement of these ideologies 
and norms, or in what individuals say in qualitative research interviews. We tend 
not to study the specific practices of institutions (e.g., hiring practices, implicit 
messages in training) and how these affect the psychology of the individual. As a 
result of these issues, it could be argued that a weakness of social psychology is 
that it has lost its concept of the ‘bigger picture’. While it seeks to relate the very 
large and the very small, it does not offer a very rich or detailed account of how 
the two are related by specific institutional and social practices. 
Another area of concern is that there are many ongoing divisions within social 
psychology. One example is the division between American and European 
approaches to social psychology. As a general rule, American social psychologists 
have historically been more concerned with processes occurring at the level of the 
individual, whereas European social psychologists have focused their research 
more on processes occurring within or between groups. The two approaches 
rarely met. This is perhaps less of a concern in more recent years, as increasing 
globalization has allowed communities of scholars to associate with each other 
more effectively. The publication process has also become more globalized. 
American and European researchers are under similar pressures to publish in 
similar journals with similar reputations, impact factors, and oriented to similar 
issues and methods. This has meant that their research has become more similar 
over time (Smith, 2005). 
However, other significant divisions exist within the discipline. For example, 
in Chapter 1 we discussed the ongoing conflict between researchers who conduct 
qualitative research and those who conduct quantitative research. Also, 
researchers in the quantitative tradition tend to be seen either as personality or 
social psychologists. For years, bitter wrangles were fought over the power of the

situation versus personality variables to predict our behaviour (Mischel, 1990). 
This is strange, given that papers in social and personality psychology study 
much the same psychological phenomena and test similar theories. The principle 
difference is simply that correlational methods tend to be preferred by person-
ality psychologists, and experimental methods are preferred by social psycholo-
gists (Tracy, Robins and Sherman, 2009). Also, social psychologists often describe 
the same phenomena and processes in different ways depending on the research 
grouping they come from. For example, the heuristic-systematic model of infor-
mation processing by Chaiken (1980) and Petty and Cacioppo’s (1986) elabora-
tion likelihood model of persuasion describe almost identical processes using 
completely different terminology. Social identity scholars and those closely 
aligned with the more recent self-categorization theory (Turner et al., 1987) argue 
the finer points of both theories that essentially describe the same phenomena in 
very similar ways. 
Exploring further although there is an important distinction between critical and mainstream social psychology, 
which typically use qualitative and quantitative research methodologies respectively, some researchers are involved 
in both types of research. look up some of these researchers (e.g., olivier Klein, Stephen Reicher) and see if you can 
find more. The extent to which the two ‘camps’ are divided may sometimes be overestimated. Some researchers also 
call for a fusion of the two types of research (e.g., Jost and Kruglanski, 2002). 
Divisions within a discipline need not be a bad thing. Dissension can be healthy 
in science. However, there is a tendency to think in ‘us’ and ‘them’ terms, and 
dismiss the validity of alternative perspectives. Here is an example from a recent 
paper in social psychology:
To use evolution as a proximal explanation of human social behaviour is to 
overextend the approach, to take social kinds as natural kinds, and to reify all 
the imperfections and inequalities of our contemporary world … Evolutionary 
theories themselves, lest they be tempted by the prospect of extending their 
explanatory reach, should recall that hubris is the anvil on which every great 
empire is destroyed. (Reicher, 2011, p. 393)
In this book, we have encountered many examples of evolutionary social 
psychology, few of which attempt to explain the social positions or roles of 
different groups in society. More of these investigations concern the ultimate (and 
seldom the proximal) causes of empathy, altruism, love, and the desire for cognitive 
consistency, none of which are directly relevant to the inequalities and systemic 
imperfections of human society. This quote touches on important and legitimate 
criticisms that can be levelled at evolutionary social psychology, but in our opinion 
glosses over crucial distinctions between specific theories within this tradition. 
Exploring further Can you find examples of evolutionary social psychology that are politically dubious, for 
example which suggest that women are less suited than men to high status roles? 

682
Social Psychology
Another example features a similar use of metaphor and emotive rhetoric when 
discussing a rival point of view: 
the field [of social psychology] remains tethered to cognitive constructivist 
assumptions regarding causality … This old view of cognition as being about 
representation is incompatible with the embodied principle of ‘behavior before 
brain.’ (Marsh, Johnston, Richardson and Schmidt, 2009, p. 1217)
Here, advocates of embodiment in social psychology suggest that social psychology 
should somehow liberate itself from the traditional cognitivist assumptions that 
mental representations and schemas are important. The word ‘old’ in this quote is 
pejorative. It means outdated, out of vogue, and wrong. In general, criticism and 
debate are healthy for a discipline, but it is important that the potential contribu-
tions of alternative approaches are not unduly dismissed. 
Exploring further until relatively recently, european and american social psychology were divided. So you can 
see this for yourself, go to the library and find old (e.g., 1970s) editions of a major uS journal such as the Journal of 
Personality and Social Psychology and also select some more recent editions (e.g., 2000s). look through the 
author affiliations. What is the proportion of american to european scholars represented in each edition? Has this 
changed over the years? Do the same for one of the major european journals such as the European Journal of 
Social Psychology.
Academic politics and reward systems
As we briefly alluded to in the previous section, some of the changes in social 
psychology have brought the various different traditions closer together in some 
ways. For example, academics in general – not just social psychologists – are 
required to meet certain performance standards such as publishing in ‘high impact’ 
journals and winning research grants. This brings consistency to academia in 
general – everyone knows what they are supposed to do – but it also creates prob-
lems. One problem is that the field becomes more competitive. There are limited 
numbers of pages in social psychology journals and many social psychologists 
who want to publish their work in the most visible and prestigious place possible. 
Getting published in the more prestigious and higher impact journals is therefore 
a competitive business, which can again expose divisions within the different 
research and methodological ‘camps’ in social psychology. 
The pressure on social psychologists to produce (lots of) high impact work has 
also prompted a recent change in the publication process. In recent years, many of 
the major journals in social psychology, including the Journal of Experimental 
Social Psychology, the British Journal of Social Psychology and the European 
Journal of Social Psychology, have introduced the acceptance of short reports of 
typically less than 5,000 words. While this is positive in some respects, in that 
researchers can quickly disseminate novel findings without the necessity for 
lengthy delays in the review process, and it creates more space in the journals, it 
can also encourage researchers to publish research they have not yet replicated or 
fully explained (note the Ethics and research methods box on replication in 

683
Social psychology: an overview 
Chapter 3). The pressure to publish innovative and novel findings can mean that 
researchers overlook some of the weaknesses of their work. It may also mean, 
either intentionally or unintentionally, that researchers ‘spin’ their research so that 
it is exciting and newsworthy but perhaps stretches the truth. As Jonathan 
Schooler, a psychologist at the University of California, Santa Barbara said in an 
interview with the New York Times (Carey, 2011): 
The big problem is that the culture is such that researchers spin their work in a 
way that tells a prettier story than what they really found … It’s almost like 
everyone is on steroids, and to compete you have to take steroids as well. 
The most unscrupulous response to this pressure is to publish falsified (made up 
or dishonestly altered) data. In September 2011, the prominent Dutch social 
psychologist Diederik Stapel was suspended on suspicion that he had published 
falsified data. A committee report later concluded that he had faked data for at 
least 30 of his publications, including papers in highly prestigious journals such as 
Science, the Journal of Personality and Social Psychology and Psychological Science, 
which have since been retracted. Falsifying data is an extremely serious breach in a 
discipline that is motivated to find the truth. Falsified data not only misleads 
researchers and practitioners but wastes their time, as they seek to replicate and 
extend effects that were not real to begin with. 
Of course, allegations of academic misconduct are not unique to social 
psychology. Neither is there any evidence that the practice is widespread. There are 
serious efforts to reduce the risk that falsified data are going to be published. You 
will find that such problems exist in many of the sciences, social sciences and 
humanities. Dishonest people and pressure to succeed exist in every sphere of life. 
However, as a student of the discipline, it is important to appreciate that the context 
in which contemporary social psychologists work means that their work is not 
always free of bias or exempt from pressure. As we have noted throughout this 
chapter, it is always important to think critically about what you read. This does not 
mean dismissing novel or surprising findings out of hand, and it is not helpful to 
entertain the possibility that a finding is fake. However, bias and sheer chance will 
produce findings that are not robust, and which are nonetheless published. Replica-
tion is always crucial before we place too much weight on a finding. Considering 
the various weaknesses and limitations of the discipline is important too. 
Current and future directions in social psychology
Thus far, we have reviewed some of the great strengths and weaknesses of social 
psychology. In this section, we will discuss where the discipline is likely to go in 
the future. Predicting the future is an enterprise littered with failure. Nevertheless, 
it is possible to identify some of the forces that have shaped the discipline in the 
past and are likely to affect its course in the future. In particular, some factors influ-
ence the things that social psychologists can do. For example, new technologies, 

684
Social Psychology
intellectual developments within the field, new statistics and research techniques, 
and new insights from other fields influence what researchers are able to do, but 
not necessarily what they ought to do. On the other hand, some factors influence 
the things that social psychologists choose to do, or what they feel they ought to do, 
within the changing limits of what is possible. For example, governments, charities, 
businesses and the public are likely to demand certain types of research (on partic-
ular topics). Such factors are typically related to social and economic forces. We 
highlight some of these ‘supply’ and ‘demand’ factors in the following sections, 
first focusing on the use of the internet for research in social psychology. 
The internet
We have already encountered a significant limitation of social psychological research 
to date in that it relies too much on samples of willing and readily available volun-
teers, who are typically university students. In the past decade or so, the internet has 
provided an extremely valuable resource for social psychologists, providing access 
to samples of a size and quality that was hitherto difficult to achieve. Gaining access 
to a reasonably representative sample of, say, 1,000 participants or more has tradi-
tionally required researchers to hire market research and polling companies who 
typically charge significant sums of money per participant. For international 
samples, a great deal of time-consuming and expensive coordination was required, 
involving several groups of researchers. Using the internet, researchers are able to 
mount experiments and surveys online. A great advantage of internet-based studies 
is that they offer access to participants distributed across the globe, and may free 
researchers from overreliance on convenient, but local, samples (Gosling, Sandy, 
John and Potter, 2010). Studies have shown that research mounted on the internet 
produces similar findings to comparable studies run in the laboratory with partici-
pants recruited in traditional ways (Gosling, Vazire, Srivastava and John, 2004). 
Of course, the internet has its limitations as a means of recruiting participants. 
Many research questions cannot, at least at present, be examined in this way 
(Johnson and Gosling, 2010). For example, if you want to study participants’ 
body language, or the way they respond to people in 
the same physical space as them, then the internet is 
not the best medium of choice. Meaningful interaction 
between the experimenter and participants is too diffi-
cult. This may help rule out some experimenter effects 
(Paolacci, Chandler and Ipeirotis, 2010), but also makes 
it more difficult for researchers to get feedback from 
participants about how they experienced an experi-
mental or survey procedure. Such information can be 
an invaluable aid to the interpretation of results and the 
refinement of experiments (Aronson, Wilson and 
Brewer, 1998). When experiments are potentially 
distressing to participants, the lack of contact also has a 
negative ethical implication. Specifically, it is hard for

researchers to discuss with participants the distress and other negative effects that 
the research procedure may have caused. Another downside of internet-based 
studies is that it can be difficult to stop the flow of information from debriefed 
participants, who know what the study was about, to new participants. All it takes 
is for participants to post information on a blog or discussion board, and new 
participants may enter the study with a good deal of knowledge about the aims 
and objectives of the experiment. Nonetheless, the potential to obtain more results 
from larger and more globally representative samples is an exciting prospect for 
the discipline.
ETHiCS AND rESEArCH METHODS
Crowdsourcing social psychology 
although the internet makes it easier to access a potential 
audience of millions, researchers using this tool are 
confronted with much the same problem – how to 
motivate people to take part in their research. apart from a 
minority of people who are willing to volunteer, for studies 
that take up more of participants’ time and require larger 
samples, it is usually necessary to offer some monetary 
incentive. This can be expensive, and transferring money to 
participants over the internet poses logistical and security 
difficulties. In recent years, a promising solution to this 
problem has emerged – crowdsourcing services. one such 
service, amazon’s mechanical Turk, had over 100,000 
subscribers by 2010, who take part in various tasks for 
small monetary rewards. It allows researchers to recruit 
from this pool for payments of less than a uS dollar. The 
subscribers to this service tend to be reasonably 
representative of the population as a whole – somewhat 
more educated, but earning slightly less than average. 
Studies run on mechanical Turk appear to produce similar 
findings to those run in other ways (Paolacci et al., 2010; 
Burhmester, Kwang and gosling, 2011). 
Questions
1 You are asked to evaluate the ethics of a study into 
attitudes to rape survivors (e.g., abrams et al., 2003). 
The questionnaire presents a scenario involving a rape, 
and asks participants to rate the extent to which the 
perpetrator and the victim were responsible for the 
attack. The researchers propose to run their study using 
online survey software and recruit participants 
remotely on mechanical Turk. What are the ethical 
advantages and disadvantages of running sensitive 
studies like this on anonymous online sites, versus 
face-to-face laboratory settings? 
2 Paying people to participate in psychological studies, 
not only on mechanical Turk but in any setting, raises 
ethical issues. Some people see it as akin to a type of 
coercion, in that people who lack money may feel 
compelled to take part (Head, 2009; malouff and 
Schutte, 2005). What do you think, bearing in mind the 
ethical guidelines of professional psychological 
societies? Search ‘ethics participant payment’ to obtain 
a range of views. 
Exploring further Find recently published articles that have used mechanical Turk or some other crowdsourcing 
software to recruit participants. Summarize the three you find most interesting or relevant to your assignments. 
What were the sample characteristics and main findings? Do you think the research would have been difficult or 
expensive to conduct without this service? Do you think that the findings would have been different if they had been 
conducted in a more traditional way such as testing a group of undergraduate participants?

New research tools provided by information technology
Advances in information technology (IT) also provide exciting avenues for 
conducting social psychological research. One example is the technique of data 
mining, which is the process of automatically searching large volumes of data for 
patterns, extracting useful information from large data sets or databases. To give a 
simple example, imagine that a retail department tracks the purchases of a partic-
ular customer and notes that they purchase a large number of shoes. A data mining 
system will detect a correlation between that particular customer and shoes. This 
information can be used by the company to target their sales efforts towards that 
customer in future – they may want to sell them even more shoes or direct them 
towards other products. You can probably imagine how, on a larger scale, this 
technique could be useful to social psychologists. Essentially, data mining allows 
the user to identify correlations or patterns among many different fields in large 
sets of data. One interesting use of this technique can be seen in a study by Thel-
wall, Wilkinson and Uppal (2010), who examined the extent to which emotion 
was present in MySpace accounts (a commonly used social networking site). 
Using data mining and content analysis, they randomly sampled 819 public 
comments from American users, finding that females were more likely to give and 
receive emotionally positive comments than males, but that there was no differ-
ence for negative comments. Although traditionally used in marketing research, 
data mining holds a lot of potential to answer social psychological questions.
Online social networking sites (e.g., MySpace, Facebook) also provide new 
possibilities for social psychological research. Indeed, analysing social 
networking behaviour is becoming increasingly popular in social psychology. 
For example, Buffardi and Campbell (2008) found social networking sites a 
useful forum in which to study narcissism, finding that narcissism predicts 
higher levels of social activities online and more self-promoting content (see also 
DeWall, Buffardi, Bonser and Campbell, 2011). Using social networking sites 
allows researchers to examine differences between online and offline relation-
ships (e.g., Carpenter, Green and LaFlam, 2011), and even changes in personality 
and self-views as a function of internet use (Gentile, Twenge, Freeman and 
Campbell, 2012). At a practical level too, social networking sites allow 
researchers to recruit participants quickly and easily, although perhaps from a 
rather limited sample of younger adults. 
It is also possible to examine spontaneous behaviour on web discussions that 
are largely archived, thus opening up a wide range of data for analysis. For 
example, Bordia and Rosnow (1998) examined the transmission of rumours online 
by studying posts on an electronic discussion board after a rumour had recently 
surfaced about the shady behaviour of an IT service provider. The researchers 
analysed the posts using categories developed from theories of rumour transmis-
sion and followed their prevalence over time. Monitoring the development and 
communication of this rumour online provided the researchers with a novel and 
unobtrusive way of studying rumour transmission – an area that had traditionally 
only been possible to study in artificial laboratory settings (Bordia, 1996). Thus,

Social psychology: an overview 
the archival study of rumour transmission provides a good example of how using 
IT can open up new and realistic ways of examining social phenomena. 
Skitka and Sargis (2005) pointed to other ways in which social psychologists 
have used developments in IT to advance their research. For example, Shohat and 
Musch (2003) studied discrimination by analysing behaviour on online auctions. 
They found that sellers with Turkish names (who are a minority group in 
Germany) took longer to receive winning bids than those who had German 
names. Also notable is research by Glaser, Dixit and Green (2002), who posted 
varying ‘problems’ on white supremacist discussion lists to examine whether 
participants supported different levels of violence depending on the content of the 
problem. They found that participants advocated more violence when the 
researchers posed as someone whose (white) sister was considering getting married 
to a black man, compared to someone who faced competition for a job from a 
black man. In the future, the creative use of technological advances will, undoubt-
edly, allow social psychologists to answer a wide variety of research questions. 
Neuroscience and psychophysiology
As we discussed in Chapter 1, social neuroscience aims to 
understand how biological systems implement social proc-
esses and behaviour. It also uses biological theories, concepts 
and methods to inform and refine theories of social behav-
iour and social processes. Developments in psychophysio-
logical and neuroscientific methods and theories have greatly 
facilitated the study of social neuroscience (see Figure 15.5). 
For example, functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) 
measures brain activity by detecting associated changes in 
blood flow. Recently, this technique has been used broadly in 
social psychology to study topics such as social exclusion 
(Eisenberger et al., 2003), knowledge about the self (Kelley, 
Macrae, Wyland et al., 2002), person perception (Cloutier, 
Gabrieli, O’Young and Ambady, 2011) and cross-cultural differences in the repre-
sentations of significant others (Ng, Han, Mao and Lai, 2010), to name but a few 
examples. Transcranial magnetic stimulation induces weak electric currents in the 
brain using a rapidly changing magnetic field. In doing so, it causes activity in 
targeted parts of the brain, allowing researchers to study brain function. It has 
been used in social psychology to study the experience of emotions such as anger 
and fear (Carver and Harmon-Jones, 2009), responses to emotional pictures 
(Hajcak, Molnar, George et al., 2007) and the relationship between anger and 
aggression (Hortensius, Schutter and Harmon-Jones, 2012).
Advances in existing methods, such as electrocardiography (measuring electrical 
activity of the heart), have also allowed advances in social psychology. For 
example, Vick, Seery, Blascovich and Weisbuch (2008) measured physiological 
responses to stereotype threat and found that cardiovascular patterns for women 
in a gender-biased condition reflected a threatened motivational state compared to

those in a gender-fair condition. Further, enhanced software associated with the 
measure of event-related potentials has allowed social psychologists to answer 
specific questions about brain responses as a direct result of specific sensory 
events, such as distinguishing between automatic and controlled processing of 
emotional stimuli (Hajcak, MacNamara and Olvet, 2010) and cultural differences 
in self-construal (Lewis, Goto and Kong, 2008). There are now dedicated journals 
for the study of social neuroscience (Social Neuroscience and Social Cognitive and 
Affective Neuroscience), plus the Journal of Personality and Social Psychology 
published a special issue on social neuroscience in 2003. This is a rapidly emerging 
field and will continue to be responsive to technological developments. 
Nonverbal and co-verbal behaviour
The study of nonverbal behaviour allows social psychologists to rely less and less 
on self-report data, and to answer a wide variety of research questions. Studying 
social phenomena via nonverbal behaviour also adds ecological validity, since 
behaviour is often being studied in the context of real-time social experiences. 
Technological advances are making this type of research easier and easier. For 
example, electromyography (measuring electrical activity of the muscles), and 
particularly facial electromyography, is increasingly used in social psychology. In 
particular, it has been used extensively to study changes in emotional facial expres-
sions as a result of various social stimuli (e.g., Otte, Habel, Schulte-Rüther et al., 
2011; Philipp, Storrs and Vanman, 2012). For example, Dimberg, Thunberg and 
Elmehed (2000) revealed that when people were exposed to emotional facial 
expressions, they responded with emotional expressions themselves, as measured 
by changes in muscular activity in emotion-relevant facial muscles. As we know 
from Chapter 5, people often unconsciously mimic the bodily postures and 
expressions of others, and using electromyography is a way to measure sponta-
neous changes in behaviour (see also Foroni and Semin, 2009; Halberstadt, Wink-
ielman, Niedenthal and Dalle, 2009).
Eye tracking is another method that can facilitate the study of social psycholog-
ical research questions. This method involves measuring either the point of gaze 
(that is, where a person is looking), or eye movements relative to the position of 
the head. An eye tracker is a device used to measure eye movements and eye posi-
tions and these are interpreted with the help of computer software. One example 
of how this technique has been used in social psychology can be seen in the 
research of Süssenbach, Bohner and Eyssel (in press). They asked participants to 
read a short text concerning a rape case and then view an apparent police photo-
graph of the plaintiff’s living room where the rape allegedly occurred. Their eye 
movements were measured while they viewed the photograph. Crucially, the 
photograph contained two cues that are consistent with typical rape myths – one 
being expected for the situation (wine bottle and glasses), whereas the other was 
unexpected (a poster of a naked man). Results of one study showed that partici-
pants who scored high in a measure of rape myth acceptance (RMA) fixated on 
the expected cue earlier (and for less time) and took longer to view the unexpected

cue. The authors argued that this indicates hypervigilance and greater ease of 
processing. In other words, for people who endorse rape myths to a greater extent, 
it is easier to process cues that are consistent with rape myths (e.g., that the victim 
probably had too much to drink and that rape was therefore unlikely). In a second 
study, the researchers manipulated participants’ levels of RMA, which signifi-
cantly influenced eye movement patterns for the expected cue. Thus, by using the 
method of eye tracking, it was possible for the authors to examine how a social 
phenomenon (RMA) influences visual attention. It should be noted that the 
processing differences were also responsible for judgements of the plaintiff’s 
blame, indicating that eye movements reflect real social processes. 
In a recent study by Callan, Ferguson and Bindeman (in press), participants 
were asked to listen to auditory scenarios that varied as to whether the characters 
engaged in morally bad or morally good behaviours. While they engaged in this 
task, participants’ eye movements were tracked around a set of visual scenes 
depicting positive or negative outcomes. Results revealed that the good behaviour 
of the characters influenced gaze preference for positive outcomes just prior to the 
actual outcomes being revealed to the participants. On the other hand, the bad 
behaviour of the characters influenced gaze preference for negative outcomes. 
These findings suggest that beliefs about a person’s morality encourage observers 
to anticipate the ‘deserved’ outcome as the event unfolds. The findings support 
research demonstrating that people are motivated to maintain the belief that the 
world is a just place in which good things happen to good people and bad things 
happen to bad people (Lerner, 1980) (see also Chapter 14). They also comprise 
another example of eye tracking to study social psychological phenomena. 
As it is becoming easier to study nonverbal behaviours through techniques 
such as electromyography and eye tracking, it is also becoming simpler to study 
co-verbal behaviours, or behaviours that are associated with speech. You may 
remember in Chapter 5 that we talked about the concept of vocal pitch and the 
finding that elevated pitch tends to be associated with lower perceptions of power 
(Scherer, 1979; for a review, see Krauss and Chiu, 1998; also see the Try it yourself 
exercise on this topic in Chapter 5). Enhanced measurement and software tech-
niques allow for more objective ways of recording and coding behaviour such as 
this, which may take the study of social psychology and communication into new 
and exciting directions. Indeed, the measurement of vocal pitch is increasingly 
being used in evolutionary psychology examinations of mate choice and mate 
preference (e.g., O’Connor and Feinberg, 2012; O’Connor, Fraccaro and Fein-
berg, in press). Interestingly, some research suggests that men can detect ovulation 
in women based on changes in their vocal pitch (Haselton and Gildersleeve, 2011), 
so the range of phenomena that may be studied by measuring co-verbal behaviour 
could be vast. Further, traditional qualitative methodologies that have examined 
talk in real time can potentially be merged with mainstream social psychological 
experiments that use these objective measures of behaviour. Overall, the study of 
nonverbal behaviour and technological advances in this area make for promising 
research opportunities in social psychology.

Age
The world’s population is ageing. In 1950, 8% of the world’s population was aged 
60 years or older. This figure currently stands at a little over 10%, but by 2050 is 
forecast to reach 21%. By then, older people (60+) will outnumber children and 
younger adolescents (under 16) for the first time in human history (UN, 2001). In 
developed economies such as in Europe, North America, East Asia and Austral-
asia, the trends are even starker. In the UK, for example, there are currently 10.3 
million people aged over 65, representing some 15% of the total population and 
an 80% increase since 1951. This number is predicted to increase to 12.7 million in 
2018, and by 2035, it is estimated there will be 4 million people more aged over 65 
than under 16 (Rutherford, 2012). 
This fact raises several challenges and opportunities for social psychologists. 
The study of social psychological processes related to ageing will become increas-
ingly important. One important process is prejudice and discrimination against 
older adults, or ageism, which we considered in Chapter 11. Ageism appears to be 
the most widespread form of discrimination in Europe (Age UK, 2011), yet is 
rated as more socially acceptable than other forms of prejudice and discrimination 
such as sexism, racism and homophobia (Abrams, Eilola and Swift, 2009). It is a 
particularly ironic form of prejudice since most young people aspire to live to a 
ripe old age. Adding to this irony, stereotypically associating age with infirmity 
and poor memory can become self-fulfilling, increasing the risk of heart attacks 
and strokes (Levy et al., 2009), and cognitive deficits (Swift, Abrams and Marques, 
in press). Intervening to reduce ageism, by innovative extensions of techniques we 
described in Chapter 12, is an important challenge. This may occur in the context 
of increasing resentment of older adults by the working-age population, which 
increasingly may feel that it is subsidizing their pensions and healthcare. Other 
problems associated with ageing including social exclusion and loneliness (Victor, 
Scambler, Bowling and Bond, 2005). 
Ageing is not only associated with negative outcomes, however. On average, 
older people experience more positive affect and are less egocentric than younger 
people. Rather than being pathologized, a more balanced picture of ageing may 
reveal opportunities for older adults, and society, to exploit the benefits that it 
brings. The older population can be viewed as a resource as well as a burden. 
Exploring further using the internet, can you find examples of other social psychological processes and outcomes 
that may occur with increasing frequency as the population of your country, and the entire world, ages?
Culture
As globalization and technology afford new levels of contact between cultures, 
there is an increasing need to understand how relations between people are 
affected by cultural differences, and how valuable aspects of culture can be 
preserved. The increasing frequency of contact is not only a challenge, but also an 
opportunity. Recent work highlights the benefits of exposure to cultural diversity; 

691
Social psychology: an overview 
it can make people more creative, tolerant and productive (Crisp and Meleady, 
2012; Crisp and Turner, 2011). 
Intercultural contact has other benefits. The accumulated cultural wisdom of 
one people can be adapted fruitfully by people from other cultures. This has 
happened in the case of the custom of restorative justice found among New 
Zealand Mˉaori and some other indigenous cultures (Maxwell and Morris, 2006; 
Sullivan and Tifft, 2006). Rather than focusing principally on punishing people for 
their transgressions, with retribution and deterrence in mind, restorative justice 
brings offenders and their victims together with other vested members of their 
community. The focus is on dialogue, apology and mutual understanding, which 
often includes some element of forgiveness (Braithwaite, 2002; Peachey, 1989; 
Roche, 2003; Wenzel, Okimoto, Feather and Platow, 2008). Some agreed punish-
ment is often a feature of restorative justice, but its main aim is to repair and rein-
force the moral norms of the community (Okimoto and Wenzel, 2009). Informal 
practices of restorative justice – meeting, dialogue, apology, forgiveness – are 
common to everyday life across cultures (e.g., Wenzel and Okimoto, 2010). 
However, as part of a formal justice system, restorative justice is a recent innova-
tion or remains absent from many countries. The concept was tried out in New 
Zealand in the context of youth justice in order to make the justice system more 
culturally sensitive (Morris, 2002). Its practices, such as conferences between the 
families of victims and offenders, have been exported from the shores of New 
Zealand in large part because social psychologists and social scientists stood up 
and paid attention to it. Their research accumulated to show that the practice has 
many benefits, and so it has gradually been incorporated around the world 
(Latimer, Dowden and Muise, 2005; van Ness and Heetderks Strong, 2010). 
Attention to cultural practices has enriched theorizing about justice in social 
psychology and, in so doing, has translated into real-world applications. 
Although we have seen the existence of many cultural universals in social 
psychological practices, there are also many differences that tend not to be empha-
sized in social psychology. An entire field of study, cross-cultural psychology, is 
interested in charting some of these specific differences. Also, psychologists are 
interested in identifying the deeper, underlying dimensions on which cultures 
differ. This means that many cultural differences are organized and explained 
by variables that are universal to human beings. One of these is individualism 
and collectivism, which we encountered in Chapter 2: some cultures are more 
oriented to individuals and their qualities, rights and achievements, whereas some 
emphasize the interests of the collective and the responsibilities of individuals 
(Markus and Kitayama, 1991; Triandis, 1995). Another is an analytic versus 
holistic cognitive style: Western European cultures tend to promote a focus on 
specific objects or features of interests in a stimulus field, whereas other cultures 
promote attention to the whole stimulus field and the relationships between 
them. As we saw in Chapter 13, cultures also differ in the extent to which the 
honour of families and individuals is valued (Nisbett and Cohen, 1996), how 
religious they are and how hierarchical they are (Jeffries, Hornsey, Sutton et al.,  

692
Social Psychology
2012; Shavitt, Torelli and Riemer, 2010). These cultural differences mean that some 
of the most well-known effects in social psychology, such as the hindsight bias 
and the fundamental attribution error (see Chapter 3), are not to be found in many 
of the world’s cultures (Nisbett, Peng, Choi and Norenzayan, 2001). 
Exploring further access the table of contents of the leading specialist journal, the Journal of Cross-Cultural 
Psychology. Sample the titles and abstracts of a few issues. What trends do you notice? For example, which cultures 
are most often compared? 
Research on culture is not only gathering momentum but is taking new 
perspectives. One new perspective is indigenous social psychology. Overlapping 
with anthropology, this variety of social psychology puts culture at the forefront 
of investigation. It is interested in investigating cultural practices and concepts 
that are not acknowledged by mainstream social psychology. It implies that not 
only the content but the methodology of social psychology may need to be modi-
fied or reinvented to make investigations pertinent to particular cultures (Adair, 
2005; Moghaddam, 1987; D. Sinha, 1984, 1997; J. Sinha, 1984). Another newer 
perspective on culture is to examine not how culture shapes, but how it is shaped 
by, everyday thoughts, feelings, behaviours and relationships. Over time, for 
example, the gossip and stories we exchange in everyday life shape and strengthen 
stereotypes and shared understandings of right and wrong (Boyd and Richerson, 
1985; Kashima, 2000; Schaller and Crandall, 2004). Culture depends on everyday 
enactment and renewal, and on transmission between generations, and in this 
sense is constantly being produced and reproduced. Further, recent research 
suggests that daily exposure to specific cultural practices also causes culture to 
become hard-wired into the brain. So, for example, there are identifiable brain 
differences between those immersed in independent (individualistic) as opposed 
to interdependent (collectivist) cultures (Kitayama and Uskul, 2011). 
Social psychology and you
We have already described some of the main points of wisdom that arise from the 
study of social psychology. More generally, however, the study of social psychology 
has the potential to change you, as a person. It may even change you for the better, 
even if you are not aware of the changes. In this section, we outline some of the 
main skills and attributes you can expect to have acquired, and should consider 
acquiring, as you study social psychology. Specifically, we outline some of the 
transferable skills you will be able to take with you into your careers. More gener-
ally, we talk about career prospects for students of social psychology. 
Critical thinking skills
One of the major differences between social psychology as opposed to, say, cell 
division, organic chemistry or particle physics is that people with no training in 
the discipline have a rich array of knowledge, beliefs and investments in its subject 

693
Social psychology: an overview 
matter. There are far fewer discussions in taxis and family gatherings about RNA, 
oxalic acid and gluons than there are about social influence (e.g., celebrity culture, 
peer pressure), intergroup processes (e.g., racism, gender roles), justice and rela-
tionships. We touched on this at the beginning of Chapter 1, when we discussed 
the popular debate about the causes of riots and social disorder. All sorts of people 
have an opinion and are often prepared to voice them in strong and unqualified 
terms, despite their lack of professional or scientific expertise. 
In short, people think they know a lot about the things that social psycholo-
gists study; and, in many respects, they do. Years of personal experience, millennia 
of culture, and perhaps the biological inheritance of specific social skills and 
understandings equip us with a rich knowledge about minds, relationships and 
social systems that allow us to navigate through social life (Fletcher, 1995; Malle, 
2005, 2008). This knowledge, however, has important limitations. As we have seen 
time and time again, people are often completely unaware of the situational forces 
and the psychological processes that influence them (Chapter 3). People overesti-
mate the significance of personality variables and attitudes in shaping behaviour. 
They are surprisingly unable to predict their own emotional reactions to life 
events or the behaviour of others. 
One of the reasons that laypeople’s beliefs about social psychology can be so 
limited and wrong is that they are not informed by research findings. Theories in 
the discipline of social psychology are informed and constrained by systematically 
obtained and evaluated evidence in ways that the theories of laypeople are not. As 
you know well by now, social psychological research has thrown up a lot of 
surprising findings. Recall Milgram’s (1961) observation of striking levels of 
compliance with instructions to deliver apparently excruciating, dangerous and 
even lethal doses of electricity to an innocent stranger (Chapter 9). Roughly two-
thirds of participants went all the way, flatly contradicting the intuition – even 
social scientists’ intuition – that only a tiny minority of people would do this 
(Milgram, 1965). These results not only falsify specific intuitions about what 
people would do in a particular experimental task. They also pose an immense 
challenge to general notions about the resistance of the individual to obedience, 
the power of norms, values and attitudes to constrain behaviour, and, ultimately, 
the view that the perpetrators of group-based atrocities must have been exception-
ally evil people. Of course, we saw in Chapter 9 that there has been considerable 
and renewed debate about exactly what these findings mean. Nonetheless, they 
have profoundly transformed social psychological theorizing about human nature 
and the specific causes of human behaviour. 
Finally, as we have seen, laypeople’s claims about what people do, and why 
they do it, are often motivated. To some extent, people believe what they want to 
believe, as we saw in our coverage of the concept of motivated social cognition in 
Chapter 3 (but also see in almost every other chapter in the book). People tend to 
believe claims that support their own self-image (Chapter 2), the superiority of 
their ingroup (Chapter 11) and their preferred ideological position, which often 
entails the perpetuation of the social status quo (Chapter 14). Finally, of course, 

694
Social Psychology
people (often on behalf of the companies, governments or other vested interests 
they represent) make claims about social and psychological phenomena they do 
not necessarily believe, because they are trying to influence you (Chapter 6). 
Therefore, before accepting any claim about human behaviour, you should 
evaluate it carefully. Claims of fact, and explanations of fact, should be clear, unam-
biguous and testable. Before accepting them, you should consider whether they are 
supported by evidence and logic. These criteria are seldom met in everyday discus-
sions about relationships, motivations, social problems, or anything else impinging 
on social psychology. If you hold on to what you have learned in the study of this 
discipline, and recall some of the key messages of social psychology reviewed in 
this chapter, you are well equipped to be an informed sceptic, applying new levels 
of critical thinking skills to your everyday and professional life. Learning to think 
critically in one domain, such as social psychology, will help you think critically in 
all areas of your life (Sá, West and Stanovich, 1999). 
While you continue to pursue academic study, you will also encounter over-
blown, unsupported and illogical claims. Academic ideas are sometimes marketed 
with terminology that is greatly out of step with the evidence that supports them. 
Recall, for example, the ‘warrior gene’ hypothesis encountered in Chapter 13. To 
have the ‘warrior gene’ is not to be consigned by one’s DNA to a life of violence, 
but is to be one of 34 per cent of ethnically Caucasian people. Academic claims are 
usually much less silly than this, but there is almost always room for critical doubt 
about whether claims hold up in the light of evidence, and whether evidence is not 
subject to alternative interpretations. In the Critical focus boxes of each chapter, 
we have encountered theoretical claims that are open to question. For example, in 
Chapter 5, we critically examined whether facial expressions are culturally deter-
mined, having evolved over the millennia, while in Chapter 8, we did much the 
same thing for gender roles. In Chapter 9, we critically evaluated the long-accepted 
hypothesis that the presence of other people inhibits the tendency of the indi-
vidual to help a victim. 
If someone says that contact benefits intergroup relations (Chapter 12), ask, is 
this based on correlational or experimental evidence? A negative correlation between 
contact and prejudice proves little, because very often, 
people who are less prejudiced towards an outgroup are less 
averse to contact with it. Thus, more contact does not neces-
sarily mean less prejudice. Experiments in which people are 
found to have lower prejudice after contact with the 
outgroup than a control group who have not had the contact 
provide much stronger evidence of causality. But even then, 
manipulations of contact in these experiments may not be 
realistic models of contact in everyday life (see Figure 15.6). 
The dependent measures in these experiments may omit or 
misrepresent the effect that contact has in natural settings. 
As these examples suggest, there are many reasons to 
question what we read and hear about in social psychology. 
FigurE 15.6 Contact benefits 
intergroup relations Research 
associated with the contact 
hypothesis demonstrates 
that people become less 
prejudiced if they have 
contact with the outgroup. 
The study of social psychology 
encourages students to think 
critically about such findings 
and the studies from which 
they were found. ultimately, 
you can decide for yourself, 
based on the evidence 
and arguments, if contact 
really makes a difference 
to prejudice and intergroup 
relations more generally. 
Sometimes, essay questions 
will ask you to critically 
evaluate research in an area 
such as this, so it is always 
good to think critically about 
everything you learn.

Social psychology: an overview 
Even the most rigorously designed experiments cannot, and should not, escape 
scholarly enquiry and scrutiny. As a student of social psychology, you are there-
fore encouraged to evaluate what you learn critically, take it apart (argument, 
findings, interpretations and conclusions), and critically appraise everything you 
learn. In doing so, you will have a clearer picture of a research topic and will take 
an important skill with you into the next phase of your lives. 
Critical thinking is often a difficult concept to define, but it embraces the ability 
and willingness to analyse arguments or evidence (break them down into parts, to 
categorize them), synthesize them (to incorporate multiple pieces of evidence into 
one argument, or to put together aspects of different arguments), and evaluate 
them (to determine whether arguments are logical, and evidence is sound) 
(Moseley, Elliott, Gregson and Higgins, 2005). Griggs, Jackson, Marek and Chris-
topher (1998, p. 256), after reviewing many definitions of critical thinking, describe 
it in these terms:
a process of evaluating evidence for certain claims, determining whether 
presented conclusions logically follow from this evidence, and considering 
alternative explanations. Critical thinkers exhibit open-mindedness, tolerance 
of ambiguity; and a sceptical, questioning attitude.
Time to reflect It is interesting that critical thinking is often defined in terms that incorporate some of the social 
psychological constructs we have encountered in this book, including open vs. closed-mindedness and tolerance of 
ambiguity (Chapters 4 and 11 respectively). This illustrates how the study of social psychology is reactive – ideas 
from social psychology percolate into other disciplines, such as education, and ultimately into public consciousness. 
Strikingly, although these constructs are not inherently political, they have political implications in practice. as we 
saw in the Social psychology in the real world box in Chapter 4, people who are closed-minded tend to be more 
right-wing. So, let us consider a controversial question. Could this explain why professional social scientists tend to 
be left-wing, rather than right-wing (Cardiff and Klein, 2005; Klein and Stern, 2005; Tierney, 2011)? and can it 
explain why left-wing social scientists tend to win promotion more quickly than right-wing social scientists 
(Rothman, lichter and Nevitte, 2005)? What we mean is that the predominance (and pre-eminence) of left/liberal 
academics may stem from an association between their political orientation and an open-minded, integrative 
thinking style that is likely to lend itself to successful research. 
We think a crucial element of critical thinking is also informed thinking – the 
ability not just to do things with information, but to find information (Halpern, 
1998). This is why we have included so many exercises in this textbook that require 
you to find information for yourself – including academic papers but also all sorts of 
other information. In your critical thinking about issues touching on social 
psychology, it is always useful to bear some of its key messages in mind. For example, 
considering what the evidence is for a claim, since claims about human behaviour, 
emotion and society should be testable and can be tested, is crucial. Looking past the 
surface differences between people and groups is also crucial, and considering criti-
cally what social and mental processes might produce them is important too. In a 
much-cited paper on critical thinking, Halpern (1998) also suggests some practical 
techniques for enhancing your critical thinking skills as a student:

696
Social Psychology
1 Draw a diagram or other graphic display that organizes the information: This 
can make the structure of a problem or argument clear. 
2 Ask: ‘What additional information do I need before answering the question?’: 
Sometimes, you need further information to interpret the question (e.g., to read 
about the theory you are being asked to evaluate), but you always need to 
locate the information that will enable you to begin answering.
3 State the problem you are trying to solve (e.g., an essay question) in at least two 
ways: A lot of essay questions, and especially a lot of interesting and important 
real-world problems, are rather open-ended. Seeing the problem from different 
perspectives, and being able to find ways to narrow it down, is an essential part 
of critical thinking (Buunk and van Vugt, 2008). 
4 Ask which information is most important, and which is least important: This 
focuses your mind on the value of different sorts of information, such as 
research findings versus anecdotes. 
5 Categorize research findings in a meaningful way: Grouping findings together or 
labelling them will often help you notice underlying similarities and differences. 
6 List two solutions for a problem. Present two arguments that support a conclusion 
and two that do not support a conclusion: Halpern’s (1998) suggestion is that you 
should entertain both sides of an argument. This may lead you to adopt some 
new, third position, because you can see the limitations of both sides. Even if 
you come down clearly on one side of an argument, you will be in a much better 
position to defend your preferred side from counterarguments and apparently 
contradictory evidence. In Chapter 14, we saw an excellent example of this from 
Manning, Levine and Collins (2007). Applying Billig’s (1996) dialectic approach 
to knowledge, they suggest that a useful approach to social psychology is that 
any given argument ‘should be haunted by the possibility (at least) of the oppo-
site’. This is an excellent basis for critical thinking, especially about theory, in 
social psychology. It encourages you to think about how the results of a study 
could have been completely different if something about the context, the inde-
pendent variables or the dependent variables were different. 
7 Ask what two actions would you take to improve the design of a study that was 
described: As we have seen in this chapter, sampling characteristics can be an 
important source of bias in studies. But, equally, in our experience, students 
sometimes focus too much on the sample when critically evaluating studies, or 
on the fact that a study was done in the laboratory, at the expense of other 
important characteristics of a study. In particular, as we saw in Chapter 1, it is 
always important to consider whether the manipulations and measures of 
experiments really reflect the variables they are supposed to represent. Might 
something other than the intended variables be reflected in the scores? One 
example of this is the confound in twin studies, intended to study the effects of 
genetic similarity on ideologies or behaviour (e.g., Chapter 4 on the apparent 
heritability of ideology, and Chapter 13 on the apparent heritability of aggres-
sion). The confound is that genetic similarity is associated with environmental 
similarity: people who look identical and are equally physically attractive, for 
example, are treated more similarly. 

697
Social psychology: an overview 
Exploring further as part of your social psychology training, you will be invited to work on your critical thinking 
skills. You will learn to read research articles and book chapters, and critically evaluate the claims being made. as you 
read social psychology material, you will notice different styles of writing and different ways of making claims. For 
example, some sources report empirical findings and the authors make claims based on the objective data they have 
collected. others write book chapters, which are partly based on research data while some of the claims are made 
from extrapolating from data and/or are formed from personal opinions and experiences. as a student of social 
psychology, it is important to be able to separate fact from interpretations, which can be subject to bias. To help you 
understand this process, read two to three different newspaper reports on the same topic (e.g., an event such as the 
9/11 attacks on the World Trade Center or the 2011 uK riots). Identify the factual claims made in the articles. after you 
have done this, identify the claims that are based not on facts but on interpretation or personal opinion. What can you 
conclude from these articles? are the articles significantly different from each other and which one do you believe 
holds the most weight? How do factors such as the credibility of the source also influence your judgement? 
Psychological literacy
The study of social psychology equips the learner with what is known broadly as 
psychological literacy. According to McGovern, Corey and Cranney et al. (2010, p. 
10), psychologically literate citizens are ‘critical scientific thinkers and ethical and 
socially responsible participants in their communities’. Thus, critical thinking is a 
key aspect of psychological literacy. Other aspects of psychological literacy are 
presented in Table 15.1 (see also Cranney and Dunn, 2011). Although we will not 
cover all these in this chapter, we will draw out some key 
examples and highlight their relevance to social psychology.
Technological, research and statistical skills
Throughout your studies, you will (if you have not already) 
become familiar with some more advanced IT skills. Your 
work will be produced via word processing and spread-
sheets, much of your literature search will be conducted 
through academic search engines and databases, you may 
develop research materials using online questionnaire soft-
ware or crowdsourcing techniques, and you will analyse 
data using statistical software packages. You will learn to 
retrieve relevant information for your essays and reports 
and handle the information critically (see above). You will 
learn to solve complex problems. Further, you will learn a 
wide range of data collection techniques, both qualitative 
and quantitative, as described in Chapter 1, as well as a 
broad range of data analytic techniques. You will learn to 
understand, analyse and present complex data effectively. 
Exploring further Social psychologists use a range of methods and data analytical techniques. The next time you 
read a social psychology paper, pay special attention to the research method they used and how they analysed their 
data. Could they have conducted their investigation differently?

Understanding diversity
Studying social psychology will equip you with a strong understanding of the 
issues raised by increasing social and cultural diversity in modern societies. It will 
help you understand the processes that have shaped modern societies and the 
diversity issues (e.g., immigration and multiculturalism) they are currently facing. 
It will equip you with a broad understanding of intergroup relations, which, in 
understanding diversity, involves studying what happens when people migrate 
from one place to another, how they adapt or acculturate, and how ‘host’ cultures 
are influenced by their presence. You will have a solid understanding of how 
inequality and prejudice work. Thus, the study of social psychology will give you 
a practical understanding of diversity issues as they exist where you live. 
Connection between science and wider social and policy debates
Much of social psychology relates to real-life questions and problems. For 
example, how do we explain and reduce prejudice? Why do people deny the exist-
ence of climate change? In examining questions such as these that have wide 
implications for society, social psychologists have the opportunity to inform 
policy. Indeed, there are many cases where social psychological findings have 
directly informed public policy. For example, Carol Dweck’s research on how 
children respond to feedback in educational settings has brought about changes in 
the way children are taught to think about their own intelligence and abilities. 
Specifically, this work has helped practitioners understand what kinds of praise 
and criticism help students to stay motivated and focus on their learning. Her 
intervention – the ‘Brainology’ program – has been implemented widely across 
the USA in an effort to promote children’s motivation and achievement (see the 
Social psychology in the real world box in Chapter 1). Further, in 2007 a team of 
UK and European social psychologists led by Greg Maio worked with the UK 
government to tackle obesity and inform interventions for people to make lifestyle 
changes. These are only two examples of the many ways that social psychologists 
contribute their expertise to important social issues. 
SOCiAL PSYCHOLOgY iN THE rEAL WOrLD
Nudge theory
In July 2010, the British government established a 
Behavioural Insights Team to ‘find intelligent ways to 
encourage, support and enable people to make better 
choices for themselves’ (Cabinet office, 2012, p. 3). The 
idea behind the initiative is to bring about significant 
changes in society (e.g., increased organ donation, 
environmental consciousness and healthier eating) by 
applying insights from behavioural science – and, to a 
large extent, social psychology – to influence people’s 
behaviour in inexpensive, non-coercive ways. This 
initiative is influenced by ‘nudge theory’, which was 
advanced by Thaler and Sunstein (2008) in a popular book. 
Nudge theory may not qualify as a ‘theory’ in the normal 
social psychological sense of the word. For example, it 
does not put forward a unique set of psychological 
processes to explain social behaviour. Neither does it 
generate a unique set of predictions that allow it to be 

699
Social psychology: an overview 
tested. Nonetheless, it is an interesting collection of ideas 
about how to apply the lessons of social psychology and 
other approaches to human behaviour.
Nudge theory builds on several of the central insights 
of social psychological research; for example, that much of 
behaviour is shaped by unconscious processes and does 
not live up to commonly understood standards of 
rationality. Thaler and Sunstein (2008) point out that 
governments typically attempt to influence behaviour by 
coercing people, via laws and regulations, or else by 
appealing to rationality. For example, tax agencies point 
out that dire consequences will follow if people do not file 
their tax returns, and health agencies highlight the 
consequences of overeating. The central idea of nudge 
theory is that these interventions have limited impact 
precisely because deliberative, conscious thinking is not 
the only shaper of our behaviour, and that unconscious, 
reflexive psychological processes are often equally or 
more powerful (see Chapters 3 and 4). Thus, small 
behavioural interventions or ‘nudges’ might elicit the 
kinds of behavioural changes that governments have 
been struggling to achieve. 
In 2012, the uK government published the results of 
several randomized experimental trials to test some ideas 
based on this broad, ‘nudge’ perspective on behaviour 
change. The results are generally promising, although 
they have not yet been subjected to peer review and 
published in academic journals, and several were ‘interim’ 
results. In one trial, a letter to taxpayers sent by HmRC, the 
uK government tax office, was experimentally 
manipulated. Taxpayers received either a traditional letter, 
in the control group, or messages in which social norms 
(see Chapter 5) were highlighted. Specifically, the letter 
said that ‘9 out of 10 people in Britain pay their tax on 
time’. additional variants of the letter stated that most 
people in the taxpayer’s postcode, or town, had already 
paid. These letters had the desired effect, increasing the 
extent to which people paid tax – from 67.5 per cent in the 
control group to 83 per cent in the most successful 
experimental group. 
as an approach to social policy, this has several 
strengths. It is evidence based, using experimental 
methodology to test the success of interventions. It takes 
account of research and theory in social psychology, rather 
than relying on the intuitions of government staff or 
consultants. However, it is not without its problems and 
controversies. These are laid out in some detail in a report 
commissioned by the uK Parliament (House of lords 
Science and Technology Select Committee, 2011). This 
involved interviews with more than 80 witnesses from 
academia and the civil service, including noted social 
psychologists such as gregory maio and geoff Haddock 
(whose work you will find cited in this book). The gist of 
many of the criticisms is that ‘nudging’ people is unlikely 
to work on its own. Social problems are not just 
attributable to individual behaviour. obesity is a case in 
point. although ‘nudge’ interventions focus on simplifying 
the communication of dietary information, or placing fatty 
foods in less obvious places in school tuck shops, obesity is 
an endemic problem in Western societies, caused not just 
by bad decision making by individuals, but by the 
convenience of public transport, long working hours and 
food production (e.g., Roberts and edwards, 2010; 
Swinburn et al., 2011). Too much focus on ‘nudging’ 
individuals is likely to have little effect in the light of these 
larger forces, and may indeed mislead people as to the 
causes of obesity. 
another problem is although people are far from 
perfectly rational, or perfectly conscious, important life 
decisions and long-lasting behaviour changes are often 
accompanied by systematic conscious thought. Witness, 
for example, the importance of chronic egalitarian 
motivations in reducing prejudice that we saw in Chapter 
12. actively trying not to be prejudiced, over the long run, 
appears to be effective. also consider how long-term 
persuasion often requires the systematic presentation of 
logic and evidence, in the so-called ‘central route to 
persuasion’. In contrast, short-term, one-shot 
interventions such as nudges may not be enough to 
induce lasting change. Still, on balance, it seems to us that 
in conjunction with regulations and other tools of social 
policy, a focus on properly evaluated, carefully designed 
behavioural interventions such as ‘nudges’ have a 
promising role to play. 
Questions

accessible.pdf. It is an interesting read for students of 
social psychology who are interested in how its 
insights are being applied by governments. Some 
results appear to be quite promising, but many do not 
seem to support the starting assumptions of the

Social Psychology
researchers, and show that ‘nudges’ designed with 
social psychological principles in mind do not always 
work. You should read it with a critical mindset, both in 
terms of whether the results support the claims being 
made and whether the interventions are being tested 
with appropriate methodologies. 
2 Take a close look, for example, at the methodology 
employed in Trial 6. looking at the results displayed in 
the graph, does the trial appear to have been a 
success? looking at the results, what are the 
experimental conditions in this trial? How many 
changes do there seem to be in the letters, between 
conditions? If there is more than one change between 
any two conditions, then there is a confound, and it is 
impossible to determine exactly why results are 
different – or the same – between the two conditions. 
3 We can see trials like these as applications of social 
psychology. However, we can also see them as 
extensions of social psychology, in that they add to 
what we know about people’s social cognition, 
attitudes, emotions and behaviours. assuming trials 
like this are well conducted, what specifically might 
they offer to social psychology? 
Try it yourself Imagine that you are an employer and you have recently moved your staff to a new office. Your 
employees have a habit of eating lunch at their desks, which makes the office messy. You would rather they didn’t do 
this in the new office. You are trying to work out how best to make this request of your employees. Write down a list 
of things you might say or do. Which are the most likely to succeed? Why? 
Exploring further Research ‘impact’ is becoming increasingly important in academia. governments, who typically 
fund academic research, need to know that their funds are being used for research that makes a difference in some 
way. This is not to say that non-applied (basic) research has less value. of course it does and the insights gained from 
basic social psychological research continue to increase our knowledge of many facets of human social processes. 
This is called ‘academic impact’. However, as we have discussed throughout this chapter, social psychology can make 
a difference to society in many ways too. as an exercise to help you appreciate this contribution more, take some 
time to look for examples of social psychological impact on social policy. Think of a topic (e.g., prejudice, persuasion, 
healthy eating, climate change, any issue you can think of) and spend some time researching social psychologists’ 
social or policy impact on these topics. 
Social psychological findings are also frequently reported in the media and 
contribute to debates about prominent social issues. If you conduct an internet 
search on the names of prominent social psychologists, it is very likely that you 
will come across media reports highlighting and debating their findings. For 
example, several social psychologists commented on the UK riots in 2011, talking 
about topics such as crowd behaviour, aggression and gang violence (Reicher and 
Stott, 2011). Others have contributed to the public debate on climate change, and 
social psychologists frequently offer their expertise on public debates related to 
prejudice and persuasion and other topics such as domestic violence. A great deal 
of social psychological research deals with issues that are relevant to people’s 
everyday lives and so it has great potential to engage the public with science and 
scientific findings.

Social psychology: an overview 
Communication skills
Studying social psychology provides students with 
an opportunity to develop communication skills. 
Effective communication involves developing a clear, 
logical argument that is supported by relevant 
evidence and written in an appropriate style for its 
audience. Throughout your degree, you will have the 
opportunity to develop these skills through experi-
ences such as making oral presentations to groups. 
However, for the most part, social psychology work 
involves writing. Your studies will therefore enable 
you to develop your written communication skills. 
By the end of your degree, you should be able to 
present an argument effectively. Of course, some 
people write more fluently than others, but if you write carefully and deliberately, 
the quality of your ideas should be evident. Write simply and to the best of your 
ability, drafting your work in advance. When writing, use empathy – put yourself 
in your reader’s perspective. Consider who your audience is and what does, and 
does not, need to be explained to them. Crucially, always write to the brief – care-
fully read and listen to any instructions on your written assignments you are 
given. Read the assignment carefully and ensure you are answering the question 
that has been set. Respect the due dates, word lengths, and formatting and submis-
sion requirements absolutely. If some instruction by your tutor seems to contra-
dict anything we have written here, follow your tutor’s instruction. 
Of interest, social psychologist Michael Billig (2011) has identified several 
pitfalls that are encountered in social psychological writing. In particular, he 
critiques writing in social psychological journals and undergraduates alike. He 
offers the following advice:
1 Try to use simple language and to avoid technical terms as much as possible. 
Sometimes, technical terms are not as clear as the ordinary ones and it is often 
more difficult to write without jargon. But it is much easier to read writing that 
is free of (unnecessary) jargon. Interestingly, Billig recommends that we should 
not become ‘personally attached to technical terms’ (p. 18). As instructors, we 
often find that students overuse technical language in their essays. Instructors 
understand the pressure students feel to demonstrate that they have mastered 
technical terms. However, we are generally much more impressed by clear 
writing, sound logic, good use of evidence and critical thinking than we are by 
the use of terminology. We feed back to students that they overused termi-
nology and elevated language more often than we comment that their language 
was too simple and did not employ enough terminology. 
2 Avoid writing in passive sentences where possible. Writing ‘It was found … 
(Manning et al., 2007)’ is much less clear and efficient than writing ‘Manning et 
al. (2007) found …’.

3 Treat these recommendations as aspirations rather than rigid rules. Sometimes, 
at a key point in your work, it may be necessary to break one of these rules. 
There may be an area of literature that is so riddled with terminology, for 
example, that it is all but impossible to avoid it. Still, you should avoid 
producing long tracts of writing that break these rules. 
Billig (2011, p. 14) highlights a couple of adjacent sentences from a recent article 
to illustrate his points. The first sentence reads:
Whereas intergroup anxiety is by now an established mediator of intergroup 
contact and cross-group friendship, the present study also sought to explore 
cognitions of rejection as a cognitive mediator predicted by cross-group friend-
ship, and predictive of intergroup anxiety, as well as a range of attitudes towards 
the outgroup.
This is the second sentence:
Specifically, we propose that people with cross-group friends cease to expect 
outgroup members to reject their attempts at contact and friendship.
The second sentence is not only shorter and crisper but is also written, as Billig 
(2011, p. 14) puts it, ‘in terms of people and what they might do and feel’. It is 
relatively free of jargon, and is much clearer in its use of active voice, clearly estab-
lishing who is doing what. Mastering the art of simple, accurate writing will allow 
you to communicate complex ideas to a range of audiences, and is a valuable skill, 
no matter what career you choose.
Research projects
As an undergraduate student in psychology, you will probably be required to 
undertake a research project as part of your degree. Throughout this book, we have 
highlighted some projects that students have done over the course of their studies, 
comprising a range of projects across social psychology. We hope that this has made 
the prospect of conducting your own research less daunting. All these students – 
just like you – had to start somewhere. Here, we would like to offer some small 
pieces of advice in conducting your own undergraduate projects. Also, in the Some 
further reading section, we have cited a book that may help you with your project. 
First, it is advisable to be realistic about the amount of work you can achieve in 
your project. Some of you will be required to work for a year on a project. Some 
will have more time and some will have less time. Some students will be permitted 
to work with other students and others will be required to work alone. Be mindful 
of the requirements of your specific institution and, when in doubt, take the advice 
of your supervisor. In meetings with your supervisor, be professional, punctual 
and polite. Likewise, observe professional standards when dealing with research 
participants. Do not attempt to influence your participants. It is crucial that you 
adhere to the ethical guidelines of your institution or professional association 
(e.g., British Psychological Society). Be scrupulous and thorough in this respect 
(see Chapter 1). 

703
Social psychology: an overview 
When deciding on a topic and designing your research, apply critical reasoning 
skills and spend a good amount of time researching the relevant literature. We 
strongly advise that you aim to be incremental; that is, look for one new piece of 
knowledge in your research rather than trying to invent a whole new research area 
for yourself. Novelty is key, but do not leave yourself stranded in an entirely new 
research area with no literature from which to draw upon. Likewise, you should 
introduce methodological innovation only where necessary. This means using 
manipulations and measures devised by other researchers where possible. This will 
save time and avoid mistakes, and you will find it easier to interpret your findings if 
you adapt others’ procedures and materials. It is important that you plan your time 
carefully to avoid any pitfalls associated with conducting research. It is also impor-
tant that you design your project mindful of how you plan to analyse the results. 
Having given all these words of caution, it is important that you also be curious 
and open-minded. Typically, marks on project work are awarded according to the 
quality of your research, your professionalism in running it, and the quality of 
your write-up, not your results. So, do not be disappointed if your project 
produces non-significant findings. This is very common for student projects and 
does not mean that you will receive a low mark.
Time to reflect It is never too early to start thinking about your research project. Conducting an undergraduate 
project is an opportunity for you to conduct a unique investigation into a topic that interests you. Now that you have 
a broad knowledge of social psychology, perhaps have a go at generating some ideas for a research project. The first 
step is to think of a general topic. To do this, take some time to list the topics in social psychology that interest you 
the most. Then, narrow this down to a specific research area. For example, if you are interested in prejudice, what 
type of prejudice is most interesting to you (e.g., race, gender, sexuality)? are you interested in understanding 
prejudice or reducing prejudice? once you have got this far, it is time to think of some potential questions you might 
ask. Do you notice any gaps in the literature? For example, what can social psychological research tell us about 
reducing prejudice and what can it not tell us yet? This is where you begin to generate your unique research 
question. The steps that follow involve deciding on what you will do, what you will predict, and what you will be 
able to conclude based on your investigation. This may seem a daunting task but broken down into a series of 
smaller steps, it need not be a scary process. again, this is a unique opportunity for you to make your mark on a 
research topic, so enjoy it. For other information and advice on conducting your research project, do read the Student 
projects at the end of Chapters 1–14.
Careers and employability
It is widely known that many psychology graduates do not seek employment as 
professional psychologists. Specifically, it was recently noted that 80 per cent of 
psychology graduates in the UK are employed in other types of careers (QAA, 
2010). Of course, professional bodies in many countries, such as the British 
Psychological Society, need to ensure that degrees adhere to the topics and stand-
ards that would allow graduates to ultimately become professional psychologists. 
However, the Quality Assurance Agency psychology benchmark in the UK 
stresses that ‘due to the wide range of generic skills, and the rigour with which 
they are taught, training in psychology is widely accepted as providing an excel-
lent preparation for many careers’ (QAA, 2010, p. 2). Specifically, because 
psychology graduates develop so many different kinds of transferable skills, as we 

704
Social Psychology
discussed earlier (e.g., computer literacy, numeracy, teamwork, critical thinking), 
they are viewed as highly desirable employees (Trapp, Banister, Ellis et al., 2011). 
Whether you are planning a career in psychology or elsewhere, or whether you 
are not consciously planning one, it is worth reflecting on the skills and attributes 
that will help open doors for you later in life. Landrum and Harrold (2003) report 
that employers of psychology graduates rated the following attributes as most 
important (1 = most important):
1 listening skills
2 teamwork skills
3 ability to get along with others
4 wanting and being able to learn
5 in particular, being willing to learn new and important skills
6 having a focus on customers or clients
7 strong interpersonal relationship skills
8 being adaptable to changing situations
9 having the ability to suggest solutions to problems
10 being able to implement solutions to problems.
Time to reflect Think about landrum and Harrold’s (2003) list of attributes desired by employers and the key 
points of psychological literacy we identified earlier in the chapter. How do these relate to each other?
Obtaining a university degree does not guarantee that you will have the 
attributes that will set you up in a career. Employers in the USA took a rather dim 
view of university graduates, according to one survey (AACandU, cited in Trapp 
et al., 2011). Specifically, employers rated: 
 o 33% of graduates as having insufficient skills and knowledge to succeed in 
relatively basic or ‘entry-level’ positions
 o 42% as lacking self-direction
 o 37% as having poor writing skills
 o 31% as lacking critical thinking skills
 o 30% as lacking adaptability
 o 26% as lacking the ability to accurately appraise their strengths and weaknesses.
It is useful to consider this list of concerns together with Landrum and Harrold’s list 
of qualities that employers are looking for in psychology graduates. Looking at these 
two lists, you can develop a clear picture of the qualities you might want to develop 
in the course of your studies. Critical thinking and social skills, including the ability 
to communicate effectively in different ways to different audiences, are crucial. How 
can you develop these skills? Some methods are very traditional. Attend available 
classes, listen to lectures in order to develop your ability to listen to others and to 
speak effectively. Take available opportunities to work in teams, and do so with 
enthusiasm and diplomacy. Be critical and curious. Read widely, both to increase 
your knowledge and also to enhance your writing skills. The more you encounter 
how others express complex psychological concepts in writing, the easier you will 

705
Social psychology: an overview 
find it to do the same. The take-home message here is that a degree in psychology – 
of which social psychology plays a crucial part – gives students the opportunity to 
develop a range of skills that will equip them to succeed in a broad variety of careers. 
Chapter summary
In this chapter, we have invited you to reflect on everything you 
have learned throughout reading this book. What are the key 
insights of social psychology? What concepts, skills and ideas can 
you take forward into your careers? We argued that there are 
several take-home principles or messages of social psychology:
• Despite much popular thinking, social psychology can be 
studied scientifically. Common misunderstandings about 
what can and cannot be studied in social psychology often 
stem from a misunderstanding of science.
• Scientific explanations are incomplete and imperfect. any 
one explanation of human behaviour is not invalidated by 
the presence of other explanations.
• People need groups – group memberships and social 
identities largely define who we are.
• People are not easily manipulated. They often react strongly 
to attempts to change their opinions and influence their 
behaviours. They are creative and reactive.
• Be aware of self-fulfilling prophecies. When people’s 
behaviour seems to confirm expectations, always ask if this 
could be an example of a self-fulfilling prophecy.
• People are not always aware of factors that will influence 
them. also, they cannot always tell when they have been 
influenced.
• Behaviour is crucial. Not only is it the central means by which 
we can understand human nature, it also has the power to 
change what we think and who we are.
• Critical thinking is key. Before accepting any claim about 
human behaviour, evaluate it carefully. Claims of fact,  
and explanations of fact, should be clear, unambiguous  
and testable.
We also argued that the study of social psychology presents 
several challenges and limitations:
• Social psychology suffers significantly from the sampling 
bias. Researchers rely too heavily on convenience samples of 
undergraduate students.
• The discipline is dominated by a small number of research 
methods such that the majority of social psychological 
findings are derived from correlational and experimental 
studies.
• Social psychological research often attempts to simulate 
real-life thoughts and contexts and apply findings to the real 
world. Some work may lack the ecological validity to do so.
• as in other disciplines, there is a publication bias in favour of 
positive findings that report significant results.
• Social psychology relies heavily on studies of attitudes and 
probably not enough on studies of behaviours and actions.
• Some argue that social psychology has lost sight of the ‘bigger 
picture’ as it focuses on basic questions about human nature. 
• ongoing divisions within social psychology (e.g., european 
vs. american; quantitative vs. qualitative) create problems 
within the discipline.
• like other disciplines, social psychology is a competitive 
academic subject, which means that findings may not 
always be free of bias resulting from the pressure to publish.
We also outlined some current directions in social psychology:
• The internet provides a valuable resource for social 
psychologists, enabling them to access samples of a size and 
quality that was hitherto very difficult.
• advances in information technology such as data mining and 
social networking also provide exciting avenues for 
conducting social psychological research.
• Developments in psychophysiological and neuroscientific 
methods (e.g., fmRI, transcranial magnetic stimulation) and 
theories have greatly facilitated the study of social 
neuroscience.
• The non-invasive study of nonverbal behaviour (e.g., 
electromyography, eye tracking) allows social psychologists 
to rely less on self-report data and to answer a wide variety 
of research questions.
• an ageing population makes the study of social 
psychological processes related to ageing (e.g., ageism, 
changes in affect) increasingly important.
• as globalization and technology afford new levels of contact 
between cultures, there is an increasing need to understand 
how relations are influenced by cultural differences, and 
how valuable aspects of culture can be preserved.
In the final section, we discussed some of the skills you will take 
forward with you from your study of social psychology, such as 
psychological literacy, technological, research and statistical skills, 
an understanding of diversity, the connection between science 
and wider social policy debates, and communication skills. We 
discussed how to use these skills in your student projects and in 
your future careers. Now that you have reached the end of this 
book, we wish you all the very best in these future adventures.

Social Psychology
Essay questions
at the beginning of the chapter, we asked you to consider  
these questions:
1 Imagine you are having a conversation with your friend in 
which you discuss an interesting social psychological finding 
you have just read about – specifically, you read that meat 
eaters deny mental qualities to animals they eat as a way of 
justifying their meat eating (Bastian et al., 2012). Your friend 
says this is rubbish because they are a meat eater and they 
love animals. as an expert on social psychology research 
methodologies, how might you respond to your friend’s 
statement?
2 Imagine reading about another interesting finding that 
people are often influenced by conspiracy theories – theories 
arguing that secret plots and deals determine major political 
events – without their awareness (Douglas and Sutton, 
2008). Your friend again says that this cannot be the case. 
People would know if they had been influenced. Is this true?
3 The discussion with your friend takes an unpleasant turn and 
they say to you: ‘Social psychology is a pseudo-science.’ 
What would you say in response? 
Having read this chapter, these questions could also be framed 
as the following essay questions, which you can attempt in 
preparation for your examinations:
1 If a study shows that meat eaters tend to be less likely to see 
animals as having minds, does this mean that all meat 
eaters will do this? explain how a social psychologist might 
have reached such a conclusion (what research methods and 
analyses) and discuss some of the common misconceptions 
about social psychological research. 
2 are people always aware that they are being influenced? If 
not, what does this mean about the value of intuition?
3 Discuss the claim that social psychology is not a science.
