Preface
Preface
 
The micro- and nano- transport of biomolecules is of interest to a wide range of scientific and 
engineering communities.  Application areas include miniaturized technology that will support and 
advance key sectors, including healthcare, food provisioning, environment services, etc.  This e-
book is generally intended for undergraduate students from chemical, life and physical sciences 
wanting to find out about the basic properties of biomolecules and how they can be transported in 
liquids on the micro- to nano-scale.  The e-book tends to be oriented towards engineering aspects, 
especially with the transport of biomolecules in micro-devices powered electrically.  It is hoped it 
will also be useful for interdisciplinary researchers surveying the field of biomolecule transport.   
 
Much of the book can be read with no more than high school level of science and mathematics and 
selected areas that require engineering mathematics can be omitted if need be.  Vector notation for 
example has been deliberately omitted until Chapter 4. At the same time the more mathematical 
sections in Chapter 4 are expected to be useful for researchers entering this area of science.

Introduction
1 Introduction
 
This chapter introduces biomolecules in a general context in which they are studied scientifically 
and applied to real-world problems.    
 
1.1 Motivation: biomolecules in scientific context 
 
Biomolecules are organic molecules that are biologically important. Examples of biomolecules 
include nucleic acids - deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) and ribonucleic acid (RNA), proteins – 
filamentous (e.g. actin filaments and microtubules) and globular (e.g. haemoglobin that transports 
oxygen in our bodies), carbohydrates and lipids.  The transport of biomolecules on the nano- and 
micro-length scale is of interest to a number of scientific and engineering communities – ranging 
from life and chemical sciences, to engineering and mathematics.  
 
Scientific enquiry and engineering application is supported by, and contributes to, a wider public 
society.  Fig. 1-1 is a general sketch of the relationship between knowledge disciplines embedded 
within a wider public arena.  It is a simple sketch, in so far as a more complete web- or map-of-
knowledge should be rendered in several dimensions, illustrate more elaborate interconnections, etc.  
Nonetheless, it represents the basic idea and the above disciplines are listed in three quadrants: 
Biology and Biomedical Science, Physics and Engineering, and Chemistry.

Fig. 1-1 Discipline-based knowledge and related industries, services and wider public arena. 
Broadly speaking, as a community, life scientists seek to understand the minute biological 
processes that occur inside living organisms.  Their discoveries inform about transport processes 
and it is important to integrate their observations within frameworks of established physical and 
chemical laws.  In recent years this has become more apparent when the community has used tools 
made available from micro- and nano-technology in their investigations, e.g. nano-bioparticles.  
 
Another community, engineering scientists, seek to find applications of naturally evolved 
biological processes to create novel components, devices and systems.  During the past decade 
there has been increasing interest in miniaturising biotechnical processes – and methods developed 
by highly successful semiconductor manufacturing have been borrowed to achieve this.  
Knowledge about biomolecule transport is needed for choosing controllable forces that drive 
movement and for ensuing micro-device design.  
 
Practical scientific enquiry and development on the nano- to micro-scale is largely performed by, 
or at least is underpinned by, chemistry - and its related wide ranging sub-disciplines. Much is 
owed to the chemistry community for the development of polymers, photolithographic resists, 
nano-bioparticles,  microarrays, etc. Again, the importance of transport processes is evident. 
 
The fourth quadrant in Fig. 1-1 lists mathematical, computing and statistical sciences. These 
quantitative disciplines play a pivotal role with their experimental-oriented (biological, chemical 
and engineering) disciplines in numerous ways.  To describe a couple: first, assuming a given set of 
laws, boundary conditions, and parameter values, they enable quantitative prediction of the motion 
of biomolecules; second, they enable experimental data to infer the most likely models applicable 
(or parameter values of selected models).  These attributes of prediction and inference are 
cornerstones for supporting and nourishing a successful emerging science.

Introduction
The involvement of experimental-oriented biological, chemical, and engineering disciplines is 
evident in scientific meetings, international conferences and journals that discuss biomolecular and 
cellular transport on small scales.  Examples include micro Total Analysis Systems (ȝTAS) 
conference, and Lab-On-Chip (LOC) journal.  Consequently, the acronyms ȝTAS and LOC, listed 
at the top of Fig. 1-1, are often associated with micro-devices – along with BioMEMS (Bio-
MicroElectroMechanical Systems), biosensors and microarrays. 
  
Bioinformatics and systems biology journals and conferences are venues that attract biological, 
medical and life scientists along with computing, mathematical and statistical scientists.  They have 
tended to attract less hardware and ‘wet-lab’ engineers and chemists. 
 
1.2 Length scale of transport 
 
Transport is the movement of an object from one point to another and is often integral to a 
particular process, such as, a biochemical reaction.  Transport takes time. In biological 
environments and manufactured structures, spaces are compartmentalised so that shorter length 
scales reduce processing time.  Processing time reduction is one of the key reasons for motivating 
miniaturisation or scale-down biotechnology.  Other reasons include savings in amount of 
biochemical reagents needed, reduction in energy consumption and mass (or weight) of devices, 
thus creating opportunities for portability.  To further imagine the possible impact on our future 
lives, it is helpful to glimpse back to the historical past.   
 
Drawing on analogies with computing, one remembers the large size of computers early last 
century and time duration it took to do calculations compared with today.  Science museum 
displays and old films remind us of mechanical or early electronic valve computers that occupied 
entire rooms. Computers were comparatively slow so that programs were run in batches – 
sometimes overnight or for weeks on end.  Nowadays, computing has become so ubiquitous that 
computing devices such as microprocessors are part of many home and workplace appliances, 
making them ‘smart’ and improving user-friendliness. Integrating a camera, music player, radio, 
telephone and clunky computer would have been almost unthinkable a century ago; today they’re 
packaged and work together in a standard cell phone. The point is that smaller and faster 
technology has many follow-on ramifications in terms of weight, cost, availability, functionality, 
pervasiveness and influence on our lives.  
 
 
It is possible that scaled-down biotechnology in the form of chip-like micro-devices will also give 
rise to new ways of doing new things almost unimaginable at present. As in the past, it will in-part 
be shaped by scientific and societal challenges and opportunities. At present, most countries aim to 
improve healthcare, food provisioning, energy and water recycling and resourcing, and confront 
global problems, such as, climate-change.  Recognition of these current challenges is enough to 
motivate considerable scientific and engineering effort in discovering, understanding and utilising 
micro- and nano-scale transport of biomolecules.  The future could even be more fictive.

Introduction
1.3 Biomolecule transport example: engineered microdevices 
 
This e-book focuses on the transport of biomolecules in water driven by electric fields. The 
suspensions are assumed to be enclosed in microstructures with feature lengths on the scale of tens 
to thousands of nanometers (nm).  These laboratory microstructures represent micro-devices that 
are being developed for applications ranging from diagnostics to security. It is important that the 
micro-devices are communicable with each other and generally the most convenient medium that is 
capable of conveying both information and power simultaneously, is electrical signalling.  Other 
signal media include microfluidic and optical radiation.  Even using molecular motors, extracted 
from naturally evolved biological systems, could form a long distance communication link 
deploying similar motility systems to nerve fibers in our bodies.   
 
An example schematic of three micro-devices connected to an electronic communication and 
power controller is illustrated in Fig. 1-2.  Device A is a sketch of nucleic acid (DNA or RNA) 
fragments that are being drawn out their suspension in water into the region between two planar 
electrodes.  The inert metal electrodes have been micro-fabricated on glass, such as a microscope  
slide, using standard photolithographic methods.  The electrodes are being supplied with electrical 
signals from the communication and power controller via multiplexed cable, as shown.  The 
electrode edges are very close to each other - on the order of microns (ȝm).  They are energised 
with voltage differences between them of no more than, say, 20 volts at radio frequencies (MHz).

Micro- and Nano-Transport of Biomolecules

Introduction
Strong non-uniform electric fields generated between electrodes attract the nucleic acid fragments 
so that they position at right angles (orthogonal) to the edges, as shown. The fragments are not 
normally visible so they have fluorescence dyes attached, or labeled, to them.  This enables their 
movement to be detected and monitored using optical equipment, such as, a fluorescence 
microscope, as shown.  Information about the biomolecule movement is then sent back to the 
controller.  Other methods of non-optical sensing of biomolecules between electrodes include 
differences in electrical impedance (not shown).  
 
Details of the electrokinetic mechanism for moving the fragments is not important for the moment, 
and are elaborated later in this book.  The key point is that the strength of the electric field driven 
movement can between the  monitored and controlled ‘remotely’ (away from the micro-electrodes) 
to yield a biomolecular transport device.   
 
Device B is similar to A but the biomolecules are protein filaments, such as, actin filaments (AFs) 
or microtubules (MTs) rather than nucleic acids.  The gap between the electrodes is made variable, 
rather than constant as in device A, so as the filaments electro-kinetically concentrate.   The details 
how the electrokinetic mechanism works will become evident later in this chapter.  In living (in 
vivo) biological systems, such as cells, these motility filaments are involved in a wide of processes, 
such as, muscle contraction, linear transport of metabolites, and movement of chromosomes during 
cell division.  AFs and MTs are the ‘tracks’ the corresponding linear protein motors, myosin and 
kinesin, practically ‘step’ on as they transport cellular material. As with Device A, AFs or MTs in 
Device B are fluorescently labelled, and can be controlled and monitored remotely.   
 
Device C shows the protein motors, adsorbed to chemically modified glass substrate, and 
associated in some way to an AF or MT.  The size of the motors are in terms of tens of nanometres 
and they use adenosine triphosphate (ATP) as fuel with high efficiency.  In this ‘glass’ (in vitro) 
role, they are operating in reverse to in vivo where they move and transport cargo.  Instead, they are

Introduction
stationary and their ‘stepping’ motion moves their respective AF or MT filament, with 5 nm and 8 
nm step-lengths.  AFs and MTs are made of asymmetrical monomers that fit into each other so as 
to provide stable structures with directionality. Even so, they need mechanical guidance and this is 
provided by the polymer walls, as shown.  Electric fields are used to govern the direction of AFs 
and MTs and bias their movement, rather than propel them which mechanically powered from ATP. 
 
The scale of the myosin and kinesin motors and step sizes is on the order of tens of nanometres and 
they are a very good example of ‘bottom up’ assembled machines.  This is important because 
making nano-sized mechanisms or machines that will operate inside microdevices is difficult in 
terms of today’s available ‘top-down’ methods.  This is due to resolution and cost limitations of 
photo- or electron- lithographic processes.  Motivated by molecularly assembled ‘bottom up’ motor 
construction and high energy efficiency, researchers have developed in vitro biochemical 
procedures or motility gliding assays where these nanosized linear protein motors operate on 
chemically modified glass or polymer surfaces; the platforms are termed ‘hybrid-devices’.  
Therefore, in Fig. 1-2 Device C is labelled as motility, whereas devices A and B are non-motility.  
As with A and B, Device C is also monitored.  All three micro-devices can communicate with each 
other thus enabling coordinated biomolecular transport. 
 
1.4 Structure of this e-book  
 
This e-book focuses on devices non-motility devices A and B, leaving C for further work as 
recently reviewed (Bakewell and Nicolau, 2007; Conceição et al., 2008).   The structure and 
function of biomolecules and their electrical properties is described in Chapter 2.  The emphasis on 
DNA since it is an important biomolecule and because its properties are often referred to in 
subsequent chapters.  The concept of a bioparticle is introduced as a biomolecule with a rigid shape, 
typically spherical, for several reasons. These include the increasing use of model bioparticles, such 
as, latex nanospheres (beads) in bioscience and bioengineering research, that many biomolecules 
have well defined shapes in water suspensions, and that their transport can be mathematically 
modeled using Newton’s laws of motion.   
 
An account of the way in which biomolecules are moved by electric fields and mechanisms of 
dielectric polarization are described in Chapter 3, complemented with calculation examples.  The 
primary transport driving forces are introduced in Chapter 4 with emphasis on motion arising from 
non-uniform electric fields (dielectrophoresis). The forces are categorised as deterministic - that 
are known, and stochastic – that arise from thermal random motion and give rise to diffusion.  The 
single bioparticle motion is described by the Langevin equation that combines both deterministic 
and stochastic forces. The motion of a population (or suspended solute) can be derived from the 
Langevin equation and is described by the Fokker Planck equation or modified diffusion equation.  
 
The final chapter in the book describes example experiments and computer simulations of 
bioparticle and biomolecule (DNA) transport under the action of nonuniform electric fields in a 
microdevice context.   The experiments and simulations draw together concepts and theoretical 
models presented in the in the previous chapters.

2. Biomolecules and their electrical properties
2 Biomolecules and their electrical properties 
 
In this chapter the biologically important organic molecules (biomolecules) mentioned briefly in 
the previous are introduced in their natural - cellular context - since the cell is the smallest living 
unit in nature.  The biomolecules are then discussed including their chemical structure and function 
in a natural environment, e.g. in vivo (within living organism).   Students needing to understand 
more biology can refer to highly informative science textbooks including, for example, Alberts et 
al. (2008), Nelson and Cox (2008), and Pollard and Earnshaw (2008).   
 
2.1 Biomolecules in cells 
 
A very simple sketch of a cross-section of a typical animal cell is shown Fig. 2-1.  
 
It is a eukaryote, i.e. contains nucleus – as shown that in enclosed by a wall (green).  This is in 
contrast to prokaryote that do not have a nucleus.  Cells are dynamic in the sense that they need to 
reproduce (divide into two copies of the original cell), move and search for nutrients to feed on, 
exhaust waste products, defend themselves from invaders, etc.  The nucleus contains genetic 
information in the form of coiled DNA that is arranged into chromatin fibers.  DNA essentially 
stores information in the form of a genetic code that describes the constituents for assembling other 
biomolecules both within the cell and outside, for example, the extracellular matrix. Hence, it is 
often referred to as the genetic ‘blueprint’ or ‘instruction manual’ or for a particular organism. 
 
The remaining portion of the cell that is exterior to the nucleus and within the cell plasma 
membrane is the cytoplasm.  Surrounding the nucleus within the cytoplasm are ribosomes that are 
responsible for translating the genetic code into proteins – discussed further in the next section.  
The illustration shows other key parts of the cell.  Many of these are called organelles that are 
biochemically functioning entities enclosed by a membrane.  Examples include the centrosome, 
endoplasmic reticulum (ER), mitochrondria (plural of mitochondrion), and Golgi complex:

- 
the centrosome is centrally located and is responsible for organizing the network of MTs 
associated with it, as illustrated.  It is the pole (or spindle pole) during cell division for 
reproduction (mitosis).   
 
- 
the ER is involved with the synthesis of lipids and proteins; not shown are ribosomes 
attached to the ER, called rough ER 
 
- 
the mitochrondria are known as the ‘power-house’ of the cell and produce most of a key 
molecule called adenosine triphosphate (ATP) which is an energy supply or ‘currency’ for 
cells, organisms, etc. It also where important biochemical reaction pathways occur, for 
example, tricarboxylic (or citric) acid cycle.  

- 
the Golgi complex is involved with protein and lipid modifications and sorting - including 
preparation for their integration into membranes. 
 
Other entities in Fig. 2-1 include AFs and vesicles that carry various biochemical cargoes, etc.   
MTs and AFs filaments have dual roles acting as mechanical scaffolding and as ‘rail tracks’ for 
molecular motors to step along as they actively transport metabolites.

2. Biomolecules and their electrical properties
2.2 Biomolecules: structure and function
 
The structure of biomolecules is related to their chemical properties and their biological function, 
and is also influenced by the natural, or artificial, environment that surrounds them.   
 
2.2.1 Nucleic acids 
 
Nucleic acids are divided into deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) and ribonucleic acid (RNA). The basic 
chemical building blocks of nucleic acids are nucleotides that consist of three characteristic 
components 
 
- 
a nitrogen containing base that is either a  
- 
purine, there are two possibilities: Adenine (A) or Guanine (G) or a 
- 
pyramidine, there are three possibilities: Cytosine (C), Thymine (T) or Uracil (U) 
 
- 
a pentose sugar ring (denoted SR) 
- 
for DNA it is a 2'-deoxy-D-ribose 
- 
for RNA the ring is a D-ribose 
 
- 
a phosphate (PO) 
 
In DNA and RNA, the nucleotides are covalently linked together with the phosphates acting as 
‘bridges’ between the pentoses.   Chemically, the 5´ - phosphate group of one nucleotide is linked 
to the 3´ - hydroxyl group of the next nucleotide; the linkages are often referred to as the ‘sugar 
phosphate backbone’. The three constituents of the four nucleotides for DNA is shown in Fig. 2-2.  
A key property of nucleic acids is that a single strand of linked nucleotides can form 
complementary pairs with another strand.  That is, each base of a nucleotide on one strand can form 
hydrogen (H) bonds with the base of a nucleotide on the opposite strand.  This occurs for all bases 
on each strand and purines pair with pyramidins.  Generally the following rules apply:   
 
- 
DNA contains A, C, G, and T 
- 
DNA bases usually pair as A with T (double H-bond) , C with G (triple H-bond) 
 
- 
RNA contains A, C, G, and U 
- 
RNA bases, when they pair, do so as A with U (double H-bond), C with G (triple H-bond) 
 
DNA and RNA are distinguished by their pentoses, i.e. DNA entails 2'-deoxy-D-ribose; RNA 
entails D-ribose. They also differ by one of the bases (T rather than U) and only on very rare 
occasions do exceptions to these rules occur. 
 
There are a number of different structures of DNA, two of the most common are single-stranded 
DNA (ssDNA) and double-stranded DNA (dsDNA).  Fig. 2-2 shows base pairing where A and C 
on the left ssDNA strand forms H-bonds with T and G on the right strand.  The complementary

Fig. 2-3 shows a very short length of dsDNA as it occurs in aqueous (or water) solution, that is, in 
the energetically favorable state as a double helix.  The sugar-phosphate double helical backbones 
are shown as thick lines - though structurally ‘backbone’ is a somewhat of a misnomer in the sense 
that it provides little stiffness.  These are hydrophilic (water loving) and lie on the exterior of the 
biomolecule.  The hydrophobic nucleotide base-pairs (bp) lie within the biomolecule, away from 
the polar water molecules.  They are represented symbolically (A – T, C – G pairs) with respective 
double and triple H-bonds, as in the previous figure.  The displacement along the major helical axis 
between base pairs is shown as 0.34 nm, so that the length between repetitive positions of the 
double helix is about 3.4 nm (10 bp). The diameter is the biomolecule is about 2 nm.  
 
RNA is mainly involved with reading of DNA, called transcription, and its translation into 
proteins and other biomolecules associated with cellular information. There are a number of 
different types of RNA that perform different functions inside a cell: 
 
- 
messenger RNA (mRNA) is concerned with transfer of genetic ‘blueprint’ information that 
codes for proteins.  There are 20 different amino acids found in Nature, and DNA codes for 
them using the A, C, G, T  bases available or ‘quaternary alphabet’.  This means that it 
requires a triplet of bases to sufficiently code for 20 AAs.  That is, 4 bases to choose 
independently for first (base) position, then 4 bases to choose independently for the second 
position, then another 4 for the third position, yields total of 4×4×4 = 64 combinations or 
possible AAs.  This is more than enough to code for the actual 20 AAs needed to make 
proteins so the genetic code is said to have redundancy.  The triplet of bases that codes for 
each AA (and also some DNA reading instructions) is called a codon. 
 
- 
transfer RNA (tRNA): reads (decodes) the mRNA and transfers an appropriate AA onto a  
polypeptide chain that is being synthesized during production of a particular protein. 
tRNAs are small RNAs (about 80 nucleotides) with a characteristic clover leaf shape and 
act as adapters.

2. Biomolecules and their electrical properties
- 
ribosomal RNA (rRNA):  ribosomal RNA constitutes part of the ribosome. These are 
located in the cytoplasm of a cell and are responsible for the synthesis of AA peptides and 
hence, protein, by decoding mRNA.  
 
- 
noncoding RNA is that RNA that is not mRNA (does not code for protein) or rRNA or 
tRNA; and are short ~ 22 nucleotides single strands. These perform a whole variety of 
functions that are being currently discovered.  These include, for example, small interfering 
RNA (siRNA) that can silence reading (gene expression) of DNA code, micro RNA 
(miRNA) that has been linked with cell cycle regulation, cardiac pathology, cancer, etc.  
 
If one extracts RNA from cells, say fish liver cells, the dominant amount of RNA is rRNA with the 
amounts other RNA’s being much smaller.  This means that mRNA needed for understanding the 
protein production has to be carefully separated from the total amount of RNA.  
 
Referring back to the illustration of a cell, a close-up of Fig. 2-1 is shown in Fig. 2-4 and outlines 
the process of making the protein according to genetic instructions.  In eukaryote cells the reading 
of DNA, or transcription, occurs inside the cell nucleus.  Since the DNA is packaged as chromatin, 
it needs to be unwound before its base sequence can be read. After unwinding, the DNA (dsDNA) 
is separated into two ssDNA strands, as shown on the left, in Fig. 2-4. Aided by RNA polymerase, 
unpaired bases on one of the ssDNA strands code for complementary bases thus forming a mRNA 
sequence.  The mRNA is processed, packaged and exported through the nuclear pore, as shown.   
 
The mRNA is translated in the cytoplasm at a ribosome; each one is made of about 50 different 
proteins and several rRNAs. The matching of the triple-base mRNA codon to AA is performed by 
a set of tRNA adaptor molecules.  Reading the mRNA 5' to 3', the codon ‘ACU’, for example, pairs 
with the anti-codon tRNA adapter thus adding the AA Threonine (Thr) to the polypeptide chain.

2. Biomolecules and their electrical properties
2.2.2 Proteins 
 
Proteins are made of peptides of amino acids (AAs) and may also contain some residues of 
uncommon AAs. The linear sequence of monomer units in a polymer is called a primary structure; 
the AAs in peptides fit this definition, so AA sequence is referred to as the primary structure.  The 
twenty possible AAs are classified according to their electrical charge and as to whether parts of 
the AA have charge imbalance, i.e. parts have more positive charge and other parts more negative, 
that is, if they are polar.  A water molecule itself is polar - with the oxygen atom carrying positive 
charge, and the two H-atoms carrying the balance of negative charge.  Therefore, polar AAs near 
water tend to form H-bonds and are therefore energetically stable and consequently observed to be 
hydrophilic or water soluble (at biological pH that is about 7.0).  Conversely, nonpolar AAs tend to 
be hydrophobic and tend to aggregate together in water.  The 20 AAs are classified according to 
their R groups (or side chains); there are five classes: 
 
- 
aliphatic, nonpolar R groups: the seven hydrophobic AAs are Glycine (Gly), Alanine (Ala), 
Proline (Pro), Valine (Val), Leucine (Leu), Isoleucine (Ile) and Methionine (Met) 
 
- 
aromatic R groups: the three AAs are Phenylalanine (Phe), Tyrosine (Tyr) and Tryptophan 
(Trp) 

- 
polar, uncharged R groups: the five AAs that are more soluble in water than the nonpolar 
AAs are Serine (Ser), Threonine (Thr), Cysteine (Cys), Asparagine (Asn)  and Glutamine 
(Gln) 

- 
positively charged R groups: the three AAs soluble in water are Lysine (Lys), Histidine 
(His) and Arginine (Arg) 

- 
negatively charged R groups: the two AAs soluble in water are Aspartate (Asp) and 
Glutamate (Glu) 
 
In solution the primary sequence of AAs forms bonds so that the polypeptide forms a defined 
structure.  The term secondary structure refers to regular folding pattern in a localized vicinity, 
such as, Į-helices and ȕ-sheets.  Tertiary structure refers to the three dimensional (3D) folding of a 
polypeptide chain into a protein unit, e.g. globin.  Quaternary structure refers to the spatial 
relationship of protein subunits that form a complex, e.g. haemoglobin that carries in oxygen in our 
blood and is made up of two Į-globin and two ȕ-globin chains.  
 
Proteins that can be positively or negatively charged depending on the concentration of anions and 
cations in solution (or pH).   They can be classified in many ways, for example, according to their 
structural properties.  Filamentous proteins, for example, include AFs and MTs that perform 
important functions, such as, the active transport of cargoes within cells, as mentioned earlier in 
section 2.1.  Globular proteins are another example – as described above.

2.2.3 Carbohydrates
 
Carbohydrates are generally known as food sources and certain kinds, such as, sugar and starch, 
form a large part of peoples’ diet in many parts of the world. Carbohydrates are not only involved 
with energy storage and use, they also perform numerous other roles, such as, signal messengers 
for cells.   
 
Carbohydrates can be classified according to their size 
 
- 
monosaccharides are simple sugars and example include sugar D-glucose, or dextrose - as 
is labeled sometimes in the laboratory.    
 
- 
oligosaccharides are monosaccharides linked by glycosidic bonds into short chains.  The 
most frequently encountered in daily life are disaccharides (two monosaccharides), such as, 
sucrose or cane sugar.     
 
- 
polysaccharides are sugar polymers with tens to thousands of units, some as linear chains, 
others are branched.  Two of the most important polysaccharides for storing energy are 
starch in plants and glycogen in animal cells. Cellulose is another polysaccharide that is 
found in cell walls of plants and constitutes much of wood and cotton.

2.2.4 Lipids
 
Lipids are insoluble in water and soluble in organic solvents, such as, benzene.  They are 
chemically diverse and perform a range of biological functions, for example 
 
- 
energy storage : triacylglycerol droplets are the simplest of fatty acid fats and are found in 
the cytoplasm of many cells. Derivatives of fatty acids we are familiar with include fats 
(e.g. animal fats in cream or meat) and oils (e.g. corn and olive oils).  Fatty acids are often 
classified as being saturated or unsaturated. 
 
- 
membrane structures: phospholipids are one class of membrane lipids and each molecule 
with a hydrophilic, polar head and two hydrophobic fatty acid tails, is capable of 
assembling with others to form a stable bi-layer in an aqueous environment.  They are the 
basis for cell membranes.   
 
- 
signaling: lipids can act as hormones for cell communication including prostaglandins and  
steroids, for example, derived from cholesterol - testosterone, estradiol, cortisol, 
aldosterone, etc. 

- 
other: lipids are also known for their pigment properties, for example, vitamin A is both a 
hormone as well as a pigment for vertebrate eyes.   
 
2.3 Biomolecules: electrical properties
 
One of the most potent forces for moving biomolecules is the electromagnetic (EM) field, one of 
the four fundamental forces of Nature – the remaining three being gravity, strong nuclear, and 
weak nuclear forces.  Biomolecules are generally responsive to the electric component of the EM 
field and electric fields are fairly easily generated – especially in today’s world of electronic 
devices and gadgets that supply electrical power.  For this reason, and the fact that electrons play a 
fundamental role in chemical bonds, the electrical (or dielectric) properties are detailed.    
  
2.3.1 Polyelectrolytes 
Polyelectrolytes are molecules with a large number of charged chemical groups. Example 
biomolecules typically referred to in scientific literature are DNA and collagen.    As introduced in 
the previous section, biomolecules, such as DNA and RNA possess a net negative charge. Proteins 
are made of amino acids that can be positively or negatively charged in varying amounts – and also 
dependent on pH or concentrations of anions and cations in solution.   
 
An electrolyte or aqueous environment with salts acts as a supply for dissociated ions for example, 
Na+, Mg2+, OH-, Cl-.   Consequently, if the biomolecule is electrically charged, it will attract ions of 
the opposite charge (or counterions) by Coulombic forces in order to restore charge neutrality.  
These counterions form a cloud around the biomolecule and act to electrically screen in the 
biomolecule by a certain amount.  Further away from the biomolecule, the charge of the

2. Biomolecules and their electrical properties
counterions themselves in turn attracts ions of the opposite charge that have the same charge as the 
biomolecule and are termed co-ions.  
 
This polyelectrolyte phenomenon is illustrated in Fig. 2-5, i.e. the same dsDNA as Fig. 2-3 
including the solvent.  The double-helical structure is shown to be straight in Fig. 2-5 but this only 
applies for relatively short lengths.  The mechanical properties of DNA are partly determined by its 
chemical composition.  As before, the sugar-phosphate ‘backbone’ is a misnomer and instead it is 
the stacking of the nitrogen bases that gives the molecule its backbone (Calladine & Drew, 1997).   
Fig. 2-5 dsDNA (or DNA) as a negatively charged polyelectrolyte in solution attracts positive 
counterions.  These form around the polyelectrolyte to electrostatically screen the charge.

2. Biomolecules and their electrical properties
The flexibility of DNA also depends on the ionic composition of the solvent. In the situation of low 
concentration of counterions there is little electrostatic screening of the polyelectrolyte with itself.  
That is, the biomolecule electrostatically repels itself, so to be energetically favorable it tends to be 
straight.  Conversely, in solvents with high molar counterion concentrations, screening occurs to 
the extent the biomolecule repels itself less, so it is more flexible.     
 
2.3.2 DNA can be modeled as wormlike chain  
 
A measure of straightness is known as the persistence length Lp, as sketched in Fig. 2-6.  Typically 
for standard biological conditions for dsDNA, Lp = 50 nm (Hagerman, 1998). In this way the 
behavior of dsDNA in water is modeled as a worm-like chain with each straight link equal to the 
Kuhn length that is twice the persistence length, LK = 2Lp long (Bloomfield et al., 1974; Viovy and 
Duke, 1993).  In this chain the next link is randomly oriented and independent from the previous 
link; randomness arises from thermal motion. This means that each link is about 100 nm or roughly 
30 double helical turns or 300 bp.  
 
 
 
A biomolecule moving in a solvent (e.g. DNA in water) can behave hydrodynamically as if it is a 
rigid body, such as, a sphere.  This is due to the worm-like chain retaining a roughly spherical (or 
ellipsoidal) shape due to ions and water molecules being attracted and dragged along with it.  The 
mass of DNA, ions and water exerts a hydrodynamic drag equivalent to a sphere with a radius, rh.  
This is the hydrodynamic radius and is an important parameter that can be inferred and estimated 
from experimental measurements (Newman, et al., 1974; Smith et al., 1996)

2. Biomolecules and their electrical properties
2.3.3 Biomolecules and bioparticles 
 
The electrical and hydrodynamic properties of the biomolecules may enable them to be 
approximated as a body or point-particle. That is, the biomolecule is assumed to behave like a 
fairly rigid body with known properties or parameters, for example, centre of mass, electrical 
charge, size (or volume), solid-solution interface, etc.  Appropriate circumstances for biomolecules 
to be modeled as bioparticles include, for example, instances where the biological or minute 
chemical activity is not being questioned; rather physical and broader questions are asked about the 
motion of the biomolecule for length scales much larger than the biomolecule itself.  There are a 
number of reasons for introducing and justifying the notion of a bioparticle: 
 
- 
the transport of bioparticles is more convenient to mathematically model compared with 
flexible biomolecules, such as, DNA. This applies to either approximate ‘back-of-the-
envelope’ calculations or with more sophisticated computer models. 
 
- 
the transport of bioparticles is often measured using fluorescence microscopy where the 
biomolecule itself is often not larger than the limit of optical resolution for recording; 
hence, a particle model is sufficient.  
 
- 
globular proteins and filaments with well defined shapes can be modeled as rigid bodies or 
bioparticles to a first approximation when applying Newton’s laws of motion. 
 
- 
the use of latex (polystyrene) and metal nano- and micro-spheres (or beads) in biological 
are increasingly being used in investigations for many purposes such as functionalizing 
biomolecules.  This means that it is not only the transport of biomolecules themselves that 
is of interest, but also the beads. The beads themselves can be used as a diagnostic and as 
‘ideal biomolecule’ for researching and developing transport processes.  
 
- 
modeling flexible biomolecules (e.g. DNA) as bioparticles is less straightforward than, for 
example, with beads but with care can be performed using parameters, such as, the 
hydrodynamic radius. 
 
Biomolecules that are modeled as bodies or particles are collectively called ‘bioparticles’.  Micro- 
and nano-beads capable of being biologically functionalized are also included.  Importantly, the 
dielectric properties of bioparticles are critical for the main transport process discussed in this e-
book.   
 
2.3.4 Electrical double layer 
 
Investigations on the behavior of polyelectrolytes and colloids that mimic bioparticles have 
indicated the presence of an electrical double layer, shown in Fig. 2-7.  Counterions adjacent and 
close to the bioparticle form the Stern layer.  Counterions further away from the bioparticle and 
Stern layer are more diffuse and screen the bioparticle charge in such a way as to attract co-ions.

2. Biomolecules and their electrical properties
In conjunction with the Coulombic and diffusive forces, the diffuse layer is subjected to 
hydrodynamic forces.  The ‘slip plane’ designates where part of the diffuse layer that moves with 
the body, in comparison with the remainder that tends to be dragged away by the surrounding 
medium.  The zeta potential )]  (not shown in Fig. 2-7) is the electrical potential at the slip plane 
(Pethig, 1979; Russel et al., 1999).  
 
2.3.5 Introduction to dielectric polarization  
 
Polarisation is a term that describes how charges, within a dielectric, respond to an externally 
applied electric field. Charges that are free to move reveal their movement on a macroscopic scale 
as conduction.  If the movement of the charges is blocked they are said to be ‘polarised’.  In this 
respect, polarisation is the ‘intention’ of the charges to move in response to an applied electric 
field. 
 
There are many of kinds of polarisation: electronic, atomic, molecular, interfacial (or space-
charge), and counterion polarisation.  The first three are attributed to the displacement, or 
orientation, of bound charges; the latter two concern movement on a larger scale.  Electronic 
polarisation arises from a slight asymmetric displacement of electrons (with respect to the positive 
nuclei of atoms) caused by an externally applied electric field.   
 
Atoms constituting a molecule, such as sodium chloride, have different net charges due to an 
unequal sharing of electrons. Consequently, when an external electric field is applied, the atoms 
behave differently.  This causes a displacement of the atoms, from their equilibrium positions, 
resulting in atomic polarisation.  An example of a molecule that exhibits atomic polarisation is 
sodium chloride. Both electronic and atomic polarisations are induced, and contribute only 
modestly to the total polarisability. 
 
The asymmetric distribution of electrons in molecules also gives rise to permanent dipoles.  The 
interaction of such a dipole with an externally applied electric field causes a torque that attempts to 
orient the molecule in the field direction.  The polarisation is appropriately called orientation, or 
dipole, polarisation (Von Hippel, 1954).  Water is an example of a molecule with a permanent 
dipole, and is responsible for manifesting a significant permittivity for frequencies up to 17 GHz.  
In summary, of the first three types of polarisation, only molecular dipole polarisation, tends to 
feature in the literature concerning dielectric properties of bioparticles and DNA.   
 
The last two kinds of polarisation, interfacial and counterion, involve large-scale charge movement. 
Currently, there is no universal consensus in the literature on the high frequency polarisation 
mechanisms for biomolecules, such as, DNA.  At present, the emphasis tends to favour Maxwell-
Wagner interfacial polarisation for bioparticles with well defined interfaces between AAs and 
water molecules, and counterion fluctuation polarisation, along the longitudinal axis, for DNA and 
probably for RNA.   
 
Interfacial, or space-charge, polarisation arises from free charge accumulation across the 
interfaces, between different dielectric materials, when they are juxtaposed.  The interfacial charge

2. Biomolecules and their electrical properties
accumulation, or polarisation, results in dielectric dispersions when the aggregate of dissimilar 
materials is exposed to AC electric fields (Pethig, 1979; Takashima, 1989).  The simplest form of 
interfacial polarisation is a Maxwell-Wagner type, and is detailed in the following chapter.   
 
Counterions are ions in solution that are attracted to bodies of the opposite charge.  They form 
‘clouds’ around the bodies that become distorted when an external electric field is applied.  
Counterion polarisation arises when the movement of these counterions is restricted.  Counterion 
movement around the surface of bioparticles, and along the double helical axis of DNA, is also 
detailed further in the next chapter.   
 
2.3.6 Polarisation parameters: a brief view 
 
The free movement of charges can be expressed, in terms of electrical circuit parameters, as the in-
phase conductivity; and the restricted movement, or polarisation, as the out-of-phase conductivity, 
(Pohl, 1978).  An equivalent, and frequently used alternative, is to parameterise the free movement 
of charges as the out-of phase permittivity Hcc, and polarisation as the in-phase permittivity Hc.  The 
complex permittivity H is the combination of these,

.  Polarisability is a measure of 
response of a body to an external electric field.  It is represented quantitatively by the constant, D.  
A highly polarisable body, for example, features many charges that are responsive to an electric 
field, but their movement is in some way restricted.   
 
The literature on dielectric properties of bioparticles and DNA suspended in solution, motivates an 
extension of equation (2.1) to include the conductivity (or low frequency Ohmic loss) of the ionic 
solution, V (Grant et al., 1978; Jones, 1995).  In addition, the frequency dependency is also made 
explicit, hence the relation for the complex permittivity becomes

Dispersions arise when the oscillating cloud of charges can no longer follow the alternating electric

Biomolecules can have more than one dielectric dispersion characterized by a decrement and 
associated time constant. The decrement, 'Hc, is used for experimentally characterising the 
frequency dependent polarisability of macromolecules and polyelectrolytes, such as, DNA.

2. Biomolecules and their electrical properties
Commercial time-domain dielectric spectrometers (Feldman et al., 1996; Kamyshny et al., 2000) 
can be used to estimate the dispersion decrement 'Hc and time constant ĲR using a sample, e.g. say 
150 microlitres (ȝl), of macromolecules suspended in an appropriate solvent, such as, water.      
 
The polarisability corresponding to a suspension of np bioparticles each with volume, V, or

2.4 Concluding remarks 
 
This chapter has described the structure and biological function of biomolecules and introduced 
their electrical properties as they behave in aqueous solution.  Concepts, such as double-layer, 
dielectric polarization, and bioparticle will be important for subsequent chapters that focus on 
biomolecule transport, particularly using electric fields.

3. Moving biomolecules using electric ﬁ elds
3 Moving biomolecules using electric fields 
 
It is often thought biomolecules that are electrically neutral do not move when an electric field is 
applied across, or external, to the suspension. This is true if the biomolecules are lying within in a 
uniform electric field – they remain stationary. However, it is not necessarily true if the electric 
field is nonuniform – the biomolecules may move in accordance with their dielectric properties 
relative to the medium they are suspended within. Electrophoresis is the movement of a charged 
biomolecule under the action of a uniform electric field; dielectrophoresis refers to the movement 
of under the action of a nonuniform electric field that depends on the dielectric properties. The 
biomolecule may be electrically neutral or charged. This chapter explains basics of biomolecule 
response to both uniform and nonuniform electric fields that forms a potent force underpinning 
current and emerging technologies. 
   
3.1 Electrophoresis 
 
When an electric field is applied, by energising a pair of submerged electrodes, to a charged 
biomolecule suspended in salt water electrolyte the surrounding double layer counter-ion cloud is 
disturbed.  The biomolecule itself is not entirely electrically screened - and ‘feels’ the presence of 
the field and moves under the action of Coulombic force.  Suppose for example the biomolecule is 
negatively charged (e.g. DNA); from Coulomb’s law, the biomolecule moves towards the positive 
electrode.  The counter-ions, that are positive by definition, will move towards the negative 
electrode.   
 
Since the counterions are moving in the opposite direction to the biomolecule and remain attracted 
to it, then the net force on the biomolecule cannot be simply described by Coulomb’s law. In 
addition, as the biomolecule moves, the effects of hydrodynamic viscous drag have an effect so that 
a ‘comet-tail’ shape tends to form behind the behind the biomolecule, O’Brien and White (1978) 
and DeLacey and White (1981). Taking these effects into account, the electrophoretic force 
(denoted by the subscript ‘EP’) is described by the relation,

(kg m-1 s-1) (Ohshima, 1997; Grattarola and Massobrio, 1998; Arnold et al., 1993; Reese, 1994).   
 
Biomolecules have charge proportional to length and mass. In suspensions of long biomolecules 
with thicknesses or width much less than their length, the viscous friction in water or liquid 
medium is also proportional to mass.  Therefore, the electrophoretic and viscous forces often 
negate each other and there is no net charge advantage.  Attempting to separate biomolecules based

on length or mass is unsuccessful. Instead, biomolecules can be separated using a porous medium, 
such as, a gel where the electrophoretic and friction forces do not cancel each other.   
 
3.2  Dielectrophoresis (DEP) 
 
If a biomolecule is electrically neutral so that electrophoresis does not occur, it can be moved by 
applying a non-uniform field.  To understand this phenomenon and its application, consider Fig.   
3-1 where a neutral bioparticle lies in a uniform field established by a electric potential difference 
being applied across two parallel plates.  The field causes elementary charge movement, within the 
dielectric material, that opposes the (original) field.  The movement of these charges resulting from 
the external electric field, results in induced dipoles, as shown schematically.  The charge 
movement is the same throughout the bioparticle. Consequently, the interaction of the uniform 
external field with the charges means the sum of the forces is zero and the neutral bioparticle 
(yellow) does not move.  In contrast the small positively charged test bioparticle (blue) experiences 
a Coulombic force, and moves to the left.   
 
The movement of charges within a neutral dielectric bioparticle, to establish equilibrium, also 
occurs when a non-uniform electric field is imposed, Fig. 3-2.  The charged regions have equivalent 
amounts of charge, as shown.  However, the strength of the electric field with which they interact, 
varies between local regions throughout the bioparticle.  Consequently, the total force on the 
bioparticle, equaling the sum of the Coulombic forces of each local region, is no longer zero and 
neutral bioparticle moves in accordance with the spatial distribution of field strength.

3. Moving biomolecules using electric ﬁ elds
 
Assuming the bioparticle is more polarisable than the surrounding medium, it moves towards the 
region of highest field non-uniformity.  The phenomenon is called dielectrophoresis (DEP).  
 
The imbalance of forces on the neutral bioparticle can be explained by considering two elementary 
charges +q and –q at A and B, distance d apart, Fig. 3-3.  The electric field at B is stronger than at 
A, EB > EA.  Assuming the forces are acting in the horizontal direction and using a standard 
convention where forces acting to the right are positive, and those to the left are negative, the sum 
of the two Coulombic forces is 
Fig. 3-2  Dielectrophoresis: the neutral body (yellow) in a nonuniform electric field (red 
arrows) experiences a net force depending on spatial distribution of electric field strength.  In 
this example, where the polarisability of the body is greater than the surrounding medium, it 
moves to the right (black arrow).

Fig. 3-1 Charge movement in a neutral bioparticle (yellow) in a uniform electric field (red 
arrows) results in induced dipoles (the sum of the induced dipoles represented by the brown, 
unfilled, arrow). The sum of the forces is zero so the neutral bioparticle does not move.  In 
contrast, a positive test charge (aqua), acting under a Coulombic force, moves to the left.  In 
this example, the polarisability of the bioparticle is greater than the surrounding medium.

and is positive, (i.e. acting towards the right). Note that the extra negative sign arise from the 
electric field acting towards the left.  
 
Expressions for the net force acting on a neutral bioparticle in a nonuniform electric field have been 
developed using the energy variation principle, effective moment method, and Maxwell stress 
tensor approach.  The effective moment method is the most straightforward, and includes situations 
where there is dielectric loss.   
 
Equation (3.2) can be evaluated using a Taylor series approximation,

where D is the induced polarisability, or effective dipole moment, per unit volume in unit electric 
field and has dimensions Farad per metre (Fm-1).  The physical-chemical origin of the polarisability 
was introduced in the previous chapter and will be discussed further in this chapter.  It is assumed, 
for the force to be proportional to the derivative of E in (3.3), that the dimension of the dipole p is 
small compared with the characteristic length of the electric field non-uniformity.  Any spatial 
electric field phase variation is considered to be negligible.   
 
Fig. 3-3 The displaced charges at A and B interact with the electric field, EA and EB, 
generating Coulombic forces, FA and FB acting in the opposite directions, as shown.  The 
force at B is greater than at A, FB > FA , so the neutral bioparticle moves to the right.

To keep the argument simple, our interest lies solely in the in-phase component of the DEP force 
and it is usual for experimental arrangements to supply electrodes with potentials of 180o phase 
difference.  Combining (3.3) and (3.4) and using the differential calculus product rule,

where the subscript signifies that this equation is applicable for a constant (DC) signal applied to 
electrodes.   
 
 
Equation (3.5) underlines an important property of dielectrophoresis; the direction of the 
force is invariant to the electric field direction (or sign of the electrode potentials).  This 
fundamental and important property means that the neutral bioparticle continues to moves in 
the same direction – independent of the sign of electrode potentials, as shown in Fig. 3-4.  
Therefore, alternating current (AC) signals can be used rather than direct current (DC) 
signals that tend to cause hydrolysis reactions between the electrode surface and electrolyte.  
Using AC radio frequencies above 1 kHz avoids hydrolysis for most water solutions that are 
not too salty. This enables microelectrodes with micron to sub-micron features to drive 
bioparticle or biomolecule transport for LOC-type applications.

where ‘small-time’ average, denoted by ¢  ²t, over an oscillation period and can be expressed in 
terms of the electric field root-mean-square (rms), Erms.  The DEP force is understood to be ‘almost 
instantaneous’.   
 
The proof for (3.6) is given in the next chapter that entails a higher level of mathematics needed for 
the more general three dimensional (3D) case. In terms of understanding and computing the DEP 
force, the electric field gradient for realistic geometric electrode designs can be determined, 
analytically for simple cases, or by appropriate electromagnetic simulation software.  The volume 
of the bioparticle V is usually known or can be estimated.  The remaining parameter is the 
polarizability, D, and it is important to discuss it in the following sections for at least three reasons: 
 
- 
the polarisability turns out to be frequency dependent so that its magnitude and sign will 
influence the direction and magnitude of the DEP force 
 
- 
the polarisability may be not be straightforward to calculate or estimate, and may need to 
be to be determined by experimental means, such as, by dielectric measurements

- 
the dielectric polarisability of biomolecules is not covered in usual biology textbooks at 
present, and engineering texts tend not to cover biology at the molecular level – it is 
interdisciplinary and somewhat specialist 
 
3.2.2 Maxwell-Wagner interfacial polarisation 
 
A schematic diagram of Maxwell-Wagner (MW) interfacial polarisation for an electrically neutral 
bioparticle (latex yellow) suspended in aqueous solution, is shown in Fig. 3-5.  The bioparticle lies 
in a uniform electric field established by an electric potential difference being applied between two 
parallel plates.  The charges have moved to their interfaces in accordance with Coulomb’s Law and 
their movement is the same throughout the bioparticle.  Consequently, the interaction of the 
uniform external field with the charges means the sum of the forces is zero and the neutral 
bioparticle does not move.  A comparison with the setup shown for DNA in Fig. 2-5 shows some 
similarities and also differences that are instructive to point out:   
 
- 
the bioparticle is electrically neutral, compared with the DNA that had a net (negative) 
charge. 
 
- 
the bioparticle lies in an externally applied electric field, compared with the DNA that did 
not have an electric field imposed on it. 
 
 
Suppose the potential on the electrodes is suddenly reversed to that they are opposite to the values 
shown in Fig. 3-5.  There will be time delay before the charges redistribute themselves, inside the 
body, to the imposed electric field.  There will also be a delay for the counterions to re-cluster 
around the polarised body.  The time taken for the charges to redistribute, or ‘relax’, is called the 
Fig. 3-5 Maxwell-Wagner (M-W) interfacial polarisation of a neutral dielectric body in a 
uniform field.  Charges accumulate at the interface between the dielectric sphere and the 
aqueous medium.

relaxation time. The movement of the charges, restricted by interfaces between layers, manifests 
itself as polarisation.  The delay also occurs when the electrode potentials are reversed, again, back 
to the original state.  Thus, applying an AC electric potential across the electrodes causes the 
charges within the bioparticle to be attempting to respond to temporal changes in the electric field.   
 
3.2.3  Maxwell-Wagner interfacial polarisation for bioparticles 
 
The polarisation mechanisms applicable to bioparticles or ideal biomolecules  (Sasaki et al., 1981) 
have been characterised by similar investigations on bioparticles and polyelectrolytes with 
spherical geometry, (O’Konski, 1960; Schwartz et al., 1962; Schwan et al., 1962; Lyklema et al., 
1983; Springer et al., 1983; Lyklema et al., 1986).  The expression for the effective polarisability, 
D, or dipole moment per unit volume per unit electric field, for interfacial polarisation of a 
spherical particle immersed in a medium is (Von Hippel, 1954; Jones, 1995)

The conductivity of the particle (bioparticle) Vp, of radius r, consists of the bulk conductivity Vb of 
the polystyrene and from ion movement shunted around, tangential, to the surface of the particle 
(O’Konski, 1960) with surface conductance, Ks (S). Ks includes ion movement in both parts of the 
double layer described in section 2.3.4 (Hughes et al., 1999).

Example: Typical values for the permittivities of water and 282 nm diameter latex bead as an 
example bioparticle are Hm = 78.4Ho and Hp = 2.55Ho (Green and Morgan, 1997a) 
where the permittivity of free space is Ho = 8.854u10-12 F/m. Selecting a low conductivity 1 mM 
potassium phosphate suspension, Vm = 0.018 S/m with bioparticle parameters, r = 141 nm, Vb # 0 
and Ks = 2.2 nS, equation (3.14) yields Vp = 0.0312 S/m, and (3.13) predicts fc = 5.23 MHz – which 
is close to the experimentally observed crossover frequency (Green and Morgan, 1997a).  Also the

There are several points to be highlighted 
 
- 
the transition from positive to negative DEP force, as the applied frequency f or 
conductivity Vm are varied, means these parameters can be varied to explore subsequent 
changes in DEP collection rates. 
 
- 
the region of the crossover frequency can be estimated from the M-W relaxation time. 
 
- 
experiments exhibiting a large deviation of crossover frequency, compared with predicted 
relaxation frequency, may indicate another polarisation mechanism is operating. 
 
 
3.2.4  Maxwell-Wagner polarisation for DNA 
 
Maxwell-Wagner polarisation models for DNA suspensions have been undertaken by a number of 
researchers, e.g. Grosse (1989) and Saif et al. (1991).  MW interfacial polarisation models tend to 
predict high relaxation frequencies in the order of 100’s of MHz and therefore appears to be a less 
successful model for explaining the dielectric behaviour of DNA than it is for bioparticles.  This is 
perhaps because relatively dilute suspensions of DNA exist as worm-like entanglements with a 
poorly defined interface compared with the well defined spherical or rod-like boundaries of 
bioparticles (Nagasawa, 1974; Bonincontro et al., 1984; Mandel and Odijk, 1984).

A brief account of MW polarisation is given. The DNA macromolecule is modelled as a long 
cylindrical insulating core surrounded by a highly conducting ‘sheath’, immersed in an electrolyte 
of low conductivity.  The model of the DNA is shown in Fig. 3-7; the amino acid, sugar phosphate, 
double helix that constitutes DNA with a diameter of 2 nm is represented by an insulator (light 
yellow).  The high conductivity sheath (light green) represents the bound counterions on the 
negatively charged sugar phosphate backbone.  The low conductivity electrolyte is shown as light 
blue medium.

Example: using Vs = 8.5u10-3 S/m at 25 oC, Qf = 0.20 %, Hrm = 78.4 and the fraction of condensed 
counterions, Ic = 0.25, equations (3.15) and (3.16) yield 'Hc # 0.42 and fR # 162 MHz.   
 
An alternative approach mimics the rod-shaped DNA macromolecule with conducting sheath by a 
randomly oriented shelled, prolate ellipsoid with a very short minor axis, and an extremely long 
major axis (Asami et al., 1980).  Again this approach predicts a very high relaxation frequency of 
hundreds of MHz (Bone et al., 1995).  Polarisation due to charge movement along, or across, a 
poorly defined boundary, such as, a double-layer is probably better explained with the counterion 
fluctuation model. 
 
3.2.5  Counterion fluctuation polarisation 
 
It is the response of the counterions to an externally applied AC electric field that results in 
counterion polarisation.  Since there is Coulombic attraction between the charged body and the 
counterion layer, the counterions attempt to pull the charged body along with them as they follow 
the electric field.  The double layer introduced in section 2.3.4 plays a key role in the movement of 
counterions and there are subtle differences in the two models between bioparticles and DNA, 
(Eisenberg, 1976).  
 
3.2.6  Counterion fluctuation polarisation for bioparticles 
 
Investigations of the low frequency dispersion of bioparticles have been undertaken by a number of 
groups, and was given impetus by Schwarz (1962) who derived expressions for the dielectric 
increment and relaxation frequency for a spherical particle.  In the model proposed by Schwarz, the 
counterions were so strongly attracted to the surface, they could only move along the surface but 
not perpendicular to it.  The effect of the diffuse layer was included in subsequent refinements of 
the model (Dukhin, 1971; Fixman 1980a; Lyklema et al., 1983; O’Brien, 1986) and accommodated 
radial and tangential ion movement, Fig. 3-8.

There has been much progress in understanding counterion polarisation mechanisms but further 
investigations are needed to resolve differences between theoretical predictions of dielectric 
dispersions and experimental data.  The dielectric increment and relaxation frequency are predicted 
by the following formulae that show the influence of the double layer. The thickness of the diffuse

Comment: the effect of the diffuse layer is shown by the reciprocal Debye length, Ns, in (3.17), and 
includes in the differential capacitance, Cd, parameter.  Thus, the diffuse layer influences both the 
increment, 'H(0), and relaxation time, W, through the dimensionless factor M in equations (3.18) 
and (3.19). Excluding the effects of the diffuse layer is achieved by allowing OD o 0 so M o 1 in 
both equations.

3.2.7  Counterion fluctuation polarisation for DNA 
 
The counterion polarisation mechanism is due to solution counterions (such as Na+, Mg2+, etc.) 
interacting with negatively charged phosphate groups along the DNA polyion backbone.  The 
counterions move freely along lengths of DNA in response to the component of the external 
electric field parallel to the major axis or ‘backbone’, Fig. 3-9. Their migration results in an 
induced dipole moment, and hence, an identifiable polarisability.  To reiterate: dispersions arise 
when the oscillating cloud of counterions can no longer follow the alternating electric field 
(Oosawa, 1971), and this effect is observed in both real and imaginary parts of the complex 
permittivity.   
 
 
A popular model of counterion polarisation is the Mandel-Manning-Oosawa model developed in 
various stages by these authors (Mandel, 1961; Manning, 1969, 1978a, 1978b; Oosawa, 1970).  In 
this model, the counterions move freely along macromolecular “subunit lengths” and are permitted 
to cross from one subunit to a neighbouring subunit only by overcoming “potential barriers” (van 
der Touw and Mandel, 1974: Part I, p. 223-4; Mandel, 1977). The subunit length Ls is described as 
the length along the average macromolecular conformation between “breaks”, or “potential 
barriers” resulting from perturbations in the equipotentials (due to conformational processes, 
folding, etc.), Fig. .   Counterions moving along these subunit lengths, under the influence of an 
external electric field, manifest high frequency dispersion – which is of major interest to DEP 
investigations.  The dispersion is also molecular weight independent.   
Fig. 3-9 Counterion polarisation on a short segment of DNA: a negatively charged sugar 
phosphate double helix attracts counterions.  Components of an applied AC electric field (red 
bi-directional arrows) causes counterion movement in the longitudinal direction - along the 
DNA backbone, and transverse direction (brown bi-directional arrows).  The counterion 
movement tends to be within the ‘cylindrical’ double-layer (light green).

3. Moving biomolecules using electric ﬁ elds
 
This polarisation scenario contrasts with molecular weight dependent counterion movement along 
the entire macromolecular contour length that results in low frequency dispersion and accounts for 
the static permittivity (van der Touw and Mandel, 1974: Part II).  It is also proposed (Manning 
1969, 1978a, 1978b) that a proportion of the counterions are so strongly attracted to the 
polyelectrolyte 
that 
they 
are 
said 
to 
‘condense’ 
onto 
the 
DNA 
backbone. 
   
Essentially there are three distinct phases: (Saif et al., 1991) 
(i) condensed counterions – these are sufficiently, but non-locally, bound (or ‘delocalised’) to the 
phosphate groups of the DNA, and thereby neutralise a fraction of the DNA charge. 
(ii) diffuse counterions which are responsible for neutralising the remainder of the DNA charge, 
with a density which decreases exponentially with distance from the axis. 
 (iii)  bulk ions or ‘added salt’ ordinary aqueous solution ions. 
 
In terms of their contribution to polarisability, the condensed counterion phase is the most 
important.  A feature of the condensed state is that the local concentration of counterions around 
the DNA does not tend to zero when the bulk electrolyte concentration does (Anderson and Record, 
1982).  Condensation occurs when the condition

Question: Suppose a sample of dsDNA is found to have dispersion with 'Hc = 9 and a 
relaxation time Ĳ = 500 ns.  What are the predicted subunit lengths?  
 
Answer: Equation (3.31) gives Ls = 100 nm and (3.32) gives Ls = 101 nm.  Physically, this is is 
very close to the worm-like chain Kuhn length for dsDNA.  In the framework of the 
counterion model, the result would support the notion that equipotentials arise from natural 
curvature of the dsDNA suspended in solution.

grooves of the DNA (Mashimo et al., 1989) and relaxation of DNA polar groups (Takashima et al., 
1984) - although some re-interpretations of the latter have favoured the “bound water” molecule 
approach (Takashima et al., 1986).  These polarisation mechanisms tend to predict very high 
frequency dispersions of the order of 100’s of MHz. Also the relaxation times have temperature 
dependence that predicts much high activation energies than measured.  Consequently they have 
received less significance in the literature (Bone and Small, 1995).  
 
3.3 Micro-environments for biomolecule transport
 
Micro-environments can be either naturally evolved (e.g. the interior cytoplasm of cell, cell 
membrane pumps) or artificial (e.g. made using photolithographic techniques).  It is the latter of 
focus in this e-book and photolithographic techniques have been advanced for making 
semiconductor electronic devices (Pacansky and Lyerla, 1979).  An example use of biomolecule 
transport lies in separation of biomolecules based on their size, dielectric constants, etc.
 
A chromatography microdevice is shown in Fig. 3-11 where red and green bioparticles are 
introduced on the left; the green are attracted to the planar electrode array by DEP forces generated 
by nonuniform field flux stemming from the array, whereas the red pass through.  The array is 
energized with AC signals with phases as shown.  Note that the first three electrodes on the left 
have the same phase so that there is little electric field flux created by them and so little DEP.  
Elsewhere the 180o phases difference gives rise to a nonuniform electric fields and hence, positive 
DEP (pDEP).  Details of the electric fields are given in Chapter 5.  Electrode widths, w, and inter-
electrode gaps, g, can vary considerably.  Those on the order of 10 microns (ȝm) are capable of

create DEP forces for technological application.    
 
The four main steps involved with standard photolithographic fabrication of the gold electrode 
array are described and illustrated in Fig. 3-12: resist (polymer) exposure, resist development, 
metal evaporation and lift-off.  The reason for using a titanium (Ti) under-layer of the gold (Au) is 
that it does not adhere to glass very well; so Ti acts to bond the Au to the glass.  
 
 
 
3.4 Concluding remarks 
 
Biomolecule transport in water using electric fields has been discussed in this chapter with the 
focus on movement on nonuniform electric fields called dielectrophoresis (DEP). DEP operates 
whether or not the biomolecule is electrically neutral or charged. The electric field can be said to

act twice: first, to induce a dipole, and second to interact on that dipole in an uneven way so as to 
cause movement.   
 
Inducable polarisability is fundamental to DEP and two key dielectric polarization mechanisms 
apply for motion in nonuniform fields.  The two mechanisms are Maxwell-Wagner interfacial 
polarization and counterion polarisation.  Interfacial polarisation arises from electric charge 
accumulation at well defined interfaces whereas counterion ploarisation arises from a condensed 
sheath of ions along the major axes of biomolecules, surrounded by a more diffuse layer.  The 
counterions attempt to move in accordance with the externally applied electric field and since they 
are also hydrodynamically coupled to the biomolecule by Coulombic attraction, also drag the 
biomolecule.   Micro-environments for creating electric fields use standard photolithographic 
techniques pioneered by semiconductor technology.

4 Basic micro- and nano-transport 
 
There are a number of computational approaches for predicting the transport of biomolecules in 
water and other fluids, such as, air.  The most straightforward method to model the transport of 
biomolecules in low to moderate concentrated suspensions is to consider the biomolecules as 
spherical or oblate spheroids and assume that they do not interact.  Most are not spheres or even 
rods.  DNA and double stranded RNA, for example, are considered as a freely jointed chain with 
straight segments corresponding to twice the persistence length (100 nm for double stranded DNA).  
The motion of each bioparticle is governed by four kinds of Newtonian force: inertial, external, 
friction and thermal.

As an initial approximation, it is reasonable to introduce the concept of a bioparticle as a sphere 
with effective hydrodynamic radius r moving through a fluid.  The inertial force is given by 
product of bioparticle mass m and acceleration,

4. Basic micro- and nano-transport
The relaxation time for a 200 nm bioparticle will be about a nanosecond, Ĳ = 1 ns. Biomolecules in 
their native environment (i.e. at standard temperature and pressure), being organic, have a density 
that varies but is generally on a par with surrounding water. Biomolecules do not sink in water as 
quickly as metals do or resurface like air; unless moved by external forces, they tend remain evenly 
suspended in water for quite long periods.   
 
The force due to gravity Fg, acting in the vertical direction (adopting the convention upwards as 
positive), can be written as the product of bioparticle mass m and gravitational acceleration g (that 
is assumed to have a constant value, g = 9.8 m s-2),

4.2 Electromagnetic forces acting on single biomolecules 
 
The constituents of biomolecules, such as nucleic acids, proteins, lipids, and fats mean often they 
are susceptible to electromagnetic (EM) forces. The influence on the biomolecule of the externally 
applied electric and magnetic components of EM radiation is discussed separately.   
 
4.2.1 Electric fields and electrophoresis 
 
Electric fields are generated often by applying electrical potentials to electrodes immersed in 
electrolyte solution.  Dissociated ions mean there are there are free charges in solution and 
subsequently a considerable amount of electrostatic screening. In the general case the potential, ĭ,

The last term in (4.12) introduces a slightly more compact notation for partial derivatives. 
Poisson’s and Laplace’s equations are solved by applying Boundary Conditions (BCs) for the 
potential and the electric field. There are two types of BCs, Dirichlet and Neumann, and these are 
described with examples in the next chapter.    
 
As discussed in previous chapters many biomolecules, such nucleic acids or proteins, are 
responsive to electric fields and laboratory electrophoresis equipment used today testifies to this 
property. It is a technique commonly used to separate biomolecules according to charge, and the 
electrophoretic (EP) force was expressed in equation (3.1).  It is easily generalised to 3D and to 
include time,

 and all other symbols are as previously defined.  If the electric field is very 
slowly oscillating (0 – 10 Hz), the then the biomolecule or bioparticle moves in accordance with 
the field.  Applying safe voltages across between the two wire electrodes immersed in a droplet of 
water (less than 30V, preferably platinum) a simple experiment can be set-up to show a sample of 
bioparticles oscillating in the suspension.  Note that bubbles arising electrolysis at the wires need to 
be channeled to avoid interference.  As the frequency is increased beyond 100 Hz, the bioparticles 
have less time to move with the field and eventually their movement is barely detectable.  
Mathematically, one can say that their small-time average is zero.  
 
4.2.2  Inhomogenous electric fields and dielectrophoresis  
 
As discussed in Chapter 3, using DC signals can cause problematic hydrolysis. Consequently, using 
more applicable AC signals, the small-time averaged DEP force is just half the DC value (shown 
next page)

As described in Chapters 2 and 3, the induced polarisability, D, or effective dipole moment per unit 
volume in unit electric field has dimensions Farad per metre (Fm-1).  It is assumed, for the force to 
be proportional to the gradient of E in (4.15), that the dimension of the dipole p is small compared 
with the characteristic length of the electric field non-uniformity.  Any spatial electric field phase 
variation is considered to be negligible.   
 
As in the 1D case in Chapter 3, our interest lies in the in-phase component of the DEP force since 
the experiments supply electrodes with potentials of 180o phase difference.  The polarisability is 
considered to be a real, scalar, quantity.  Writing the electric field is written in terms of angular

4.2.3 Electroosmosis 
 
Electroosmosis (EO) arises from an electric field being applied that is tangential to a surface where 
there is a double layer, described in section 2.3.4.  The electric field acts on the charges in the 
double layer causing them to move.  In this way the surface of electrodes, for example, with an 
electrical potential difference between them and immersed in an electrolyte will be surrounded by 
double layers that provide a source of electroosmotic flow.  The double layer around an electrode 
surface will be similar manner to the surface of a bioparticle illustrated in Fig. 2-7.   
 
There are two types of EO: DC and AC. DC EO is well known and finding application in 
microfluidics. The EO fluid velocity is proportional to the electric field and can be predicted using 
an electroosmotic mobility relation in a similar manner to EP.  AC is less well-known at present but 
important in non-uniform electric fields (Morgan and Green, 2003). Like DEP AC EO does not 
arise in a uniform electric field because the small-time averaged movement would be zero – as it is 
for electrophoresis. Instead it arises in a non-uniform electric field because there is time averaged 
movement.  
 
To understand this mechanism, consider an AC electric voltage applied to an electrode. At an 
instant in time during the cycle (electrode is say, positive) a double layer of counterions 
(predominantly negative) will form.  A tangential electric field generated by the electrode will act 
on the negative double layer charges surrounding the surface by Coulombic forces and the charges 
will move.  Conversely, during the part of the cycle when the electrode is negative, a positive 
counterion double layer will form and the direction of the tangential electric field will be opposite 
compared with before.  Therefore, the Coulombic forces on the charges will be in the same 
direction.  It can be said that, like DEP, there is a ‘double action’: the electric field sets up the 
double layer then acts on it, so small time-averaged flow results.  
 
4.2.4 Magnetic fields  
 
Biomolecules are not usually susceptible to magnetic fields, unless they are exceedingly strong.  
Again standard laboratory equipment demonstrates this property. A magnetic stirrer consists of a 
beaker with a magnetic stirring element at the bottom. Motion is transferred to the element from the 
base plate by a rotating magnetic field. The magnetic stirring element is able to do its job because it 
transfers only viscous forces to suspensions, and the magnetism does not attract biomolecules.  
Magnetic forces can be used, however, if the biomolecules are attached to para-magnetic 
nanospheres or other tiny biocompatible magnetically susceptible particles.  This is the basis for a 
number of new laboratory techniques and has been facilitated by the emergence new high-magnetic 
flux materials.  
 
Conceptually, magnetophoresis (MAP) is the ‘magnetic equivalent’ of dielectrophoresis (i.e. not 
electrophoresis).  The relations developed in the preceding section can be easily converted for 
MAP.  Unfortunately, in practice MAP is more difficult to currently achieve for micro-device 
applications as illustrated in Fig. 1-2 due to complexity of fabricating micro-coils. Developments 
may change this situation; for the time being our interest lies more in DEP than MAP.

4.3 Thermal fluctuations 
 
Nano-sized bioparticles in a liquid medium, at room temperature, incur incessant collisions from 
neighbouring molecules.  The collisions of the thermally agitated molecules with each bioparticle, 
are random in direction and time, and cause the bioparticle to move in a haphazard way.  This 
random movement is called Brownian motion, named after the botanist, Robert Brown, who in 
1827 observed the irregular motion of pollen grains suspended in water (Gardiner, 1985).    
 
To fully describe the irregular motion of the nano-scale bioparticle would require knowledge about 
the motion of all the colliding molecules.  This is practically impossible, therefore the motion of the 
bioparticle is described probabilistically.  At least two assumptions have been made about the 
nature of this probabilistic movement (Einstein, 1905): 
 
- 
the movement of each bioparticle is independent of the movement of all other bioparticles, 
 
- 
the movements of a particular bioparticle in successive time intervals are independent 
processes, as long as the time intervals are chosen ‘not too small’. 
 
There have been many experimental and theoretical studies of Brownian motion that indicate the 
two assumptions are essentially correct provided the suspension of bioparticles is dilute. The force 
exerted on the nano-scale bioparticle, from each thermal collision (Gardiner, 1985) is

where all symbols have been previously defined and the collisions are assumed to be spatially 
invariant, hence FTherm(t) is written without x dependence.  The statistical term, ( )t
[
, is called a 
random variable (RV) that describes the time of the ‘impact’ (Papoulis, 1984).   
 
The idea of a RV may seem foreign to some readers but it is helpful to think of examples in daily 
life.  Examples include the side of a coin, that shows heads or tails; or the sides of a dice that 
reveals numbers, 1, …, 6.  The RV has units of time in seconds (s-1/2) which may also appear 
strange to readers; the dimensions of FTherm are easily confirmed to be Newtons (N).  The impact of 
the nth bioparticle, out of a population of N, is written as,

and has important implications for transport processes where diffusion is dominant (diffusion

equation says that the effect of entirely randomizing the transport of bioparticles by stochastic 
thermal motion makes the average transport time dependent on the square of the length.  
 
This contrasts with controlled or deterministic unidirectional motion where the time duration 
between start and end points is linearly proportional to the length traversed, i.e. t

Micro- and Nano-Transport of Biomolecules

4. Basic micro- and nano-transport
Equation (4.32) says that the mean velocity is given by the DEP and constant forces (usually fluidic 
drift).  To determine spread of the particles requires either numerical, stochastic algebraic 
integration of the Langevin equation (4.29) or other approaches (Haken, 1978).  Stochastic 
integration is beyond the scope of this book.  Therefore, the result is simply given and it is called 
the Fokker-Planck equation (FPE), also Smoluchowski, Kolmogorov, modified diffusion equation 
(MDE), or continuity equation (van Holde, 1971; Risken, 1989; Doi and Edwards, 1986; Gardiner, 
1985). The latter title is not surprising since the expression can be developed from continuity 
considerations in a similar manner as Fick’s Second Law (Hiemenz, 1986), so the mathematical 
structure form can be verified.   
 
The bioparticle position, as the dependent variable in (4.28), is replaced by the spatial-temporal 
probability density p(x, t) of an ensemble (or population) of particles.  By definition for a 1D 
system,

The concept of probability density may sound rather strange to some readers but it becomes much 
more tangible when probability density is related to bioparticle concentration c(x, t), simply by the 
total number of particles in the system, N.  The probability density has the same units as 
concentration, and for a 1D system (m-1).

where the diffusion coefficient is D = kBT/] and it is understood p = p(x, t) and v = vdtm(x) is 
deterministic.   It is also useful to render the equation in terms of the “probability flux”, J(x, t).   
 
Again the notion of “probability flux” may be odd to some readers.  A simple way of thinking 
about it, leaving diffusion aside for the moment, in a 1D system it is the number of bioparticles 
passing by a point per unit time (or bioparticle flux) divided by the total number of bioparticles

with units (s-1).  Why use probability?  One pragmatic reason is that it’s convenient and easy to 
keep track of during computer simulations, since (4.33) implies that the spatial integral should sum 
to unity at all times.

4. Basic micro- and nano-transport
 
4.6.1 Example of one-dimensional (1D) MDE transport 
 
Boundary Conditions (BCs) and Initial Condition (IC) are needed to solve the partial differential 
equation (PDE).  A simple and important situation refers to bioparticles inside a chamber being 
drawn down to the array and where both the array and boundaries are impenetrable or reflect, i.e.  
bioparticle flux is zero.  An example of bioparticle collection under the action of a deterministic 
downwards force and then release after it is switched off is illustrated in Fig. 4-1.  
 
 
 
A cartoon showing particle distribution (side view) is shown in Fig. 4-1(a) Initially, the bioparticle  
distribution is uniform (i), soon after the electrodes are energised (t = ton) the dielectrophoretic 
force on nearby particles attracts them towards the lower boundary (array) causing a localised 
concentration increase and leaving a depletion layer above (ii).  The depletion layer widens and 
travels towards the upper boundary, and reaches steady state (t § tss) where the DEP particle flux is 
balanced by diffusion (iii).  After the DEP force is switched off (toff) the particles diffuse away 
from the array into the bulk, and the distribution returns to the initial state (iv).

.  As with the 1D system, 
one can view the 3D probability flux, leaving diffusion aside, as the number of bioparticles passing

When the probability density no longer changes with time and the lhs = 0, p(x, t) is said to have 
reached steady state, or become stationary, and the system of particles remains at equilibrium.  The 
probability flux arising from DEP is balanced by diffusion and the divergence of the flux J(x,t) is 
zero,

Point parameters such as probability density or concentration tend to be convenient for simulations 
but they are often not directly measured experimentally.  Instead, the initial collection rate and 
initial to steady-state transition are measured in terms of numbers of bioparticles or biomolecules at 
observed using a microscope at an instant in time, n(t), counted within a designated volume, Vdesig, 
or an observable indicator, such as, their emitted fluorescence, F(t).  For moderately low 
concentrations they are related,

4. Basic micro- and nano-transport
4.7 Concluding remarks 
 
The primary forces are introduced with emphasis on electrokinetic mechanisms, and in particular 
on motion arising from non-uniform electric fields (DEP). The forces are categorised as 
deterministic - that are known, such as, gravity or an ideal, noiseless electric signal; and stochastic 
– that are uncertain, for example, motions that arise from thermal random motion and give rise to 
diffusion.  Newton’s laws of motion are applied to develop a quantitative description of transport 
applicable for the micro- and nano-scales.  The single bioparticle motion is described by the 
Langevin equation that combines both deterministic and stochastic forces. The motion of a 
population (or suspended solute) of bioparticles can be derived from the Langevin equation and is 
described by the Fokker Planck, or modified diffusion, equation.  Alternatively it can be derived by 
quite simple continuity arguments.

5. Observing, quantifying and simulating electrically driven  
biomolecule microtransport
5 Observing, quantifying and simulating 
electrically driven biomolecule micro- 
transport 
 
This final chapter describes example computer simulations and real time recordings of bioparticle 
and biomolecule (dsDNA) transport under the action of nonuniform AC electric fields (DEP).  The 
transport process occurs in a micro-chamber and includes a diffusive component.  
 
5.1 Micro-device and experimental arrangement
 
An experimental arrangement for observing biomolecule transport in a microdevice setup is shown 
in Fig. 5-1. Fig. 5-1(a) is simplified from the general microdevice platform shown in Fig. 1-2 in 
that it is a non-motility arrangement transporting for biomolecules i.e. devices A and B.  The 
tracking of biomolecules as they move in real time is achieved by tagging or labeling them with a 
fluorescent dye and observing their microscopic movement with a epi-fluorescence microscope 
(Piller, 1977; Ploem and Tanke, 1987) with typically 200× or above magnification.  Usually a 
camera is used to record display biomolecule movement on a PC/TV screen - since the 
experimentalist often needs to perform other tasks away from the microscope, e.g. change controls 
on the signal generator.  
 
A plan view detail of the microelectrode ‘fingers’ that are responsible for generating electric fields 
that drive DEP biomolecule transport is shown in Fig. 5-1(b).  The interdigitated electrodes were 
microfabricated according to standard procedures described section 3.3.  Fig. 5-1(b) shows the

The experimental aims and apparatus is for a first stage characterization of a flow-through 
microdevice described in section 3.3, Fig. 3-11. This means that our interest lies mainly in the 
vertical movement of bioparticles rather than horizontal flow-through. Therefore, in the 
arrangement microdevice chamber does not require a comprehensive microfluidic arrangement 
with, say, flow-pumps and a screw-down sealed chamber.  Rather a simpler apparatus is sufficient 
at this stage and is shown in Fig. 5-3.  Referring to the photograph, Fig. 5-3, usually a 10 – 20 ȝl 
droplet of fluorescently labeled - and if needed, agent to reduce photobleaching - is micro-pipetted 
over the planar array and capped with a cover-slip to allow microscopic viewing and reduce 
evaporation.  In the photograph, narrow coverslips act as the chamber walls, as shown, so in Fig. 5-
3 the chamber height in the vertical y-direction is about h = 160 ȝm and the chamber ceiling is a 
coverslip.  The length of each ‘finger’ is the longitudinal z-direction is so long that edge effects can 
be ignored.

5.2 Observations and quantitative measurements 
 
When the electrode array is energized or switched on bioparticles randomly distributed in solution 
are attracted by DEP forces onto the electrode edges near where the electric field nonuniformity, 
and hence the DEP force, is the greatest.  The arrival and settling of bioparticles at the electrodes is 
called DEP collection, and camera images at different times are shown in Fig. 5-3.   
 
Microscope images of a DEP collection experiment of a sample of 216 nm diameter beads 
suspended in water inside a chamber is shown in Fig. 5-4.   A slice of the camera image is shown in 
(a) initially, about one second before DEP force was applied (or electrodes energized with signal) 
with the beads are exhibiting random Brownian motion; (b) about 37 seconds after DEP was 
applied; and (c) average fluorescence intensity, I(x) along the longitudinal z-direction as a function 
of the pixel count in the transverse x-direction.  Note that images (a) and (b) shown are strips one-
third of the original 720 pixel width and cropped for illustrative purposes.  Since the dimensions of 
the electrodes are small compared with their length, electrode end effects are ignored.  
 
5.2.1 Using geometry of DEP force aids quantification 
 
Quantification of the camera images was achieved by recognizing that for fairly low bead 
concentrations, the optical fluorescence in a given volume was proportional the number of beads. 
The volume was assumed a vertical thickness corresponding to the microscope depth-of-focus. 
Software coded in Matlab (MathWorks, USA) and the mathematics and image processing details 
can be found (Bakewell and Morgan, 2001; Bakewell and Morgan, 2004).  The geometry of the 
array governs the gradient of electric field-squared, which in turn governs the DEP force.  It is 
shown in the simulations comprising next section that solution for the components of DEP force, in 
the transverse direction, show the array is periodic every electrode width and associated inter-
electrode gap, i.e. w
g

.   
 
 
The periodic properties are exploited so that pairs of peaks of the intensity plotted in Fig. 5-4(c) can 
be summed and averaged to yield a second periodic average.  In addition, within the period there is 
Fig. 5-5 DEP bioparticle collection quantification (a) fluoresence intensity - periodic average (b) 
fluoresence intensity – further symmetric average yields characteristic.

 and characterizes the 
bead collection on the entire array at that moment in time (t = 37 s); thus, it is called a

space (x-direction) and time (or frame number) is shown in Fig. 5-6(a).  This surface encapsulates 
the fluorescence over the entire array versus time.  A 2D projection along the time axis is shown in

the edge of the electrode.

The 3D surface contains much useful information. However, 3D surfaces are not so convenient 
when many collection experiments are being compared.  Instead, a 2D summary time profile is 
more useful.  This is obtained by integrating the fluorescence over a interval between a lower and 
an upper limit, xl and xu, as shown in Fig. 5-6(b), or by finding either the value of each peak.  The 
former tends to be more robust against mechanical vibrations and sources of noise.  Integrating 
over xl and xu, for each fluorescence characteristic generated each frame, as represented in Fig. 5-
6(c) yields a collection time profile, Fig. 5-6(d).    
 
The profile shows that the greatest increase in fluorescence, and therefore bead collection occurs 
almost immediately after the array is electrically energized (DEP force switched on).  This is 
attributed to DEP flux solely acting and can be quantified by the collection rate transport parameter

– introduced in the previous chapter.  Thereafter the flux arising from diffusion acts 
against the increasing concentration near the electrodes edges so the collection rate decreases and

The fluorescence profile also shows time fluctuations on the scale of a few seconds.  These can 
arise from a number noise sources including mechanical vibrations and variations in the light 
source of the epi-fluorescence microscope.  Fluctuations are smoothed out by integrating the

fluorescence of the entire arrays and normalizing the fluorescence about the edges with respect to it 
(for brevity, not shown). Thus, the normalized fluorescence is typically around unity before the 
DEP is switched on and the collections start.  
 
5.2.2 DEP collections exhibit frequency and voltage dependence 
 
The time profile shown in Fig. 5-6(d) represents one collection experiment for an electrical signal 
with fixed radio frequency, 10 kHz to 20 MHz and amplitude.  Generally a sine waveform is used 
and is specified in terms of peak voltage, Vo or root-of mean of sum of the squares (RMS).     One 
of the electrode buses is generally ground (0V) so the peak electrode voltage difference is simply 
represented as the potential, ĭp or more conventionally, Vo (volt). Repeating DEP collection 
experiments for a range of radio frequencies and voltages of 216 nm latex beads yields varying 
collection profiles; typical ones are shown in Fig. 5-7.  
   
 
All red, blue and green profiles show normalized fluorescence, each measured and evaluated using 
the averaging procedures for a planar interdigitated array described above. Experimental 
parameters for the green profile were Vo = 2V and f = 2 MHz as indicated in Fig. 5-7.  The red 
profile was measured and evaluated with one experimental parameter the same Vo = 2V but the 
other signal frequency parameter had been halved to f = 1 MHz as indicated.  The blue profile was 
measured and evaluated with the potential doubled Vo = 4V but the signal frequency was the same 
as the green f = 2 MHz as indicated.  No collections were observed at 3 MHz.

Question: How can we account for these profiles evaluated from experiments given (i) the known 
Vo and f  parameter values, and (ii) the conceptual and factual material in the previous chapters ? 
Clues/hints:  start by asking what type of entity are we dealing with? Bioparticle or biomolecule? 
Think of the process: it is DEP driven transport with beads small enough so that Brownian motion 
plays a role.  What parameters does the DEP transport depend on?  
More clues and answers towards the end of the chapter! 
 
 
DEP collections of DNA and RNA biomolecules have also been performed, advancing the early 
pioneering work by Washizu (see refs).  The DNA was 12 kilobase pair (kbp) plasmid which 
means that the strands are joined together so they can be circular.  They are twisted – superficially 
like an elastic band that has been rolled between our fingers.  Dielectric studies on this DNA, 
purified using standard methods (Maniatis et al., 1982)  revealed three dispersions at 140 kHz, 2 
MHz and 12 MHz (Bakewell et al., 2000).   
 
Photos of fluorescently stained DNA are shown in Fig. 5-8; (a) before the DEP was switched on 
and (b) several seconds after the electrode were energized with Vo = 4.5 V and f = 100 kHz.  Time 
profiles for frequencies up to 2 MHz are detailed in Bakewell and Morgan (2006), they are 
qualitatively similar to those with beads in that the collections decreased with frequency.  Note that 
in Fig. 5-8(b) the DNA strands appear to span the inter-electrode 10 μm gaps.  This prompts 
questions: How long would be a 12 kbp (12,000 base pair) DNA biomolecule?  Hint: see section

2.2.1 on nucleic acids. Is it possible for one biomolecule to span the 10 μm gap? - even if the 
strands were cut so the DNA was no longer circular but linear? 
 
5.3 Simulations of electrically driven biomolecule micro-transport 
 
Prediction of biomolecule or bioparticle transport between locations in a microfluidic-type chamber 
is achieved by solving the modified diffusion equation (MDE) described in Chapter 4.  It includes 
deterministic (known) and stochastic (uncertain) terms and is solved so that transport is determined 
for spatial and temporal areas of interest. This means there are two steps for simulating the 
transport of biomolecules or bioparticles in microfabricated structures.  These are  
 
- 
solving Laplace’s equation for the electric field and hence the deterministic biomolecule or 
bioparticle DEP force and flux  
 
- 
solution of the diffusion equation modified to include DEP flux (MDE) thus predicting the  
biomolecule concentration over the spatial and temporal areas of interest. 
 
5.3.1 Determining the dielectrophoretic force throughout the chamber.  
 
The DEP force is computed from (4.18) by first evaluating the electric field.  As described in the 
previous chapter, the electric field is determined by solving Laplace’s equation (4.9) as an 
approximation to Poisson’s equation.

Again, the length of each ‘finger’ of the interdigitated electrode array in the longitudinal z-direction 
is so long that edge effects can be ignored.  This enables the solution space of Laplace’s equation to 
be reduced from 3D to 2D, thus, considerably saving computation resources (memory, speed, time, 
etc). 
 
Fig. 5-9 shows a contour plot of the solution for the electric potential, with normalized parameters 
and BCs as indicated: 
 
- 
Dirichlet BC at known potentials (V) along the electrodes (gold), as shown, and at solution 
space boundaries  
 
- 
Neumann BC, denoted ‘N’ at electrolyte solution glass interfaces and to preserve electric 
field symmetry, where the electric field component normal to the boundary is set to zero. 
 
The values used in the numerical finite element integration (FlexPDE, PDE Solutions, USA) of 
Laplace’s equation, w, g, h, and Vo are normalized for illustrative purposes, hence, arbitrary units 
(a.u.).  The contours of potentials are repeated (periodic) and exhibit symmety, therefore the width 
of the solution space for the DEP force is reduced to

‘feature lines’ into the FlexPDE software to achieve accurate prediction of the electric field.   Note 
that the left vertical BC above the electrode is Neumann since the potential cannot be specified 
above the electrode, only the gradient of the potential is zero - as the simulation shows in Fig. 5-9.

The positive force x-component over the half-electrode indicates that particles will be attracted 
towards the electrode/gap edge.  The negative force x-component over the half-gap indicates that 
bioparticles will be attracted in the reverse direction, resulting in them moving also towards the 
edge. The negative force y-component over the edge indicates that bioparticles in suspension above 
the planar array are attracted downwards towards the edge. The profiles decrease in their 
magnitude further away from the array with a behavior that stays much the same.  In summary, the 
positive DEP force is shown to act towards electrode edge thus confirming the experimental 
observations of bioparticles collecting on array edges in the previous sections.

5.3.2 Solutions of the MDE for predicting bioparticle collections 
  
The MDE partial differential equation (4.37) also requires BCs and an initial condition (IC) for a 
particular solution to exist.  This second set of BCs concern bioparticle flux and are not to be 
confused with the first set of BCs used to solve Laplace’s equation! The BCs in this example are 
that the bioparticle flux, J given by (4.38) is zero meaning that bioparticles cannot pass through.  
This is obvious for the lower and upper boundaries, shown in Fig. 5-12, since their glass and gold 
material properties mean they are reflective or impenetrable.  For the vertical boundaries, the zero 
flux BC may be less obvious.  One way to think of this is in terms of symmetry - that is, processes 
on each side of each boundary are the same so that the bioparticle movement that happens on one 
side mirrors, or reflects, the events on the other side.  This means that the net flux of bioparticles 
passing through each of these boundaries at any moment in time is zero.  
 
 
 
A realistic IC used for bioparticles is that they are uniformly distributed in the chamber.  Having 
established the BCs and IC, particle collections are simulated by specifying a designated region 
that mimics a realistic collection volume.  In the previous section 5.2 the collection area was 
defined by the depth of focus in the vertical y-direction. The transverse x-direction chosen depends 
on properties of the collection: 
 
- 
for bioparticles (beads), the collections occurred about the electrode edges  
 
- 
for DNA, the biomolecules collected in between the electrodes  
 
The MDE, BCs and IC are coded in application software, FlexPDE, that integrates (4.37) by finite 
elements (Zienkiewicz and Taylor, 1989).  Simulation results for bioparticles (216 nm diameter

latex beads) with parameter values that enable comparisons with experiments are shown in Fig. 5-
13.  The simulations were performed using the above methods with realistic values for parameters, 
e.g. h = 200 μm.   
 
5.4 Brief discussion of experiments and theory 
 
As a general observation the values for voltages are set lower than those used in the experiments.  
Compare the experimental 2 MHz green profile in Fig. 5-7 that used 2 volts with the comparable 
simulated 2 MHz green profile in Fig. 5-13 that used 0.6 volts.   Anomalous results were obtained 
when a value of 2 volts or more were attempted in the simulations, indicating the theoretical model 
is too sensitive and predicts DEP transport that is far stronger than occurs experimentally. In fact a 
steady state solution (for brevity, not described) predicted that all beads would be attracted out of 
solution by DEP onto the array leaving none in the suspension.  That is, a concentration or 
probability density in the bulk of zero.  Such an affect has never been observed to our knowledge.  
 
Comparisons of the trends of the initial collection rates of experiments, however, concurred with 
trends in the simulations.  Using the 2 MHz green profile as a ‘baseline’, consider the effect of 
doubling the applied voltage in Fig. 5-7 from 2 V to 4 V shown by the blue profile.  The initial 
fluorescence rate, given by the slope of the tangent,

in Fig. 5-13 – there is a four-fold change.  The simulations 
confirm the square-law dependence of the DEP bioparticle force on electric field (and hence 
electrode voltage) depicted in equation (4.18). It is easy to image that a four-fold increase of force, 
and hence, velocity or flux, of bioparticles into a tiny volume would lead to the same four-fold 
bioparticle number increase within that volume! Formal mathematical expressions can be derived 
using equation (4.42). So the simulations confirm the trend one intuitively expects.  
 
The same argument applies to comparing the effect of changing the signal frequency. Again using 
the 2 MHz green profile as baseline, consider the effect of reducing the applied frequency in Fig. 5-
7 from 2 MHz to 1 MHz as indicated by the red profile.  The initial fluorescence rate

, and green tangents in Fig. 5-13, there is a two-fold 
increase.  The simulations confirm the frequency dependence of the DEP bioparticle force on the 
inducible polarisability via the real part of the Claussius-Mossotti factor, Re{fCM}, section 3.2.3 
equation (3.12).  Inspecting the plot in Fig. 3-6, as the frequency decreases from 2 MHz to 1 MHz,  
the Re{fCM} increases from about 0.3 to 0.6, or doubles.  So the simulations and experiments 
concur and confirm the trends predicted by theory.  Thus one can encapsulate these results by 
suggesting that the bioparticle collection rates behave as,

Comparisons of the initial to steady-state transition for the experimental versus simulation are quite 
different.  The three experiments in Fig. 5-7 show steady state after two minutes.  However, only 
the green profile in the simulations, Fig. 5-13, could be considered to be quasi-steady state at two 
minutes; the red and blue are clearly not at this time point. Extrapolations of the blue and red 
profiles indicate the steady-state values are at least order of magnitude greater than the green 
profile!  Clearly, experiments do not concur with simulations for the initial to steady-state 
transition parameter despite being based on the same theoretical models as the collection rates.   
 
A rough summary of Fig. 5-7 is that the experimental transitions are nearly proportional to the real 
part of the Claussius-Mossotti factor and the voltage-squared.  In contrast, integration of (4.37) 
with (4.39) imposed predicts a theoretical exponential (Boltzmann) dependence on the DEP energy!  
Again the discrepancy appears to lie in sensitivity of values and the physical reasons are not 
entirely clear.  It appears one factor is fluid motion arising from hydrodynamic effects and 
electroosmosis that disrupts steady state conditions.   These additional effects are not included in 
the theory, nor is the fact the polarisability could saturate more than expected. An alternative 
approach is to use a DEP mobility relation (Asbury and Van Den Engh, 1998) in a similar way to 
electrophoresis and methods for inferring model parameters from data are being developed 
(Bakewell, 2008).  
 
DEP of DNA studies have also exhibited close agreement of experiments and simulations with the 
initial collection rate parameter in contrast to the initial to steady state transition.  Nonetheless, 
biomolecules themselves bring in further questions. We leave the reader to think about another 
question. For example, why are the DNA biomolecules bridged across the inter-electrode gaps in 
Fig. 5-8 when DEP force in Fig. 5-11 is shown to be localized around the electrode edges?  One of 
the answers could be that the presence of DNA biomolecule itself alters the electric field 
surrounding it in a way as to attract more DNA towards it. In fact bioparticles are known to form 
perl-chains that can bridge across the inter-electrode gaps for this reason (e.g. Llamas et al., 1998).   
 
5.5 Concluding remarks 
 
Laboratory apparatus, experiments and simulations of dielectrophoretic driven biomolecule and 
bioparticle transport over the micron and submicron scale has been described in this chapter.  The 
chapter draws on concepts and theory developed in previous chapters and describes how 
geometrical properties of the sample chamber can be exploited to enable experimental 
quantification biomolecule and bioparticle transport in space and time. The geometrical properties 
of the sample chamber have also been used to simulate transport using Laplace’s equation and the 
modified diffusion equation.  Comparisons between experiments and simulations using the initial 
collection rate parameter show agreement in trends that depend on signal frequency and voltage.  
However, there are differences in terms of sensitivity and this is observed in the initial to steady-
state transition parameter. In summary, experiments and simulations confirm the basic theoretical 
framework of DEP driven transport but also raises a need for further modeling of other 
electrokinetic phenomena supported by experimental investigations.
