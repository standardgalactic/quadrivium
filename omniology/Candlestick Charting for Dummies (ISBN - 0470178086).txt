Author’s Acknowledgments
The most thanks must go to my wife Merribeth who through a very difficult
year, that included producing this book, always was willing to yield to the
time I needed to complete this project. Maggie, my daughter, was also always
a helpful participant by working quietly alongside of Daddy when he needed
to work. To Emmy, who discovered how to push buttons while this book was
being written, thanks for not turning the computer off when Daddy hasn’t
saved his work.
Thank you to a few current professional associates who’ve been very helpful
recently: Mike Wilkins, Bill Annis, and Patrick Guinee. Also, there are some
people that I professionally lost touch with that helped guide my career, and I
feel I’ve never properly thanked them: R. Patrick Jones, Mickey Hoffman, and
Michael Orkin. These people stand out the most in my mind, so I’m taking
this opportunity.
As far as the mechanics of putting the book together, Stacy Kennedy,
Acquisitions Editor, Chrissy Guthrie, Senior Project Editor, and Carrie
Burchfield, Copy Editor, were extremely helpful for this non-writer. Tim
Brennan, the technical editor, did an excellent job pointing out areas that
needed some improvement. Brittain Phillips gets a special thank you for
taking what I’m trying to say and making it readable. Also, I can’t go without
acknowledging Michelle Hacker, Editorial Manager, who introduced me to the
people at Wiley Publishing, Inc. Without her I never would’ve had the chance
to produce a book.

Candlestick Charting For Dummies

Introduction
Years ago, when I was playing around with my first quote machine on the
floor of one of the Chicago exchanges, I came across the candlestick
charting function. My personal charting software, which I ran on a DOS-based
PC with no hard drive (yikes!), had no such function. When the candlestick
chart popped up on the screen, I was fascinated by what came up, and my
curiosity was piqued. The charting system looked useful and promising, but 
I didn’t know much about it. It wasn’t like I could just run an Internet search
on candlestick charts to find out more, so I proceeded to the exchange
library to find out about candlesticks.
The exchange library was stocked with just about every investment and 
trading related book in and out of print, but I was surprised to find very little
information on my newly discovered method of charting prices. I could find
only one book about candlestick charting, along with a couple of articles.
And the articles were about the book! Not exactly what I’d call a wealth of
information.
Fast forward to today. Candlestick charting is now far more of a mainstream
trading tool than it was when I first saw it flash up on the screen of that 
primitive exchange floor computer. In fact, I recently noticed that the charts
used in the Wall Street Journal are now candlestick charts. But although 
candlestick charts are more common in the financial world, not very many
traders take full advantage of the vast potential of candlesticks.
I’m hoping to do my part to change that with this book. Candlestick charts
can be hugely helpful in nearly every aspect of trading, and savvy traders
should take the time to understand candlesticks and how they can enhance
and enrich any trading strategy.
About This Book
This book isn’t intended to be an end-all-be-all guide to profitable trading. 
It’s meant to provide readers with some insight into how candlesticks are 
created and how they can be used to analyze the psychology behind what
happens over the course of trading days. (When I say “psychology,” I’m not
trying to conjure up images of Freud and Rorschach tests; I’m talking about
the motivating factors that help to determine how the market behaves.)

I hope that the candlestick methods described in this book help readers to
make trading and investment decisions that lead to solid profits, but unfortu-
nately, there’s no guaranteeing that. What I can guarantee is that after reading
this book (or even parts of this book), you can gain a useful understanding 
of what candlesticks are, what they represent, and how they can be used in
trading.
Conventions Used in This Book
To help you navigate this book, I use the following conventions throughout:
 Italics are used for emphasis and to highlight new words that are 
presented with easy-to-understand definitions.
 Boldfaced text is used to indicate key words in lists.
 Monofont is used for Web addresses.
I make an effort to use as many examples as possible in the text, and each
and every example I present is one that I found while searching through
actual charts. I did that to show you not only how common it is to come
across these candlestick patterns in everyday trading, but also how emi-
nently possible it is to use them in live trades. They’re out there, and they’re
waiting for you to harness their power!
Also, with each new candlestick pattern that I introduce, I present at least
one case where it succeeds in producing a useful signal and one where it 
produces a dud. Candlesticks are terrific, but they’re not perfect, and 
recognizing the failure of a signal is just as important as picking up on a 
valid signal.
What You’re Not to Read
When you come across the Technical Stuff icon, you may skip ahead because
this icon indicates information that’s additive to trading knowledge, but not
essential to gaining knowledge about candlestick charting.
You can also skip the sidebars that are placed throughout the text if you’re
pressed for time or you want only the essential information. Sidebars contain
nonessential material, and you can tell them apart from the rest of the text
because they’re placed in gray shaded boxes.

Candlestick Charting For Dummies 

Foolish Assumptions
Because knowledge of candlesticks varies widely from trader to trader —
even traders with the same amount of trading experience can differ quite a
bit in their candlestick know-how — I’ve made the assumption that you 
have at best a very basic understanding of what comprises a candlestick
chart. My apologies if you already know a little about candlesticks, but hey, it
never hurts to review and hone those essential candlestick skills. I build
understanding from the ground up, beginning with how to create individual
candlesticks and finishing with how complex candlestick patterns can be
combined with other forms of technical analysis. Also, I’m operating under
the assumption that you’ve had some sort of experience trading a stock or 
at least a mutual fund. I assume that you’ve spent some time looking over
stock charts in the past too.
How This Book Is Organized
I’ve organized Candlestick Charting For Dummies into five parts. Each part
offers a different set of information and skills that you can take away to 
incorporate in your personal trading strategy. You get a feel for candlestick
basics or understand some simple candlestick patterns and how to trade
based on them. You tackle some more complicated patterns and figure out
how it’s possible to use candlesticks in tandem with other popular technical
indicators. The possibilities for candlestick charts are many and varied, 
and I do my best to touch on a wide range of their uses and benefits.
Part I: Getting Familiar with Candlestick
Charting and Technical Analysis
In the first part of this book, I introduce candlestick charting and some other
basic charting concepts. You may be wondering what advantages candle-
sticks have over other types of charts. Believe me, the rewards are plenty,
and you can read all about them in Chapter 2. Want to know what price data
elements are combined to generate a candlestick? That’s all contained in
Chapter 3, along with some information on how to embrace the other types
of data that you may run into when reviewing candlestick charts. And in the
last chapter of Part I, I also let you know how to tap into a variety of free and
for-purchase electronic resources for charting, which are critical in today’s
high-tech trading environment. I even include a low-tech alternative: how to
draw charts yourself.

Introduction

Part II: Working with Simple 
Candlestick Patterns
Part II features descriptions and explanations of some of the most basic and
common candlestick patterns. The simplest candlestick patterns involve just
one day or one period of price data, and you can find information on those
patterns in Chapters 5 and 6.
Two-stick candlestick patterns are one step up from those basic patterns, but
just a single step up in complexity can provide quite a bit of additional infor-
mation and versatility. Some extremely helpful two-stick candlestick patterns
pop up frequently on candlestick charts, and if you want to really capitalize
on candlesticks in your trading strategy, you need to know how to identify
and trade them. Don’t worry; I’ve got you covered in Chapters 7 and 8, which
wrap up Part II.
Part III: Making the Most 
of Complex Patterns
Three-stick patterns are the most complex patterns that I deal with in this
book, and their nuts and bolts are explained in this part. (Three-stick pat-
terns in Part III — convenient, right?) Like their one- and two-stick counter-
parts, three-stick patterns tell you what a market or security is about to do
next, and the added stick means that these patterns are a bit more rare but
that much more exciting. You can get your three-stick candlestick pattern
bearings in Chapters 9 and 10.
Part IV: Combining Patterns 
and Indicators
I begin Part IV with Chapter 11, which offers a more in-depth discussion of
several other technical indicators. It’s useful for any trader to understand 
a variety of indicators because you can use them alone, to confirm your 
candlestick signals, and in combination with candlestick patterns.

Although candlestick patterns alone have proven to be reliable trading tools,
using them in combination with other indicators can greatly enhance their
ability to predict the future direction of a market or a stock. In the rest of Part
IV, I take some simple and complex patterns and combine them with pure
technical indicators to show you how coupling the two techniques can lead
to profitable trading. The chapters in this part are chock-full of fascinating
real-world examples from a variety of markets and industries.
Part V: The Part of Tens
You can’t have a For Dummies book without a Part of Tens, and this book 
is certainly no exception. The final part includes a few helpful lists, including
myths about trading, a few things to keep in the back of your mind about
charting, and some resources that you can consult to further your 
candlestick understanding.
Icons Used in This Book
I used the following icons throughout the book to point out various types of

Introduction

Where to Go from Here
To figure out which area of this book to dive into first, think hard about what
facet of candlestick charting you want to understand. Want to get grounded
in the basics, or polish up on a few candlestick fundamentals that you may
have forgotten since you read that online article about candlestick charting
months ago? Check out the next page, on which Part I begins.
If you want to get cracking and find out about a few real candlestick patterns
and how they can tell you what a market or security is going to do next, 
I suggest that you flip to one of the chapters in Parts II or III. I cover many
candlestick pattern examples in those chapters — more than enough to give
you plenty to look for as you pore over charts on the Web or on a charting
software package.
You may have been recently exposed to some other technical indicators 
and it’s possible that reading about candlesticks alongside some of that famil-
iar material may help you get your feet wet. If so, make a beeline for Part IV, 
and enjoy!
The water’s fine no matter where you choose to dive in, and you’re just 
a few page-turns away from adding a powerful weapon to your trading 
arsenal.

Technical Analysis

In this part . . .
I
don’t know of any traders or investors who’ve taken
the time to fully understand candlestick charting and
then not used the techniques in their trades. After you’ve
taken the time to grasp candlestick basics, it’s tough to
deny their advantages over other types of charts, and the
profits can certainly speak for themselves. But the basics
must come first, and that’s what Part I is all about.
I begin this part by setting candlesticks in context with
several other types of charts, so you can get a feel for can-
dlestick benefits. After that, I explain the price action and
signals that candlestick charts generate, and I show you
how a candlestick is constructed and what its variations
can mean. To close Part I, you look at the range of elec-
tronic resources available for candlestick charting, which
you can exploit with just a few clicks of your mouse.

 Understanding a few trading and investing basics
T
he advent of the Internet has leveled the playing field for securities traders.
Access to markets once meant placing orders through a broker, and now
it’s little more than a couple of mouse clicks away. Commission rates are dra-
matically lower, and access to market information is now in many cases free.
Getting into securities trading is now easier than it ever has been, and the
result is a whole generation of investors and traders that handle their
finances without professional help. Technology allows these people to enjoy
many new types of market information, and one of the best tools available is
candlestick charting.
Candlestick charting methods have been around for hundreds of years, 
but candlesticks have caught on over the past decade or so as a charting
standard in the United States. I’ve been working with candlestick charts for
quite a few years, and I’ve seen many traders — novice to professional —
develop a fierce loyalty to candlesticks after taking the time to understand
their uses and potential. I think you’ll feel the same way, and this book is the
first step on the path to conquering candlesticks.
The material contained in this chapter exposes you to many of the facets of
candlestick charting that continue to fuel its rise as one of the most popular
charting techniques. I begin with the overall role of candlesticks within the
context of charting. I cover the advantages of candlestick charting, and the
basics of candlestick construction. I also take the opportunity at the end of

this chapter to discuss how to get started as well as give some insight into
the characteristics and habits that successful traders employ in their pursuit
of profits. Enjoy, and happy charting!
Considering Charting Methods 
and the Role of Candlesticks
With advancements in technology and the growing availability of trading and
investing resources available to traders, many options exist for the charting
of securities. There are several different types of charts and dozens of varia-
tions and features to be configured on each type. It’s important that you’re
clear on the options and, perhaps more importantly, why candlestick chart-
ing is at the top of the heap. This section explains.
Getting a feel for your options for charting
When it comes to alternatives to candlestick charting, the three main charting
contenders are as follows:
 Line charts: These charts are simple and helpful for short-term decisions,
but they’re quite limited in the amount of data presented.
 Bar charts: These are much more useful than line charts and are the
most common, but they’re not as versatile as candlestick charts.
 Point and figure charts: These are tried-and-true charting methods, and
they’re great for recognizing support and resistance levels, but they’re
far less dynamic than candlestick charts.
Each one of these charting methods can be used effectively to ratchet up the
effectiveness of your trading strategy, but they pale in comparison to candle-
stick charts for a number of reasons, a few of which I describe in the next 
section.
Realizing the advantages 
of candlestick charting
You’d be hard pressed to find someone who’s more enthusiastic about 
candlestick charting than yours truly. I can go on and on about the advan-
tages that candlesticks afford. If you want to read more of my gushing about
the many great advantages of candlestick charting, turn to Chapter 2, but
here are my top reasons:
10
Part I: Getting Familiar with Candlestick Charting and Technical Analysis 

 One of the best features of candlestick charting in general is the visual
appeal and readability. You can glance at a candlestick chart and quickly
gain an understanding of what’s going on with the price of a security.
You can also tell whether sellers or buyers have dominated a given day,
and get a sense of how the price is trending.
 Also, even after reading up on the most rudimentary of candlestick basics,
you can easily spot the opening and closing price for a security on a 
candlestick chart. These price levels can be very important areas of sup-
port and resistance from day to day, and knowing where they are can be
extremely helpful, especially for short-term traders.
 Candlesticks aren’t just a pretty face. Candlestick charts also feature
specific patterns that you can identify and use to decide when it’s time
to buy, sell, or wait on a trade or investment. These patterns can be a
real boon to your work with securities, and you can combine them with
other technical indicators for even more reliable results.
Understanding Candlestick Components
You can’t trade and invest effectively by using candlestick charts unless you
understand candlestick patterns, and you may have a very hard time under-
standing those patterns if you aren’t familiar with basic candlestick construc-
tion. Candlestick charting starts with the knowledge of what it takes to make
a candlestick and how changes in that basic information impact a candle-
stick’s appearance and what it means. For starters, you need to know what
goes into creating a candlestick’s wick (the thin vertical line) and its candle
(the thick part in the middle).
The following four pieces of information are combined to create a candlestick:
 Price on the open: The price at which a security opens on a given period
is the first piece of information used in creating a candlestick. Depending
on whether the security’s performance is bullish or bearish, the opening
price corresponds to either the bottom edge of a candlestick’s candle or
the top edge.
Candlesticks that represent bullish price action appear white on a chart,
and candlesticks that represent bearish price action appear black.
 High price: The highest price that a security reaches during a given
period corresponds to the top of a candlestick’s wick. If a security opens
at a certain price and then trades consistently lower than that price
throughout the period, there won’t be any wick at all above the candle.
 Low price: The lowest price that a security reaches during a period cor-
responds to the bottom of a candlestick’s wick. If the price action for
that period is extremely bullish and prices trade higher than the open,
there won’t be any wick below the candle.
11
Chapter 1: Understanding Charting and Where Candlesticks Fit In

 Price on the close: After a security finishes trading during a given period,
its closing price is the last piece of information used to create a candle-
stick. Depending on the security’s performance during that period, the
closing price can correspond to either the top edge of a candlestick’s
candle (if the period was bullish) or the bottom edge (if the period was
bearish).
As a true candlestick devotee, I believe that you can gain far more insight into
a period’s trading by looking at a candlestick than you can by looking at
another type of charting tool. Want proof? Take a look at Figure 1-1.
You can tell right away that the up day has a white candle and the down day
has a black candle. That simple difference alone clearly reveals the nature of
the price action that took place during that period. In the case of the candle-
stick with the black candle, there was more selling pressure than desire to
buy. And the candlestick with the white candle indicates that there was more
buying pressure than desire to sell.
Why is this so important? Candlestick charts quickly clue you in on the type
of buying and selling that’s been going on during a given period and where it
may occur again. In many cases, the buyers continue to buy and the sellers
continue to sell during subsequent periods or if the price reaches a level that
has spurred them to action in the past.
For more information on candlestick construction, refer to Chapter 3.
Working with Candlestick Patterns
The components of a candlestick may be the bones of candlestick charting,
but candlestick patterns are the heart and soul. Patterns appear on candle-
stick charts as simple, single-stick occurrences or complex, multi-stick

formations, and many different types of patterns can tell you what may be in
store for a security that you’ve had your eye on for trading or investing. And
knowing what may lie ahead can be the difference between a profitable trade
and a flop.
Candlestick patterns indicate when prevailing trends reverse or when they
continue. Both types of patterns are very useful because they tell you when
to get into a trade, when to get out of a trade, when a trade you’re in may
make no sense, and even when to hang onto a trade you’re already in. Check
out Chapters 5 through 10 for more info on identifying and trading on a wide
variety of candlestick patterns.
Simple patterns
Some candlestick patterns are very simple: A single candlestick on a chart
can serve as a candlestick pattern. A single candlestick that signifies time to
buy or sell is very appealing to traders who are just starting to work with
candlestick charts because after you understand the basics of candlestick
construction, you can immediately start identifying simple patterns and using
them to make more informed trading decisions. Flip to Chapters 5 and 6 for
several great examples of how just one candlestick can tell you what a secu-
rity’s price is going to do in the immediate future.
I also consider double-stick candlestick patterns as simple patterns, and you
can explore several varieties in Chapters 7 and 8.
Complex patterns
When a candlestick pattern includes three periods’ worth of price action
(three candlesticks), I consider it a complex pattern. Many complex candle-
stick patterns require specific price activity over the course of three days 
for the pattern to be considered valid, and I discuss a range of them in
Chapters 9 and 10.
Complex candlestick patterns can be frustrating at times because you may
watch with anticipation as a pattern develops nicely for the first two days
only to fizzle out on the third.
Complex candlestick patterns are more rare than their simple counterparts,
but they can be worth the wait. Because the conditions and criteria for a
complex pattern are so specific, it’s more likely that the signals they offer will
be good ones.

Chapter 1: Understanding Charting and Where Candlesticks Fit In

Making Technical Analysis Part of 
Your Candlestick Charting Strategy
A stunning amount of mathematical ingenuity is applied to security trading
analysis. The options for technical analysis can be as simple as the average 
of a few days of closing prices and as complex as applying calculus to price
action to indicate the momentum of prices. The possibilities are endless, and
you shouldn’t be shy about including some of them in your trading strategy
alongside candlestick charts.
Take the time to get familiar with an array of technical indicators to make you
a more versatile trader and enrich your work with candlestick charts. For
example, it’s great when you spot a candlestick pattern indicating that it’s
time to buy, and at the same time, your favorite technical indicator is also
flashing a buy signal. Combining trading tools helps build your confidence
and can help you quickly determine when a trade isn’t going to work out,
allowing you to exit with minimal losses.
I explore several different types of technical indicators in Chapter 11 and clue
you in on a few ways that you can combine these indicators with candlestick
patterns in Part IV (Chapters 11 through 15). Find a few technical indicators
that match up to the type of trading you want to pursue and add them to
your candlestick charts. Read up on the choices, and if Chapter 11 isn’t
enough, you can always turn to Technical Analysis For Dummies (Wiley) by
Barbara Rockefeller. The added understanding of technical indicators can
really aid you in your candlestick charting efforts.
Trading Wisely: What You Must Under-
stand Before Working the Markets
Security trading and investing can be a financially rewarding and fulfilling
experience, but it’s far from a risk- and stress-free undertaking. I want to
make clear to you a few key points and concerns before diving into my 
candlestick charting discussion, so that you’re fully aware of what you’re 
up against and what you can do to maximize rewards and minimize risks.
Trading can be an expensive endeavor
There’s money to be made on the security markets, but don’t be fooled 
into thinking that earning profits is easy or effortless. Many smart people
have taken on trading as a hobby or profession and been quickly humbled 
14
Part I: Getting Familiar with Candlestick Charting and Technical Analysis 

by poor trades and losses. Do your homework and practice wise money man-
agement, or you could end up joining their ranks!
By doing homework, I mean look at charts and develop a trading plan. The
more you prepare, much like for a test, the better your trading results should
be. I’ve seen a direct correlation between the level of trading success I’ve
achieved and how much time I’ve put into preparing for trading situations. 
As far as wise money management, the key here is making sure to take a loss
when it becomes apparent a trade isn’t going to work. Take the loss and move
on. Take this loss early and quickly before it becomes a much bigger loss.
The most important rule for managing your trading and investing funds is to
not risk money that you can’t afford to lose. There are many obvious and
unforeseen risks in the financial markets. If your lifestyle changed dramati-
cally because a trade or investment wiped out your account, then you’re
probably putting too much of your personal net worth on the line.
Paper trading costs you nothing but time
Paper trading refers to the practice of tracking trades on paper that haven’t
been traded in an account. Professional traders tell you that paper trading
isn’t the same as putting real money at risk on the markets. As a professional
trader, I totally agree. The emotional rollercoaster involved with making and
losing money can’t be matched in a dry run. But if you’re a novice who’s just
starting to understand the ways of the market, I think paper trading is a great
idea. The risks are nil, and the educational benefits are outstanding. Even
after 15 years of trading experience, I still tend to paper trade new ideas or
systems for a while before putting real money to work.
If you’re new to trading, test out your trading ideas and refine your trading
strategy by signing up for a trial account online with an electronic broker.
(You can read all about electronic trading resources in Chapter 4.) All you
stand to lose is a little time and some pride. But that’s better than jumping
right into a live trading scenario and getting taken to the cleaners!
Developing rules and sticking to them
Throughout this book, I stress the importance of setting rules for yourself
and sticking to those rules. I just can’t stress enough what a good practice
that is for any trader. Making and losing money on the market is a very emo-
tional experience, and one of the main reasons some traders lose big when
they should lose just a little (or even win) is that they let their emotions take
control of their trading. You can help take emotions out of the equation if you
develop trading rules and adhere to them no matter what happens.
15
Chapter 1: Understanding Charting and Where Candlesticks Fit In

Create a set of trading rules for yourself, and stick to those rules. Include rules
such as the following:
 When to get into trades
 Where to place stops in various trading situations
 What amount of money to risk on trades and investments
 When to get out of trades, either with a loss or profit
Write down your rules and keep them handy for a quick review when you’re
in the midst of a trade, and you’re having second thoughts about what action
to take.
I’ve been trading for a long time, and I can say without reservation that creat-
ing and adhering to a set of trading rules is the best way to reward yourself
both personally and financially for the effort you put into the markets. I
always follow the rules that I’ve set for myself, and although it may sound
crazy, at this point I’m more proud of my rules than I am of my profits. All
traders have to come up with their own sets of rules that talk to their trading
style and comfort with risk, and you should keep that in mind and jot down
potential rules as you explore the contents of this book.

E
ver wonder why a trader or investor would choose candlestick charts
over other types of charts when analyzing price action of investments 
or markets? Well, this chapter provides some answers.
Trading and investing aren’t easy undertakings, and they’re certainly not easy
professions. Most traders — professional and amateur alike — and investors
struggle just to keep up with the market’s performance as measured by the
Standard & Poor’s 500 Index (S&P 500). The S&P 500 is an index comprised of
500 of the largest stocks traded in the United States (U.S.) and is considered
representative of the stock market as a whole.
In order to be one of the successful few who beats the market and other market
participants, you should strive to develop a competitive advantage or some
unique insight, commonly referred to as your “edge,” that you believe most
market participants aren’t using or considering. I can’t say that using candle-
stick charting provides an edge by itself — and it does come with a couple of
potential problems. But when combined with recurring patterns and other
technical indicators, you can find your edge!
In this chapter, I cover candlestick charts — the good and the bad — and I
review a handful of alternative charting methods. But in the end, you under-
stand why candlestick charting is the way to go!

Recognizing the Many Benefits 
of Candlestick Charting
Trading, investing, and charting styles are plentiful. You can spend hours
debating what type of approach to the markets is the best. For me, and for a
growing number of other traders, the benefits of a candlestick chart versus
other types of charts aren’t really debatable. Let me tell you why.
Changes and developments in the way stocks and other securities are traded
(and when they’re traded) have made trading an increasingly complex under-
taking. (For more info, see the nearby sidebar, “What makes up a day?”)
Because trading is becoming more and more complex, the need for a consis-
tent, dynamic charting method is more important than ever. Traders need
easy-to-read charts that allow them to make quick decisions and efficiently
analyze patterns. Candlesticks offer those benefits and many more, all 
covered in this section.

Part I: Getting Familiar with Candlestick Charting and Technical Analysis 
Brief history of candlestick charting
The history of candlestick charting stretches
back to Japanese rice traders in the 17th or 18th
century. This fact is why candlestick charts are
frequently referred to as Japanese candlestick
charts. A very smart man named Munehisa
Homma developed the methodology of monitor-
ing the price of daily rice trading, and his meth-
ods eventually evolved into what traders and
other market watchers call candlestick charting.
Homma found that having a visual representa-
tion of daily rice trading allowed him to make
more informed buy-and-sell decisions during
the hectic trading day. It’s said that Homma
once had a streak of over 100 winning trades!
Fast forward to the early 1990s, when Steve
Nison published a book and magazine article on
candlestick charting. Until then, candlestick
charting wasn’t widely used. Nison’s first book,
Japanese Candlestick Charting Techniques
(Prentice Hall Press), served as an introduction
to candlestick charting methods for many
traders and investors in the United States. Over
the next 15 years, the acceptance and use of
candlestick charting became widespread, and
the use of computer software for analyzing
recurring patterns proved profitable for many
traders.

Seeing is believing: Candlesticks 
are easy to read
It sounds pretty simplistic, but one noteworthy advantage candlesticks have
over other charts is their readability. For many people who strain to read 
the fine print and also for the younger traders who don’t want to deal with the
headaches that can come from staring at bar charts all morning, candlesticks
are an attractive option. Consider Figure 2-1, which displays a bar and a 
candlestick in a side-by-side comparison.
Figure 2-1 gives you a basic idea of why candlesticks are easier to read, but it
doesn’t really provide a full picture of why they’re also much better at help-
ing traders to visually interpret price action (how the stock or market traded
during the day relative to the opening price), which is an essential skill for
successful trading. Take a look at Figure 2-1, which takes a couple of weeks’
worth of trading data and displays it using traditional bar charts and candle-
stick charts, respectively.

Chapter 2: Getting to Know Candlestick Charts

Notice the dramatic difference between the bar chart and the candlestick
chart. By comparing them, you can clearly interpret what’s occurred from
day to day, including the openings, closings, and how they change from day
to day. The candlestick chart is a superior way to interpret the price action
from day to day when compared to a bar chart. Don’t worry — I cover how to
read candlestick charts extensively in several other chapters, but even in this
simplistic example you can see that knowing where a stock closed relative to
its open on a given day is a powerful piece of information that you can glean
quickly from a candlestick chart.
You can spot bears and bulls quickly
Knowing a security’s closing price relative to its opening price during a cer-
tain period is vital information. Candlestick charts allow you to quickly iden-
tify the days when a closing price is above an opening price and vice versa.
I like to think of the daily price action as a battle between bears and bulls.
Bears win when the price of a security closes lower than its open, and bulls
win on the days when the close settles higher than the open.
20
Part I: Getting Familiar with Candlestick Charting and Technical Analysis 
What makes up a day?
The definition of a trading “day” used to be very
simple. Trading was done on a central exchange
with specific opening and closing times. For
example, trading on stocks listed on the New
York Stock Exchange (NYSE) began at 9:30 a.m.
and ceased at 4:00 p.m. Now trading in these
stocks commences on some electronic commu-
nication networks (ECNs) hours before the NYSE
opens and hours after it closes. (An ECN is a net-
work of brokerage firms and traders, which
allows for trading directly between the broker-
age firms and traders.) A “day,” therefore, is
much different than it was in the past. Throw in
futures exchanges and currency markets that
trade almost 24 hours a day, and this issue
becomes even more confusing. With all that
trading outside of exchange hours, what consti-
tutes an actual day, for data purposes?
Currently, in the case of stocks, the official open
and close are based on the primary exchange
they trade on, but in this world of expanding
electronic trading, the actual open and close
are becoming more blurred. With respect to
futures markets that trade almost 24 hours a
day, it’s almost impossible to pin down a day. For
daily testing, I use data between 7 a.m. eastern
standard time (EST) and the close at 3 p.m. to
constitute a day.

Figure 2-2 is a great example of bearish and bullish days on a candlestick
chart. Although the two candlesticks are the same size and shape, you can
tell the difference between a bear and a bull:
 The bear: The black filled-in candlestick indicates a bearish performance
by the security because the close is much lower than the opening price.
 The bull: The hollow (white) candlestick indicates a bullish performance,
meaning that the opening is lower than the close.
Chapter 1 covers hollow candlesticks that show a higher close than open and
a filled-in candlestick that shows a lower close than open.
Understanding the ways that prices are trending is very useful information
when making buy-or-sell decisions. The old saying “The trend is your friend”
is a constant reminder that you always want to be on the more dominant side
of price action. By recognizing whether the bulls or bears are the more domi-
nant group, you can be conscious of the trend and better prepared to stay on
the right side of the market.

Seeing into the future (sort of)
The goal of charting and technical analysis isn’t to see what’s happened 
in the past, but to attempt to predict the future. Basically, if you can predict
the future for a majority of the time, you should be able to profit nicely through
wise investing and trading. Because candlestick charts are chock-full of info,
they aid a trader as she works to predict and profit from future price moves.
For example, a trader may study old candlestick charts and notice that when
a security’s closing price is much higher than its opening price, it seems to
open higher the next day — a situation commonly referred to as a gap open-
ing. That trader can buy the security on the close of the day and place an
order to sell the next day, thus making a profit. Figure 2-3 provides a clear
visual example of a gap opening.
Just by studying past price action on old candlestick charts, the trader in this
section’s example is able to predict a small piece of the future and use it to
turn a profit. History does repeat itself in markets and trading, and you can
use this repetition to your advantage by considering past candlestick charts,
which can be a cinch to read. But always keep in mind that as with all aspects
of technical analysis and investing, past results do not ensure future returns.
At the very least, be sure to pay attention to price gaps, because they indicate
an increase in volatility in the price of a security. When there’s an increase in
volatility, there’s an increase in trading opportunity. Many other types of pat-
terns, including those that incorporate candlesticks, reappear and may be
profited from.
22
Part I: Getting Familiar with Candlestick Charting and Technical Analysis 
Bulls and bears
The terms bull and bear have been in the trading
lexicon for many years. Both terms apply to
people and market trends. A bull is a market par-
ticipant that expects or wants the market to
move higher, but it is also an expression to
explain when the market goes up: bullish market.
A bear, on the other hand, expects the market to
decline (person) and indicates a declining
market. But where did these terms come from?
Although there’s some debate over the origins of
the two terms, they may be attributed to a man
named Thomas Mortimer, who wrote about the
precursor to the London stock exchange in the
late 1700s. He wrote that a bull bought stocks
without putting any money down with the hope
of selling at a higher price before having to settle
up. And according to Mortimer, a bear sold stock
he didn’t own without putting up any money also
hoping to exit the position at a profit before he
was forced to settle up.

Showing price patterns
Recognizing patterns on candlestick charts is easy, and you can combine two
or more candlestick charts to flesh out a reliable pattern that can lead you to
profitable trading. For example, a common price pattern that serves as a
good sell signal is depicted in Figure 2-4.
The pattern is a two-day pattern, and the third day is a common reaction to
the first two days. Here’s the typical progression:
1. The first day is a strong open-to-close day.
The closing price is considerably higher than the opening price. The
first day is a victory for the bulls.
2. The second day reveals very little price action because the close is
very near the open.
The second day is a wash because higher prices entice more bears to 
be sellers.

Understanding price gaps
Price gaps are very common in the financial
markets, and occur on charts when no overlap
exists between consecutive period highs and
lows. For instance, if XYZ stock’s high is 81 and
its low is 80 on a given day, and then the next
day it opens higher than 81 — let’s say 83 —
and trades in a range between 82 and 84, a gap
with no trading exists between 81 and 82. That
stock gapped higher and never closed the gap.
If the stock had opened much lower — 77 or 78,
for example — and never reached the previous
day’s low, it would’ve gapped lower.
So what causes price gaps? These gaps are
usually the result of news about a certain secu-
rity being released outside of market hours. It’s
not uncommon: Most companies release their
quarterly earnings or other big news either after
the market closes or before it opens. The market
adjustment to that news causes price gaps.
Also, a gap may occur on specific stocks just
because they’re moving up or down due to a
gap in the overall market. This may occur due to
a release of some economic news before the
market opens or possibly due to a macro event
such as a terrorist attack.
You should remember that gaps always get
filled when the high to low price action of a
future day covers the price range where no
trades occurred. But you can’t always tell when
gaps will be filled. When the dot.com bubble
was building, some Internet stocks had several
price gaps on their way up to stratospheric val-
uations. These gaps were eventually filled, but
anyone trying to short these stocks for the gap
being filled would’ve ended up in the poorhouse
before any gap filling took place. (Take a look at
the “Selling short, in short” sidebar for more
information on shorting.)

Once again, a trader who studies candlestick charts and patterns can easily
spot this change. Such a momentum shift is useful to someone who owns a
security and is considering selling or a trader who has the ability to sell short.
(See the sidebar “Selling short, in short” in this chapter for more information.)
Admitting the Potential Candlestick
Charting Risks
After more than 15 years of using candlestick charts to inform my trading
decisions, I can honestly say that I have a difficult time coming up with any
substantial arguments for using other common types of charts over 
candlestick.
In the interest of fairness, however, and to help you realize the truly versatile
and useful nature of candlesticks, I offer a couple of minor potential chinks in
the candlestick chart’s armor:
 They don’t work in the very short term. Candlestick charts are an
excellent display of price action, but for some extremely short-term trad-
ing strategies, the patterns that reveal themselves on a daily candlestick
chart may not develop on the much shorter time frame — five minutes
or less, for example.
I like to think of candlestick charts as a visual representation of the battle
between the bulls and bears, which is played out in the price action of 
a stock. That battle takes some time to play out, so patterns on a very
short-term chart may not produce signals that can be properly inter-
preted and traded.
Candlesticks aren’t as useful to intraday “scalping” or day trading strate-
gies where hold periods are generally shorter. This speaks more to the
utility of the chart and the intended behavior of the trader.
 They don’t reflect trade volume outside of regular market hours. The
advent of increased electronic trading means that there can sometimes
be significant volume traded outside of regular market hours. This trad-
ing can cause patterns that don’t reflect the full picture to appear on a
candlestick chart.
For example, if a stock officially opens at 9:30 a.m. at a price of $50, but
traded as low as $49 during the pre-market hours (on an electronic trad-
ing network), the open may not be a true reflection of where the stock
initially traded on the day. That means that the open recorded on the
candlestick is somewhat inaccurate. Also, if the stock never trades down
to $49 during the day, the low on the chart may not be an accurate
depiction of the day’s price action.
25
Chapter 2: Getting to Know Candlestick Charts

Comparing Candlestick Charts with
Alternative Charting Methods
Knowing a bit about the options that exist outside of candlestick charts
serves as a point of reference and makes clear the benefits of using candle-
stick charts when analyzing price data.
Although they’re not as versatile and useful as candlesticks, each of these
alternative charts has its benefits:
 Line charts are simple and straightforward.
 Bar charts are important to understand because they’re still relatively
prevalent.
 Point and figure charts are great for revealing support and resistance
levels.
I’m confident that you’ll be a believer in candlesticks when it’s all said and
done, but understanding the alternatives is certainly worth your time.

Selling short, in short
One of the most well-known trading adages is
“Buy low, sell high” — the simplest way to turn
a profit in a market. But other ways exist, includ-
ing short selling or shorting a security. This
somewhat counterintuitive process involves
selling a security first and then buying it back
later. Traders who practice this strategy are
known as shorts.
The mechanics of selling short can be fairly
complex, but I’ll try to sum them up:
1. A short borrows a stock from a bank that
holds it for the owners, expecting the price
of the stock to go down.
2. He then sells the borrowed stock to a buyer.
3. When the stock price drops, he buys the
stock back and returns it to the bank at 
the original (higher) price, and pockets the
difference.
Shorts get a bum rap and are often accused of
being responsible when a stock trades lower.
Companies have even sued shorts on claims
that they spread negative rumors to drive down
the company’s stock price. But short sellers are
really just a part of the overall market mecha-
nism, and they can actually help keep compa-
nies honest, because they’re constantly on the
lookout for companies with deteriorating fun-
daments or evidence of suspicious accounting.

Line charts
A line chart is a line on a chart that displays security prices over time. A line
chart represents the price — usually the closing price — of a security from
one period to the next.
On a very short-term basis, a line chart is definitely a proper choice for deci-
sion making. However, since no other information is displayed, attempting 
to formulate any sort of trading strategy from a line chart of price action
wouldn’t be a worthwhile venture.
Figure 2-5 is a line chart of three months of daily closing prices for a stock.
Bar charts
A traditional bar chart contains bars that represent price action from period
to period. Each bar is basically a vertical line that shows the difference
between the high and the low of the period. The top of the bar is the high and
the bottom is the low. The distance between the two is similar to the wick of
a candle on a candlestick chart. (The wick is discussed more in Chapter 1.)
The finishing touch on a bar chart is a little notch on the left of the bar that’s
made to mark where the security closed. Figure 2-6 is a single bar that nor-
mally appears on a bar chart.

Bar charts have been the industry standard for some time, but are quickly
being replaced by candlestick charts. When the Wall Street Journal starts
using a new charting convention (as it has with candlestick charts), the 
convention is considered to be the industry standard.

Point and figure charts
Point and figure charting is another type of stock charting that’s been around
so long it deserves a mention when covering methods of charting. A point and
figure chart is composed of x’s and o’s drawn on a sheet of graph paper. This
chart isn’t constructed using a set time frame but is instead based on reversals
of price. The x’s make up a series of up moves without a certain price reversal,
while the o’s represent a series of down moves without a price reversal.
Figure 2-8 is a point and figure depiction of the same data that composes the
line and bar charts in the two previous sections. The figure values each square
with one point and adds a new column with a change of direction of at least
two points, based on the close. For example, if day one has a closing price of
75 and day two has a closing price of 78, you draw x’s from 75 to 78. If on day
three the closing price is 76 — a 2-point reversal — a new column is added,
and o’s are placed in the 77 and 76 squares. If the price stays in the 76 to 77
range for a few days, no changes are made to the chart.
Point and figure charts are unique because they purely reflect price moves.
Because time isn’t factored in, you don’t need to update the chart if a stock
stays at a certain price for some time. On the other hand, when a price 
trades between two prices several times — bouncing between 50 and 55, for
example — a point and figure chart offers a very clear display of those levels,
which are called support levels and resistance levels. In this case, 50 is the
support level and 55 is the resistance level.
If you can properly recognize support and resistance levels, you can potentially
use that knowledge to make a tidy profit. Using the example in the preceding
graph, if you can buy at 50 and sell at 55 several times over, the returns can be
astounding. So why aren’t point and figure charts right up there with candle-
sticks in terms of usefulness? It’s simple: Support and resistance levels show
up well on candlestick charts too, and candlesticks also contain a variety of
other information.
Although interesting and unique, point and figure charting is really a throw-
back to a time when stock prices were charted based on the closing prices
found daily in the financial press and were meticulously kept by hand. Its use
has fallen by the wayside with the advent of technology.

Chapter 3
Building a Base of Candlestick
Chart Knowledge
In This Chapter
 Understanding the basic components of candlestick charts
 Working with additional information on candlestick charts
T
o take full advantage of candlestick charts, you must understand how
they’re constructed. From the basic pieces of information used to gener-
ate a candlestick to the various additions and extra pieces of data that can be
tacked onto a chart, you need to know just what you’re looking at before you
can make wise trading decisions. You need to be familiar with candlestick
nuts and bolts before delving into their interpretations and uses.
In this chapter, I offer a solid foundation of candlestick know-how. I start with
the data that goes into constructing individual candlesticks. Although candle-
sticks can represent the action of a security over a wide variety of time peri-
ods, the basic information used to build them is the same. I also cover the
other pieces of data that are commonly included on a candlestick chart —
added features that enhance the usefulness and readability of the chart.
Constructing a Candlestick: 
A Core of Four
For any security, each day of trading includes four key components in terms
of data: opening price, closing price, highest price traded on the day, and
lowest price traded on the day. These four pieces of data are needed to 
construct the individual bars that make up candlestick charts. Several bars,
created by using the data from several days or periods, are generated in 
succession to produce a full candlestick chart.

Candlestick charts may be applied to the performance of securities over a
variety of time periods. I use them on charts from as short-term as five min-
utes per bar to as long-term as a week per bar. A five-minute chart may be
applied to a day or two of activity, while the weekly chart would be applied 
to a period of several years. Although those are two vastly different time
frames, a candlestick chart is appropriate for both, and candlesticks would
work for many different time periods in between.
Price on the open
The first piece of data used to construct a candlestick is the opening price for
the day. For stocks, in most cases, it’s the official opening price on a specified
primary exchange.
Recording an opening price on a candlestick
On a single candlestick, the thin vertical line is the wick, and the thick part 
in the middle is the candle. The opening price on a single candlestick will
always be either the top or bottom of the candle, and it’s created on the chart
using the price scale on the chart’s vertical axis. A hollow (white) candle is
bullish, meaning that the opening price is lower than the closing price. (See
Chapter 2.) If you see a hollow candle, the bottom of the candle is the open-
ing price. Conversely, a filled-in (black) candle is bearish, meaning that the
opening price is higher than the closing price. In that case, the top of the
candle is the opening price.
Dealing with the challenges of pinning down an opening price
Because many securities are now trading on multiple exchanges or electronic
trading networks, pinning down an exact opening price can be difficult, which
makes constructing a candle a difficult endeavor.
For example, I was recently trying to trade a stock on which very significant —
and misinterpreted — news came out before the opening of the trading day.
The stock had closed the day before at $48 per share, but was trading on one
of the electronic communication networks (ECNs) two hours before it was to
open on the New York Stock Exchange at $45 per share. Over the next two
hours, the breaking news was better understood, and the stock started to
trade higher. It actually opened at about $51 per share. Although several
thousand shares traded between $45 and $51 in the two hours leading up to
the opening price, the official open for the day was $51.
For futures contracts on commodities — agreements between two parties to
buy or sell a certain product on a predefined date (see the nearby sidebar,
“Focus on futures” for more details) — attempting to determine the opening
price for a day can be even more difficult. Many futures markets now trade
both electronically and on a trading floor. A perfect example is Japanese Yen.
32
Part I: Getting Familiar with Candlestick Charting and Technical Analysis 

Yen futures trade on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) and on their
corresponding electronic platform, called Globex. The pit for the CME opens
at 7:20 a.m. central time and closes at 2:00 p.m Monday through Friday. But
the Globex trading hours run from Sunday at 5 p.m. central until 4:00 p.m. on
Friday, with only an hour break each afternoon. So how do you determine the
open? Note: These hours are accurate as of December 2007 and subject to
change.
For such a convoluted situation, I use the pit data for analysis purposes, but
since the most volume is traded during the hours that the pit is closed, I
always have to reevaluate what I consider to be the open. For some other
examples of futures contracts that have both pit trading hours and electronic
hours, see Figure 3-1.
33
Chapter 3: Building a Base of Candlestick Chart Knowledge
What’s the stock market?
When most people think of the stock market,
they picture stock traders in brightly colored
jackets shouting and hand signaling orders in a
giant room. This is actually how the commodity
markets function. The stock market, or at least
the floor of the New York Stock Exchange
(NYSE), is more like a giant bank lobby with
each stock having a particular place or post
where transactions for that stock take place.
The person in charge of manning this post is
known as the specialist, and his job is to facili-
tate trading of a particular stock between the
multitudes of buyers and sellers in an orderly
manner.
A specialist takes all the buy-and-sell orders
and attempts to match them up. In some cases,
when an abundance of sellers exists but not
enough buyers, the specialist may help with
orderly trading by buying shares from the sell-
ers. When there are several buyers and not
enough sellers, the specialist may act as a
seller to keep the market orderly. Specialists
also assimilate buy-and-sell orders before the
official market opening to determine an opening
price, and they do the same thing on the close.
When I began my career 15 years ago, virtually
all stock trading in the United States was done
either on the floors of the NYSE or the American
Stock Exchange (AMEX), or through a network
of brokers known as the National Association 
of Securities Dealers Automated Quotation
System (NASDAQ). If I wanted to buy shares of
IBM, which traded on the NYSE, I called a
broker and gave him an order. He forwarded my
order to someone working on the exchange
floor, or in some cases directly to the specialist.
If I were to purchase shares of Microsoft,
(symbol MSFT), which traded on the NASDAQ,
I called a broker who either traded directly with
me, matched me with a seller, or traded with
another broker through the NASDAQ market.
Today there are multiple venues for those
stocks traded on the listed exchanges and
those on the NASDAQ. The broker I use for my
personal stock trades has an automated feature
that automatically selects the best market for
the order I enter. I never know anymore if my
orders go to the exchange floor, and as time
goes on, fewer and fewer of my orders make it
there. Instead, the orders are traded over an
electronic communication network set up for
trading stocks without using the primary
exchange or the specialist. Brokers and large
institutions use these networks to trade stocks
without sending the orders to the floor of the pri-
mary exchange.

Part I: Getting Familiar with Candlestick Charting and Technical Analysis 

In Figure 3-1 you see that, for futures contracts, the actual opening price for a
session can be hard to determine. One good solution is to use the opening
price for the first trade during the pit session.
High and low price for the session
The second and third pieces of data that are essential for constructing a 
candlestick are the high and low prices for a session. No tricks here — the
high price is the highest point the security’s price reaches during the session,
and the low is the lowest point reached during the same session. Because
there may be some flexibility in what you consider a trading session, it may
be the high and low that have traded between 6:30 a.m. and 2:00 p.m. Your
session would be 6:30 a.m. to 2:00 p.m.
35
Chapter 3: Building a Base of Candlestick Chart Knowledge
Focus on futures
When explaining how futures contracts work, 
I always love to use my example about buy-
ing a lawn mower at the home improvement
superstore.
Imagine that it’s December 15, and you know
that when spring rolls around in May, your old
rusty lawnmower just isn’t going to cut it, so to
speak. You need a new mower. The mower you
want is expected to cost $500 on May 1, which
will be the first day you really need to cut the
grass. You don’t want to pay that much for a
mower, and you’re in luck, because your home
improvement superstore is the only one in the
world that offers lawnmower futures. And May
1 just so happens to be the day that May lawn-
mower futures (if they existed) expire. The price
of a May lawnmower futures contract is $400,
so you make a small deposit — maybe 10 per-
cent of the mower contract size of $400 — and
buy one futures contract through your mower
futures broker. When May 1 rolls around, you’ll
have the ability to pay $400 for your new lawn-
mower, even though the market price is $500.
But who would offer such an attractive deal?
The seller of the futures contract can be a lawn-
mower dealer who’s more than happy to lock in
a price of $400 to sell a lawnmower on May 1.
After all, it would help that dealer to plan pro-
duction accordingly by locking in a guaranteed
number of mower sales at a set price. It can
also be a speculator who thinks mowers will be
on sale at the home improvement superstore for
$300 at some point before May 1, which would
allow him to buy the mower at a discount and
then sell it to you for $400 on May 1, generating
a $100 profit.
The futures markets were created to allow
farmers a mechanism for locking in the price of
their crops and eliminating the risk that when
their crops were ready to be sold, the selling
price would not be enough to cover their costs
and provide a profit. For farmers, whose liveli-
hood is so dependent on factors out of their
control, this method was extremely helpful to
eliminate selling price as one of the major risks.

Incorporating high and low prices into a candlestick
The high and low prices for a session or day are used to make the thin verti-
cal line or wick of the candlestick (see Chapter 1 for a visual of the basic 
candlestick). The top of the wick represents the high price for the session,
and the bottom of the wick represents the session’s low price.
You need to define what your trading session is, and the wick represents the
range from the high down to the low. This can be for the formal exchange
floor or pit trading times, or, as discussed earlier, for a period you decide to
represent a trading session.
If a security opens at a certain price and then drops in price steadily through-
out the course of the session, you won’t see any wick at all extending above
the candle. If, on the other hand, the security opens at a certain price and
increases in price during the session without ever dropping below the open,
you won’t see any wick extending below the candle.
How low (or high) can you go? Deciding on a high and low price
As with opening prices, high and low prices can be tough to nail down
because of the various electronic trading venues operating today. If big news
on a particular security breaks before the official open or after the close, it
may very well trade higher or lower on an electronic trading venue than it
does on its primary exchange.
It’s even more likely that the futures contracts will trade at prices above the
exchange session high or below the exchange session low, due to the fact
that the electronic futures markets are active 24 hours a day. Nowhere is 
this more evident than futures on currencies. The currency market is a true
24-hour market, and news across the globe is constantly impacting currency
movements. Because of that volatility, it’s very possible that there will be a
lot of price action outside of normal exchange pit trading hours.
For more insight into the dramatic difference between 24-hour activity and
exchange hour activity, see Figure 3-2. Both are charts of futures contracts 
on the Swiss Franc price versus the U.S. dollar. These contracts trade from
7:20 a.m. to 2:00 p.m. central time on the floor of the CME, and trade up to 
23 hours a day between Sunday evening and Friday afternoon on the CME’s
Globex system. Figure 3-2a is a chart of the price action over the course of a
couple of months using only data from pit trading hours. Figure 3-2b uses the
same time period but takes into account all trading hours.
36
Part I: Getting Familiar with Candlestick Charting and Technical Analysis 

Frankly (ahem), the Franc chart has so many gaps that it’s basically not even
worth trying to analyze. It’s highly unlikely that you’d work out a profitable
method of trading based on this chart. There’s very little opportunity to catch
the many dramatic price moves that occur in the hours outside of normal or
exchange trading hours. You just don’t have enough information to make
smart (and profitable) moves. Figure 3-2b, on the other hand, gives you a
fuller picture of the price moves of the futures, and allows you to make well-
informed decisions about buying and selling.
Currencies aren’t the only futures contracts that experience these types of
overnight moves. Bond futures and stock index futures such as Chicago
Board of Trade’s ten-year government bond futures contract or the S&P 500
Index futures that trade at the CME also see price action in the overnight ses-
sion, while the underlying bond and stock markets are closed. Traders are
even starting to see price moves for true commodity futures trading overnight
that aren’t properly caught on charts.
When it comes down to it, the choice of what to use for a day is up to the
individual trader. For instance, if you’re looking to put on longer term trades,
the prices that trade outside of normal trading hours may not mean as much
to you as it would to a trader trying to catch very short-term moves as short
as a few minutes. Also, what you use for a day may just depend on how much
time you can devote to watching the markets. I think most casual traders may
just want to focus on the primary exchange’s trading hours or the price
action that occurs over the course of a normal work day.

The fourth and final piece of data used to build a candlestick is a security’s
closing price. The closing price is the final price that’s traded on a security
during the day. These are the closing numbers that appear in the stock tables
in newspapers, and the prices that investment professionals use to monitor
their day-to-day performance. As with the other data used in creating a 
candlestick, closing prices are getting tougher and tougher to pin down.
Recording a closing price on a candlestick
Depending on the performance of a security, its closing price may appear in
one of two places on a candlestick:
 If the security had a bullish performance on a given day, the candle part
of the candlestick is hollow (white). In that case, the closing price is rep-
resented by the top of the candle.
 If the security performed bearishly, the candle is filled in (black), and its
bottom marks the closing price for the day.
Trying to pin down a closing price
Just like the opening, high, and low prices (see previous sections), the clos-
ing price can be a real challenge to pin down because of the presence of elec-
tronic trading networks. Also, stocks and futures stay open for some time
after their official exchanges close, so pinpointing what the market believes
the true value for a stock or futures contract is at the end of the day is 
actually really difficult.
Although trading continues beyond the primary market’s hours, stocks do
generally trade for an hour or so after the exchanges close. Usually the trad-
ing in stocks after 4 p.m. EST on the electronic trading networks is pretty
light in volume, but on days with significant earnings announcements or
other news, several million shares of a stock may trade after the close.
One example of this after-close trade is what’s referred to as earnings season.
This time period is when many companies report their quarterly financial
results to the financial and investing community. During a recent earnings
season, both Microsoft (MSFT) and Google (GOOG) reported their earnings.
Both stocks traded many millions of shares after the 4 p.m. official close of
the NASDAQ, the primary trading market for both. With such a high volume
of trading, this price action is significant enough to be included in charts.
For the earnings season in question, the investment community (“the street”)
wasn’t terribly impressed with either company’s results, and the stocks
traded off pretty significantly as a result. Microsoft’s official closing share
38
Part I: Getting Familiar with Candlestick Charting and Technical Analysis 

price at 4 p.m. EST was 31.51, but in the “after hours” the stock traded down
to 30.90, which is a nearly 2 percent drop from the closing price at 4 p.m. and
0.02 percent below the official low for the day of 30.93 per share.
The difference in Google’s stock was even greater. The official 4 p.m. close
was 548.59 a share, but after checking, the post market trading revealed a
final price of 508.70 a share. That’s more than 7 percent lower than the 4 p.m.
close! It was also quite a bit lower than even the official low of the day, which
was 542.24 a share.
Considering Additional Information
Included on Candlestick Charts
In addition to the basic information (described in the earlier sections of this
chapter), most candlestick charts automatically include many other pieces of
data. This added data allows you to quickly digest how the stock has traded
in the past and gives you some fundamental activity, such as dates of 
earnings releases or dividend payments, which may also appear on charts.
In this section, I clue you in on a few pieces of information that may be
included on your candlestick charts.
Volume
In trading lingo, volume is the number of shares traded during a certain period
of time. A volume measurement usually appears in the bottom quarter to
bottom third of a chart. Figure 3-3 is a chart of Google showing roughly 60
days leading up to July 19, 2007.
In the bottom of the chart in Figure 3-3, daily volume for Google’s stock has
been between 1 and about 11 million shares per day during this period.
Notice the second trading day in July, which was July 3, just before a mid-
week Independence Day holiday. That was a half day for the market, and the
volume measurement is barely a blip. On the other end of the spectrum, have
a look at the high volume on the last day of the chart. That high volume came
in anticipation of the earnings that were to be released after the market
closed. And the volume measurement on the last day of the chart doesn’t
even include the 4.5 million shares traded after the 4 p.m. close!
39
Chapter 3: Building a Base of Candlestick Chart Knowledge

Many technical analysts put quite a bit of emphasis on volume as it relates to
certain chart patterns. For instance, if a stock trades down to what’s con-
sidered a support level (flip back to Chapter 2 for more info on support levels)
on a day with significant volume, many traders may give this support level
more credence and consider buying. The reason is that the increase in volume
indicates a high level of buy interest emerging at this level. If support is tested
on a low volume day, such as July 3, a trader may wait for more volume to
trade to confirm this support level. Low volume days sometimes contain unreli-
able price action where the price has whipped around due to a lack of liquidity.
Open interest
In the case of futures charts, open interest takes the place of volume. Before
discussing open interest on a chart, an explanation of exactly how it’s deter-
mined and what it means is in order.
Put simply, open interest is the number of outstanding futures contracts.
When a buyer and a seller involved in a futures contract initiate new posi-
tions, the open interest increases by one contract.
When you trade a futures contract, whether you’re buying or selling, you’re
also either opening or closing a position. If you have no position, and you buy
a futures contract, that’s an opening position. When you sell that contract,
Figure 3-3:
Daily
candlestick
chart of
Google, 
with volume
information
included.
40
Part I: Getting Familiar with Candlestick Charting and Technical Analysis 

you’re closing the position. This can work for selling, too. If you have no posi-
tion to begin with, and you sell a contract, you’ve opened a short position.
When you buy this contract back or cover the short position, you’re closing 
a position. For more information on shorting, see Chapter 2.
When both the buyer and seller in a trade are opening positions, the open
interest of contracts increases. If only one of the participants in a trade is
opening a new position, then the open interest doesn’t change. Finally, if both
participants in a trade are closing positions, the open interest decreases.
Figure 3-4 is a very simple example of how open interest increases and
decreases. Here’s how the days break down:
 Day 1: Assuming that Day 1 on the chart is the first day the futures con-
tract displayed trades, the beginning open interest is zero. For display
purposes, two contracts trade, and both the buyer and seller are initiat-
ing new positions. These new positions create two new contracts.
 Day 2: On Day 2, there are four more contracts initiated by both the
buyer and seller, and the open interest increases to six contracts.
 Day 3: On Day 3, things get a little trickier. Mr. A decides to sell his two
contracts, and Ms. D decides to buy back (cover) two of the contracts
she’d previously sold short. This reduced the open interest by two 
contracts.
 Day 4: Finally, on Day 4, Mr. C sells his four contracts, but Mr. A buys
them, so these open contracts are transferred, and no new contracts are
created. The open interest doesn’t change.
Figure 3-5 is a chart of soybean futures, which expire in November 2007. I
actively trade the soybean futures market, so this chart is near and dear to
my heart. The open interest appears in the same area on the chart as the
volume did on the chart of Google in Figure 3-3. Notice the increase in open
interest during the life of this contract moving from left to right on the chart.
This increase is due to the time approaching expiration, but also due to the
fact that the summer of 2007 was a volatile market (although basically all
summers are volatile in the wild world of beans).

Chapter 3: Building a Base of Candlestick Chart Knowledge

As beans topped out, so did open interest. That would’ve sparked some
traders to sell beans, because there were fewer new participants coming into
the market at higher prices. The same would be true if beans had been drop-
ping dramatically. Either way, a reversal of open interest along with a reversal
of certain candlestick patterns (more on those in Parts II and III of this book)
are two items worth looking out for when considering a trade.
Technical indicators
Numerous technical indicators may automatically appear on the charts you
generate. Technical indicators are ways of analyzing current trends in the
market in hopes of being able to predict future trends. You can usually expect
to see some sort of average of closing prices (a moving average), and possi-
bly another basic technical indicator, on a chart. Don’t let them rattle you,
because you can remove them if you want, or — even better — alter them 
to your personal preferences. (I discuss a variety of technical indicators in
detail in Part IV.) Take a look at Figure 3-6 — a chart that includes a moving
average, one common type of technical indicator.

42
Part I: Getting Familiar with Candlestick Charting and Technical Analysis 

Among the different types of technical indicators are those that need their
own space on a chart, much like volume or open interest. Figure 3-7 is a chart
with a technical indicator known as the relative strength index (RSI) on the
bottom. The RSI indicates the trend of price movements. (RSI is covered in
depth in Chapter 13.) The crooked line is the calculated RSI; the lines at 30
and 70 are permanent and signify where a market is considered overbought
or oversold (more on that in Chapter 13, as well).
As you can see, the RSI takes nothing away from the rest of the chart and
actually provides some useful additional information that you can take into
consideration when making chart-based decisions.
Fundamental information
Charts containing fundamental information aren’t particularly common, but
the addition of that information can be extremely useful. Fundamental infor-
mation can include dividend dates, earnings release dates, stock splits, and
the number of days people with inside information (legal inside information)
may have bought or sold stock. This info relates almost exclusively to charts
of stocks, so I stick to stocks in this section’s discussion.
Figure 3-6:

Chapter 3: Building a Base of Candlestick Chart Knowledge

Needless to say, monitoring how a stock performs around the time dividends
are paid or earnings are reported is helpful. If some patterns tend to repeat
themselves, trying to trade around these dates may be a profitable strategy.
Also, keep an eye on how stocks are bought and sold by company officials
who have an intimate knowledge of their company’s business activities.
Dividend dates
The usefulness of dividends as a way of making a profit on the market comes
and goes. Sometimes investors are focused on buying stocks for their dividend
yields, and other times price appreciation is a much more lucrative endeavor.
Like all market cycles, dividend paying stocks fall in and out of favor, and the
focus on dividends waxes and wanes. For now, though, it’s very possible that
some stocks that pay higher than average dividend yields trade in a certain
pattern around their dividend dates. If the dates on which dividends are paid
are noted on your charts, you may very well be able to recognize a pattern that
surrounds these dates and buy or sell to profit from it.
Deciphering dividend dates
When it comes to dividends, consider four important dates:
 The date the dividend is declared by a company
 The date the stock trades with an adjustment for the dividend, or the ex-
dividend date
Figure 3-7:
A chart that
includes a

strength
index (RSI).
44
Part I: Getting Familiar with Candlestick Charting and Technical Analysis 

If you own a stock the day before the ex-dividend date, then you receive
the dividend. If you buy it on the ex-dividend date, you don’t receive 
the dividend. For trading purposes, focus on the day before the 
ex-dividend date, because that’s when you want to own the stock to
receive the dividend.
 The record date, two trading days after the ex-dividend date, which is
the date on which the owners of a stock are identified as eligible to
receive a dividend
 The payable date, which is when you get your dividend check
For an example, look at the following dates for the second dividend paid
by IBM in 2007:
• Declared
4/24/2007
• Ex-Date
5/8/2007
• Record Date
5/10/2007
• Payable
6/9/2007
Earnings dates
During each quarter of the year, companies are required to release a summary
of their earnings for the previous quarter. These numbers are usually distrib-
uted via press releases, which are quickly picked up by news wires and the
financial press. Traders react to the resulting news. The press releases are
usually followed an hour or two later by conference calls that feature mem-
bers of the companies’ management teams answering questions from industry
analysts regarding the recently released earnings. These calls are important,
because the outlook for the company is typically discussed in detail.
These earnings release dates are by far the most important four days of the
year for many companies, and their stocks are usually at their most volatile
just before and after the subsequent conference calls. At the very least, if
you’re interested in trading a particular stock, be aware of when the company
is scheduled to release its next earnings report.
In a charting capacity, seeing how the stock trades before and after earnings
dates can be useful for trading decisions. For example, if a company generally
trades higher going into its earnings release, buying a week before the earn-
ings date and selling the day before may be a profitable strategy. Also, if a
company usually reacts strongly to its earnings announcements (either good
or bad), but seems to reverse this move a few days later, this can lead to a
good short-term trading strategy. Either way, it should be clear that having
earnings date info on the charts you use isn’t a bad thing, and it can set you
on the path to making a nice profit, if you can spot a usable pattern.
45

Stock splits
Sometimes when the price for a stock reaches a high level, a company
announces that it’s paying a stock dividend or splitting the shares in two. 
The timeline for a stock split is very similar to that of a dividend, and split
information is sometimes included on charts. A company will announce 
a split, which is usually considered a positive event for the stock. The
announcement indicates what type of split it is (2 for 1, 3 for 1, and so on)
and the date that the split will be effective.
That date is the day that shareholders own more shares at a lower price, and
it’s the date that’s noted on a chart, typically with a big letter S or a note about
the type of split.
So how does splitting work for you? If you own 10 shares of that stock, you
own 20 on the split date. The price of the stock is usually adjusted accord-
ingly. For example, if a stock is trading at $100, and the stock splits so each
share held becomes two shares, that’s considered a 2 for 1 split, and the
price of each new share is then $50. The dollar amount is the same, but the
number of shares is increased.
Splitting shares allows for more broad ownership of a stock. Many people can
afford to buy 100 shares of a stock that trades for $15 a share ($1,500); few
people can afford 100 shares of a stock that trades for $200 a share ($20,000).
The idea is that the more broad the ownership, the better the performance of
shares.
Stock split information on a chart is useful when a company’s stock has had
recurring reactions to stock splits. Generally, a stock rallies after the news of
a split, although whether this fact is logical is debatable, because a stock
split doesn’t necessarily mean that something has fundamentally changed
within the company. Unfortunately, the announcement of a split isn’t common
46
Part I: Getting Familiar with Candlestick Charting and Technical Analysis 

on a chart. But since the date the split is effective is generally available, you
can easily focus on how the stock trades leading up to the split and after-
ward, and make appropriate trading decisions.
Insider trading: the legal kind
Legal insider trading — not the kind of insider trading that results in executives
wearing handcuffs on the evening news — is the trading activity of company
executives in their company’s stock. In this context, an insider is anyone offi-
cially associated with a company, or even an owner of 10 percent or more of a
company’s stock.
The option to buy stock can be a major part of the compensation package for
employees of public companies. From the company’s standpoint, it makes
sense to offer employees another incentive to work hard for the financial
well-being of the company and the strength of its stock. Employees of a com-
pany may also buy stock in the open market when they believe the company’s
prospects are bright.
Owners of 10 percent or more of stock may have access to some information
that you may not have. You can’t blame them if they make decisions on buying
or selling that stock based on their insider information. However, by law they
must report this trading activity within a few days of making such transac-
tions, and the resultant data is public and sometimes ends up on charts!
On the flip side, at times, employees who own shares may choose to sell. It’s
a bit tricky, as the stock may be sold for personal reasons — a major 
purchase like a home or child’s college education, for example — or it can be
a signal that an employee believes a stock’s price has reached a level where
it’s prudent to sell shares. In this case, following an insider’s lead and selling
that stock may prove profitable or help you avoid a loss.
To see what insider trading information looks like on a chart, take a gander at
Figure 3-8.
When insider trading information is included on candlestick charts, the indi-
cations of insider activity are usually very easy to read. In Figure 3-8, the B
indicates insider buying, and the S indicates insider selling. (Splits also use
the S. But splits normally have a 2 for 1 or some numbers along with the split.
It really varies from chart service to chart service.) Some other charts use up
arrows to indicate buying and down arrows to indicate selling. This chart
includes buying in September and selling in October. It appears the insiders
in this company do a very good job of trading their own stock!
Trying to trade along with insiders has such a following that not only does
insider trading information appear on some charts, but also services and
newsletters are devoted to disseminating the information. One service,
InsiderScore, even ranks individual insiders by how well they have bought
and sold shares in the past!

A
fter you’re armed with an understanding of why candlestick charts are
so useful and what it takes to create a candlestick, you’re ready to
spread your wings and do some charting. You can take the appropriate data
and build a chart in many different ways, and in this chapter I provide you
with some insight on the easiest and least expensive ways to do just that. I
begin the chapter with the easiest method, which is to let a candlestick-
friendly Web site do the heavy lifting. And the sites I describe will do it all for
free, if you’re willing to put up with a few banner ads (a small price to pay for
some very handy services).
After taking a look at some free online options for candlestick charting, I pre-
sent the basics of creating candlesticks using Microsoft Excel. Candlestick
charting has caught on so quickly that it’s now a standard feature in Excel’s
charting section. Finally, at the end of the chapter, I cover a few of the best
low-cost charting packages that are widely available and make sense for indi-
vidual traders and, to a lesser extent, investors.
One quick note for those of you who are left-handed. I use right-click versus
left-click in some of the instructions in this chapter. Please keep in mind that
I’m right-handed, so I’m referring to the way I would be clicking a mouse. If
you happen to be left-handed and have the mouse set up specifically for a
left-handed user, remember that when I say to right-click, readers with
adjusted mouse settings need to left-click.

Turning to the Web for Candlestick
Charting Resources
Like so many other areas of life, trading and technical analysis have been
greatly impacted by the Internet over the past few years. You can visit multi-
ple Web sites where you can get low-cost or even free financial information,
and, of course, candlestick charts are included. A quick Internet search on
candlestick charts produces more results than you’ll know what to do with.
In this section, I cover a handful of the best Web sites you can use to view
candlestick charts, showing you how to create charts on these sites and
pointing out other various features you can find there. Each of the sites men-
tioned are excellent for obtaining free charts but also have a plethora of
other information you can use to help you make better trading and investing
decisions.
Using Yahoo! Finance for charting, 
trading, and investing
If you’re looking for a free, user-friendly Web site that’s packed with useful
information, steer your Internet browser to the finance section of Yahoo! This
dynamic site offers many features that greatly enhance your charting experi-
ence, including the ability to download free data that you can manipulate
however you want. And just like all good charting packages, Yahoo! makes
candlestick charting available to all users.
In addition to charts, Yahoo! Finance offers a variety of information on stocks
and markets that can provide you with enormous amounts of data, company
fundamentals, and even message boards full of both rumors and facts. It’s all
just a few clicks away.
Creating a candlestick chart on Yahoo! Finance
Using Yahoo! Finance to build a candlestick chart is a breeze. All you need is
a computer with an Internet connection. To generate a chart, work your way
through the following steps:
1. Get to Yahoo! Finance from the main Yahoo! page by clicking Finance
or by using the URL www.finance.yahoo.com.
2. Enter the symbol of the stock or index you want to chart in the bar to
the left of the Get Quotes button, and then click that button.
That click takes you to an information page for the stock or index you’ve
chosen.
50
Part I: Getting Familiar with Candlestick Charting and Technical Analysis 

If you don’t know the symbol of the stock or index, simply click Finance
Search to the right of the Get Quotes button.
3. After you’re on the information page, click Basic Chart in the blue
box on the left of the page (Technical Analysis is another possible
choice that you can visit later to explore more of Yahoo!’s charting
features).
A basic line chart appears, with clickable options for making changes to
the chart. The categories are for Range (time), Type, Size, and Scale.
The scale of a candlestick chart can be either linear or logarithmic in the
way its pricing data is displayed. A linear chart displays prices without
any adjustments. A logarithmic chart adjusts data in order to better
depict performance in an investment (long-term) scenario. Logarithmic
charts make sense for long-term investing, but aren’t very useful on, say,
a daily chart of stock prices that’s used for trading.
4. Select the Range (from one day to five years) you prefer, and then
click Cdl, for candlestick, as the Type.
It’s as simple as that! After you’ve completed these easy steps, you should
see a beautiful candlestick chart that looks very similar to Figure 4-1.
If on Step 3 you opted to click Technical Analysis instead of Basic Chart, you’d
have a number of other choices, including
 Moving Avg (various moving averages)
 EMA (various exponential moving averages)
 Indicators (various indicators)
 Overlays (indicators that show up on top of the price chart)
I encourage you to play around with these until your hand is cramped.
There’s no better way to master the ins and outs of charts than manipulating
them and looking at as many as you can. You can also flip to Chapter 11 
of this book for more info on technical analysis and the ways you can 
combine those methods with your candlestick charts.

Chapter 4: Using Electronic Resources to Create Full Charts

I like the Yahoo! Finance site for many things, but the flexibility of its charting
is somewhat limited. For example, my favorite time period is a three-month
daily chart, and Yahoo! currently doesn’t offer a three-month option. However,
a beta charting package is being tested, and I’m confident that the functional-
ity of Yahoo!’s charts will be expanded in the near future.
Checking out Yahoo! Finance’s other useful features
If you want to take advantage of Yahoo! Finance’s other resources, spend
some time examining the information page for a specific stock:
1. Get to Yahoo! Finance from the main Yahoo! page by clicking Finance
or by using the URL www.finance.yahoo.com.
2. Enter the symbol of the stock or index you want to chart in the bar
next to the Get Quotes button, and then click that button.
That click takes you to an information page for the stock or index you’ve
chosen.
In the blue box on the left of the page, you can find many sources of data and
other handy functions. Among them is a unique feature that Yahoo! provides
for accessing historical daily opening, high, low, and closing price data, with
volume information that you can download into Microsoft Excel using the
Historical Price choice. (Skip ahead to “Creating Candlestick Charts Using
Microsoft Excel” later in this chapter for more info on how to work with 
candlesticks in Excel.)
For another informative and sometimes fun area of Yahoo! Finance, check out
the Message Board section. This area includes discussions that focus on spe-
cific stocks. In the case of some controversial companies, the discussions can
be pretty heated, to the point of being amusing. But the boards aren’t just
good for lively conversation. They’re also a good place to turn for informa-
tion and rumors if a stock’s price is moving without any apparent reason.
To top it all off, Yahoo! allows you to build your own portfolio, which you can
use to monitor news and prices for any stocks you specify. You can also access
real-time quotes — most quotes available on the Internet are delayed — for a
small fee, and take advantage of excellent financial calendars for upcoming
earnings and economic statistics.

Charting on CNBC.com
In recent years, CNBC has become a primary source for market information
on television. The folks at CNBC have also put a lot of effort into their Web
site, which offers charting functionality in addition to the content that relates
to their TV programs.
The charting function on CNBC.com is easy to use, and the professional func-
tions allow you to do things like compare securities and overlay technical
indicators. One downside is a lack of flexibility, but the site is being constantly
updated, and more flexibility can emerge in the future.
Generating candlestick charts on CNBC.com
Here’s how to take advantage of CNBC.com’s free candlestick charting 
offerings:
1. Direct your Internet browser to www.cnbc.com.
Near the top of the page, you’ll see a box for entering a symbol, with the
links Quote and Chart directly above it.
2. Click Chart, enter your symbol, and click the Go button to the right of
the box.
You should see a line chart for the stock you entered.
54
Part I: Getting Familiar with Candlestick Charting and Technical Analysis 

3. On the Chart Style drop-down menu, select Candle.
The chart is refreshed, and a candlestick chart appears in place of the
line chart. After taking all these steps, you should end up with a candle-
stick chart like the one shown in Figure 4-3.
CNBC.com gets an A+ for its chart-making simplicity. You can also choose
from many time frames and indicators, and you can even add flags to the
chart for events like earnings releases, stock splits, and dividend pay dates.
Another attractive feature is the ability to add notes to your charts, such as,
“I should have bought this stock right here” before a big up day. Of course,
notes aren’t any good if you can’t save your charts, but CNBC.com has that
covered, too. Register at their site (basic registration is free), and you can
save your charts and your chart settings, so you don’t have to select every
last option each time you return to the site.
CNBC.com also offers additional information on the companies you select,
including news, profiles, earnings, recommendations, and competitors’ stats.
You can also click the Peers tab to see a graphical representation of some
peer companies. The Financials tab provides a quick overview of the com-
pany’s financials on both an annual and quarterly basis, and the Ownership
tab gives an overview of the company’s owners, some insider holding infor-
mation, and a graphical breakdown of insider activity.
Tapping into CNBC.com’s other useful features
Since the Web site’s revamping in 2007, many CNBC anchors have blogs that
feature entries on their specific areas of expertise. You can also use the
Investing Tools link, which includes the ability to create a portfolio watch list
and perform some stock or mutual fund screening, all at no cost to you.
Because CNBC is a successful financial television franchise, CNBC.com is
loaded with video highlights and other ways to review the issues discussed
on CNBC during the trading day. Unless you’re a professional trader and you
have CNBC on all day, it may be of interest to you to catch up on their Web
site to see what professionals are focusing on.

Using Reuters.com for 
candlestick charting
Reuters is a world renowned source of financial information. Its Web site is
very much geared toward professionals, but that doesn’t mean that it can’t
be useful for newcomers to the candlestick charting game. Also, Reuters is
truly a global organization, so its site is great for looking up information on
foreign stock markets and currencies.
How to candlestick chart with Reuters.com
Take the following steps to create a candlestick chart of your own on
Reuters.com:
1. Go to www.reuters.com/investing.
You’ll see several choices on the left side of the page.
2. Click Stocks, and the Stocks Information page opens.
3. Type your stock symbol in the box next to the blue Go button.
Make sure that the button next to the word Symbol is checked, and
choose Chart from the drop-down menu.
4. Click the Go button.
That gives you a one-year line chart, under which are a few buttons that
indicate the types of charts that you can draw.
5. Click the third button from the left — the one with the familiar 
candlesticks.
6. Choose your preferred date range from the button choices or the
drop-down box on top of the chart.
You should be looking at a candlestick chart that closely resembles the
example in Figure 4-4.

Part I: Getting Familiar with Candlestick Charting and Technical Analysis 

Although at first glance there appears to be nothing significantly different
about Reuters.com compared to the other sites I’ve mentioned in this chap-
ter, there are some nice features on the site that I like:
 You can easily overlay the price action of key competitors or a market
index.
 You can also overlay several customizable technical indicators.
Play around with the options on the site to find what looks promising and
what works best for you.
Checking out Reuters.com’s other useful features
Reuters’s global scope means that the company’s Web site presents a large
amount of international information, including data on foreign markets, cur-
rencies, bonds, and commodities. When I’m traveling and need a quick
update of global markets, I almost always turn to Reuters.com.
As a financial news source, the Business page on Reuters.com rivals many of
the top financial newspapers. The site has a wonderful stock screener, which
allows you to search for trading or investment ideas by searching on certain
fundamental or technical criteria, and contains in-depth profiles of companies.
Creating Candlestick Charts 
Using Microsoft Excel
Microsoft Excel is an excellent tool for running all sorts of financial analyses.
One of the great features of Excel is its charting tool, and, of course, that tool
includes candlestick charts as one of its choices.
In this section, I explain the process for creating a candlestick chart with
Excel, from finding and entering the data to building the chart. I even clue
you in on a few ways to add some additional information to your Excel 
candlestick charts, including moving averages, trendlines, and volume data.
Finding the data for your chart
Before you can create an Excel candlestick chart, you need to compile the
right data. There are multiple sources for data, and a quick Internet search
can turn up dozens of options, some of which I explore earlier in this chapter.
(See “Turning to the Web for Candlestick Charting Resources”.) Of those
options, I typically use Yahoo! Finance for its ease of use, and that’s the
source I proceed with in this section. (See the section “Using Yahoo! Finance
for charting, trading, and investing”.)
57
Chapter 4: Using Electronic Resources to Create Full Charts

To get the data into Microsoft Excel, follow these steps:
1. Go to www.finance.yahoo.com.
2. Enter a stock symbol in the box at the top of the page and click the
Get Quotes button.
For this example, I use IBM.
3. In the blue box at the left of the page, click Historical Prices.
4. Above the data is a box labeled Set Date Range; use that to set the
range of dates for which you want to obtain data, and to specify
whether you want daily, weekly, or monthly data.
I chose June 1, 2006, to July 31, 2006, and daily data.
5. After making your choices, click the Get Prices button just below the
date choice boxes.
6. Scroll down below the data table and right-click your mouse on the
Download To Spreadsheet link and select Save Target As.
A save box opens; save your file under My Documents, and use your
symbol (I’ll use IBM) for a file name. Make sure that you’re saving as a
Microsoft Excel Comma Separated Values file, and click the Save button.
7. After the download is complete, click Close.
Congratulations! You now have the data needed to create a candlestick
chart using Microsoft Excel! Now you just need to make a couple of
minor modifications to the data and then create a chart. You’re almost
there!
Making sure the data is 
in the correct format
Unfortunately, Microsoft Excel needs your data to be in a very specific format,
and, of course, it doesn’t come directly from Yahoo! Finance in that format.
You need to make some quick adjustments to make sure that your numbers
are in order.
Basically Yahoo! gives you the right data but in the wrong order. Follow the
steps below to reverse the data and get you ready for the fun part: building 
a chart! Follow these steps:
1. In your saved Excel data file from Yahoo!, start by deleting the Adj.
Close column.
To delete this data, click the column letter in the gray box above the
word Volume (most likely column F) and drag your cursor to the next
column (most likely column G). Both columns will be highlighted.
58
Part I: Getting Familiar with Candlestick Charting and Technical Analysis 

2. While the columns are still highlighted, choose Edit and then Delete.
You’re left with five columns of data: Date, Open, High, Low, and Close.
3. Highlight all your data, and choose Data and then choose Sort.
4. Under Sort By, select Date.
Make sure the button next to Ascending is selected, and then click OK.
The data is now ready for creating a chart.
Building an Excel candlestick chart
Excel is a great way to get your feet wet building a chart. It also gives you
some experience as to what’s behind the chart. Commercial packages that 
do all the work for you don’t give you that type of experience.
At the time of this writing, I used Excel 2003, but I was just starting to work
with the 2007 version. The 2007 version is quite a change from the 2003 ver-
sion and is a little different to use. However, there are added features in the
2007 version that make it worth your while. Also, eventually, this new version
will be the standard, and you won’t have a choice. For now, as most people
still seem to have the 2003 version, the examples use that version.
Now it’s time to build a candlestick chart:
1. Highlight all the data in your spreadsheet, without highlighting the
headers.
2. Click Insert, and from the available choices select Chart.
Step 1 of 4 of the Chart Wizard appears.
3. Under Chart Type, scroll down and highlight Stock.
To the right of this box appear four chart choices; click the top right
one, which looks like a little candlestick chart.
4. Click Next at the bottom of the dialog box, and then click Next at 
Step 2 of 4.
That brings you to Step 3.
5. Click the Axes tab, and under Category (X) axis, click Category.
Also, make sure the Category (Y) axis button is checked. This step elimi-
nates missing days (such as weekends and holidays) from your chart.
6. Click the Gridlines tab.
Make sure there are no check marks in any of the boxes.
7. Click the Legend tab and make sure that the box next to Show Legend
is deselected.
59
Chapter 4: Using Electronic Resources to Create Full Charts

8. Click Next to open Step 4 of 4.
9. Click the button next to As new sheet.
10. Click Finish.
A new sheet with a candlestick chart has been added to your spreadsheet!
Congratulations! You’re now the proud owner of an Excel candlestick chart.
Feel free to right-click the chart to view all the options available for your tin-
kering pleasure. For example, when you right-click one of the black candles, a
Format Down Bars box opens, and you can change the color of all down bars
(bars for days when the close was lower than the open). The opportunities
for modification on Excel candlestick charts are many and varied.
For a point of reference, Figure 4-5 is a chart I created in Excel following the
above instructions. If you made all the correct clicks, your chart should look
very much like this example.
Although Excel’s candlestick charting is a very nice feature, it doesn’t allow
for much flexibility. If you want to change time frames, for instance, you may
need to completely rebuild your chart. But you can add in some additional
information to make your charts more functional. How? Read on through the
rest of this section to find out.
Adding a moving average to 
an Excel candlestick chart
If you’re interested in dressing up your Excel candlestick charts with some
added information, moving averages are a good place to start. A moving aver-
age is the average of the closing prices for today and looking back a certain
number of days. For instance, a five-day moving average would be the closing
today added up along with all the closing prices of the previous four days
with that total divided by 5. The process is easy, and the result gives you that
much more room to analyze and interpret. (Flip to Chapter 11 for more on
moving averages.)
Follow these instructions to add a moving average to your Excel chart:
1. With your candlestick chart sheet open in Excel (see preceding sec-
tion), select Chart on the menu bar, and a drop-down menu box
opens.
60
Part I: Getting Familiar with Candlestick Charting and Technical Analysis 

2. Select Add Trendline.
The Add Trendline box should open. There are six types of trendlines
from which to choose. Highlight Moving Average at the bottom right.
3. In the Period box to the right of the Moving Average box, scroll the
number up to 5.
This step provides you with a five-period moving average.
4. In the Based on series box at the bottom, highlight Close to ensure
that your moving average is based on closing prices.
5. Click OK at the bottom of the box.
Your chart should now contain a moving average. If you’re using the
same IBM data that I’m using, your chart should look like Figure 4-6.
Notice that the moving average doesn’t start until the fifth time period. This
is not usually the case in charting-specific software, just a quirk that appears
on Excel. The problem with this quirk is that if you try to add a moving aver-
age with a large number of data points, it may end up looking like Figure 4-7.

You have to search a bit for this moving average. See it? It’s the small line on
the right side of the chart. The line is pretty short because this is a 30-period
moving average, and as you can see, it’s not very useful because it only
appears on a tiny portion of the chart.

Adding a trendline to an 
Excel candlestick chart
Another function you can enjoy when using Microsoft Excel for charting is
the trendline function. It’s found in the same area as moving averages (see the
preceding section), so if you can add a moving average, you can easily add a
trendline. A trendline is a line that indicates the direction of a trend either
higher or lower. The line is usually drawn based on the lows (in the case of 
an uptrend) or the highs (based on a downtrend) of the price action in the
trend. For more information on trendlines and how to interpret them with
candlestick charts, turn to Chapter 11.
But for now, get going on adding a trendline to your chart:
1. With your chart sheet open in Excel, select Chart on the menu bar.
A menu box will open.
2. Select Add Trendline to open the Add Trendline box.
3. Highlight the top left box, which is Linear.
This choice is the default, so it may already be highlighted.
4. Click OK.
If you’ve continued using the data from the previous examples in this
chapter, your Excel chart with an added trendline should resemble
Figure 4-8.

Adding volume data to an 
Excel candlestick chart
The most difficult type of add-on for Excel candlestick charts is a volume
chart. There are a lot of additional steps involved with this operation, and if 
it gets to be too taxing, you may want to leave the volume charts to the free
online charting services described earlier in this chapter or the charting
packages discussed at the end of the chapter.
Formatting the data for your chart
In order to create a chart with candlesticks on top and volume on the bottom
(the standard presentation), download the data from Yahoo! Finance in its
raw form and then continue with the following:
1. To begin formatting the data in the correct order (Date, Volume,
Open, High, Low, Close), start by deleting column G (Adj. close).
2. Highlight column B, click Insert, and select Columns.
All columns except column A (Date) will move to the right, and column B
will be empty.
3. Highlight column G, click Edit, and select Copy.
4. Highlight column B, click Edit, and select Paste.
Column B should now contain your Volume data.
5. Highlight column G again, click Edit, and select Delete.
Column G will be empty.
6. Highlight columns A through F, click Data, and select Sort.
Make sure that the Sort By choice is Date and the button next to
Ascending is checked, and then click OK.
Creating the actual chart
Now you can make a chart with volume! The steps are very similar to creating
the basic Excel candlestick chart:
1. Highlight all the data in your spreadsheet.
2. Click Insert, and from the available choices, select Chart.
Step 1 of 4 of the Chart Wizard appears.
3. Under Chart Type, scroll down and highlight Stock.
In the Chart sub-type, select the bottom right choice.
4. Click Next, which takes you to Step 2 of 4.
64
Part I: Getting Familiar with Candlestick Charting and Technical Analysis 

5. Click Next to open Step 3 of 4.
6. Select the Axes tab and make sure that under Primary Axis then
Category (X) axis the button next to Category is selected.
7. Select the Gridlines tab and make sure that all boxes are deselected.
8. Click the Legend tab and make sure that the box next to Show legend
is deselected.
9. Click Next at the bottom of the box to advance to Step 4 of 4.
10. Click the button next to As new sheet and click Finish.
The result should be a chart similar to Figure 4-9. Notice the overlap of the
volume and the pricing data. You’re almost finished, but to correct that 
overlap and make the chart more readable, you need to make some small
adjustments.
Making the chart presentable
To make your chart fully readable, you need to adjust the range of the data
on the left side of the chart by doing the following:
1. Right-click one of the gray row number cells on the left side of your
chart and click Format Axis.
The Format Axis box will open.

2. Click the first two boxes under Auto to deselect Minimum and
Maximum.
Make sure the Minimum is set at 0. For Maximum, take the default
number and multiply it by 3. In my IBM example, the maximum is
16,000,000, so I would replace that with 48,000,000.
3. Click OK.
Your chart should now have the volume data clearly visible on the bottom
and the pricing action set nicely at the top. Your final result should look like
Figure 4-10.

I’ve spent my career working on institutional or professional trading desks,

Part I: Getting Familiar with Candlestick Charting and Technical Analysis 

Many low-cost charting software packages are available for download for your
candlestick charting endeavors, and I could probably write a whole book about
them, but for this chapter, I’ve chosen three of the most popular offerings. All
three of these have a core group of users that argue the merits of their chosen
software, but it’s best for you to consider what each package offers and choose
the one that best suits your needs.
Remembering a few key points when
selecting charting software
When deliberating on which charting package may be right for you, you need
to consider several key factors. First and foremost, make sure the software
has the ability to display candlestick charts. This book is full of reasons why
candlestick charting is a superior way to display price data, and there’s really
no reason to waste time or money with a package that isn’t candlestick
friendly. Some of the other factors you’ll want to consider are price, data
(where it comes from, what it costs, and so on), and applicability to the type
of security you’re trading. All are covered in this section.
Considering price
Price should be a primary concern when choosing charting packages. Any
money you lay down for the software has to be recouped through trading.
Although trading or investing may likely be more of a hobby than a business
for you, you should approach the profit and loss aspect in a very businesslike
manner. Suppose you’re making an average of $2,000 a month trading, but
you’re spending $3,000 on systems and equipment. You may be having fun,
but is it worth $1,000 a month?
Some charting packages can be downloaded at no cost, and then the providers
charge you each month to use the service. Others charge you for the one-
time download and for monthly service. Pricing for trading software ranges
from around $50 to $1,000 per month, depending on the level of functionality
you need. I pay about $200 per month for various services, and when tracking
my trading profits, I deduct these expenses at the beginning of each month.
If you’re planning to execute only a handful of trades per month, you may be
happy with an offering on the low end of this range. On the other end of the
spectrum, a trader sitting in front of a screen all day trying to make a living
wants all the bells and whistles that come with a high-end system.
67
Chapter 4: Using Electronic Resources to Create Full Charts

Determining data demands
Different charting packages offer various options in terms of the data you
need to get the most from the software. For example, you can have access 
to data that displays price moves in periods as short as a minute or as long
as a month. But if you’re trading over the course of a few days, you don’t
need access to minute-by-minute data, and a chart made up of monthly data
wouldn’t be of much use. You would most likely want to use a chart that dis-
plays data in a daily format.
You also need to consider how “fresh” you need your data to be, and make
sure that the charting package you’re considering is adept at dealing with the
right type of data. (By fresh, I mean data that’s being updated as the trades
occur, or “real-time” quotes.) If you’re looking to work with trading time frames
of less than a day, you may need real-time quotes, which can be costly. (Most of
the free quotes you get online are delayed by 15 or 20 minutes.) And if you’re
going to be paying for real-time data, you want to make certain that your chart-
ing software is built to work with that kind of data.
The exchanges charge for real-time data, and some of the fees are much higher
for professionals than for nonprofessional traders. There isn’t much difference
between the fees for pros and nonpros in the commodity exchanges, but 
the stock and option exchange fees for real-time data are based heavily on 
your professional status. Table 4-1 shows examples of the fees charged by
TradeStation for access to various exchanges (see the section “TradeStation”
later in this chapter). It provides a useful illustration of why you should be sure
to sign up as a nonprofessional.

Factoring in what you’ll be trading
Another consideration for your choice of charting software is what you’ll be
trading. Some packages are better equipped for handling stocks, and others
are more compatible with futures or commodities. There’s an 80-percent rule
that you can use here. Get the software that’s appropriate for 80 percent of
the trading you’ll actually be doing, not the trading that you hope to get into
in the future.

Part I: Getting Familiar with Candlestick Charting and Technical Analysis 

You may want to see if international markets are available if you think you
may expand in that direction in the future. Also, if you’re considering trading
options, the differences can be pretty dramatic. Make sure your focus is on
how the software works with your markets of choice.
Considering a few charting 
package options
To give you an idea of the charting packages available for individual traders
and investors, in this section, I highlight three of the most popular package
options. By no means are these the only options available, but they’ve been
around for quite some time, enjoy a wide user base, and offer conferences or
classes where you can discover more about using the packages.
Each of the charting packages discussed in this section offer some sort of
free trial. Take advantage of these risk-free test runs and don’t limit yourself
to just these three.
eSignal
I’m not sure if it’s a positive or a negative, but the variety of offerings from
eSignal can be a bit overwhelming. The company has several products that
run the gamut of sophistication from programs for amateurs to intricate soft-
ware made for the pros. The best way to illustrate the breadth of its product
line is to examine its products’ price range: Basic eSignal is as low as $95 a
month, while the most expensive product — Advanced GET — can run more
than $1,500 a month.
For novice purposes, focus on eSignal, the flagship product. It’s more than
adequate if you’re just getting started with charting and trading. It also covers
all domestic markets and allows you the choice of real-time or delayed data.
And eSignal also offers free seminars all over the country where you can find
out more about the product and charting in general, even if you don’t use
eSignal.
As a positive, the eSignal brand offers a full suite of very professional prod-
ucts, and as you work your way up to being a very successful full-time trader,
you can also move your way up its product line. More information on eSignal’s
products can be found at www.esignal.com.
MetaStock
MetaStock is actually a product of Reuters, which I discussed earlier in this
chapter. MetaStock offers what it calls real-time or end-of-day data, but it
69
Chapter 4: Using Electronic Resources to Create Full Charts

actually charges for its software platform, which starts at around $499. It also
adds a monthly fee starting at $59.
The software is very expensive but very powerful and may be the most pro-
fessional offering out there for individuals. MetaStock certainly has versatility
going for it — the program covers virtually every market you would even
consider trading in the world.
Check out MetaStock at www.equis.com.
TradeStation
One of the nice features that TradeStation has is the ability to back test trad-
ing strategies. One of the best methods for determining a trading plan is to
back test your trading ideas. This process involves taking historical data and
seeing what would’ve happened if you had applied and traded a set of rules
to this data — sort of an “If I would’ve known then what I know now” approach.
TradeStation’s back testing feature uses a programming language called
EasyLanguage. It takes some time to master, but it has a wide user base, and
classes are frequently offered online and at various sites across the country
to teach this programming language.
After you find the strategies that allow you to retire young, you can use
TradeStation’s automated trading feature to implement these strategies. This
function allows you to set up some trading systems in advance of when you
want them to become active, and TradeStation takes care of the rest. It’s a
great option if you work during the day but still want to get in on some short
term trading.
Go online to www.tradestation.com for info on TradeStation’s charting
package.
In addition to offering a very solid, easy-to-use charting software package,
TradeStation is also a brokerage firm. It’s actually a publicly traded brokerage
firm, so you can trade with it or trade its stock, which has the symbol TRAD.
You may be thinking, “Why do I care if it’s also a brokerage firm?” Well, this is
useful to know because if you use its brokerage arm for trading, you actually
get to use their charting package free of charge (as long as you conduct a
minimum number of trades each month; otherwise, the base price is $249 
per month).

M
any traders get interested in candlestick charting
because of the usefulness of candlestick patterns
for figuring out what a market or security is going to do
next. In fact, there’s a good chance that you picked up this
book with hopes of tapping into the potential of candlestick
patterns. If that’s the case, you’re going to love Part II.
This part is loaded with explanations of simple — one- or
two-stick — candlestick patterns. I explain how to identify
the patterns on a candlestick chart and how you can use
them to make wiser trading decisions. All the discussions
center on real world examples, so you can quickly see
how these patterns play out in a variety of markets.

Chapter 5
Working with Straightforward
Single-Stick Patterns

 Understanding bearish single-stick patterns and their uses
I
t’s time to begin diving into individual- and multi-period candlestick pat-
terns. Many patterns give buy and sell signals, and some serve as a heads-
up that a big move is on the horizon (although it’s not always clear just what
that big move will be!)
Most candlestick patterns are valid based only on the market activity of the
previous few days. For instance, some patterns indicate a change in trend.
Using one of these without knowing about the previous trend wouldn’t be
very useful. Usually, the context in which you find a pattern tells you a great
deal about what you should do based on that pattern. There are, however,
some single-stick patterns that are considered either bullish or bearish regard-
less of the context, and those patterns are what I focus on in this chapter.
This chapter explores the signals that may be given off from single-stick candle-
stick patterns, some bearish and some bullish. (The constructions of these pat-
terns are covered back in Chapter 3 if you need to have a quick look at what’s
behind these patterns.) I demonstrate what may have happened during a par-
ticular day trading-wise to result in the formation of a significant single candle-
stick on your chart. (I say significant, because candlestick patterns are often
used to forecast future price action.) I give examples of a candlestick signal
working well and also cases where the pattern may not give such a positive
signal. If you know how to recognize and trade on these examples, they should
provide some reliable tools that you can add to your trading toolbox.

The Bullish White Marubozu
The most bullish of patterns is the long white candle. It represents a day
during which the bulls controll trading and push prices higher from the open-
ing to the closing. As the price moves up, sellers come in, but not enough to
keep the price from continuing its rise. Any time sellers show up during this
day, the buyers buy from them, and prices move higher. With the long white
candle closing near the high, odds are the bulls aren’t done with their buying
and will be back for more on the following day. There just wasn’t enough
supply of stock by sellers to keep the buyers from pushing the price up.
The Japanese term for a long white candle is the white marubozu. There’s a
slight difference between a marubozu and a long white candle: The long white
candle may have some wick exposed on both ends. A true white marubozu
has either the opening price equal to the low for the day, the closing price
equal to the high, or both. A long white candle may not have the open equal
to the low or the close equal to the high, but its open should be near the low
and the close near the high. A true white marubozu has either the opening
price equal to the low for the day, the closing price equal to the high, or both
leaving no wick.
The Japanese names given to certain candlestick patterns or individual 
candlesticks can reveal important characteristics. Loosely translated, maru-
bozu means bald or little hair. These single-stick patterns earned their name
because they don’t have much of a wick on either end of the candlestick. The
sticks are bald!
Due to the baldness, the marubozu is a unique type of white candle. There
are several specific types of long white candles. Although they all depict bull-
ishness during the day, there are some unique characteristics to keep an eye
out for, which are covered in this section.
Understanding long white candles
One common feature of the long white candle (see Figure 5-1) is an open near
the low of the day and a close near the high of the day. This indicates that
buying has taken place throughout the day.
Figure 5-2 is an instraday chart of the price action that results in a long white
candle on a daily chart. An instraday chart is a chart that depicts the price
action during a time period that is less than a day, such as on a 5-minute or
30-minute basis. Each candlestick represents the price action for this subpe-
riod of a day. The day that corresponds to Figure 5-2, which is the price
action of a single day made up of 30-minute pricing periods, features an open-
ing price near the low of the day and a closing price near the high of the day.
A textbook long white candlestick has a long candle with no wick, but that
doesn’t happen very often, and long candles that have a little wick on either
or both ends are still considered long white candles.

75
Chapter 5: Working with Straightforward Single-Stick Patterns

To figure out if you’re looking at a long white candle, determine the area cov-
ered by the difference between the close and the open. If it’s at least 90 percent
of the area covered by the difference between the high and low, you have a
long white candle.
For the day in Figure 5-2, the bulls were in charge from the beginning of the day
to the end. There’s just no disputing this, because the price does nothing but
go higher over the course of the day, and the close is near the high of the day;
the bulls will probably stay in charge for the near future. It’s just that bullish.
You usually have the chance to act on such a case because there may be some
trading below the closing price of the long white candle in the next couple of
days, and you can place a buy order lower than the closing price but within the
range of the long white candle to try to get an attractive entry point.
On a long white candle day, a lot of price action is covered in a very short
amount of time. Stocks — and markets for that matter — don’t move in one
direction without some sort of move in the opposite direction. This normal
retracing of prices gives you a chance to act on this bullish signal.
The long white candle signaling an uptrend
Check out Figure 5-3, where you can see a few days where the price action is
lower than the high of the long white candle. After seeing this bullish signal,
you have several days to buy.
Sometimes signals don’t work, and it’s critical that you recognize this. With
long white candlesticks, the low price on the candlestick is a good support
level.
Support is a level where if market conditions are consistent, buyers are
expected to support the price of a security. If this support doesn’t hold, what-
ever buy signal you’re dealing with has changed, and the signal shouldn’t be
acted on. In that case, you should exit your position fairly quickly. You may
take a small loss, but getting out before prices fall even lower prevents you
from taking a much larger loss later on.
Look again at Figure 5-3, where I point out the low of the day on the long white
candle and also note that the price doesn’t trade below that support level over
the next few days. If you watch that stock and see that the support level is
broken, you should consider that the bullish signal failed and no longer valid.
I can’t stress enough that when a signal is no longer valid, any trades based
on that signal should be exited, and no new positions based on it should be
undertaken. Many small losers turn into big losers when the small loss isn’t
quickly realized and corrected.

Part II: Working with Simple Candlestick Patterns 

The long white candle failing as a long signal
What happens when the support level revealed by a long white candle is
broken? Take a look at Figure 5-4. This chart shows a nice long white candle
and then a quick violation of its support level. The failure of this stock to
hold support means that the long white candle on the chart doesn’t mean
bullish action is going to continue!

77
Chapter 5: Working with Straightforward Single-Stick Patterns

How do you cope with a failed signal? Take preemptive action. Place an order
that triggers when a signal fails. This process is known as a stop order. When
you’re trading long, stop orders are known as sell stop orders or sell stops. A
sell stop is placed below the current market price of a stock and triggered
when the price reaches this level. For example, if a stock is trading at 51, you
can place your sell stop order at 50. As long as trading stays over 50, nothing
will happen. However, once the price hits 50, a sell order is executed, protect-
ing you against further drops in price. Use stops when initiating positions to
minimize the damage caused when a signal turns bad.
Identifying the three variations 
of the long white candle
There are three versions of the long white candle. Although slightly different
in appearance, the three variations of the long white candle or marubozu
single-day pattern all represent a day during which the bulls were in control
from the open to the close.
The white marubozu
The first is the most bullish of them all: a long white candle with no wick. 
The day begins on the low and finishes on the high. This results in a white
marubozu, or as my three-year-old would call it, a white rectangle. Check 
out Figure 5-5 for the result.
Figure 5-5:
A white
marubozu.
78
Part II: Working with Simple Candlestick Patterns 

The closing white marubozu
The second version of the long white candle is another white marubozu, which
is known as the closing white marubozu. On this single-stick pattern, the
close is equal to the high, so there is no wick on top of the stick. Figure 5-6 
is a closing white marubozu.
The opening white marubozu
The third variation of the long white candle is the opening white marubozu.
This pattern’s opening price is equal to the low of the day, and as a result,
there’s no wick on the bottom. Figure 5-7 is an opening white marubozu.

79
Chapter 5: Working with Straightforward Single-Stick Patterns

The Bullish Dragonfly Doji
The doji is a type of candlestick pattern with variations and is created when
the open and close are equal, so there’s essentially no stick on the candle-
stick. Dojis are almost all wick. Take a look at Figure 5-8, which includes a 
few different types of dojis. As you can see, a doji looks more like a cross or 
a t than a pattern on a candlestick chart.
Loosely translated, doji means blunder or mistake. It’s said that the pattern
got its name because a whole day’s worth of trading just to end up back at
the starting point seems like a goof, but price action isn’t ever a mistake, so
I’m not crazy about that explanation.
Although there are several varieties of dojis, you can count on them all to be
fairly frustrating for traders. For a doji to be created, a day must begin and
end with the same price, so a whole lot of trading takes place, but when it’s
all said and done, the price is right back where it started. Dojis are differenti-
ated by the location of the open and close on the wick — where trading
begins and ends on a given day.
At first glance, dojis may not seem very exciting, but don’t be fooled. Doji pat-
terns are usually associated with a market turn, even though they depict a
day where the battle between bulls and bears is fairly equal. Even though the
battle for the day is a draw, one side soon overpowers the other. It’s like a
prolonged tug of war that ends when one team is violently yanked into the
mud. For the tug of war that’s a doji pattern, that yank in price action usually
occurs sometime in the next few days or even on the following day.
Although dojis do indicate some indecision, in some instances, a doji may be
more bullish or bearish depending on the price action. A dragonfly doji is one
of those cases. It is fairly bullish in nature due to the price action that is behind
this pattern.
Figure 5-8:
A variety 
of dojis.
80
Part II: Working with Simple Candlestick Patterns 

Recognizing a dragonfly doji
The dragonfly doji is unique in that three of the four candlestick components —
the open, high, and close — are equal. A dragonfly doji comes from a day
when a stock opens, trades down during the first part the day, and then at
some point starts to trade back up, eventually closing on the high (which is
also the open). In terms of bears and bulls, on a dragonfly doji day, the bears
initially decide they’re going to rule the day, and the resulting lower prices
lead the bulls to decide it’s time to buy. The bulls then take over and push
the price up as they dominate the rest of the day, until the price is right back
where it started. Refer to Figure 5-9 for a classic example of a dragonfly doji.
For an illustration of the inner workings of a day that results in a dragonfly
doji, check out Figure 5-10. This figure features a 30-minute chart of the price
action that occurs over the course of a day to cause a dragonfly doji. The
bears dominate the first half of the day, but the bulls take over in the after-
noon, and the result is a close equal to the open — all that struggling during
the day for nothing.

81
Chapter 5: Working with Straightforward Single-Stick Patterns

The price action behind a dragonfly doji bodes very well for those hoping
that prices go higher, because a price at which people buy aggressively has
been set at the low end of the wick. The low of a dragonfly doji day is consid-
ered a near-term support level, because it’s clear that buyers came in at that
level and turned the trend from down to up.
The length of a wick from the high to low doesn’t have to be any specific dis-
tance to qualify as a dragonfly. However, the wick length can signify the amount
of bullish significance a dragonfly doji has for future price action. Put simply,
the longer the wick, the more bullish the pattern. Figure 5-11 illustrates this
point.
Figure 5-11 displays price action that creates a dragonfly doji on a daily chart.
Dragonfly dojis appear when the open and close are very near or equal to the
high, so the beginning and ending of this chart are equal. The price action
during this day is very interesting. The bears take over from the open and
push the price down. Eventually, though, lower prices entice buyers and they
get aggressive, pushing the price back up to the open and settling on the high
of the day.

Part II: Working with Simple Candlestick Patterns 

Trading based on a dragonfly doji
You can make smart trades based on the dragonfly dojis you see in your
charts. Two charts can help:
 One in which a dragonfly doji indicates a nice buying opportunity
 One in which a dragonfly doji fails pretty badly
First the good one. Much like the long white candle I discuss earlier in this
chapter, the dragonfly doji helps you establish a solid support level to buy
with confidence. In Figure 5-12, notice how the bottom end of the dragonfly
doji wick works as a support level, which is held as the security remains bull-
ish for several days. The dragonfly doji appears after some range trading, and
it’s followed by a quick breakout of prices that reach new highs. Although the
first day following the dragonfly doji shows an opening price lower than the
previous close, the dragonfly’s low price isn’t violated, and the signal remains
valid. Sticking with this valid signal leads to some nice profits!
Figure 5-12:
A dragonfly
doji that
pays off.
83
Chapter 5: Working with Straightforward Single-Stick Patterns

Now for a dragonfly doji that doesn’t work out too well. The dragonfly that
appears in Figure 5-13 looks promising, but it’s followed the next day with a
low that’s lower than the bottom of the dragonfly’s wick. And as you can see,
the next moves are even lower.
The low of the dragonfly doji is a significant support level, but when that
level is violated, it negates the dragonfly’s buy signal. When a level is vio-
lated, get out as soon as possible.
The Bearish Long Black Candle
The long black candle is a direct counterpart of the long white candle dis-
cussed earlier in this chapter. It’s a long candlestick compared to other 
candlesticks on the same chart, and most or all of it is made up by a solid
candle.
The long black candle is as bearish as it gets. To see one of these candles
means that sellers take over at the beginning of the day and push prices lower
and lower until the end of the day. Typically, these sellers are just selling to
get out, and their price sensitivity is low. Seeing this type of enthusiastic sell-
ing should give you confidence that the bears will be in control for a few more
days after the long black candle appears, and you can capitalize on that.
Figure 5-13:

84
Part II: Working with Simple Candlestick Patterns 

Understanding long black candles
A long black candle is created when the bears seize control at the start of a
day and push until the day’s end. Figure 5-14 is a picture of a typical long
black candle.
For some quick insight on the numbers involved, have a look at Figure 5-15,
which is an intraday chart of price action that creates a long black candle.
Keep in mind that the figure is just one example, and that there are several
other intraday patterns that can produce a long black candle on a daily chart.
Basically, any pattern that begins near the high of the day and ends near the
low of the day results in a long black candle, even if the action that got the
price to the low occurred in just a couple of the 30-minute bars. The potential
intraday action is limitless; the important thing is to know the bears pushed
hard and down, and the bulls weren’t able to hold up the price.
The most important thing to bear in mind (pardon the pun) is that the long
black candle indicates that the bears were in charge for the majority of a 
day. The day begins with the bears controlling the activity, and it ends the
same way.
Figure 5-14:
A long 
black candle.
85
Chapter 5: Working with Straightforward Single-Stick Patterns

A useful rule of thumb for the long black candle is that the candle section
should cover at least 90 percent of the candlestick. The wicks should be
barely visible or completely missing.
The long black candle also usually indicates that many price levels have been
covered over the course of one day. A reversal is very possible in the short
term, but the long black candle shows the bears are being aggressive and
suggests that this aggression will continue.
Identifying black marubozus
Like the long white candles described earlier in this chapter, there are
marubozu versions of the long black candle, which are cleverly called black
marubozus. The black marubozu features an open equal to the high and a 
low equal to the close. Figure 5-16 is a black marubozu, or as my toddler son
would say, a black rectangle.
Just like their bullish counterparts, there are three variations of the black
marubozu. Figure 5-16 is the first variation, which is a marubozu that opens
on its high and closes on its low. The second is the closing black marubozu.
You can spot a closing black marubozu by recognizing that there’s no wick on
the candlestick at the bottom or closing end of the candlestick. The close is
equal to the low, while the open is a little bit lower than the high for the day.
Figure 5-17 is a closing black marubozu.
Figure 5-15:
A 30-minute
chart that
produces a
long black
candle on a
daily chart.
86
Part II: Working with Simple Candlestick Patterns 

The third variation is the opening black marubozu. This pattern is created
when the open is equal to the high of a day, and the close is just above 
the day’s low. A small wick appears only on the bottom of this candlestick.
Figure 5-18 is an example of a typical opening black marubozu. The appear-
ance of a small wick on the bottom of this candlestick indicates the possibil-
ity of some late-day buying or that the low price of the day enticed some
buyers. This source of speculation leads some to regard the opening black
marubozu as the least reliable of the three black marubozu variations.

Chapter 5: Working with Straightforward Single-Stick Patterns

Trading based on long black candles
Now it’s time to see how you can trade using long black candles in the real
world. Figure 5-19 is near and dear to my heart because it represents a trade 
I actually executed while writing this book. This is a chart of the November
soybean futures contract that trades at the Chicago Board of Trade. At the
time, I wanted to take a short position in the soybean contract, but was wait-
ing for a confirming trading signal or bearish chart pattern before I executed
my position. The long black candle highlighted in Figure 5-19 provided the
short signal I sought.
Getting a good bearish signal from a long black candle
I’ve noticed in the past that long white or black candlesticks are generally 
followed by continuations of their up or down moves more often with com-
modities than with stocks. Futures on commodities tend to have strong
trends. This tendency makes me quicker to initiate a position in futures than
in stocks. And by the same token, I’m usually quicker to concede that I’m
wrong on a futures trade than on a stock trade. Keep these differences in
mind and use them to your advantage. (Chapter 11 covers trends in more
detail.)
Back to my soybean trade. For fundamental reasons, I was looking for a signal
that told me to short the soybean futures contract. When I saw the long black
candlestick on a particular day, I put on a short near the close of that day. I
was quickly rewarded the next day, as another very bearish day followed.
Figure 5-18:
An opening

marubozu.
88
Part II: Working with Simple Candlestick Patterns 

If things hadn’t worked out as I’d planned, I still wouldn’t have suffered big
losses, because I also entered a protective order called a buy stop, which 
is the opposite of the sell stop mentioned earlier in this chapter (see
“Understanding long white candles”). My buy stop level was the high of the
long black candle — the resistance level that if broken, would negate the sell
signal given by the long black candle.
Keep in mind that resistance levels are where chartists believe sellers will be
brought into the market and keep prices from going higher. In candlestick
charting, resistance is generally the highest level of one of the candlesticks
that created a sell signal. After this resistance level is broken, the signal isn’t
considered valid anymore.
Luckily, that level was never reached, and the trade turned out to be a prof-
itable one. I continued to monitor the short position from day to day and
exited on the day indicated on the chart. The pattern for that day is a regular
doji, which often signals the reversal of a trend. I cover regular dojis in more
detail in Chapter 6.

Chapter 5: Working with Straightforward Single-Stick Patterns

A long black candle failing as a short signal
As with long white candles, and any candlestick patterns for that matter, long
black candles don’t always work out perfectly. Long black candles do fail, as
you can see in Figure 5-20. In fact, this figure includes two instances of long
black candle failures!
Figure 5-20 contains a chart of the futures contract trading on crude oil from
the summer of 2007. If you were involved with any oil or other energy-related
commodity trading during that time, you’ll remember that shorting was a
hard row to hoe then.
Two long black candles appear in Figure 5-20. Both fail. One crashes and
burns after a few days, and the other follows suit the very next day. For clar-
ity’s sake, I labeled them #1 and #2:
 Long black candle #1 was followed by an up day, but this up day didn’t
break resistance or the high of the signal candle. It managed to stay
below resistance for a few days before breaking out and then trading
higher for several days in a row. Note that if you didn’t get out of a short
position on the day that resistance was broken, you never had a shot to
get out at that level again. Without a protective buy stop at the failure
level, your losses would’ve continued to pile up.
 Long black candle #2 doesn’t work out too well either, but at least it
failed quickly. The possibility for a successful trade was clearly over at
that point, and if you were involved, you could’ve moved on to the next
trade. The trait that #2 shares with #1 is that if you didn’t exit when the
resistance level was violated, you basically didn’t have a chance to get
out at a lower level to limit your losses. Your losing trade would’ve just
gotten worse. Getting out of trades quickly is just as important as finding
and executing winning trades.
The Bearish Gravestone Doji
The doji is one of the most significant candlestick formations and is created
when the open and close for a day are equal. It doesn’t matter where this
occurs on a wick for a candlestick to be classified as a doji, but the location
dictates what kind of doji it is.
Identifying the gravestone doji
When the open and close are both equal to the low of the day, the result is
the most bearish of doji: the gravestone doji. Figure 5-21 is a good example 
of a bearish gravestone doji.
90

The price activity that creates a gravestone doji begins and ends at the low of
a day. The progression for the day includes the following:
1. A security opens and trades up during the day, as the bulls dominate
the activity.
2. Higher prices attract sellers, and the selling becomes strong enough to
overwhelm the bulls.
3. As the bears take over, the price is moved back down to the open,
which was also the low of the day.

Chapter 5: Working with Straightforward Single-Stick Patterns

Closing at this level after trading up during a day doesn’t bode well for the
bulls in the near term. Figure 5-22 provides an example of such a day, which
would be a fearful one for the bulls.
Trading based on gravestone dojis
Take a look in this section at a couple of examples of gravestone dojis that
have popped up in the real world and what happened afterward. The two
examples I provide are for stocks, not commodities. The first example, which
you can see clearly in Figure 5-23, is a gravestone doji that offered a useful
sell signal followed by lower prices.
I included several days of price action to show a combination of interesting
factors:
 First, notice that this gravestone doji signals the beginning of a pretty
prolonged downtrend in the stock.
 Second, notice that during the downtrend, there are a couple of smaller
gravestone dojis. If you’d shorted on the first gravestone doji and kept
on the short position, you would’ve been pretty happy with the results.
The appearance of a couple more bearish formations would’ve given you
the confidence to maintain your short position.

Part II: Working with Simple Candlestick Patterns 

 Finally, there’s a fourth gravestone doji toward the end of the downtrend.
Notice that it fails fairly quickly, as the following day has a high equal to
the original gravestone doji’s high. If you’d ridden the stock price down
to this level and seen a sell signal fail, it would’ve been time to buy the
stock back, take your profit, and move on to the next trade. That would
be a profitable outcome for you.
The next example shows what can happen if you’re not as fortunate. 
Figure 5-24 is a chart of Apple Computer’s stock (AAPL). A gravestone doji
appears in the middle of the chart and during an uptrend. Dojis are often
associated with a trend change, and seeing the bearish doji in an uptrend
may be a signal of a trend change to the down side. Unfortunately for anyone
trading this sell signal, things don’t work out so well.
The gravestone doji is initially followed by a couple of down days, and it does
appear that the trend may be changing. However, a couple of positive days
put this trend change in doubt. A couple of days later resistance is tested and
broken, and the uptrend continues. The sell signal failed, but a nimble trader
would’ve placed a buy stop to limit the losses on this failure.

n Chapter 5, I cover a few of the more basic and easily defined single-stick
candlestick patterns, which are either bullish or bearish indicators regard-
less of their location on a chart. For those patterns, the price action that
occurs during the previous few days just isn’t that significant.
But not all single-stick patterns are that straightforward. Some extremely
useful single-stick patterns rely heavily on their location on a chart. Making
yourself familiar with these patterns and how to identify and trade based on
them is another way that you can add a versatile weapon to your trading
arsenal. That’s what this chapter is all about. Also, context is essential to the
single-stick patterns that are covered in this chapter. This isn’t always the
case, but for this chapter, you need to know the market environment before
deciding if a signal or pattern is valid.
A variety of single-stick patterns can provide some terrific trading opportuni-
ties if you can spot them in the right market environment. I begin this chapter
by quickly touching on how you can define a market environment, and then I
cover some of the most significant single-stick patterns that you can exploit
for profitable trading.

Understanding Market Environments
In order to take full advantage of single-stick patterns that rely heavily on the
market context in which they appear, you first need to know how to quickly
and effectively determine the market environment. Being aware of the current
market environment is key to properly using most candlestick patterns in
general, but especially for the ones I describe in the rest of this chapter.
The three market states
A market or stock is usually defined as being in one of three states:
 Bullish: Price behavior trending up
 Bearish: Price behavior trending down
 Range bound: No discernable trend
Deciding which of the three states a market is in can be as easy as looking
back a few weeks on a chart and spotting a general direction or drawing a
line that shows the market’s trend. It may also be as complicated as using a
technical indicator to reveal the direction of the market. These indicators are
covered extensively in Chapter 11, but for this chapter, I use examples where
the market trend is easy to decipher.
Identifying the market trend
For a quick visual representation of what an uptrend or downtrend looks like
on a chart, check out these figures; it doesn’t get much clearer. Figure 6-1
shows an uptrend.
Figure 6-2, conversely, shows a downtrend.
At times, the market environment may not be completely apparent or obvi-
ous. Either different people may see the trend or lack of trend in a different
way or the time frames participants are using may cause different traders to
have differing views of the trend or lack of trend. If that’s the case, then pass
on any trades you’re considering. The uncertainty is just too high, and there
will always be another trading opportunity in the future.

Chapter 6: Single-Stick Patterns That Depend on Market Context

Delving Into Dojis
A doji is a single-stick pattern in which the open and close for a day are equal
(see Chapter 5 for more discussion on dojis). This level of exactness is a
rarity, though, and some candlestick chartists are flexible and say that if the
open and close are very near each other, it’s still considered a doji. I agree,
although I do think that they need to be the same in the case of the dragonfly
and gravestone — two dojis that are indisputably bullish and bearish, respec-
tively. But there are other varieties of dojis for which the market context is
critical, and I cover a few of the significant ones in this section.
Dojis are often associated with the reversal of a trend and can serve as out-
standing reversal indicators. If a doji appears in an uptrend, it could very well
indicate that the trend may be changing to a downtrend soon, especially if the
doji is a gravestone doji. Likewise, if a doji (especially a dragonfly doji) appears
during a downtrend, there’s a good chance that things will look up soon.
The long legged doji
In addition to the dragonfly and gravestone dojis (covered in Chapter 5), one
last doji is significant enough to merit a specific name. This one is cleverly
called the long legged doji.
A long legged doji is considered a reversal signal when appearing in an uptrend
or downtrend. This doji indicates that there has been much uncertainty in the
market after a period of directional certainty. This change of conviction often
results in a change in trend.
Identifying long legged dojis
The long legged doji has a fitting name: It features a small stick with very long
wicks (or legs) on each end. The small candle on a long legged doji is normally
located very close to the center of the candlestick. Check out Figure 6-3 for a
classic example of a long legged doji.
In addition to its unique appearance, the long legged doji is singled out due
to the unusual price action that causes the formation of this candlestick pat-
tern on a daily chart. Figure 6-4 provides a look at a 30-minute chart that
translates into a long legged doji.
Figure 6-4 just looks like a roller coaster ride. Imagine trying to trade during a
day like that and ending up where you started. You can really lose (or win)
big on such a day.

Chapter 6: Single-Stick Patterns That Depend on Market Context

If you’ve just started trading or don’t feel quite comfortable with your trading
abilities yet, it’s probably best for you to steer clear of day trading on
extremely volatile days. I’ve been trading for years, and I have taught myself
to lay off the day trading when things are particularly hairy.
Using long legged dojis as buy signals
As I mentioned earlier in this section, the long legged doji may be a buy or sell
signal depending on prior price action. In a downtrend, the signal can forecast
a change to an uptrend and act as a buy signal, and in an uptrending market,
the long legged doji can indicate that the uptrend is coming to an end and
serve as a sell signal. I provide a couple of examples where a long legged doji
is a good buy signal and then demonstrate where it doesn’t work out too well.
The long legged doji giving a good buy signal
Figure 6-5 is a long legged doji that occurred in late 2002 on the futures con-
tract of the Canadian dollar. It occurred after three very bearish days in a row
and was followed by a very nice uptrend. This example shows how a long
legged doji works when it signals the end of a down move. Unfortunately, I
didn’t trade this particular scenario, but I definitely will if I see the same 
pattern in the future!

Part II: Working with Simple Candlestick Patterns 

Notice that the doji buy signal in Figure 6-5 works almost immediately —
what’s expected of a trend changing signal. If the signal doesn’t seem to be
working very quickly, beware.
Trading against a trend is a very dangerous prospect. You need to be sure
you’re prepared to take a loss and move on quickly to the next trade if things
go sour.
A failing long legged doji
Now on to the bullish long legged doji that didn’t work too well. In all honesty,
it was difficult to find a good real-world example. The long legged doji is fairly
rare, and when it shows up during a trend, it usually does signal an impending
trend change. It does happen, though, and Figure 6-6 is an example of a long
legged doji that didn’t signal a change in trend.
Figure 6-6 features price action for a stock with a long legged doji showing up
after a few downtrending days. The price trends up for the next day or two
and things look fine, but then the long legged doji’s low is broken, and the
signal is no longer valid. If you were trading this stock and didn’t get out at
that critical point, where a stop order should’ve been placed or an exit trade
should’ve been executed, you would’ve endured some pretty painful losses.
Figure 6-6:

101
Chapter 6: Single-Stick Patterns That Depend on Market Context

Be sure you’re prepared to get out of a trade immediately after the signal
you’re trading goes bad. Use that as a rule, and follow that rule regardless of
how much it may hurt. To help me remember the importance of these rules, 
I taped the following quote from Zen in the Markets by Edward A. Toppel to
the monitor on my trading desk: “You can break the rules and get away with
it. Eventually the rules break you for not respecting them.”
Using long legged dojis as sell signals
Just as a long legged doji that appears during a downtrend can be considered
a buy signal or the end of the downtrend, a long legged doji that appears in
an uptrend may be considered an uptrend reversal or sell signal that can be
extremely helpful if you’re looking to short a security.
Sometimes in the market no trend is obvious or exists. If you see a long legged
doji during one of these times, do nothing. The long legged doji is only useful
as a signal when it appears during a trend.
Seeing a good short signal on the long legged doji
Have a look at Figure 6-7 for an example of a long legged doji that provides a
useful signal for shorting. This daily stock chart is for Gap, Inc. (GPS). The
long legged doji appears in the middle of an uptrend. Notice that there wasn’t
much of a chance to get out of a long position, and although the opportunity
to put on a short was definitely there, you would’ve had to have been on your
toes to pull it off. The stock opened up slightly the next day, and then the
bears took over and dominated most of the day. Even the bears that were late
to the party toward the end of the day were rewarded with a substantial gap
down the next day.
The long legged doji sells signal failing
As always, an example that didn’t work too well is in order. Figure 6-8 is a
chart of the futures contract that trades on the Canadian dollar. In the center
of the chart is a nice long legged doji that appears in an uptrend that may
seem to be rolling over. Rolling over means that the price action on a chart
has been strong but is starting to top out. I’ve highlighted the uptrend and
then where the price begins to roll over or top out. Toward the right side of
this rolling price action, a long legged doji appears. Things look good for a
little while, and then the high of the doji is overtaken, and the price is off to
the races once again.

Chapter 6: Single-Stick Patterns That Depend on Market Context

Other dojis
The long legged doji, bullish dragonfly doji, and gravestone dojis are power-
ful but rare. You’re more likely to see a doji with an open and close that
appear somewhere other than the center or one of the ends of a wick. These
dojis are still useful as reversal indicators, and because they appear more
often than the named dojis, they offer more trading opportunities. Figure 6-9
highlights a variety of dojis.
When evaluating a doji, I look for the candle to appear on the top half of the
wick if I’m using the doji as a buy signal or on the bottom half of the wick if
I’m using it as a sell signal. With the open and close near the high, I feel that
the bulls are winning the day, and if the open and close are near the low, I feel
that the bears are coming out on top.
Figure 6-9 looks like a chart that my three-year-old created while she was
learning how to write the letter t. Basically dojis just look like t’s or upside
down t’s.
Using regular dojis to trade long
Figure 6-10 is a chart of the stock Capital One Financial Corp. (COF). Notice
the long doji on the left. After that doji, the stock takes off on a very nice
uptrend. The doji is a great example because the candle that marks the open
and close is clearly in the top half of the price action for the day. I really have
more comfort buying a doji signal when the price closes near the high; I just
feel that more bulls are on my side.
Figure 6-9:
A variety 
of dojis.
104
Part II: Working with Simple Candlestick Patterns 

For an example of a failing doji signal, see Figure 6-11. It’s a chart of the futures
contracts that trade on the Japanese Yen. In the center of the chart is a doji
appearing during a definite downtrend. The signal is negated the following day
with a violation of the low of the day in which the doji appeared. Once again, if
you traded this signal and you didn’t call it quits after the violation and signal
failure, you’d be in for a painful ride down.
Using regular dojis to short
Regular dojis work well in short or selling situations, too. Figure 6-12 shows a
short doji formation in an uptrend that quickly reversed for a nice short sell-
ing opportunity in the U.S. Treasury bond futures. The short doji is high-
lighted, along with another doji. The day after the short doji, the rarest of all
dojis appears on the chart: the four-price doji, which occurs when the open,
high, low, and close are the same on a chart. This occurrence is very rare and
usually happens on a very low volume day. The incidence may also represent
a data error. In this case, having a source to double-check the data behind the
chart would be very helpful. (See the “Data Integrity” sidebar in this chapter
for more details.)

106
Part II: Working with Simple Candlestick Patterns 

The signal doji in Figure 6-12 meets the criteria of appearing in an uptrend
and then also appears to have the open and close in the bottom half of the
day’s price action. No violation negates the signal, and the signal is quickly
followed by a downtrend lasting several days. I wish all my trades were so
easy to identify and profit from.
Like all other signals, short dojis aren’t perfect. Have a look at Figure 6-13, a
chart of IBM. This figure shows two failures of a short doji signal within the
span of just a couple of weeks. Both are highlighted on the chart, and both
fail pretty quickly.
This leads me to another fact I’ve picked up over the years. Each market or
stock may have its own individual trading characteristics. Although shorting
a doji formation in an uptrend may be a highly successful trading method for
the majority of financial instruments, there may be some out there who con-
tinuously shrug off this sell signal. Unfortunately, knowing what works well in
various markets is just a matter of putting in time and gaining experience.

107
Chapter 6: Single-Stick Patterns That Depend on Market Context

Looking At Other Patterns: Spinning Tops
Like the doji, the spinning top is another single-stick pattern that depends on
market context and reveals a tight battle between bulls and bears. Whenever
the bulls-versus-bears battle is close, eventually one side has to give, and
when this happens, an explosive move in one direction is possible. My favorite
analogy for that scenario is a coiled spring being pushed hard on both sides.
Eventually one side gives in, and that’s the direction the spring flies.
The key is picking the right direction, and considering the market environment
where you find your pattern helps you make the right pick. For spinning tops
or any other patterns that indicate a tight battle between bulls and bears, 
if the bulls have been in charge for some time leading up to the pattern, it
usually indicates that the bears are starting to gain some strength. And the
reverse is also true: If the pattern appears during a bearish trend, it generally
indicates that the bulls are going to make a run (and you don’t have to be in
Pamplona to run with them).
Identifying spinning tops
To qualify as a spinning top, a candlestick should have a small body and wicks
that stick out on both ends. The body should appear close to the center of the
range of the day’s price action. Also, the wicks should both be at least as wide
as the candle section of the candlestick. For a clear picture of what a spinning
top looks like, check out Figure 6-14.
108
Part II: Working with Simple Candlestick Patterns 
Data integrity
With so many financial products trading in the
world today and so much data floating around,
data errors are bound to occur. In the case of a
four-price doji, having a second source to check
the price action of the day is extremely valuable.
As a professional trader, I use multiple charting
software packages and data sources to assure
that the data I’m using accurately reflects the
price action that occurred in the past. With
fewer resources, you may want to consult an
exchange’s Web site for data accuracy or free
data sources such as Yahoo! (www.yahoo.
com) or MarketWatch.com (www.market
watch.com). (Flip back to Chapter 4 for more
information about online and electronic sources
of charting information.)
MarketWatch.com has a terrific function that
allows you to enter a stock symbol and a spe-
cific date to check for accuracy. Either way,
when you see some price action that looks out
of place on a chart, doing a double check can
save you frustration and money in the long run.

The color of a spinning top’s candle isn’t terribly important, although it’s nice
to see a dark body if you’re expecting a reversal of an uptrend (sell signal) or
a white body if you’re expecting a reversal of a downtrend (buy signal).
One of the best features of spinning tops as compared to dojis is that spin-
ning tops appear much more frequently. Dojis are powerful signals, but they
can be pretty rare. I scanned many charts to come up with the examples for
this book, and it was much, much easier to find good examples of spinning
tops than it was to track down dojis. And with more appearances come more
chances to trade and make more profits!
Using spinning tops for profitable trading
Like dojis, spinning tops are nice indicators that a trend may be about to
change direction. Catching an early trend change can be a very profitable
endeavor, and in the sections below, I give you an idea of how you can 
execute some fruitful trades by using spinning tops.
Recognizing a buy signal with a spinning top
Figure 6-15 is a chart of the futures contracts that trade on the Standard &
Poor’s 500 Index (S&P 500). The low of a downtrend culminates with a spin-
ning top, and a trader who recognizes this signal is rewarded with a nice up
move if she shows a little patience.
Figure 6-14:
Examples 
of spinning
tops.
109
Chapter 6: Single-Stick Patterns That Depend on Market Context

For this reversal pattern, I wanted to use a chart that appeared to be failing
initially. Although the futures contract in Figure 6-15 didn’t immediately reverse
to an uptrend, it also didn’t match the low of the signal day. The contract came
close, but the low was never broken, so the signal was never violated. Such a
case may test your patience, but sticking with this buy signal would’ve been
rewarded after a few days of watching it go nowhere.
Looking at an example of a failing spinning top
On the flip side, take a look at Figure 6-16, which is a chart of the futures con-
tracts that trade on the ten-year U.S. Treasury notes. I’ve highlighted a spin-
ning top that appears in a downtrend. The next day shows a quick failure,
with the downtrend continuing for several days afterward. Although the
appearance of the spinning top on this chart may have been a hopeful sign
for someone choosing to go long, that hope was dashed pretty quickly.
Getting a nice short signal from a spinning top
Spinning tops may also be used quite effectively to recognize a shift from an
uptrend to a downtrend. Figure 6-17 is a chart of the futures contract on the
Euro currency. A spinning top appears just as an uptrend is rolling over, which
is a favorite situation of mine. The next day’s high comes very close to pen-
etrating the high of the spinning top signal day, but doesn’t quite get there.
The result is a downtrend that lasts almost a month.

110
Part II: Working with Simple Candlestick Patterns 

To capitalize on the scenario presented in Figure 6-17, you would initiate a
short position on the futures contract either near the close of the day on
which the spinning top appeared or the next day, when the spinning top was
validated by the fact that the day’s high didn’t violate the high of the 
previous day.

Figure 6-18 shows a chart where spinning tops just keep failing. This chart is
of the stock for Yahoo!, which carries the symbol YHOO. I’ve highlighted
three spinning tops that appear after some small uptrends. Each fails pretty
quickly and miserably.
Discovering More about Belt Holds
More single-stick patterns that depend on market context and offer outstand-
ing trend reversal signals are belt holds. But wait — if you read Chapter 5, you
and belt holds have already been introduced, although you may know them
by a different name.
Belt holds are exactly the same as marubozus that have no wick on the open-
ing end of the candlestick formation. As with the other patterns in this 
chapter, the difference is that the usefulness of belt holds as trend reversal
signals depends heavily on the market environments in which they appear.

Part II: Working with Simple Candlestick Patterns 

Spotting belt holds on a chart
There are two types of belt holds: bullish and bearish. Bullish belt holds fea-
ture an open equal to the low and a close near the high, which leaves a small
wick on the top of the candle. Bullish belt holds appear during downtrends.
For an ideal example of a bullish (long) belt hold, take a peek at Figure 6-19.
Bearish belt holds, on the other hand, open on their highs and close near
their lows, thus leaving a small wick on the bottom of the candle. Bearish 
belt holds show up in the midst of uptrends. You can find a picture perfect 
version of a bearish (short) belt hold in Figure 6-20.
Buckling down for some 
belt hold-based trading
It’s time to investigate what it’s like to trade signals. These are pretty power-
ful and common patterns that can be used. The dramatic reversal from the
opens they represent often does show a trend change occurring over the
course of just one day.
Figure 6-19:
Textbook
example 
of a long
belt hold.
113
Chapter 6: Single-Stick Patterns That Depend on Market Context

The price action behind a belt hold is pretty directional. For example, a stock
in a defined downtrend may open on its low and then spend most of the day
rallying. As a downtrend presents itself, the bulls have finally had enough and
start buying. Prices reach a low enough level to encourage not just buying,
but aggressive buying.
Belt hold as a long signal
Figure 6-21 is a chart of Wal-Mart stock. The long belt hold pattern actually
shows up on the chart on the day after Christmas in 2006. I like this chart
because in addition to this being the company’s most important time of year,
it shows how sentiment changed relative to the retailing environment right
after the crucial holiday season had ended.
Two factors contribute to the strength of this long belt hold.
 The sheer length of the candlestick: Very aggressive buying is exhibited
by the size of the candle and overall candlestick.
 The fact that the gap from the opening price was filled: Also, you can
find another bullish indication in the fact that that the stock gapped
lower than the previous low on the open (it means that the price attracted
buy interest immediately). Notice that the whole price action of the pre-
vious day was covered. That’s bullish stuff.
Figure 6-20:

Part II: Working with Simple Candlestick Patterns 

Belt hold failing on the long side
Want to know what happens when bullish belt holds go bad? Look at 
Figure 6-22. This figure is a chart of the futures contract that trades on 
soybeans. The bullish belt hold comes on the heels of some pretty bearish
trading that occurred over the course of a few weeks. For the sake of full dis-
closure, I’ll fess up and say that I actually traded this signal because I was
looking for a short-term bottom and was encouraged by the price action of
that day. However, I was a little less wealthy the next day because the signal
failed. Happens to the best of us.
Bearish belt hold signals occur when there’s an obvious uptrend with a day
that opens on its high and closes very near its low. This signal appears as a
dark candle with just a small part of the wick appearing on the bottom. It’s 
a day when the bears rule for most of the day after being pushed around by
the bulls for several days prior.
Bearish belt hold working out
For a nice bearish belt hold scenario, look at Figure 6-23. This chart of
exchange traded funds represents a basket of biotech stocks also known as
the Biotech Holders (BBH). The BBH bears had been overtaken by the bulls,
but the short belt hold reveals that the bears are clawing their way back into
the action.

Part II: Working with Simple Candlestick Patterns 

Take a closer look at Figure 6-23. Notice any additional bearish patterns? I
chose this chart specifically to try to push you to start looking beyond what I
highlight on a chart. Give yourself a pat on the back if you notice the doji the
day before the belt hold. Give yourself two pats if you notice the doji’s short
signal was intact while you received a short signal from the belt hold. I’d give
you a chance to give yourself three pats on the back, but that can be hard on
your rotator cuff.
A failing bearish belt hold
Just so you’ll know what to look for if you suspect that a bearish belt hold
may be failing, check out Figure 6-24. It depicts the futures contract that
trades on the Japanese Yen.
It’s a really nice bearish belt hold pattern, except that it just doesn’t work
out. The belt hold appears during an uptrend that’s been in place for several
days, and it’s pretty encouraging that lower trading occurs during the next
few days. However, seven days after the signal appears, the Yen futures trade
over the high of the belt hold day and then trade much higher pretty quickly.
Sometimes signals take a few days to fail. They don’t immediately show signs
of failure, so stay on your toes and keep your eyes out for signs of trouble.

Chapter 6: Single-Stick Patterns That Depend on Market Context

Deciphering between the Hanging 
Man and the Hammer
The last single-stick patterns that rely on a specific market environment that I
present in this chapter are the hanging man and the hammer. I paired them
together in this section because they appear exactly the same. Don’t be
fooled, though — the two patterns aren’t identical. The hanging man is con-
sidered bearish, and the hammer is considered bullish, and the difference
between the two is where they appear on a chart.
Spotting and distinguishing the 
hanging man and the hammer
The first step in working with the hanging man and the hammer is under-
standing how to spot them on a chart. The pattern is fairly distinctive, so
identifying it usually isn’t a problem.
The hammer or hanging man is recognized by a small candle that appears at
the very top of the pattern. There’s usually a pretty long wick on the bottom.
If you see this pattern at the bottom of a downtrend, you’re looking at a
hammer. If it appears at the top of an uptrend, it’s considered a hanging man.
(Both cases assume that the patterns are actually good signals, of course.)
Also, in less than ideal cases, it’s possible for a small wick to be sticking out
of the top of the candle.
For a classic example, look at Figure 6-25.

Part II: Working with Simple Candlestick Patterns 

Although the hammer and the hanging man are individual patterns, there’s
one extra step to them: the confirmation of the pattern. The confirmation
comes on the following day’s opening price. If the opening price on the very
next day is in the direction of the signal, you’re working with a true hammer
or hanging man. If you think you have a hanging man appearing in an uptrend,
you wouldn’t trade on it unless it’s confirmed the next day with an opening
price lower than the previous close. By the same token, if a hammer appears
during a downtrend, you need to confirm it with an opening price on the next
day that’s higher than the hammer’s close.
Trading on the hanging 
man and the hammer
To better illustrate the intricacies of the hanging man and the hammer, I show
you examples of both patterns that were either confirmed the next day or not
confirmed. If you’re planning to dig into later chapters and read more about
complex patterns, get used to the idea of confirming patterns, because it pops
up continually throughout the rest of the book.
Going long with a hammer pattern
Figure 6-26 is a chart of Dell, Inc. (DELL) stock with a hammer that pops up
during a downtrend. The following day, the stock opens higher than the close
of the previous day for DELL. That’s the confirmation that indicates that the
hammer is a good long signal, and you’d be very wise to wait for it before
buying. Be patient and wait for the confirmation, even if you’re completely
convinced that it’s hammer time!
The confirmation may cost you a little in profits because you pay a slightly
higher price, but Figure 6-27 shows what it may cost you if you choose not 
to wait.
Figure 6-27 is also a chart of DELL. This one contains a potential buy hammer
that isn’t confirmed on the next day. In fact, the opening the next day is lower
than the low that occurred on the day that the hammer appeared. Not only
would you have saved yourself the effort of trading in and out of this stock by
waiting for confirmation, but you’d also have saved yourself a little in losses.
If a candlestick signal calls for some sort of confirmation, always wait for the
confirmation. Don’t try to get ahead of the confirmation day by trading in
early. In the long run, it catches up with you!

Shorting with a hanging man pattern
Now for a look at a successful hanging man. Figure 6-28 is a chart for the
stock of Toll Brothers, symbol TOL. If you aren’t familiar with Toll Brothers,
it’s a homebuilder focusing on the higher end of the housing market. If you
remember what happened to the housing market in 2007, you can see why
this is a good short example.
Figure 6-28 shows how you could have made money when the housing market
first started to tank. I’m not saying that trading housing-related stock is the
way to offset any potential losses in the value of your home, but this was a
chance to take advantage of the fall in value of a home-building company as 
it anticipated the drop in housing prices and home sales activity.
Right at the very peak of a trend in the TOL stock, a hanging man appeared. If
you happened to already own this stock (also called being long), that was a
pretty scary signal that may have suggested that it was time to take your
profits and move on to a less risky investment. If you were in the market look-
ing for a stock to short, that would’ve looked like a swell opportunity. After
the hanging man, a very dramatic reversal occurred, and the downtrend con-
tinued for several weeks.
Figure 6-28:

121
Chapter 6: Single-Stick Patterns That Depend on Market Context

Finally, I provide you with a hanging man that doesn’t get confirmed. Sorry
for the abundance of examples using retail stocks, but I’ve had a profitable
history with them, and they often make good examples. Figure 6-29 is a chart
of the stock for Kohl’s Stores (KSS).
A very encouraging hanging man appears on the chart in a defined uptrend.
However, after waiting patiently overnight for confirmation of the end of the
uptrend and a shorting opportunity, a trader is surprised to see a gap opening
and a continuation of the uptrend. If she’s following the rules (as she should
be) and waiting for the confirmation of the hanging man, all she gets is disap-
pointment. But it could be worse: If she’d jumped the gun and sold, it
would’ve cost her even more.

Working with Bullish 
Double-Stick Patterns
In This Chapter
 Understanding double-stick patterns that signal a trend reversal
 Working with double-stick patterns that tell you a trend will continue
C
ompared to the single-stick patterns in Chapters 5 and 6, double-stick
patterns are difficult to come by. But these patterns can be very power-
ful and profitable if you put in the time and effort to monitor them.
I tackle a number of double-stick patterns in this chapter, and each of them
consists of two days. I’ll refer to the first day as the setup day, and I’ll call the
second day the signal day. When you’re looking for double-stick patterns,
you’ll have to start paying attention to the possibility of a pattern developing
on the setup day, and you’ll react (trade) if you see what you need to see on
the signal day.
In this chapter I cover some double-stick patterns that signal a trend reversal
and a few that signal a trend continuation. The reversal signals are more fun,
because they help you to outsmart the crowd and buy near the end of a trend.
The trend confirming signals are useful if you’re already on the right side of a
trend, or if you’re considering going against a trend, and you’re looking for 
a signal that can kindly tell you to reconsider.
If you want to go hunting for double-stick patterns, I must warn you that
you’re bound to suffer some disappointments. Often, you see the beginnings
of a double-stick pattern on the first day, but you can get discouraged when
the pattern doesn’t shape up correctly on the second day. Your patience may
be tested, and you may want to bag it and work only with single-stick 
patterns, but doing so is like playing the game without all the equipment 
you need to play it well.

Bullish Reversal Patterns
A wide variety of two-day patterns signal the end of a downtrend and the
beginning of an uptrend, and those patterns are the focus of this section.
There’s an old saying in trading that “the trend is your friend.” It’s based on
the idea that getting (and staying) on the right side of the trend is the best
way to make a profit in the market. I don’t disagree with that sentiment, but
plenty of traders make a good living catching changes in trend. It’s not the
easiest type of trading, but it can be rewarding. This type of trading basically
involves trying to pick a top or bottom of a trending move. Because this
involves going against the current type of market and against the majority 
of participants, it’s a difficult process.
If your trading strategy is dependent on catching trend changes, make sure
that you’re humble and quick to acknowledge when you’re wrong about a
trade. Use orders that force you to take a small loss before you rack up big
losses.
Throughout this section, I include patterns that work and ones that fail, and I
point out where a trade starts to go wrong. In these examples, you can see
how bad a trade can get if you don’t play it safe and take a small loss to pre-
vent losing big.
Bullish engulfing pattern
The first two-stick pattern is the bullish engulfing pattern. The pattern’s name
comes from the fact that the signal day engulfs the setup day. Both the wick
and the body of the second day completely cover the same ground as the
first day and then some. Also the first day of this bullish pattern is a down
day, with the second day starting out looking like there’s going to be more
bearish trading, but this selling is reversed by the emergence of buying — 
so much buying that the previous day’s open and highs are both surpassed.
(There’s also a bearish version of this pattern, and it’s covered in Chapter 8.
In fact, most of the bullish two-stick patterns I discuss in this chapter have a
bearish counterpart.)
Spotting the bullish engulfing pattern
To find the bullish engulfing pattern, take these steps:
1. First look for a setup day with a dark candle.
2. Then look to see if the signal day is bullish.
If so, you’re on the right track, but the following statements must also be
true in order for your pattern to be a full-fledged bullish engulfing pattern:
124
Part II: Working with Simple Candlestick Patterns 

• The wick of the signal day is longer than the wick of the setup day.
• The high of the signal day is higher than the high of the setup day.
• The low of the signal day is lower than the low of the setup day.
• The candle of the signal day is longer than the candle of the setup
day. (In this case the signal day’s close is higher than the setup
day’s open, and the open of the signal day is lower than the close
of the setup day.)
Figure 7-1 includes two days that create a bullish engulfing pattern.
The trading activity that creates this pattern is extremely bullish:
 On Day 1 (the setup day) the bears dominate.
The open is near the high, and they push the price down all day until the
close ends up near the low.
 On Day 2 (the signal day) the bears are at it again and move the price a
bit lower before the bulls come roaring in.
They arrive on the scene and immediately start pushing prices up, and
they don’t stop. The bulls exceed the prices from the previous day and
even push the closing price up over where trading commenced the pre-
vious day.
When a bullish engulfing pattern occurs in a downtrend, that indicates that
the bulls have been pushed around for some time before the pattern devel-
oped and that they’re geared up to continue their buying assault on the 
bears for days to come.
Figure 7-1:

pattern.
125
Chapter 7: Working with Bullish Double-Stick Patterns

Using the bullish engulfing pattern for savvy trading
If you’re vigilant and lucky enough to spot a bullish engulfing pattern, trading
on it can yield some very appealing results. Figure 7-2 is a real-world example
of the bullish engulfing pattern on a chart of the ETF that represents the
members of the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA), which is known as the
Diamonds because its symbol is DIA. (An ETF or exchange traded fund is a
security that trades like a stock, but represents a basket of stocks or an
index.)
The DIA is a popular trading vehicle among short-term traders who try to
profit from the direction of the Dow Jones Industrial Average from day to day
and also among long-term investors who seek exposure to all DJIA stocks
without having to buy all 30 of them individually.
Although it’s not picture perfect, Figure 7-2 is a useful example of how the bull-
ish engulfing pattern develops and how it can work out profitably. The bears
dominate the setup day, leaving the close near the low. On the signal day, the
DIA opens lower than the previous close and appears to trade lower — bad
news for the bulls. But at some point during the day, the bulls rally with some
strong buying and push the DIA much higher, to the point where the close of
the day is higher than the high of the setup day. The resulting price action
includes several days where the bulls are firmly in the driver’s seat.
Figure 7-2:

126
Part II: Working with Simple Candlestick Patterns 

That leads me to an important question: How do you know when the bullish
engulfing pattern’s signal is no longer valid? My rule of thumb is if the low of
the setup day is violated, then the signal is no longer good. To work this rule
into your trading strategy, place a sell stop on the low of the setup day, not
the signal day. Other traders may suggest that the sell stop be placed on the
closing price of the setup day or even the opening price of the signal day, and
you may want to consider those options as you get comfortable trading on
the bullish engulfing pattern. Keep in mind, though, that things can get pretty
miserable if you hold onto this trade for too long.
A failing bullish engulfing pattern
Figure 7-3 is an example of what happens when good bullish engulfing patterns
go bad, using the Euro currency futures contracts to show the price action
when the setup day’s low is violated a few days after the pattern arises.
The setup day in this example is very encouraging. There’s a definite down-
trend, and all the other bullish engulfing pattern criteria check out. But things
sour quickly. The bulls lose the fight, and the result is a very bearish day. No
matter what you choose to be your failure level, this day should be when you
throw in the towel.

Chapter 7: Working with Bullish Double-Stick Patterns

As I was compiling real-world examples for this book, I had an extremely
tough time finding a bullish engulfing pattern that didn’t work out profitably
if it was correctly traded. Bullish engulfing patterns don’t always work, but
finding one is an exciting prospect, and the chances are very good that if you
trade on it wisely, the result will be bright.
Bullish harami
In general, a harami is a two-day pattern with the candle of the setup day
that’s longer than the candle of the signal day. This pattern can almost be
considered the opposite of the bullish outside day and be called a bullish
inside day.
The first day is very bearish and occurring in a downtrend. On the second
day, the bulls take a shot at moving prices higher. There’s not too much suc-
cess because although the second day closes up slightly, it closes lower than
the first day’s open, and the first day’s high is never surpassed. However, it’s
a day where the bulls may have started to take a stand and stop the current
downtrend, because the second day is an up day and the low of the first day
isn’t penetrated.
Harami is the Japanese word for pregnant; if you draw an outline of the harami
pattern, it looks like a pregnant woman.
Identifying the bullish harami
If you want to identify a true bullish harami, the pattern and the market must
have the following features:
 The relevant market or stock is in a downtrend.
 The setup day has a longer candle than the signal day.
 The setup day has a black candle, with the open greater than the close,
and that candle is fairly long.
 The signal day’s candle has an open lower than its close.
 The open of the signal day is higher than the close of the setup day.
 The low of the setup day is lower than the signal day’s low, and the high
of the setup day is higher than the high of the signal day.
 The signal day’s open is higher than the setup day’s close.
 The signal day’s close is lower than the setup day’s open.
Figure 7-4 is a picture of two days that create a bullish harami. Note: The high
and low of both days don’t come into play on this pattern — just the open
and close.
128
Part II: Working with Simple Candlestick Patterns 

The setup day of the harami is a down day that follows a bearish trend. On
the signal day, the open is up from the first day’s close, and the bulls rule the
day, because the close is higher than the open. Since there has been a down-
trend, the bulls may be a bit timid, worried that the bears are going to come
back and push to new lows. The confidence the bulls gain when this doesn’t
occur should translate to more buying, and a reversal of the downtrend that
culminated in the bullish harami.
Trading based on the bullish harami
Now for a couple of examples of the bullish harami that help you figure out
what to do (or not do) when you spot one on your own. I start with a suc-
cessful appearance of the pattern at the end of a downtrend. The result is an
attractive trend reversal.
Getting a nice buy signal on the bullish harami
Figure 7-5 is a chart of the futures contract that trades on the Australian dollar.
The bears push the price down from the open until the close for eight days in
a row. Finally, on the signal day of the bullish harami, the bulls find a level
where they’re ready to start buying. This day is the first of many days where
the bulls push prices back up from the depths where the bears had pushed
them.
Notice in Figure 7-5 that the high of the signal day is a little higher than the
setup day. This example helps me make the point that the bullish harami is
just the opposite of the bullish engulfing pattern. (See the earlier section 
entitled “Bullish engulfing pattern”.) With a bullish engulfing pattern, all four
price components of the candlestick are involved, but only the open and close
matter when you’re working with a harami.
Figure 7-4:
A bullish
harami
pattern.
129
Chapter 7: Working with Bullish Double-Stick Patterns

Seeing a bad example of the bullish harami
Like most other patterns, the bullish harami can go awry. Figure 7-6 is a chart
of IBM. A bullish harami appears because IBM’s stock has been trending
down slowly. Some up days exist, but most are down days for a few weeks
leading up to the harami pattern. Any bullish inklings from the harami don’t
last very long.
The failure level of a bullish harami can vary depending on your preference. 
I use the open of the signal day as my stop level, and I suggest you use the
same level in your trading efforts. In Figure 7-6, this level holds up for less
than a day, and although there’s some sideways trading for a few days, the
downtrend resumes in time.
Bullish harami cross
Much like the doji with all its variations, the harami has more than one version.
A doji pattern has an open that’s higher than the close of the setup day and a
close that’s lower than the open of the setup day. This section covers the bull-
ish harami cross — a special variety of harami — which actually involves a doji
pattern, which is covered in Chapter 6, but should always be considered an
indicator of a potential reversal.
Figure 7-5:

harami on a

Part II: Working with Simple Candlestick Patterns 

Recognizing the bullish harami cross
The bullish harami cross starts out just like its cousin the bullish harami (see
the previous section, “Bullish harami”), and it must contain the following
characteristics:
 It appears during a downtrend.
 Its setup day is a long black candle.
 Its signal day is a doji.
It’s much easier to understand the specifics of the bullish harami cross if you
see a good example, so check out Figure 7-7.
Using the bullish harami cross for profitable trading
The bullish harami cross isn’t a common pattern, but when it appears, the
trend reversal may be pretty abrupt. Also, if the pattern doesn’t hold and 
the downtrend continues, this failure usually happens quickly.
A nice buy signal from the bullish harami cross
To get an idea of how you can trade to turn a profit with the bullish harami
cross, look at Figure 7-8. That’s a chart of the Australian dollar futures, with 
a bullish harami cross that successfully signals a trend reversal. I actually
traded this pattern, and the results were strong.

Part II: Working with Simple Candlestick Patterns 

When this pattern reared its head, I was looking for an entry point for trading
long on the Australian dollar futures contract. I had been monitoring it for a
while, and I bought near the close of the bullish harami cross’s signal day.
This pattern adheres to the rules for a buy signal because it’s at the bottom
of a downtrend, and the doji’s open and close fall within the setup day’s open
and close. Soon after I got in, I was happily rewarded with an uptrend that
lasted for several weeks, and you can enjoy the same kind of results if you
spot the bullish harami cross in a similar environment.
Failing to give a good buy signal
Look again closely at Figure 7-8. There was a failed harami cross a few days
before the successful one. I noticed this pattern, and it cost me a little before
I profited from the one that worked so well. Figure 7-9 adds a highlight where
the failed signal occurred.
For this failed signal, I placed my sell stop on the low of the doji day. I know
that contradicts what I said in the regular bullish harami section earlier in
this chapter, but since the open and close of the signal day on a bullish
harami cross are in such a small range, I generally use the close of the previ-
ous day as a stop.

Chapter 7: Working with Bullish Double-Stick Patterns

Sometimes using stops that don’t allow for some market fluctuation gets you
out of a successful trade too quickly. On the other hand, placing a stop with
too much wiggle room can get you out of a bad trade long after it would’ve
been prudent. Placing stops is as much an art as a science; it’s one of the
more difficult parts of trading. See Chapter 5 for a quick refresher on stops.
Bullish inverted hammer
The bullish inverted hammer is a fairly rare pattern. This pattern occurs in a
downtrend, and the first day (setup day) is a bearish candle — usually a long
bearish candle. The second, or signal, day is actually the inverted hammer;
this is the rare part because the price action that creates an inverted hammer
is fairly rare.
In order to get the inverted hammer as the signal day, you should start with
gap down and end with a close near the opening gap price. Usually with
much volatility associated with a gap opening, it would be rare to have the
open and close in the same price proximity.
In this section, I demonstrate what the two days that create the bullish
inverted hammer look like.
Spotting the bullish inverted hammer
Like many bullish patterns, the bullish inverted hammer is preceded by some
sort of downtrend. The setup day is a down day — a continuation of the 
prevailing downtrend. The signal day is the inverted hammer. I explain the
hammer in Chapter 6, and this pattern is just an opposite version of it.
The inverted hammer has a long wick on the top, and its candle takes up a
small part of the bottom of the whole candlestick. The body may be white or
black, but because the high is way above the rest of the candlestick, you can
tell that most of the trading activity occurs in a small area near the low. The
low serves as a support level for upcoming days. Take a look at Figure 7-10
for a handy visual representation.
Understanding how to trade on the bullish inverted hammer
To initiate a trade using the bullish inverted hammer, wait until the open of
the subsequent day. Initiate a position only if the open of that day is higher
than the low of the inverted hammer day.
Think of it this way. For the bullish inverted hammer to be considered valid,
it needs to be confirmed by the open of the day immediately after its appear-
ance. If that open is higher than the signal day’s low, you’re clear to buy, and
you should put your stop in at the same time.
134
Part II: Working with Simple Candlestick Patterns 

Checking out a successful bullish inverted hammer
Figure 7-11 is a chart of an ETF that focuses on financial stocks. The official
name is the Financial Select Sector SPDR, and the symbol is XLF. I’m going to
stick with XLF for simplicity’s sake. The inverted hammer appears after a
down day and is confirmed by a higher opening. I chose this specific chart
because there’s no question that the open on the day after the pattern con-
firms the bullish signal. If you see a bullish inverted hammer confirmed like
this, you should put on a long trade quickly because an uptrend is likely on
the way.
The bullish inverted hammer often appears, and the following day’s open
won’t confirm the bullish signal. If you see that develop, wash your hands of
any trades involving that pattern immediately.
Seeing a failed confirmation
Figure 7-12 is a chart of an unconfirmed bullish inverted hammer of the stock
for Caterpillar, Inc., the manufacturer of large construction equipment that
trades under the symbol CAT. With a downtrend in place and after a down
day, a bullish inverted hammer appears. But on the following day, the opening
price isn’t higher than the previous low or the low of the inverted hammer.
The pattern’s bullish signal isn’t confirmed, and no trade should be initiated.

Part II: Working with Simple Candlestick Patterns 

You may be asking, “Why look at a signal that ends up not being a signal at
all?” This won’t be the last candlestick pattern that requires some sort of con-
firmation on the opening or even the closing of the day after the pattern
appears, so it’s worth getting used to the concept. And you can also rely on
similar confirmations when trading on some of the patterns I cover in previ-
ous chapters of this book. Instead of buying a close on a bullish signal, you
can wait until the next day and buy the opening if it appears to be going in
the same direction of the signal or doesn’t negate the previous day’s signal.
Finally, although I spend all my working days in front of monitors looking at
charts and markets, most new or casual traders don’t. Being able to look 
at charts outside of market hours and then being prepared to initiate a trade
the next day can be very appealing for traders who can’t or won’t be glued to
a monitor all day.
Bullish doji star
The bullish doji star is very similar to the bullish inverted hammer. (See
“Bullish inverted hammer” earlier in the chapter.) It occurs in a downtrend
and signals that the bulls have had enough. The doji pattern always indicates
that the battle between bulls and bears was a tight one, and when it appears
as the second day of a two-day bullish doji star pattern, it means that the
bulls are starting to seize control.
Identifying a bullish doji star
A bullish doji star is a two-day pattern with a doji appearing on the signal day,
and it must appear during a downtrend. A genuine bullish doji star must also
include the following features:
 A down setup day, preferably with a long black candle.
 A signal day that includes an open and close that are equal or very
nearly equal, preferably in the middle of a relatively short trading day.
(This indicates an almost equal battle between the bulls and bears,
where neither faction can claim victory.)
 A gap down opening between the long black candle of the setup day and
the doji of the signal day.
This last feature shows that a gap down is met with buying but only
enough buying to keep the price stable.
Figure 7-13 shows two days of trading activity that creates the bullish doji star.
137
Chapter 7: Working with Bullish Double-Stick Patterns

Wishing (and trading) on a bullish doji star
Figure 7-14 shows a bullish doji star working out in a downtrend reversal for
the stock Hewlett Packard Co., symbol HPQ. Notice the doji that appears
after the gap down from the previous day, which was a down day. The low of
the doji is never violated, and a buyer is handsomely rewarded with a huge
day for the bulls three days after the pattern appears. If only all buy signals
resulted in a 10 percent up day!
Failing on a long signal
Unfortunately, some bullish doji stars are more like falling stars than shooting
stars. Check out Figure 7-15 for an example. It’s a chart of the futures contract
that trades on U.S. Treasury bonds. A doji star appears after a down day and
in the midst of a downtrend. Very encouraging! For the next couple of days,
the downtrend looks like it has come to an end. But just when the bulls think
they are going to make a move, the bears come in with a vengeance and push
prices lower than the low of the doji signal day. The downtrend kicks right
back into gear.

Bullish meeting line
The bullish meeting line is another great example of a pattern that offers a
heads-up that a trend reversal is on the way. It’s an interesting (and rare) 
pattern.
Recognizing a bullish meeting line pattern
The setup day of this pattern is a long black candle, and the signal day is a
long white candle. The closing prices of the two days are equal or nearly
equal, which indicates that the bears controlled the setup day. There’s also a
gap down opening, which shows that the bears are still in control at the begin-
ning of the signal day, but the bulls soon arrive on the scene. As the signal day
progresses, the low opening price brings in buying activity and a close that
reaches the previous day’s close and eliminates the gap that was created on
the opening.
Figure 7-16 is a picture of how bullish meeting lines appear on a chart.
Making a successful trade using bullish meeting lines
For a successful example of trading on the bullish meeting line pattern, I use
an example of Post Properties, Inc., a real estate company specializing in
apartment complexes (and a former landlord of your author). The company
trades under the symbol PPS.

Part II: Working with Simple Candlestick Patterns 

The chart in Figure 7-17 reveals a pattern that shows up during a downtrend,
and the setup day is very bearish. The signal day has a gap opening on the
down side, but after trading lower, appears to recover and close near the pre-
vious day’s close, completing a bullish meeting line pattern. The following
day has a threat of support being broken as the stock trades lower than the
signal day’s open, but the low of that day holds. The result is a few days of
very bullish trading. Spotting the bullish meeting lines and getting in at the
right time would yield some substantial profits in a case like this.
To give you an idea of what failing bullish meeting lines look like, check out
the chart of U.S. Treasury bond futures in Figure 7-18. True to form, the con-
tract is in a downtrend, and the pattern shows up where I’ve highlighted on
the chart. The pattern appears to be validated as the next couple of days
aren’t necessarily bullish, but the low of the signal day isn’t violated. How-
ever, on the third day after the pattern is completed, the bears take over
again, and the downtrend is back in place. Again, putting a wise sell stop in
place at either the low or the open of the signal day would served as a nice
tourniquet.

Chapter 7: Working with Bullish Double-Stick Patterns

Bullish piercing line
The bullish piercing line is one more bullish double-stick pattern that signals
a trend reversal. Just like the other patterns discussed earlier in this chapter,
it’s crucial that the bullish piercing line appears during a downtrend for it to
be considered valid.
Identifying a bullish piercing line pattern
Like the bullish meeting line pattern (see the previous section), the bullish
piercing line consists of a long black candle on the setup day and a long white
candle on the signal day. The open of the signal day should be lower than the
low of the setup day. This means that bearishness persists on the setup day,
and then the open of the signal day reveals more selling because the open is
lower than the setup day’s low. The signal day’s close is much higher than
the open, which means that the bulls came in as a reaction to the lower open-
ing price and pushed prices higher. The tide, therefore, has turned in favor of
the bulls.
Figure 7-19 is a good example of what a bullish piercing line looks like.

Part II: Working with Simple Candlestick Patterns 

Trading on the bullish piercing line
The bullish piercing line pattern combines a setup day that’s a long black
candle. The signal day is a bullish candlestick that opens with a gap down,
but closes well within the range covered by the first day. This is a case where
the bulls show up after a bearish open and decide it’s time to take charge and
push prices up.
Figure 7-20 is an example of a bullish piercing line appearing on the chart of a
railroad stock for Burlington Northern Santa Fe Corp., which trades under the
symbol BNI. You can’t beat this example for a clear representation of the bull-
ish piercing line pattern showing up and signaling the end of a downtrend.
The setup day is a long black candle, and the signal day has a gap opening
before the bulls show up and make a solid bullish run. Notice that the signal
day doesn’t have a high that exceeds the high of the first day. If it did, and if
its close exceeded the setup day’s open, this would be a bullish engulfing pat-
tern. (I cover the bullish engulfing pattern earlier in this chapter.)
The bullish piercing line failure example I provide here occurs on a chart of
FedEx Corporation (symbol FDX). In this case, the bullish piercing line 
doesn’t deliver. As you can see in Figure 7-21, in the midst of a downtrend, a
bullish piercing line appears. The following day, the low price of the bullish
piercing line is violated by that day’s low. This sign is clear that the bullish
activity from the previous day isn’t as strong as the long white candle day
indicated. It takes a couple of days, but the downtrend in FDX continues.

Bullish Trend-Confirming Patterns
Not all double-stick patterns indicate that a trend reversal is forthcoming.
Some of them actually tell you that the market is going to continue in the
direction it’s already going. It may not sound very exciting, but there are
some benefits to getting confirmation that a trend is going to stay in place.
First, if you’re considering selling a stock because you believe the price is
close to peaking, the appearance of a pattern showing the trend is still in
place may help you improve your exit price. After all, it’s always frustrating
to sell and then watch as a stock continues to climb in value. Also, everyone
has heard that the way to make money buying securities is to buy low and
sell high, but there are plenty of traders that buy high and sell higher.
These people are known as trend followers, and they can embrace these trend
confirmation signals to the tune of some outstanding returns. Think you may
want to join their ranks? If so, read on for a few examples of bullish double-
stick patterns that do a terrific job of confirming the continuation of a trend.
Bullish thrusting lines
The first trend-confirming pattern I cover here may be a bit difficult to pick
out of a chart at first glance, but it’s worth understanding and looking out for
it. Unlike the double-stick patterns I describe in the preceding sections in this
chapter, it’s critical that the bullish thrusting line pattern appears during an
uptrend, not a downtrend, because this pattern would be confirming the direc-
tion of an uptrend, but wouldn’t have much significance during a downtrend.
Recognizing a bullish thrusting line pattern
The setup day of a bullish thrusting line is a long white candle, bullish in
pretty much any market. The signal day is a black candle. This black candle
should have a gap opening higher than the high of the setup day and a close
near the day’s low. However, the close of the signal day should be above the
midpoint of the first day. For a bona fide bullish thrusting line, check out
Figure 7-22.
Trading on a bullish thrusting line
On the setup day of a bullish thrusting line (and for several days before that),
the bulls have been in charge of the price action. On the signal day, the bulls
push a stock to a gap opening, which brings in some sellers, but the sellers
don’t push hard enough to get the closing price under the midpoint of the
previous day. This means that the bulls are still around and poised to take
control. That can be a big help if you’re considering buying, because the 
bullish signal from this pattern can give you a chance to get on board at a
reasonable price before the stock continues to go up.
145
Chapter 7: Working with Bullish Double-Stick Patterns

Figure 7-23 is an example of the bullish thrusting line showing up on a chart
of International Paper Co., symbol IP. The setup day is an up day, followed by
a gap opening. The stock trades off a bit on the signal day after opening
higher, but it manages to close above the midpoint of the first day of the pat-
tern (hooray!). For a few days after this signal, the stock trades sideways, but
then resumes the uptrend.

146
Part II: Working with Simple Candlestick Patterns 

Notice that the stock doesn’t violate the low of the first day of the pattern —
that’s the stop level I use when trading on this pattern. I suggest that you use
the same, and you can see why in the next example.
Failing to indicate the continuation of an uptrend
Figure 7-24 is a chart of the investment banking firm The Bear Stearns
Companies, Inc. (symbol BSC). A bullish thrusting line pattern develops in an
uptrend, but the following day, the low violates the low of the pattern’s setup
day. Some bullish trading occurs after this violation, but a few days later, a
pretty ugly downtrend begins.
If you bought BSC based on that bullish thrusting line and failed to put a stop
at the low of the setup day, you lost more than you could bear. A failing 
trade like that can make even the most grizzled traders want to curl up and
hibernate.
Bullish separating lines
For another double-stick pattern that confirms a trend, consider the bullish
separating lines. It isn’t exactly what it sounds like, because the lines
involved may actually overlap a bit, but it’s a useful pattern and certainly one
worth understanding in depth.
Singling out the bullish separating lines
Like all its trend-confirming relatives, the bullish separating lines pattern
must appear during an uptrend. The setup day of the bullish separating lines
is a down day and usually a long down day at that. The signal day is an up
Figure 7-24:

thrusting
line failing

of BSC.
147
Chapter 7: Working with Bullish Double-Stick Patterns

day, bullish right from the open. The unique feature of this pattern is that the
opens of both days are equal or almost equal. Figure 7-25 is a terrific example.
Understanding how to trade on the bullish separating lines
The bullish separating lines confirm uptrends, but the signal day of the pat-
tern is actually a bearish day. The bears decide that the price is right to start
selling, and they dominate the bulls, pushing prices lower throughout the
day. On the signal day, the bulls come in and are ready to start buying again.
There’s so much bullishness that the opening price of the signal day is equal
to the opening price of the setup day, and from that point on, the bulls domi-
nate the day, and the uptrend remains intact.
The bullish thrusting lines and a trend that comes to an end
Figure 7-26 is a chart of the stock for Transocean, Inc., a company that builds
large drilling machinery for extracting oil in deepwater environments. Not
coincidentally, its symbol is RIG. (Looks to me that the symbol assignment
was rigged.) I’ve highlighted the pattern forming at the beginning of an
uptrend.
I love this example because the pattern occurs early in an uptrend, so a trader
may feel that he hasn’t completely missed the bull run by using this signal as
an entry point. If he kicks himself for missing a buy at a lower price but still
has some interest in getting in on a trade, this pattern may give him the confi-
dence to step up to the plate and buy the stock.
Figure 7-25:
The bullish

148
Part II: Working with Simple Candlestick Patterns 

Conversely, Figure 7-27 is an example of the bullish separating lines showing
up at the end of an uptrend. The stock charted is for The Home Depot, Inc.
(HD), a store I seem to visit every weekend. If you bought HD based on the
pattern in this figure popping up during an uptrend, you wouldn’t have taken
too bad of a loss. The stock doesn’t change to a downtrend, but instead, it
just starts to trade aimlessly in a nontrending fashion. Using a stop wouldn’t
have saved you massive amounts of cash, but it would’ve saved you the
angst of trying to figure out if the trend was reversed or just flat.
You have a few options when it comes to determining failure for the bullish
separating lines. You may choose the low or close of the setup day or the
open or low of the signal day. It really depends on how aggressive you feel
and how certain you want to be that the pattern’s signal has failed.
In the case of the HD example in Figure 7-27, the day before failure would take
out the signal day close while the following day (the day highlighted as a fail-
ure) would take out all the other options.

Chapter 7: Working with Bullish Double-Stick Patterns

Bullish neck lines
The bullish neck line is a trend confirmer and more of a classification than a
distinct pattern. There are two neck line patterns: the in neck and the on neck
patterns. At times it may be difficult to tell them apart without getting out a
magnifying glass to look at a chart. But because they look very much alike, I
decided to group the two together in this section. Keep in mind that the 
bullish neck lines I describe must occur during an uptrend to have any real
significance.
Identifying bullish neck lines
The setup day of the bullish neck line pattern is a long white candle that indi-
cates a lot of buying, and the signal day is a black candle that may be long or
short. The close of the signal day will be very near the close of the setup day.
If that’s the case, it may be said that it’s “on neck.” If the close of the signal
day is a little lower than the close of the setup day, the pattern is instead said
to be “in neck.” You can see examples of both in Figure 7-28. Notice that
they’re pretty similar.
Both the on neck and in neck bullish neck line patterns tell the same story, so
it’s not necessary to separate them for discussion. As I mentioned, they
occur during an uptrend. The signal day has a gap opening that brings in 
Figure 7-27:

separating
lines failing

of HD.

Part II: Working with Simple Candlestick Patterns 

sellers, but there’s not enough selling to trade too much (or at all) below the
previous day’s close. You may recognize these patterns as more bullish ver-
sions of the bullish thrusting lines discussed earlier in this chapter.
Trading on the bullish neck line pattern
This section gives an example of the bullish neck line working well to signal a
trend that continues to the upside as the bulls push back and hold prices
near the close of the first day of the pattern when the bears try to make a
push.
Figure 7-29 is a chart of Amgen, Inc., one of the world’s largest biotech com-
panies. It trades under the symbol AMGN. The bullish neck line appears
during a small pullback during a longer term uptrend. It’s slightly in neck,
almost to the point that it may not qualify as a bullish signal. However, a
trader that takes this as a buy signal and places a stop at any appropriate
level would be handsomely rewarded with a continuation of the longer term
uptrend. In this case, the potential stop levels would be the low of the setup
day or the low of the signal day. I’m always placing stops very close to the
entry point, so I probably would’ve chosen the low of the signal day, or the
higher of the two choices.

Chapter 7: Working with Bullish Double-Stick Patterns

Bullish neck line fails to signal a trend continuation
I hate to end the chapter on a down note, but I need to show you what it
looks like when the bullish neck line pattern fails. Figure 7-30 is a chart of the
U.S. Treasury bond futures. A bullish neck line appears near the top of this
bullish move. There’s only one day where the bulls are happy for making a
move based on this signal, and then the tide turns quickly. The only positive 
I can say about this scenario is that it happened quickly, so you can move on
to the next trade without a long and painful failure. And any stop level you
picked would’ve been taken out by that ugly black bar.
That’s it for the bullish double-stick patterns for now. In later chapters they
come back, teamed up with technical indicators that may signal it’s time for 
a reversal or that a strong trend is in place.

Utilizing Bearish Double-

In This Chapter
 Working with bearish double-stick patterns that signal a trend reversal
 Predicting the continuation of a downtrend by using bearish double-stick patterns
I
n Chapter 7, I discuss the nature and usefulness of bullish double-stick
patterns, but they aren’t the only double-stick show in town. As with most
bullish patterns, bearish two-day counterparts exist, too, and you should
know how to recognize and trade them, and that’s what I focus on in this
chapter. These patterns work as effective sell signals, and keep in mind that
when a sell signal pops up, even if you don’t have a long position on, you can
use the opportunity to initiate a successful short position.
Just like the bullish patterns in Chapter 7, the bearish double-stick patterns
in this chapter may appear as reversal patterns (signaling that an uptrend is
coming to an end) or as continuation patterns, which tell you that a prevail-
ing downtrend will continue. These bearish examples have two parts: the
first day, which I refer to as the setup day, and the second day, which I call
the signal day.
Understanding Bearish Reversal Patterns
I’m definitely biased toward bearish reversal patterns. I’ve always been a bit
of a countertrend trader, and because many candlestick patterns signal trend
reversals, I’ve always found plenty to use in my trading. But trading in antici-
pation of trend reversals isn’t always a cakewalk. In fact, it almost put me out
of the business during the strong bullish markets that have become known as
the dot.com bubble. I managed to keep from going broke during that period,
and I learned some expensive lessons about money management and using
stops that I include in my explanations throughout this chapter.

A bit of a warning about using short reversal patterns: First, remember that in
theory, a short has an unlimited loss. Also, keep in mind that when you’re
shorting stocks, you’re working against a general long-term uptrend in stock
prices. Some successful traders are exclusive shorts, but they’re pretty rare.
Don’t get me wrong. I do believe that shorting should be part of any trading
or investing program, but please use shorting as part of a larger trading strat-
egy, not as your primary way of working the markets.
You can use many extremely useful patterns for shorting, as signals for exit-
ing from a long, or as exercises in patience before buying. Take a look at this
section, which covers those patterns.
The bearish engulfing pattern
The bearish engulfing pattern is one of the best patterns to start with because
of the dramatic nature of the bearish second day that appears on the pattern.
The pattern involves the bears taking control after an extended period of
bullishness, and the trend is definitely one to watch.
Identifying the bearish engulfing pattern
Check out Figure 8-1 for an example of the bearish engulfing pattern.
Leading up to and including the setup day of this pattern, the bulls have been
in the driver’s seat. On the open of the signal day, the sellers or shorts finally
have had enough, and they decide that the price has gone up enough to bring
them into the action. They push the price down dramatically and quickly (in
one day). But these bears aren’t finished with their selling, and the close of
the signal day is near that day’s low. That will most likely continue — to the
point where a downtrend develops — because the sellers aren’t done putting
pressure on the stock or market.
Figure 8-1:
The bearish
engulfing
pattern.
156
Part II: Working with Simple Candlestick Patterns 

Trading on the bearish engulfing pattern
For a real-world example of a bearish engulfing pattern that can be used for a
profitable trade, have a look at Figure 8-2. Here you see the pattern appear on
a chart of the exchange-traded fund (ETF) that represents the 30 stocks that
trade in the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA).
On this chart, there’s a bearish engulfing pattern right at the end of a nice
uptrend. The bulls control the setup day; an uptrend is in place, and those
bulls keep it going. At the start of the signal day, the bulls continue on their
buying spree and cause the opening to be higher than the setup day’s close.
Then the bears come in and push hard — so hard in fact that although the
price had opened higher than the setup day and even traded above that day’s
high, the bears are still able to push things down below the setup day’s low.
Those bears mean business!
The overwhelming push by the bears that stops an uptrend dead in its tracks
is the key to the bearish engulfing pattern. The DIA (the symbol of the ETF
that trades based on the level of the DJIA) chart in Figure 8-2 is a great exam-
ple of a bearish engulfing pattern scenario that can lead you to profitable
results. After the bears reverse the uptrend, the signal holds, and the next
day’s trading doesn’t come near the pre-reversal prices. If you short at the
end of the pattern and ride the downtrend for a while before buying back,
you have a profitable trade.

Chapter 8: Utilizing Bearish Double-Stick Patterns

The bearish engulfing pattern fails
I provide an example of a failing pattern for every successful pattern in this
book, and in Figure 8-3, I highlight what can happen when a bearish engulfing
pattern goes wrong. This unfortunate outcome occurs on a chart of the
Japanese Yen futures. The bearish engulfing pattern shows up but fails pretty
quickly, and the uptrend just keeps going higher.
This scenario looks ripe for a bearish engulfing pattern: A clear uptrend is in
place and actually appears to be slowing a bit (a good sign). The bulls con-
tinue the trend on the setup day, and then on the signal day, a small gap
opening appears. At first the bulls push prices much higher, but then the
bears take over, and when they start selling, it’s powerful enough to cover 
the setup day’s bullishness, and then some. If you see this pattern on a chart,
you may have good reason to get excited, but things go sour quickly.
The day after the pattern appears, the bulls get back in on the action, and the
price closes higher than the opening of the signal day. The pattern clearly
fails, but if you trade on it, you can avoid heavy losses if you place a stop at
the right level.
When working with bearish engulfing patterns, I place my stops at the open
of the second day. That’s when I can tell that the bulls have again seized con-
trol of the price action, and I know that can continue for some time. It’s
always prudent to have a stop in place, and that may be a good level to
choose to put your stop. I advise you to place your stops at the same level.

The bearish harami pattern
The bearish harami pattern can tip you off that an uptrend is about to be
reversed. Loosely translated from the Japanese, harami means pregnant. If
you use your imagination and squint a little, you can see in Figure 8-4 how the
pattern got its name. I guess if you draw a line to circle the area that a harami
covers, you end up with something that resembles the outline of a pregnant
woman. Okay, so it’s not going to fetch much at an art auction, but it can pay
off if you understand how to identify and trade on it.
Spotting a bearish harami
The setup day of a bearish harami pattern is a continuation of a prevailing
uptrend — a strong up day. At first glance, the signal day isn’t much to jump
up and shout about, either. It’s a day where the price action doesn’t stray out-
side of the high and low of the setup day, and it indicates that the bears take
over on the open, and neither side makes much progress pushing around the
price action. But since this trend occurs after a bullish day and during a
marked bullish trend, it can very well serve as a sign that the bears are start-
ing to take control of the price action. Figure 8-4 shows an extremely straight-
forward illustration of the bearish harami pattern.
Another name for the signal day in this pattern is an inside day, where the
high is lower than the previous high, and the low is lower than the previous
low. When they occur on their own, inside days indicate a lack of conviction
by both the bulls and the bears. But combine an inside day with a preceding
bullish day and a bullish trend in place, and the combination can show you
that the bull run is coming to an end.
When a prevailing trend starts to fade away into indecision, the next dominant
trend is likely to go in the opposite direction.
Figure 8-4:
The bearish
harami
pattern.
159
Chapter 8: Utilizing Bearish Double-Stick Patterns

Using the bearish harami pattern for a clever trade
For a good look at what the bearish harami looks like on a real chart, check
out Figure 8-5. The chart is of the ETF that represents a group of the largest
retail stocks, including Wal-Mart, Home Depot, and Walgreens. The trading
symbol for this ETF is RTH. I have an affinity for retailers because I covered
them fundamentally, and I’ve traded them at various firms. I also like this ETF
and individual retailers as trading vehicles because their performances are
closely linked to the state of the economy. With fluctuations in economic
opinion comes volatility in these stocks, and with volatility comes trading
opportunities!
The setup day of this two-day bearish harami pattern is a very strong up day
that occurs in the midst of an uptrend that’s been in place for several weeks.
The signal day is an inside day that’s a little on the bearish side. After that
day the price falls quickly, back to the level where the uptrend began. The fall
occurs much more quickly than the ascent, which is often the case with
downward moves. They tend to happen much more quickly than uptrends. I
guess fear is stronger than greed in the stock market.
A failing bearish harami pattern
Figure 8-6 provides a solid example of how the bearish harami can fail, because
it happens twice in a row on this chart. This double dose of pattern failure
should open your eyes to what can go wrong when the bearish harami doesn’t
play out favorably.
Figure 8-6 is a chart of the futures contract that trades based on the price of
crude oil. As you can see, the bearish harami appears twice in a row. The
setup day of each pattern is a nice up day (in the middle of an uptrend), and
both of the signal days are inside days with dark candles that indicate bear-
ish trading. These two patterns have something else in common, as well.
They both fail immediately! Both patterns crash and burn the day after they
appear on the chart. If you trade these patterns and take a small loss, I bet
the next time a bearish harami rears its head, you think twice before putting
on a trade.
The setup day of the second bearish harami on this chart is actually the same
day that the first pattern fails. I define a bearish harami failure as a violation of
the high of the signal day. This violation occurs on both patterns in Figure 8-6,
and both fail the day after the pattern appears. (My definition for failure on a
bearish harami pattern isn’t the only one; a failure can also be a violation of
the close of the setup day, or even the high of the setup day.) After trading
achieves any of these levels, the prevailing uptrend becomes apparent. You
need to figure out your level of risk tolerance and decide for yourself what
level to use as a failure point for the bearish harami, but using my definition
(the violation of the signal day’s high) is a good starting point. This level is a
good one to place a stop order to avoid a loss getting out of control.

The bearish harami cross pattern
The next bearish two-day pattern is closely related to the pattern I discuss in
the previous section (“The bearish harami pattern”), and it can be used in a
similar manner. This pattern — the bearish harami cross — also marks the
first return of the doji in this chapter. A doji is a candlestick pattern that
looks like a cross and usually indicates some sort of indecision in the market.
(Dojis are covered more in Chapter 6.) When this indecision occurs in a
trend, it may signal that the trend is preparing to reverse.

Chapter 8: Utilizing Bearish Double-Stick Patterns

Recognizing the bearish harami cross
The bearish harami cross occurs in an uptrend and consists of an up setup
day followed by a doji for the signal day. The signal day doji must be both a
cross and an inside day. Take a look at Figure 8-7 for an illustration of the
bearish harami cross.
Because the doji indicates that indecision ruled the day, I actually prefer the
bearish harami cross to the plain old harami reversal pattern. Dojis are rare,
and the occurrence of a bearish harami cross pattern is more of an event
than the appearance of the bearish harami.
Trading on the bearish harami cross
The chart in Figure 8-8 gives you an idea of how the bearish harami cross can
spell market success for you. This figure shows the pattern appearing on a
chart of one of my favorite commodity contracts: frozen concentrated orange
juice, or OJ.
In the movie Trading Places (one of my favorites), commodities are being
explained to ersatz trader Eddie Murphy. There’s a table that displays several
traded commodities (including orange juice), and when the conniving old
Dukes brothers get to the OJ, one of them says, “orange juice, like you may
have had for breakfast this morning” in a tone he could’ve used to explain the
concept to a first grader. The look Eddie Murphy gives the camera is priceless.
Anyway, Figure 8-8 shows the bearish harami cross appearing in a choppy
uptrend. The setup day is clearly an up day, and the contract reaches new
highs. The cross or doji day follows, and the bulls are clearly running out of
steam. After that, you see a very bearish day with no violation of the high for
the setup day, which is what I like to use as the failure level for this pattern,
and then a downtrend that lasts a few weeks. If you put on a short position
and ride the downtrend for a while, you end up with an attractive profit.

Part II: Working with Simple Candlestick Patterns 

For a failing bearish harami cross, I use Transocean Offshore (RIG). This com-
pany builds drilling rigs for use in deep water. The stock is a great trading
vehicle due to the company’s exposure to the energy markets.
Signaling a losing trade
In Figure 8-9 you can see that during an uptrend, a little cross appears after a
bullish day. This cross or doji is actually a slight up day, but a doji just the
same in my book. Much like the price of energy, the stock prices of energy-
related stocks have been on a tear, and RIG is no exception. This bearish
harami fails pretty quickly, and the uptrend stays intact.

Chapter 8: Utilizing Bearish Double-Stick Patterns

You may notice that although this signal failed, there were a few days after
the failure where the chart still appears to reveal a change in trend. This 
confusing start-stop-start situation is part of the game.
Signals sometimes fail and trades get stopped out temporarily, only to even-
tually reveal price action that could’ve produced profitable results. These
occurrences are frustrating, but I’ve never been upset with myself for follow-
ing trading rules or signals, even when it’s clear a few hours or days later that
I could’ve made money if I had overridden a stop or ignored a failure signal.
When I consistently follow the rules, I can’t second guess myself, but if I don’t
follow the rules and a trade fails, I can only blame myself. I suggest that you
adopt the same philosophy, especially if you’re just starting to trade.
I can’t emphasize enough that sticking with a trading plan and following your
rules may be the most key components to becoming a successful trader.
The bearish inverted hammer pattern
Like many of the bearish reversal patterns described in this chapter, the bear-
ish inverted hammer is set up with a long white candle that occurs during an
uptrend. Then there’s a gap opening and even more buying to start the signal
day. However, at some point the bears are called to action and start to push
prices lower, and if you keep your eyes peeled for that move and trade accord-
ingly, you should be able to turn a profit.
Identifying the bearish inverted hammer
The bearish inverted hammer is depicted in Figure 8-10. The inverted hammer
is actually the second day of the pattern. The setup day is a long white candle,
which indicates a very bullish day. The start of the signal day (also called the
hammer day) sees a gap opening and continued bullishness; that process 
carries on for part of the day, and higher prices are achieved. At some point
during the signal day, the bears have had enough and selling begins. The
bearish action pushes prices down below the opening price, and the close 
is equal to or very near the day’s low.
Using the bearish inverted hammer in your trades
To provide you with a winning scenario for the bearish inverted hammer
(Figure 8-11), I offer a pattern that actually came up while I was searching 
for an example for this section. This chart is for the Financial Select Sector
Fund, symbol XLF, which is an ETF that represents a handful of large financial
stocks such as Citigroup, American International Group, and Bank of America.
You can see the bearish inverted hammer near the top of the chart. When I
saw the pattern, I figured I should put my money where my mouth is. I knew
that even if the trade didn’t work out, I’d still have an example of a failing pat-
tern for later in this section. Luckily, though, that wasn’t the case.
164
Part II: Working with Simple Candlestick Patterns 

I shorted the XLF on the signal day of the pattern, held it for four days, and
exited on the first up day. I also placed a buy stop order at the open of the
signal (or hammer) day. That’s a very tight stop, but this trade was outside of
my normal trading activity, and I felt it was prudent to place a close stop. More
aggressive traders may have chosen the high of the signal day for their stop.
The example in Figure 8-11 is doubly useful because it also shows you how to
exit a trade. I don’t discuss exiting trades much in this book — too many
methods and goals exist once a trade has been initiated to cover here — but
Figure 8-11:

that works
on a chart of
the XLF ETF.
Figure 8-10:
The bearish

165
Chapter 8: Utilizing Bearish Double-Stick Patterns

this situation is definitely worth pointing out. I chose my exit in this trade
because the reciprocal version of the bearish inverted pattern appeared. I
saw the bullish pattern, and I was happy to exit and take a profit of just over
a dollar on one hundred shares — I’ll let you do the math — and take my wife
to dinner on the proceeds. I ended up with material for this book and a nice
dinner for Merribeth. Now that’s a perfect trade.
Recognizing a losing trade
On a somewhat gloomier note, have a look at Figure 8-12 for an example of a
couple of failing bearish inverted hammers. Figure 8-12 is a chart of the ETF
that represents the 30 stocks that comprise the Dow Jones Industrial Average
and trade with the symbol DIA, sometimes called the Diamonds. Luckily for
this author and trader, there wasn’t a real-life trade involved with this example.
Both patterns appear in an uptrend, and both feature an up setup day followed
by a gap opening and strong activity during the signal day that reverses with a
lower close. Although usually an indication of a reversal, both times these sig-
nals were proven to be false fairly quickly.
In the case of the first pattern, all possible resistance levels were violated and
the uptrend continued. For the second pattern, I highlight two failures:
 One is a violation of the open of the hammer day.
 The other is a violation of that day’s high.
Figure 8-12:
Two bearish
inverted
hammer
failures on a
chart of the
DIA ETF.
166
Part II: Working with Simple Candlestick Patterns 

The second pattern takes a little longer to fail, but it does eventually. The
second pattern is interesting because it does occur toward the end of the
uptrend. But the signal is violated, and a trader following the rules would
have exited the short. This additional illustration shows how you sometimes
have to just follow the rules and move on, even when it’s clear later that you
could’ve turned a profit if you’d stuck with the position. Don’t look back and
say “what if?” Be confident in the fact that you followed set rules and that over
the long haul, following the rules results in more consistent trading profits.
The bearish doji star
The bearish doji star is another bearish reversal pattern that contains — you
guessed it — a doji. This pattern is also an extension of the bearish inverted
hammer, which I discuss in the previous section.
Spotting the bearish doji star
The bearish doji star always occurs in an uptrend, and the setup day is an up
day. The signal day is a doji that’s sort of hanging out there by itself, because
the opening of the signal day is gap down from the previous day’s price action.
Figure 8-13 is an example of how the two days that make up a bearish doji
star appear together on a chart.
Figure 8-13:
The bearish
doji star
pattern.
167
Chapter 8: Utilizing Bearish Double-Stick Patterns

Understanding how to trade using the bearish doji star
Figure 8-14 is a chart that shows the bearish doji star in action. In this exam-
ple, this doji star pattern is working well to signal an impending drop in the
stock for microchip maker Intel (symbol INTC). An uptrend is in place, and
the setup day of the pattern is a bullish day in accordance with the trend.
The signal day is a doji, with the combined open and close outside of the
range covered by the setup day’s trading activity. After all the bullishness 
of the previous few days, the bears are finally making a stand.
The day after the pattern is a very bearish day, so if a trader didn’t put on the
trade during the doji day, he doesn’t have a chance. Then the day after the
long black candle appears, the stock gaps down tremendously. This change is
a quick victory for any sellers that are attracted to short this bearish doji star.
Failing to give a good short signal
For the losing example of a bearish doji star, I present Figure 8-15, which is a
chart of the stock for Apple Computer (symbol AAPL). The bearish doji star I
highlight in the figure showed up during a bullish trend, and you can see that
this chart includes a nice up day followed by a doji. All the bearish doji star
criteria are in place, but the pattern fails swiftly and mercilessly, and the
trend continues with a very strong up day directly after the pattern. The
potential Apple trade goes rotten.
My failure level for a bearish doji star is the high of the signal day, as opposed
to that day’s open or close. Using the combined open and close area of the
doji doesn’t provide much room for volatility on a stop. If the stock opens
just slightly up the next day, then it will hit the buy stop, which is very likely
to happen even in the case of a trend reversal. In order to avoid regular
market noise forcing me out of a trade, I prefer to rely on the high of the
signal day for my stop exit.
The bearish meeting line
Although rare, the bearish meeting line pattern is worth understanding as
you build your arsenal of double-stick bearish patterns that signal a trend
reversal. This line can be a clear indication of a change in trend due to the
stark contrast of the two days that combine to form the pattern.
168

If you’re looking for an ideal visual representation of the bearish meeting line,
it doesn’t get any better than Figure 8-16.

Chapter 8: Utilizing Bearish Double-Stick Patterns

On the setup day of the bearish meeting line, as with most of the two-day
bearish patterns, you see a strong up day. Then, on the signal day, you notice
a gap opening, which quickly entices some sellers. The selling continues until
the close. A long black candle is the result, with the close of the day being very
near its low. The close of the signal day also happens to be very near the close
of the setup day, and the meeting of these lines gives the pattern its name.
Trading on the bearish meeting line
For an example of the bearish meeting line pattern producing a scenario that’s
ripe for a successful trade, see Figure 8-17. That’s a chart of the aluminum
maker Alcoa (symbol AA). As a producer of a material used in many everyday
products, Alcoa is another stock that has strong ties to the overall economy.
AA is a volatile stock at times, creating both long and short opportunities.
A definite uptrend exists on this chart — the first criteria for keeping any eye
out for a bearish reversal signal. The setup day is a very nice up day, and
then the signal day opens with a gap higher. The bulls are ruling the trading
activity, and the situation is perfect for a successful bearish meeting line 
pattern.
If you were watching this pattern develop, you’d be pleased to see that sell-
ers come in and push prices lower than the previous day’s close, and
although the stock rebounds a little, the price settles on the signal day near
where the stock closed on the setup day.
Figure 8-16:
A straight-
forward
example of
the bearish

pattern.
170
Part II: Working with Simple Candlestick Patterns 

Then the trend reversal begins. And what a trend reversal it is! Six black can-
dles line up in a row, signaling that the uptrend has definitely ended. Any
trader not prepared on the day the signal was completed misses out on a
good part of the outstanding downtrend.
To get in on the close of a day that a pattern is completed, watch for the pat-
terns as they develop during a trading day. Usually, with five to ten minutes
left in a trading day, you can tell whether a pattern is forming or not. The
problem for you if you’re a new or part-time trader is that you probably have
a job or other responsibilities that may prevent you from being available to
trade during these important time periods. Be sure to factor in your own
availability when developing your trading strategy.
An unsuccessful bearish meeting line
An example of the bearish meeting lines failing to signal an uptrend reversal
appears in Figure 8-18, which is a chart of the futures contract that trades on
the level of the Euro currency versus the U.S. dollar. The uptrend is in place,
and the formation appears as it should. This pattern is very encouraging for a
trader who’s been waiting for a good time to short. In this example, however,
that enthusiasm from a short seller is fleeting.
The day that follows the pattern proves it to be invalid. Prices trade high-
er than both the open and the high of the pattern’s signal day, making it 
clear that the pattern is a bust.
When shorting based on the bearish meeting line pattern, I usually place my
stops on either the high of the signal day or the open of the signal day.

171
Chapter 8: Utilizing Bearish Double-Stick Patterns

The bearish piercing line or 
dark cloud cover pattern
Another two-day bearish reversal pattern is the bearish piercing line, also
known as the dark cloud cover, because some say that the signal day is an
ominous dark cloud that hangs over the setup day. It requires a little use of
your imagination.
Identifying the bearish piercing line pattern
You can see a straightforward illustration of the bearish piercing line in
Figure 8-19. Just like all the bearish two-stick reversal patterns I describe in
the preceding sections of this chapter, this pattern must appear in an uptrend.
Also, in keeping with the other bearish reversal patterns, the setup day for
the bearish piercing line is a bullish day. The signal day is a long black candle
with an opening that’s higher than the setup day’s high. The signal day indi-
cates that some sellers came rushing in, pushing prices down through the
setup day’s opening price and below its midpoint.
Making trades based on the bearish piercing line
The bearish piercing line pattern can be used to put on a profitable short, as
you can see in Figure 8-20. This chart shows the bearish piercing line on a
chart of Intel (INTC).
Figure 8-18:

172
Part II: Working with Simple Candlestick Patterns 

The pattern occurs in what appears to be the late stages of an uptrend. The
price is still working higher, but not with as much momentum as it did where
I’ve pointed out the first stage of the uptrend. If you see a reversal pattern
when you believe a trend is starting to lose steam, that’s more encouraging
than when the pattern appears in a strong trend. In later chapters I discuss
how to use indicators to make these distinctions (see Chapters 11, 14, 
and 15).

Chapter 8: Utilizing Bearish Double-Stick Patterns

Falling short with the bearish piercing line
This INTC chart is another example of the limited amount of time you may
have for initiating certain trades. Unless you keep a close eye on the chart,
you miss your chance to put on a successful short. So what does a bearish
piercing line pattern look like when the pattern fails? For an answer, see
Figure 8-21.
Figure 8-21 shows a chart of the stock for another technology company, Dell
Inc. (symbol DELL), which was founded by Michael Dell. (Maybe I’m too
focused on the market, but how cool would it be to have your name become
a stock symbol?) Here you can see a bearish piercing line that occurs during
an uptrend. The uptrend continues on, and the failure of the pattern (and the
appearance of higher prices) takes a couple of days. If you jump the gun on
this pattern and put on a short without a smart stop, you see some losses.
Making a Profit with Bearish 
Trend Patterns
In addition to double-stick patterns that tell a trader it’s time to sell or put on
a short after an uptrending move, some patterns also indicate a downtrend
continuation is on the horizon. These patterns can tell you when you still
have room to profit on a short. You can also turn to them when you’re look-
ing to buy a stock that’s been in a downtrend and looks to be “getting cheap.”
A bearish double-stick trend continuation pattern can let you know that a
stock is going to get cheaper and can therefore be had at an even lower price.
Figure 8-21:

pattern fails

174
Part II: Working with Simple Candlestick Patterns 

All the two-day bearish trending patterns covered in this section require that
the market or stock in question be in a down-trending mode. Determining the
trend can be subjective and can also be a matter of the time frame in which
you’re trading. I go into great detail on determining trend in later chapters
(especially Chapter 11), but for this section, just concentrate on the pattern
and don’t worry as much about whether you agree with my assessment of
the prevailing trend.
The bearish thrusting lines
The first two-day pattern that indicates the continuation of a downtrend is
the bearish thrusting lines pattern. I like this pattern because the signal day
is an up day. You may scratch your head and wonder why I would like an up
day that indicates the continuation of a downtrend. At first blush it does
sound counterintuitive, but the presence of an up day on the signal day of
this pattern means that a great opportunity exists to put on a short at prices
higher than the previous day of the downtrend.
Understanding how to spot the bearish thrusting lines
Figure 8-22 shows you exactly what the bearish thrusting lines look like on a
chart. Again, the prevailing trend should be down, and the setup day is a long
black candle. On the signal day, prices open weak, but then the bulls come in
and try to reverse the trend and take over. They seem to be succeeding, but
they’re not quite strong enough to get prices to the upper half of the candle-
stick that was created by the setup day’s trading. This activity means that
although the bears don’t completely control the day, they’re still around and
are eager to reassert themselves in the coming days.
175
Chapter 8: Utilizing Bearish Double-Stick Patterns
A quick note on trend strength
Allow me to point out an interesting side note
and comparison of Figures 8-20 and 8-21. The
successful bearish piercing line occurs when
the trend appears to be moderating. On the
DELL chart, which contains the failing pattern,
the opposite occurs. The trend is strong, but the
pattern appears after an acceleration of
momentum. This burst of uptrend momentum
can indicate to an observant trader that even
though a bearish pattern has appeared, it’s
probably smart to use caution when putting on
a short. It can also signal that a quick exit may
very well be in order. Remember to keep on the
lookout for these increases in trend strength. To
help you train your eye, I’ve highlighted the rel-
evant area in Figure 8-21.

Trading on the bearish thrusting lines
For an example of the bearish thrusting lines working well, turn to Figure 8-23
and a chart of the stock for the Toll Brothers (symbol TOL), which is a high-
end home-building company. During the recent contraction of real estate
prices, the publicly traded home-building stocks lost a lot of ground, and TOL
was no exception.
The bearish thrusting lines actually pop up three times on this chart, and for
each of those three occurrences, the stock’s price drops for days after the
pattern appears. For the sake of emphasis, I added a downtrend line to show
the continuing downtrend.
Figure 8-23:
The bearish
thrusting
lines pattern
works on 
a chart 
of TOL.
Figure 8-22:
The bearish

pattern.
176
Part II: Working with Simple Candlestick Patterns 

A successful trade based on the bearish thrusting lines in this chart starts
with the close of the first pattern’s signal day. If you’re short from the top of
this downtrend, you definitely feel like a skilled trader. You can easily monitor
the continuation patterns and follow the trend as it heads down. But where
would you exit the short?
An exit would be prudent when the price trades over the hand-drawn line on
the chart. (See Chapter 11 for more information on how to draw trendlines.)
At that point the downtrend has been broken, and the easy money on the
short has been made, so be smart and take your tidy profit and move on.
Recognizing a disappointing bearish thrusting line pattern
Want to see what happens when the bearish thrusting lines fail? Look no far-
ther than Figure 8-24, which is a chart of the futures contracts that trade
based on the level of the Japanese Yen versus the U.S. dollar. You can see that
toward the end of this downtrend, two double-stick patterns actually fail to
indicate the end of the downtrend. Both two-day patterns and the failing days
are highlighted on the chart.
I hate to see the patterns in Figure 8-24 fail. They both start out with so much
promise! Both patterns appear in downtrends and meet the criteria of having
a long black candle setup day followed by an up signal day that retraces some
of the long black candle day’s area but doesn’t close higher than its midpoint.
The failures occur when the highs of the signal days are violated on the days
that follow each pattern. You can even say that the violations occur when
days that follow the patterns have prices that exceed the midpoint, open, or
high of the setup day. It doesn’t matter which level you choose — they all get
violated, the patterns fail, and the trends turn upward quickly.

177
Chapter 8: Utilizing Bearish Double-Stick Patterns

The bearish separating lines
The next continuation or trending pattern is referred to as the bearish sepa-
rating lines pattern. If you flip back to Chapter 7, you can read all about this
pattern’s bullish counterpart.
Identifying the bearish separating lines
The setup day of the bearish separating lines pattern is a long white candle,
which can make some bears or shorts a bit nervous when it appears in a
downtrend. A little relief for those factions comes on the signal day, however,
when the opening price is near the setup day’s open. That relaxes them a bit,
and they decide that the up day wasn’t justified, so they keep right on selling
on the open of the signal day. But what happens to the bulls that had a ball
on the setup day? They can’t take the heat, so they sell their positions, and
the price just keeps on trending lower and lower. For a graphical representa-
tion, check out Figure 8-25.
This pattern is somewhat rare because it’s unusual for the open of the signal
day to be equal or near the setup day’s open. It really amounts to a gap down
opening, with all the prices from the setup day not even trading on the signal
day. Short-term buyers on the setup day hardly have a chance to get out with
a profit on the signal day, which is a very discouraging prospect for a buyer.
Understanding how to trade on the bearish separating lines
The example I use in Figure 8-26 for illustrating how you can use the bearish
separating lines for your trading purposes is an unusual stock chart for this
book. The stock represented is Inco (symbol N), a large producer of the metal
nickel. The model is uncommon because Inco merged out of business with
another company at the beginning of 2007, and it doesn’t trade publicly in the
U.S. anymore. Still, though, the example is a sound one, and it shows you how
the bearish separating lines can really sing when the conditions are just right.
Figure 8-26 clearly shows a downtrend in place, but then a couple of white
candles appear and make the shorts a little twitchy. The second white candle
in the highlighted area is the setup day of the bearish separating lines pat-
tern. It reveals that either some bulls think the price is right to buy or the
shorts are starting to take their profits and get out. However, the signal day 
of the pattern shows the price opening near the open of the setup day. Behold
the bearish separating lines! That means the bears aren’t done selling, and
they push the price lower throughout the day and keep the downtrend going.
The pattern in Figure 8-26 is very well formed, but it may not be the best pat-
tern to rely on if you’re interested in initiating a new trade. If you trade it on
the close, you sell at the bottom of a long black day, so quite a bit of ground
will be covered in the direction you want to trade. This particular pattern is
best used as a confirmation that the downtrend is intact, and you’re lucky to
see it if you want to hold onto a short position for a little while longer.
178
Part II: Working with Simple Candlestick Patterns 

The failing bearish separating line
Just when you thought you’d always love the bearish separating lines, here I
come with an example of what happens when they go bad. Figure 8-27 is a
chart of General Electric (GE), a conglomerate that stretches from the NBC

television networks to appliances to aircraft engines. You’d be hard pressed
to find someone who hasn’t been exposed to a branch of GE at some point in
his life. (I say that, of course, with my CNBC on in the background.)
The downtrend on the chart in Figure 8-27 is a strong one, and when the pat-
tern appears, it looks like the downtrend has been underway for several
weeks. The setup day of the pattern is an attempt by some buyers to pick a
cheap place to buy. Then, on the signal day, the bears take over from the
open and push prices lower. But notice that on the day immediately after the
pattern, the open and high of the signal day are both violated. That’s a pretty
good sign that the pattern may not be indicating that the trend will continue.
Shortly after the pattern in Figure 8-27 is violated, a trend reversal occurs. If
you’re considering buying before you see the bearish separating lines, that
pattern may keep you from doing so. If you’re short and you see the pattern,
you may have waited to cover. Because the pattern didn’t hold and the trend
was broken, buyers can change their minds more easily and start buying.
That’s certainly the case here, and you can see that the price of GE heads
higher for several days as a result.
The bearish neck lines
The last bearish double-stick pattern in this chapter is the bearish neck lines,
and just like its bullish counterparts from Chapter 7, this pattern is more of a
pattern classification than one single pattern.

Chapter 8: Utilizing Bearish Double-Stick Patterns

Recognizing bearish neck lines
Bearish neck lines have two types: bearish on neck lines and bearish in neck
lines. The difference between the patterns is so small that you don’t have to
separate them out into two sections.
Figure 8-28 includes both bearish in neck and bearish on neck patterns. The
only difference is that the wick of the in neck setup day may overlap some
with the signal day of the pattern. Both variations have a long black candle
for the setup day followed by a gap down and a rebound attempt that man-
ages to trade back only to the close of the setup day. The bears hold their
ground at this level.
Using the bearish neck lines for profitable trading
Figure 8-29 shows a chart of the futures contract that trades based on the
prices of 30-year bonds issued by the U.S. Treasury. The bearish neck lines
on this chart are in neck because the setup day overlaps with the signal day.
The bulls try to rebound the futures price, but they’re met with bearish resis-
tance at the previous opening price. Then you see a brief battle between the
bulls and bears followed by a continuation of the downtrend.
This pattern is valid even though prices don’t immediately continue down on
the following day. The trend doesn’t really break, and the price levels of the
long black day aren’t violated. The next couple of days may be nerve-wracking
for bears, but those that hold their ground on a short are rewarded with
lower prices.
Figure 8-28:
The two
variations of
the bearish

181
Chapter 8: Utilizing Bearish Double-Stick Patterns

Noticing an unsuccessful bearish neck line
Just like the rest of the two-stick patterns in this chapter, the bearish neck
lines can fail. Refer to Figure 8-30.
Figure 8-30 is a chart of the stock representing ownership in U.S. Steel (symbol
X). Because U.S. Steel is such a large producer of an eminently vital material,
the company is very economically sensitive, and its stock is volatile for trad-
ing both long and short.
The bearish neck lines appear during a downtrend, and the other criteria are
in place; the setup day is represented by a long black candle, which is fol-
lowed by a gap down. Prices then rebound, but the bears hold the price
steady. All appears to be well, but then a couple of days after the pattern
appears, the bulls get rolling on a more successful run and the trend changes.
I point to two days as failure days in Figure 8-30. Choose whichever resis-
tance level you want, but when a long black candle day is involved, picking
the midpoint may be prudent if you hope to get out of a short or buy before
the trend is in full swing and the prices you’re facing aren’t too steep. The
first failure day trades through the midpoint, the second trades over the high,
and then the uptrend is in place.

Getting the Hang of Bullish 
Three-Stick Patterns
In This Chapter
 Three-day patterns that signal the end of a downtrend
 Predicting an uptrend continuation using three-day patterns
T
he addition of three-stick candlestick patterns to your trading arsenal
makes your trading strategies more complicated, more interesting, and
hopefully, more profitable. In this chapter, I cover some of the bullish three-
stick patterns that you can use to make effective and efficient trades.
The three-stick patterns are a little more of a challenge than their one- and
two-stick counterparts because there are several rules that each must follow
in order to emerge as a valid signal. Three-stick patterns can also be a bit
frustrating. You may watch the first two days of your favorite (and most reli-
able) pattern begin to emerge only to see it fizzle out on the third day. But if
you’re up to the challenge and willing to deal with the occasional annoyance,
these patterns can be valuable tools when trying to predict trend reversals or
confirm that a current trend is going to stay in place.
Understanding Bullish Three-Stick 
Trend Reversal Patterns
The three-stick patterns in this section offer you a heads-up when a down-
trend is about to switch gears and turn into an uptrend. Many of these three-
stick patterns exist, and in the pages that follow I cover many of the most
common ones. With three days needed to complete each pattern, you have
time to watch as the patterns shape up, and you should be focused in when
the third day rolls around, and you’ve noticed some interesting developments
during the two preceding days.

When working with three-day patterns, be prepared by closely monitoring
days that follow two days of promising price action. If a pattern is completed
as you’d hoped, you need to be ready to put on the appropriate trade and
stop order near the close of the day on which the pattern is completed.
The three inside up pattern
The three inside up pattern is a good place to begin my discussion of the
bullish three-stick patterns that can let you know when a downtrend is about
to be reversed. This pattern is a straightforward pattern that you can recog-
nize with just a little practice.
Identifying the three inside up pattern
The three inside up pattern has a peculiar name, but a quick look at Figure 9-1
should give you a good idea of where the name originated. The three part
comes from there being three days involved in creating the pattern. There 
are three sticks, and the second day is an inside day relative to the first day,
which is a long down day. The final day is an up day that closes higher than
the open of the first day.
The trading activity that results in a three inside up pattern involves a gradu-
al shift of power from the bears to the bulls. I like this pattern and the way it
develops because it usually gives a trader time to put on a trade before too
much of the reversal has occurred. Traders can always buy high with the
intention of selling higher, but it’s nice when buying high doesn’t mean
they’re buying too high.

Part III: Making the Most of Complex Patterns 

Making effective trades using the three inside up pattern
The chart in Figure 9-2 gives you a very good idea of how the three inside up
pattern can tip you off as to when to buy in advance of a forthcoming uptrend.
It’s a chart of the futures contracts that trade based on the ten-year Treasury
bonds issued by the U.S. government. It’s one of the most actively traded
futures contracts, and it’s a very economically sensitive security.
This chart shows an extended downtrend in the price of the ten-year futures.
There have been a couple of attempts to change the course of the trend, and
before the pattern arrives, it appears that the downtrend has been moderat-
ing. I include a couple of trendlines on the chart as an illustration.
If you’re looking for trend reversal patterns, a good sign is when you see that
the prevailing trend is starting to moderate. When you spot a moderating
trend, be sure to keep your eyes peeled for a candlestick pattern indicating
that a trend reversal is on the way.
The first day of the three inside up pattern in Figure 9-2 is a long black candle,
which is followed by a slight up day that’s an inside day relative to the first
day. The third and final day is a strong up day that closes above the open 
of the first day of the pattern and completes the bullish signal. Then it’s off 
to the races, and the trend starts shooting upward.
Are you wondering where you may place a wise sell stop order when you’re
working with the three inside up pattern? If so, good question. You have sev-
eral choices. In most cases, I use the open or low of the second day. If those
levels are violated, I regard the pattern as invalid. You can also use the open
or low of the third day; both are viable alternatives.

Chapter 9: Getting the Hang of Bullish Three-Stick Patterns

Avoid using the first day, because if the security breaks through the lows of
the first two days, then there’s a good chance that the first day levels are
going to be tested if not violated. Wouldn’t you rather be out of the long trade
before this occurs?
The three inside up pattern not working out too well
This section gives you an example of what can happen when a three inside 
up pattern fails. Take a look at Figure 9-3, where you can see a three inside up
pattern that appears in a downtrend but doesn’t signal a trend reversal. It’s a
chart of the futures contracts that trade based on the level of the Australian
dollar versus the U.S. dollar. This isn’t the most liquid of currency futures pairs,
but it’s still active enough to make money on both the long and short side.
The first day of the pattern in Figure 9-3 is a down day, and the second day
shows a gap up but doesn’t have a low that violates the low of the first 
day. The second day’s close is also higher than its open, but the second day’s
close stays between the open and close of the first day. And if you’re thinking
that the second day is an inside day, you’re absolutely right! Finally, the third
day is also an up day — a long white bar — with an open that’s higher than
the open of the second day. So where does the pattern go wrong?
The day after the pattern is the culprit. On that day, a long black candle vio-
lates anything a savvy trader considers a support level, and that’s all she
wrote. Even though the pattern fails, the failure day can be a blessing for
buyers who have solid stops in place, because that little bit of failure (and
the subsequent stop-induced end of the trade) would save them from the
effects of a downtrend that continues for several days.

The three outside up pattern
The three outside up pattern is another relatively simple three-stick reversal
pattern that you can pick up on with a little patience and a basic understand-
ing of the necessary components. This section gives you the full scoop.
Spotting the three outside up pattern
Like all bullish reversal patterns, the three outside up should occur in the
midst of a downtrend. Here is how the days play out:
1. Day one: The pattern’s first day is actually a down day, but just a
slight down day.
2. Day two: The second day opens with a gap down from the first day,
but prices don’t stay down for long.
This day creates an “outside day” relative to the first day with the high
being higher, the low being lower than the first day. Also, the open of the
day is lower than the previous close, and the close of this second day is
higher than the open of the first day.
The bulls take over at some point during the second day and push prices
higher until the close is near the day’s high. The second day is a long
white bar, and it’s an outside day relative to the first day. Outside means
that the price action for the second day traded outside of the high and
low of the first day.
3. Day three: The third day completes the pattern with another up day.
On the third day it’s clear that the bulls aren’t done, and the day closes
higher than the high of the second day. The trend has definitely turned,
and it’s headed up, up and away.
For a straightforward example of the three outside up pattern, see Figure 9-4.
Figure 9-4:
The three
outside up
pattern.
191
Chapter 9: Getting the Hang of Bullish Three-Stick Patterns

Trading on the three outside up pattern
For a real-world example of the three outside up pattern, I use a chart of the
stock for a company that helps its customers escape the real world. The
chart is in Figure 9-5, and the company is Electronic Arts (ERTS), which pro-
duces some of the world’s top video games. Its Madden Football games com-
prise its flagship series, and the company’s stock is great on both the short
and long side because it has many volatile moves based on the popularity of
individual games and the platforms on which the games are played.
On the chart in Figure 9-5, ERTS stock appears to have found a bottom, and it
looks like an uptrend is on the horizon. When you’re working with three-day
reversal patterns, try to buy at the beginning of a trend when prices are rela-
tively low compared to recent history. The pattern plays out fairly well: The
trend is down, and a down day — albeit not a very convincing one — occurs
on the first day. It’s followed by an outside up day, and then the third day is
an up day that outpaces the bullishness of the second day.
The three outside up pattern comes before 
more bearishness instead of bullishness
The three outside up pattern is a thing of beauty, but Figure 9-6 shows you
the pattern’s potential for ugliness when it goes bad. The chart is for Hewlett
Packard (HPQ). The pattern shows up in a downtrend, and the first day is
indeed a down day. The second day is an up day, and it’s an outside day rela-
tive to the first day. Very promising! Then, to top it all off, the pattern is com-
pleted with an up day on the third day that exhibits some bullish behavior.
Figure 9-5:

192
Part III: Making the Most of Complex Patterns 

But the bullishness isn’t meant to last. On the very next trading day after the
pattern appears, the stock never even gets over the previous day’s closing
price. The gap is quickly filled, and then in a few days anything that may be
considered a support level is compromised. Easy come, easy go.
The three white soldiers pattern
The three white soldiers pattern includes three bullish candles in a row. If the
pattern occurs with a downtrend in front of it, you can consider it a possible
signal that the bulls have had enough and are buying in force.
Although it’s a nice indication to buy, a small drawback to the three white sol-
diers is the amount of ground that’s already been covered at the completion
of the pattern.
Recognizing the three white soldiers
To locate the three white soldiers on a chart, look for three consecutive up
days that occur in a prevailing downtrend. Then look closer. If the open, high,
low, and close of the second day are higher than those of the first day, and
those four points are also higher on the third day than the second, then
you’re looking at the three white soldiers pattern. Make sense? Have a look 
at Figure 9-7 for a visual.
The price action behind these days is dramatic, and it normally indicates a
quick shift from a downtrend to an uptrend. The three white soldiers mean
that the bulls are in control for three straight days beginning with the open 
of the first day.

Chapter 9: Getting the Hang of Bullish Three-Stick Patterns

Using the three white soldiers to make a profitable trade
The example I use to show you how to make trades based on the three white
soldiers pattern is near and dear to my heart. It’s a chart of the futures con-
tracts that trade on the level of the Euro, and I executed a successful trade
based on this very pattern. Prior to spotting the pattern, I’d been looking for
an indication that the downtrend was coming to an end, and so I was
delighted to see the three white soldiers shown in Figure 9-8.

Part III: Making the Most of Complex Patterns 

After such a dramatic move, there’s sometimes an opportunity for a pullback
(a small trend down from a higher level), but I bought the Euro futures very
close to the closing price of the third day of the pattern. I had a plan in place
to buy the Euro when it appeared the downtrend was coming to an end, so 
I was a little more aggressive than I needed to be. With a little patience I
could’ve gotten a better price the next day, but I didn’t want to risk missing
the trade altogether — something that can sometimes feel worse to me than
losing money.
I also highlight on the chart in Figure 9-8 where I chose to exit the position.
The trend had been in place for a few weeks, and the long black candle broke
the low of the two previous days. I’d been using a sell stop order and contin-
ued to move the stop higher as the futures contract price increased. My stop
was in place at the low of the day that came two days before the long black
candle because I felt this level would indicate the trend was starting to fade. I
also kept an eye out for any problematic reversal formations, which you
should also do if you find yourself in a similar situation.
Although I exited the trade before the trend reversed again, I was still very
happy with this trade. I had a plan, executed it, and profited from it. Why
can’t all trades be as easy as this one?
The three white soldiers fail to signal bullishness
The three white soldiers is a pretty strong bullish trend reversal pattern, but
like all other patterns, it does have the potential for failure. Figure 9-9 shows
you what can happen when the three white soldiers doesn’t fare so well in
battle. It’s a chart for the stock that represents ownership in Disney (DIS). I’m
assuming that most people have some familiarity with Disney. With a three-
year-old in the house, I’m more familiar with the company these days than I
want to be.

Chapter 9: Getting the Hang of Bullish Three-Stick Patterns

The three white soldiers pattern actually fails twice on the chart in Figure 9-9,
and both failures are highlighted. If you see this situation developing and
make the decision to trade on it, you’d be smart to place your initial sell stop
at the low of the pattern’s second day. Most traders cover a lot of ground
before they put on a trade, so some retracing of the new uptrend should be
expected. Placing a liberal sell stop allows for that.
The morning star and bullish 
doji star patterns
The morning star and bullish doji star are recognized as separate patterns,
but because they have very similar characteristics, I’ve grouped them
together in this section.
Identifying the morning star and bullish doji star
You can see basic examples of both the morning star and bullish doji star pat-
terns in Figure 9-10. The only real difference between the two patterns is the
second day. The second day of the bullish doji star is a true doji, while the
second day of the morning star pattern is almost a doji.
The price action behind these two patterns is very similar. The first day for
both patterns is a down day, which is to be expected in a bullish reversal pat-
tern. The second day for both patterns starts with a gap opening, indicating
that the bears are continuing to push down the price. Then the rest of the
second day is made up of very tight price action between the open and close.
The third day is very bullish, with prices rising to cover some or all the
ground from the down day. When you spot one of these patterns in a down-
trend, it usually means that the trend is ready to reverse.
Figure 9-10:
The morning
star and
bullish 
doji star
patterns.
196
Part III: Making the Most of Complex Patterns 

Trading on the morning star and bullish doji star patterns
Figure 9-11 is a chart of the Euro futures, and it’s a good example because the
bullish doji star pattern in the chart indicates that the trend has reached the
bottom. Keep in mind that the bullish doji star here could just as easily be a
morning star pattern, and the result would be the same.
The days play out in the following pattern:
1. The first day of the pattern is actually the third of three bearish days.
Leading up to this pattern, the bears are ruling the price action.
2. The second day features a gap opening that’s a little lower than the
low of the first day, and the day ends up forming a doji after some
back and forth between the bulls and bears.
The doji has pretty long legs, indicating an intense battle for price action
during the day.
3. The third and final day of the pattern is a white candle, indicating
that the bulls ruled the day.
It closes high and into some of the range covered by the first day. The
two days after the pattern see a bit of bearish price action, but no signifi-
cant support levels are violated, and then three days later the bulls
really get rolling, and it’s clear that an uptrend is in place. And what 
an uptrend it is!
To take advantage of this type of bullish doji star pattern (or a morning star
pattern in the same situation), you should either try to buy near the end of
the pattern, or possibly attempt to put on a long position on any sort of near-
term price weakness that doesn’t violate a stop level.
Figure 9-11:

197
Chapter 9: Getting the Hang of Bullish Three-Stick Patterns

As you can see, raking in a profit on a trade based on the bullish doji star or
morning star is a definite possibility if you keep your eyes open and place
your trades wisely. But the pattern can also fizzle out and cause losses.
The bullish doji star not working too well
Figure 9-12 is a chart with a morning star pattern that has the potential to
cause some heartbreak. It’s a chart of the stock for Janus Capital Group
(JNS), which is an asset manager of over $150 billion in investments. Yes,
that’s billion, with a b. Keep in mind that this could also be a bullish doji star
because the patterns are extremely similar and basically interchangeable for
your trading purposes.
The morning star arrives after a downtrend has been in place for a few weeks.
The trend appears to be moderating a bit — an encouraging sign if you’re
looking to buy a stock. The pattern is completed in textbook fashion, with
just one exception. The stock doesn’t change trend very quickly. The price
levels established by the pattern that you may use as stops are violated a few
weeks after the pattern appears; you may want to bail out on this trade long
before that.
Another factor that may be used when you’re determining when to exit a
trade is time. A violated price level isn’t the only way a pattern can fail. You
can also consider a pattern a failure due to the passage of time. If you see a
promising pattern that doesn’t fail but the hoped for price action doesn’t
occur, feel free to call it a failure and get out. How long you wait before bag-
ging it is up to you, but using a time stop is a very useful trading tool.

Part III: Making the Most of Complex Patterns 

The bullish abandoned baby pattern
The next bullish three-stick trend reversal pattern I cover in this chapter is
the bullish abandoned baby pattern. It’s a close cousin of the morning star and
bullish doji star patterns, and although its name sounds sad, you can end up
very happy with the results if you trade it wisely.
Identifying the bullish abandoned baby pattern
The bullish abandoned baby gets its name from the second day of the pattern,
which just kind of floats out on the chart by itself like it’s been abandoned by
the first and third days. The second day is also smaller than the other two 
candlesticks, so it’s the baby of the pattern. Look at Figure 9-13 for an example.
The first day of the pattern is a bearish day. The second day gaps lower and
has pretty tight price action, especially compared to the other two candle-
sticks in the pattern. Day three is a very bullish day that gaps higher than the
second day.
Making a trade based on the abandoned baby pattern
For a look at a bullish abandoned baby pattern that provides a great buying
signal, see Figure 9-14. It’s a chart of ITT Corporation, a conglomerate with
businesses in a variety of industries. Its products range from electronics for
defense systems to solutions to treat wastewater.
Figure 9-13:
The bullish
abandoned
baby
pattern.
199
Chapter 9: Getting the Hang of Bullish Three-Stick Patterns

The pattern develops with a bearish day in the midst of a downtrend. The
second day opens with a gap down, and the price action for that day occurs
in a fairly tight range. (A gap on a chart occurs when there’s an area or price
action that isn’t covered by two consecutive bars. The area or price range
where no trading occurs is known as the gap.) The high of the second day
never goes higher than the low of the first day, leaving a gap on the chart.
The final day gaps up above the high of the second day, and that gap isn’t
filled. The final day is also a very bullish day, and anyone watching can see
that the bulls are in the driver’s seat.
The gap openings in the abandoned baby pattern may remind you of the old
rule of thumb that “gaps always get filled.” That nugget does hold true, but
for this pattern it’s quite possible that the gap won’t be filled for quite some
time. It can take months, or even years — long past the points at which you
can profit from the trade.
The abandoned baby that didn’t work too well
In addition to successful examples of the abandoned baby pattern signaling a
trend reversal (see the preceding section), in some cases you’d be better off,
well, abandoning a trade involving this pattern.
Figure 9-15 is an unusual chart to say the least, but a good example of an aban-
doned baby that didn’t work and probably shouldn’t have been traded in the
first place. The stock represented on this chart is for Edison International
(EIX), a power company that does business primarily in southern California.
Even before the pattern on Figure 9-15 emerges, this stock doesn’t necessar-
ily look like one you’d want to trade. There are several gaps on the chart
before the pattern emerges, indicating that it’s not the most liquid stock in
the world.
Figure 9-14:

Part III: Making the Most of Complex Patterns 

The second day of this bullish abandoned baby does appear after a few down
days and a bearish move of over 40 percent, so the pattern is complete. But it
comes very close to recent highs and reaches a level that the stock has had a
difficult time exceeding in the past. Because of this distance covered by the
last day of the pattern, I recommend avoiding entering on the close of the
third day, and I’d probably ignore this pattern altogether. I know that’s easy
to say when the results are readily available, but truthfully, that’s enough
information for me to shy away from the trade.
The bullish squeeze alert pattern
The bullish squeeze alert pattern is one of my very favorite bullish patterns.
It’s a versatile three-stick pattern, and it pops up on a relatively frequent
basis, meaning that the opportunities to trade it are more common than
some of the other patterns I discuss.
Spotting the bullish squeeze alert pattern
The rules that govern the formation of a bullish squeeze alert allow for a little
wiggle room. The strictest rule is that the first day of the pattern must be a
down day. After that, the second day has to be an inside day of the first and
the third an inside day of the second. Beyond that, though, the rules are kind
of flexible. The second and third days can be up days, down days, or a combi-
nation of the two. The only strict criteria governing the second and third
days are that they must be inside days, and they have to form a triangle.
Figure 9-16 shows a variation of the bullish squeeze alert that includes black
candles for the second and third days.
Figure 9-15:
An

baby pattern
fails on a
chart of EIX.
201
Chapter 9: Getting the Hang of Bullish Three-Stick Patterns

I love this pattern’s versatility, and it owes that attractive trait to the presence
of a triangle. Regardless of how they’re formed, I’ve found that triangles usually
lead to some volatile moves. Keep on the lookout for triangles as you scan your
candlestick charts. A triangle formed on a chart shows that prices are coiling
together and will soon be ready to spring in one direction or the other.
Executing trades with the bullish squeeze alert
You can see the bullish squeeze alert at its bullish best in Figure 9-17. It’s a
chart of Southern Company (SO), which is a power company or utility that
serves customers in Alabama, Florida, Georgia, and Mississippi.
Utility stocks aren’t the most exciting stocks to trade, but the advantage is
that you generally won’t rack up massive losses on a trade in this sector that
doesn’t work out.
The pattern appears during a downtrend, and the first day is a long black
candle. The second day is an up day, but also an inside day relative to the
first day. The final day is a down day, but according to the rules, it’s also an
inside day relative to the second day. I chose this chart to show that the
second and third days don’t have to be specifically down or up, but do have
to be days that are inside days of the preceding day.
The pattern forms a triangle, which means you can expect quick price moves
in either direction. Because of this high level of volatility, I like to use the low
of the pattern’s first day as my sell stop. That gives the security the opportu-
nity to move without being stopped out just before a move in the right direc-
tion. This pattern is followed by some lower trading, but then the stock takes
off like it should.

The bullish squeeze alert failing to bring on higher prices
If you want to see a bullish squeeze alert pattern in a failure situation, look no
farther than Figure 9-18. The figure features a chart of Target (TGT) stock.
The days go like this:
1. The first day of the pattern is a very long black candle.
2. The second day is a very encouraging (for the bulls) white candle,
which is an inside day relative to the first day.
3. Finally, the pattern is capped off with a down day, but it’s an inside
day relative to the second day, so the pattern is complete.

Chapter 9: Getting the Hang of Bullish Three-Stick Patterns

The stock shows lackluster trading for a few days after the pattern appears,
and although the high of the pattern’s third day isn’t violated, the lack of
uptrending action may indicate that the pattern is a dud. There’s no real need
to wait around for lower prices to get out; it’s probably best just to exit and
move on, or if you wait on confirmation, just bag the idea of a trade and start
looking elsewhere. You should try to be liberal with your stops on the bullish
squeeze alert, but sometimes it’s best to also require some confirmation that
the squeeze is going in the desired direction a couple of days after the pat-
tern appears. If it’s not, feel free to stop waiting around and go on to your
next trade.
Working with Bullish Three-Stick
Trending Patterns
In addition to the trend reversal patterns that take three days to develop,
there are also a handful of three-day trending patterns. These patterns usu-
ally include a long white candle followed by a gap of some sort. Generally, the
gap or the low of the first day of the pattern may serve as a useful support
level to let you know when the prevailing trend is still intact.
Three-day patterns have three uses for traders as follows:
 If you’re considering buying a stock but hate to pay up when the price has
been rising, three-day bullish trending patterns can give you confidence
that the price you pay is as good as the price is going to be for a while.
 If you’re interested in shorting, a three-day bullish trending pattern can
tell you when to hold off for just a little longer to allow for the trend to
provide you with a better price to use in your trade.
 If you’re shorting a stock, a three-day bullish trending pattern can tell
you that it’s time to buy back and move on, because the trend definitely
isn’t your friend.
In this section I describe a number of three-stick trending patterns and how
you can incorporate them in your trading strategy.
The bullish side-by-side 
white lines pattern
The first bullish three-day trending pattern is the bullish side-by-side white
lines pattern, and it’s about as bullish as it gets. If you see this pattern on a
chart, you can feel pretty confident that the prevailing uptrend is going to
continue in grand fashion.
204
Part III: Making the Most of Complex Patterns 

Spotting the bullish side-by-side white lines pattern
To locate the bullish side-by-side white lines pattern on one of your charts,
first look for a day with a long white candle that’s followed by a gap opening
on the second day. That second day should develop into an up day that never
retraces prices down to the high of the first day. Finally, look for an up third
day that basically covers the same ground as the second day and definitely
doesn’t retrace to close the gap to the high of the first day. Sound confusing?
The straightforward example in Figure 9-19 should clear things up.
Trading on the bullish side-by-side white lines
I provide a solid scenario for trading the bullish side-by-side white lines pat-
tern in Figure 9-20, which is a chart of Tyson (TSN). Tyson is a large distribu-
tor of chicken, beef, and pork products. Because these commodities’ prices
vary due to tastes, weather, or competition, TSN can actually be a pretty
interesting stock to trade.
The pattern in Figure 9-20 emerges in an uptrend that hasn’t been in place for
long. This sign is a positive in my book because the longer the trend, the
more likely it will be reversing in the near future. The first day of the pattern
is a white candle, followed by two more white candles that cover similar
ground but don’t close the gap with the high of the first candle. It’s obvious
that the bulls have been moving the price in their direction and the bears are
continuing to lose the battle. And as you can see, that action continues for
quite some time.

Chapter 9: Getting the Hang of Bullish Three-Stick Patterns

Although it can be considered a bit liberal, I like to use the low of the first day
as a stop for this pattern. I choose that level because there’s a gap involved
in the formation of the pattern. Gaps are made to be filled, and I know that
the bears will try to make a run at a gap like this. I would prefer not to be
stopped out until they’ve succeeded in running the price below the low of the
first day. On the chart in Figure 9-20, I highlight where the bears make a run at
the bulls, but the bulls push back, and the uptrend remains in place.
When you spot a trending pattern that includes a gap, there’s a possibility for
some aggressive trading. There’s a chance that the gap will be filled with the
trend still in place, so you can place an order to buy in the gap and a stop at
the low of the pattern. This strategy is aggressive because you can buy and
sell in a short period of time as the bears take over. But if you can execute the
move properly, it’ll allow you to enjoy a very good entry price in the midst of
an uptrend.
The bullish side-by-side white lines 
failing to indicate more bullishness
Even though the bullish side-by-side white lines pattern is generally a bullish
powerhouse, it’s possible for the pattern to fail. For an example, take a look at
Figure 9-21.
Figure 9-21 is a chart of Analog Devices Inc. (ADI), a producer of semiconduc-
tors used in products that range from computers to DVD players. Because its
chips are used in several products that can be considered discretionary pur-
chases, its stock — as well as the stocks for just about every other company
that makes semiconductors — hinges on the overall economy and is there-
fore very volatile.

Part III: Making the Most of Complex Patterns 

The pattern in Figure 9-21 emerges at what appears to be the beginning of a
very strong uptrend. There are a few strong up days followed by a gap up and
two more white lines, which make up the pattern in this case. Because so
much ground was covered so quickly by the pattern, it may be prudent to
place a buy order in the gap that was created with the pattern, because there
may be some price retracement where a better buying point would occur.
Then you may place a sell stop below the low of the first day. It turns out to
be a lousy prospect because the gap and the low were both taken out on the
day I labeled as the failure day, but those losses pale in comparison to what
you could expect if you bought at the end of the pattern.
The bullish side-by-side 
black lines pattern
The bullish side-by-side black lines pattern occurs during an uptrend, and
although it includes some bearish trading, it doesn’t violate the uptrend’s
validity. It has some bearish undertones, but it’s still a fairly bullish indica-
tion of an uptrend continuation.
Recognizing the bullish side-by-side black lines pattern
The first day of the bullish side-by-side black lines is a long white candle that
occurs during an uptrend. The second day opens with a large gap relative to
the first day and then trades off some during the day. However, a gap is estab-
lished between the first and second days even though prices trade down
Figure 9-21:
The bullish
side-by-side
white lines
fails on a
chart of ADI.
207
Chapter 9: Getting the Hang of Bullish Three-Stick Patterns

during the second day. The third day opens higher, much like the second day.
Prices trade lower during the first day, but the gap that was established
between the first and second days stays intact. The picture in Figure 9-22 is
worth more than a thousand words in this case.
It may seem a bit odd that a three-day bullish pattern has two black candles
as the final two days, but that’s what it takes to create the bullish side-by-side
black lines. It works out because the bullishness of the prevailing uptrend
and the first day of the pattern are strong enough to keep the bears from
closing the price gap.
If you choose to enter on the completion of the side-by-side black lines pat-
tern, your entry point will be a lower price point than if you made the same
decision with the bullish side-by-side white lines.
Using the bullish side-by-side black lines for a profitable trade
For an example of the bullish side-by-side black lines paying off in a real-
world trading scenario, take a look at Figure 9-23. It’s a chart of Gannett (GCI),
publisher of USA Today and operator of several high profile Web sites includ-
ing CareerBuilder.com.

Part III: Making the Most of Complex Patterns 

The days play out as follows:
1. The first day of the pattern is a white candle that occurs during a
small pullback of the prevailing uptrend.
The trend appears to remain intact, but it can be moderating.
2. The second day has a gap opening and a little selling during the day.
A gap is established between the first and second days.
3. The third day of the pattern has a slightly higher opening, and some
selling takes place during the day.
The gap still exists, and the day closes slightly below the open. It takes
three or four days, but eventually, the uptrend is back in place and the
pattern in Figure 9-23 turns out to be a winner.
Failure of the bullish side-by-side black lines pattern
For my example of a failing bullish side-by-side black lines pattern, I turn to
Figure 9-24 and a chart of the drug company Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMY).
This company is a very large drug corporation that develops new drugs and
sells many high profile drugs already in existence. It’s a great stock to trade
because of the competitive nature and constant change in the pharmaceuti-
cal industry.

Chapter 9: Getting the Hang of Bullish Three-Stick Patterns

The first day of the pattern featured in Figure 9-24 is a very bullish day, and it
helps to continue a choppy uptrend. The second day has a gap opening, and
the long wick at the top of the candle tells you that the day saw some pretty
heavy buying. The second day does close lower, but a gap between the first
and second day is established. Prices open higher on the third day, and more
selling takes place during the day. Notice that the low of the second day isn’t
violated, and the gap remains in place.
This signal appears to have legs for the first few days, but prices soon start
to roll over. After a couple of weeks, the low of the first day is eventually vio-
lated and the signal fails. In this instance, it’s prudent to exit the trade even
before the stop is hit. That’s easy to say after the fact, of course, but the
sheer amount of time that passes while the price action appears indecisive
should be enough for a trader to call it quits on the trade.
The upside tasuki gap pattern
The three-stick trending pattern in this section can be considered a deviation
of the patterns described in the preceding two sections. The upside tasuki
gap can just as easily be called the upside white line beside black line pattern.
The name tasuki is a Japanese word for a sash that holds up a shirt sleeve. I’ve
got to be honest: I’m not sure how that relates to the pattern, but it’s fun to
say, and the pattern can lead you to some great trades, so I won’t question it.

Part III: Making the Most of Complex Patterns 

Spotting the upside tasuki gap pattern
The upside tasuki gap starts with a white candle in an uptrend. The second
day is much like the second day of the side-by-side white lines pattern that I
explain earlier in this chapter. It gaps higher and closes higher for the day.
The third day is much like the third day of a side-by-side black lines pattern
(described in this chapter in the section “The bullish side-by-side black lines
pattern”). There’s an opening in the same range as the second day and then
some lower trading, but the gap isn’t completely filled in. Check out Figure 9-25
for a visual representation.
I like this pattern because it offers an attractive entry point, especially when
compared to the side-by-side white lines pattern. Getting to buy on the low
end of any candle when there’s a bullish signal is fine with me.
Using the upside tasuki gap pattern for a successful trade
The chart in Figure 9-26 forms the basis for my explanation of how you can
use the upside tasuki gap to make a profitable trade. The chart is for the
stock of Illinois Tool Works (ITW). It’s a great proxy on the overall economy
because its interests are wide and varied. The company creates products that
are used in just about every type of mechanical product you can imagine,
from semiconductors to dishwashers.
Figure 9-25:
The upside

211
Chapter 9: Getting the Hang of Bullish Three-Stick Patterns

The tasuki gap in Figure 9-26 just barely passed the rules for the pattern. The
gap between the high of the first day and the range of the last day was so
miniscule that I had to double-check the data to make sure it was valid.
There’s a gap there, but you have to get out the magnifying glass to see it!
I also chose to include more history on this chart than I do for the other
examples in this chapter, to show that although the trend is sort of flat in the
near term, there’s a longer term uptrend in place, and that trend is actually
tested with this pattern. I include a trendline on the chart to reinforce that
point.
The nuts and bolts of the pattern are where they should be. The first day is a
long white candle in the middle of an uptrend, and it’s followed by a gap up
and another up day. The third day encroaches the gap, but the gap is still
intact at the end of the day, offering evidence that the trend should continue,
as it does. If you spot this pattern and choose to take on a long position, you
can ride the trend for a nice profit. You can also put on a long position know-
ing that you need to either get out of the trade on the appearance of a 
bearish reversal signal or some sort of trend break.
The tasuki gap fails to indicate more bullishness
I’m fond of the upside tasuki gap pattern, but it certainly does have, well, a
downside. Have a look at Figure 9-27 for an example of what can happen
when the upside tasuki gap turns out to be a dud.

Part III: Making the Most of Complex Patterns 

The chart in Figure 9-27 is for the stock that represents ownership of FedEx
Corporation (FDX). This is another stock that I love to trade, for a few rea-
sons. First, on the business side, FedEx is exposed to the energy markets on
the cost side of its business and the overall economy on the income side. As
a result, it proves itself to be a very volatile (and fun to trade) stock. Second,
the first industry for which I was ever given investment responsibility was
transportation, and FedEx (Federal Express at the time) was an early com-
pany in my coverage. Finally, I grew up in Memphis (FedEx headquarters),
where everyone knows someone at FedEx. Needless to say, the company is
close to my heart.
On to the chart. During a well-defined uptrend, a long white candle appears
on the chart, and that forms the pattern’s first day. It’s actually laying on a
support line, which would be considered a bonus in this situation. I include a
trendline on the chart. The second day is an up day, and a gap between the
first and second day is created. Finally, the third day is a down day that
encroaches but doesn’t close the gap.
The pattern looks like a winner, and the failure takes a while to occur. But
note that the low of the first day is violated — a sure sign of failure in this
scenario. To introduce another possible level of failure, I also extended the
trendline out to where the failure occurred. You can use this line as a stop
that adjusts as time moves along. That’s just another one of the countless
ways you can exit a position when the theory behind the trade is no longer
valid.

Chapter 9: Getting the Hang of Bullish Three-Stick Patterns

The upside gap filled pattern
The final bullish three-day pattern that I explore in this chapter is the upside
gap filled pattern. It offers bullish trend confirmation, but it’s particularly
nice because the gap that’s created gets filled without violating the prevailing
uptrend. Sometimes gaps on charts are targets for either longs or shorts to
push trading to fill the gaps. But with this gap filled, there isn’t a gap present
to encourage the shorts to take action.
Recognizing the upside gap filled pattern
The upside gap filled pattern is aptly named, as you can see in Figure 9-28. The
first day is a white candle that occurs in an uptrend. The second day is bull-
ish, with a gap opening and a closing that establish a gap. The third and final
day is bearish, and it actually closes the gap, but it doesn’t violate the low of
the first day.
A low level for entry on the final day makes this pattern very attractive in my
opinion. Also, as the low of the first day would be considered a stop level,
losses are typically minimal when the pattern doesn’t work as planned.
Making wise trades using the upside gap filled pattern
Examine the price action depicted in Figure 9-29 for a look at how you can
profit from a trade by using the upside gap filled pattern. The stock charted
is Edison International (EIX), a utility that deals primarily in southern
California. This is actually the second time EIX has been used as an example
in this chapter. (Have a look at Figure 9-15 for the first.) I guess utilities can
be fun to trade!
The pattern in this chart emerges pretty early in an uptrend. The first day is
an up day, and it’s followed by a white candle for the second day, which gaps
up. The third day is a down day that fills in the gap and closes in the range of
the first day. The upside gap is filled!
The price action following the pattern is muted for a few days, and it even
looks like the pattern will fail as prices come close to the low of the first day.
But the bulls prevail, and the trend continues upward for some time.

The upside gap followed by lower prices
But the bulls don’t always prevail, of course. The upside gap filled pattern
can go wrong, and although it’s ugly, you need to know what it looks like
when it happens. Check out Figure 9-30. It shows a pattern failure on a chart
for the stock of Comcast (CMCSA), which provides cable TV, Internet, and
phone services to many Americans.
The pattern on the chart in Figure 9-30 occurs at what would’ve been the
very beginning of an uptrend, if the pattern had worked out. There are a few
up days that start to indicate that the trend is positive, and then the first day
of the upside gap filled pattern appears as a very long white candle. It’s fol-
lowed by an upside gap that closes, leaving that gap in place. Finally, the
third day is a down day that closes the gap and closes within the first day’s
range.
This pattern takes a while to fail, and like several of the other examples in
this chapter, it may illustrate a situation where you’d be better served by
bailing out of the trade because of time concerns than by exiting because 
of a clear price level violation. After all, you can probably do more with your
money in another trade than you can with it tied up for what seems like for-
ever in a questionable upside gap filled pattern trade.

Chapter 10
Trading with Bearish 
Three-Stick Patterns
In This Chapter
 Predicting a trend reversal with bearish three-stick patterns
 Working with bearish three-stick patterns that signal a downtrend continuation
I
n this chapter, I focus on the biggest bearish formations included in this
book: the three-stick bearish candlestick patterns. Throughout the next few
pages I cover some of the most common bearish three-stick patterns that 
pop up on your charts.
If you flip back to Chapter 9, you can read about a variety of bullish three-stick
patterns that can tell you when a downtrend is about to shift upward, as well
as a few of those patterns that reveal when a downtrend continues. This 
chapter features the bearish counterparts of those patterns, and they can
reveal when an uptrend is about to fall apart and head downward or when 
a downtrend is likely to continue. Use these patterns when you’re looking to 
put on a short position or as sell signals if you’ve already established a 
long position.
Understanding Bearish Three-Stick 
Trend Reversal Patterns
Much like their bullish counterparts from Chapter 9, a host of three-day 
bullish patterns commonly indicate that a trend reversal is forthcoming. 
The patterns in this section tell you when an uptrend is nearing its end and
when a downtrend is ready to begin. The bearish reversal patterns can be
very useful for shorts, but keep in mind that shorting — especially with
stocks — when the trend is up can be a difficult undertaking.

The three inside down pattern
The three inside down pattern is a handy reversal pattern that shows up
fairly regularly. The indecision implied by the pattern’s second day (an inside
day) provides great insight into the action, telling you that the bears are
starting to push against the trend.
Figuring out how to spot the three inside down pattern
The three inside down always occurs in an established uptrend:
1. The first day of the pattern is an up day.
The bulls are in control on the first day of the three inside down.
2. The second day is bearish, and it’s also an inside day relative to the
first day.
(The open is lower than the previous day’s close, and the close is higher
than the previous day’s close.) The high and low of the second day also
fall within the high/low range established on the first day of the pattern.
The bears take over on the second and third days (see next bullet
point).
3. The pattern is completed on the third day with another down day that
actually violates the low of the first day.
As you may guess, this formation is usually a great sign that an uptrend is set
to fizzle out. For an example, see Figure 10-1.
Figure 10-1:
The three
inside down
pattern.
218
Part III: Making the Most of Complex Patterns 

Trading on the three inside down pattern
The preceding section shows how to identify the three inside down pattern,
so now set your sights on Figure 10-2 for a real-world trading scenario where
the pattern can potentially help you turn a profit. The chart in this figure is of
Tribune Corporation (TRB), the owner of the Chicago Tribune newspaper, as
well as the owner (as of this writing) of the Chicago Cubs. (The Cubs have
been in what you could call a downtrend for the last 100 years, but that’s a
different story altogether.)
The three inside down pattern is the opposite of its bullish counterpart dis-
cussed in Chapter 9. It starts out with a bullish first day, but things start to
turn bearish after that. Here’s how the pattern unfolds:
1. The first day is a long white candle that occurs in the midst of a pretty
strong uptrend.
2. The following day, in textbook fashion, a down, inside day appears.
The open of the second day is lower than the close of the first, and the
close of the second day is higher than the first. Both the wick and the
body are “inside” the first day’s price action.
3. The third day reveals a takeover by the bears, and they begin to push
prices down.
The stock opens lower and continues to trade down below the low of
both the first and second days. The ensuing downtrend is strong, and it
lasts for a few weeks.
If you watch this pattern develop and look to make a trade, you need to
either be prepared to short near the close of the first day or pick an entry
level to try to sell short on the second day.

Chapter 10: Trading with Bearish Three-Stick Patterns

Failing to give a good bearish signal
If you’ve read through any of the preceding chapters, you already know 
that I never provide a winning pattern example without following it up with 
a similar pattern that fails. For my failure example of the three inside down
pattern, I offer up the chart in Figure 10-3. This chart is for BEA Systems
(BEAS), a provider of business-oriented software. As far as stock trading
goes, software stocks offer as much volatility as any industry, and BEAS has
been a great one to trade for years.
Figure 10-3 shows that the inside down day on BEAS occurs at the very begin-
ning of an uptrend. It appears after some relatively strong days, so by trading
it, you’re either fighting a strong trend or catching the stock when it’s due for
a turnaround.
The first day in the three inside down pattern in Figure 10-3 is an up day, but
it’s nothing spectacular because of the recent bullishness. The second day is
an inside day, and the third day reveals a rally by the bulls that falls short
when the day closes down. The price action that plays out shortly after the
pattern is pretty encouraging for the bears, but after a couple of weeks, the
trend turns back up and the pattern clearly fails. The most liberal stop level
for the three inside down is the pattern’s high, but you can always go with a
more conservative stop, such as the high of the last day.
The three outside down pattern
Like the closely related three inside down pattern from the preceding section,
the three outside down pattern should show up pretty frequently on your
charts. The pattern is a solid three-stick bearish trend reversal, and if you
know how to correctly identify it, you can rely on it for some lucrative trades.

Part III: Making the Most of Complex Patterns 

Spotting the three outside down pattern
This pattern shows up during an uptrend and commences with another up
day in the bullish run. On the second day, the bulls get started again with a
gap opening, but they don’t control the price action for long. The bears find a
selling point above the previous day’s close and go to work driving down the
price. This means that the second day has a close lower than the first day
and a low that’s lower that the first day. The second day is, therefore, an out-
side day relative to the first day.
On the third day of the three outside down pattern, the bears call the shots
from open to close. The day produces a black candle with the open, high,
low, and close all lower than the previous day’s levels. The bears are now
firmly in control. For an illustration, check out Figure 10-4.
Making trades with the three outside down pattern
The three outside down pattern does an outstanding job of picking up a
change in trend and offering a useful sell or short opportunity, and you 
can see it really sing in Figure 10-5. The chart in this figure is for Applebee’s
International (APPB). Applebee’s operates in the restaurant industry, and
stocks in that industry experience a lot of unpredictability. Restaurant 
stocks fluctuate with the economy, people’s tastes, and even the weather.
(Bad weather every weekend during a month can mean a bad month for a
restaurant.)
Figure 10-4:
The three

221
Chapter 10: Trading with Bearish Three-Stick Patterns

The first day of the pattern featured in Figure 10-5 is an up day, and although
it’s nothing to write home about, it’s still an up day occurring in a prevailing
uptrend. It’s followed by an outside and down day. Both the body and wick of
the second day are outside relative to the first day. Finally, on the third day 
of the pattern, the bears seize control and begin pushing prices down at the
start of what becomes a sustained downtrend. In fact, it takes a couple of
weeks before the bulls even attempt some sort of rally. The three outside
down pattern predicted a trend reversal, and that’s exactly what played out.
Offering a failing signal
But what happens when the three outside down pattern doesn’t deliver on its
suggestion that a downtrend is on the way? For an answer, take a look at
Figure 10-6. The chart in Figure 10-6 displays price action for the stock of the
biotech company Millennium Pharmaceuticals (MLNM). Biotech stocks can
be wildly volatile and fun to trade. This chart is interesting because there’s
more there than just a failure of the three outside down pattern, and I explain
the extra features in a moment.
The outside down pattern on this chart is a classic example of how the pat-
tern appears as it gives a sell signal. The first day is bullish in a bullish trend,
followed by a second day where the bulls push higher on the opening, but
then the bears push back, creating a down day that’s outside compared to
the first day. Finally, the bears are in control on the final day as they push
prices even lower.
After the pattern, a couple more bearish days exist, and then the trend takes
a turn to the upside. As I said, biotech stocks can be highly unpredictable!
The pattern fails and then something funny happens. Take a look. You may
think I highlighted another instance of the bearish outside day pattern, but
that’s not the case.
Figure 10-5:

222
Part III: Making the Most of Complex Patterns 

It’s a little difficult to tell, but the highs of the first and second days marked
with ??? are equal. This disqualifies the pattern as an outside down pattern.
So does a penny of price action on the second day really mean that there was
a huge difference in the trading behind these three days? Apparently not. A
new downtrend that lasts several weeks pops up right after the appearance
of what you may call the “almost bearish outside pattern.”
Splitting hairs on candlestick pattern formation can cost you a profitable
trade. Just because there’s a very small price difference that seems to dis-
qualify a pattern, don’t be too quick to disregard the formation altogether.
The psychology behind the pattern that almost panned out is the same as
what drives a by-the-book pattern, and you may be able to make a successful
trade, if you aren’t harshly strict with your pattern evaluations.
The three black crows pattern
The pattern featured in this section looks just plain ugly. The three black
crows pattern certainly isn’t much to look at, but it can benefit your trading
activities if you can spot it and trade it wisely.
Identifying the three black crows pattern
If you’re into the kind of bird watching that can lead to profits on the stock
market, keep on the lookout for the three black crows. This pattern includes
three down days in a row, and it must occur during an uptrend for it to be
valid. Set your sights on Figure 10-7 for an example.

Chapter 10: Trading with Bearish Three-Stick Patterns

The first day of the pattern may actually include a gap opening when com-
pared to the previous day, but even if the bulls are in charge at the start of
the day, it doesn’t last long. The bears push prices lower, and the result is an
obvious down day. The next two days see lower price levels across the
board. Both the second and third days are black candles with lower opens,
highs, lows, and closes. The bears have definitely taken over.
Making trades with the three black crows pattern
The example of a successful three black crows pattern that I provide is based
on a chart of a stock that’s closely tied to the stock market. TROW is the
symbol for T. Rowe Price Group, which is an asset management firm that pro-
vides mutual fund investments for individuals and retirement plans. Its busi-
ness is based on people’s confidence in investing in the market. This
confidence moves right along with trends in the stock market, so TROW and
other asset management stocks are always good trading vehicles. Take a
moment to review Figure 10-8 and allow me to explain how the three black
crows can take flight for an attractive trade.
The three black crows show up shortly following a gap up in an uptrend. The
black crows fill the gap up, which I consider to be a pretty encouraging sign.
As you can see, each day of the pattern is a black candle, and each level is
lower than the previous day’s levels.
It’s safe to say that this sign is pretty bearish. After all, sellers are putting
pressure on a stock for three straight days. This also means that there’s been
a lot of downward price movement in a short period of time — an indication
Figure 10-7:
The three
black crows
pattern.
224
Part III: Making the Most of Complex Patterns 

that there can be an opportunity to make a sale a little higher than the close
of the pattern. That’s the case with the pattern in Figure 10-8, and for the next
few days, the pattern holds, despite a weak attempt by buyers to resume the
uptrend. A patient trader that sold even the day after the pattern would be
rewarded with a nice entry point.
Failing to signal lower prices ahead
If you’re the kind of trader who insists that this pattern always works out
when it appears, you may end up eating crow. The three black crows can fail,
as you can plainly see in Figure 10-9.

Chapter 10: Trading with Bearish Three-Stick Patterns

Figure 10-9 is a chart of Intel (INTC). Intel produces semiconductors, but
you’d think they make birdfeeders with all the black crows flocking on this
chart! Okay, maybe not. The chart is a little unusual because it includes 
two failures of the three black crows pattern:
 The first occurrence of the pattern appears in an uptrend that starts
with a gap up on the first day, which brings in three solid days of selling.
The bulls make a run, but the signal stays valid because, although
there’s a slight uptrend, no price action violates the levels set by the
three black crows — for the time being, at least.
 The second occurrence of the three black crows comes in the continued
uptrend, but it features slightly lower levels than the first pattern. A
hopeful trader may be excited by the presence of two sets of the three
black crows pattern, but his hopes will soon be dashed when the high of
both patterns is violated.
The three black crows covers a lot of ground on the down side, and placing 
a stop at the high of the first day leaves you with a lot of room to accumulate
losses before getting out of the position.
When working on a three black crows trade, try to pick a stop that achieves 
a middle ground between what you can tolerate in terms of losses and where
you really believe the pattern will no longer be valid. You may first consider
the midpoint of the pattern, which can be a prudent level depending on your
ability to take a loss.
The evening star and bearish 
doji star patterns
You didn’t think I could get through a chapter without discussing a doji pat-
tern, did you? I confess my love for the doji several times in this book, and
I’m happy to report that the two patterns described in this section make me
grow only fonder of dojis and the trading opportunities they present.
The evening star and bearish doji star patterns are technically two different
patterns, but they’re so close and the trading psychology behind them so
similar that I lump them together in this section.
Recognizing the evening star and bearish doji star
Both the evening star and bearish doji star patterns start with an up day, fol-
lowed by a gap opening and then a doji for the second day (for the bearish
doji star), or at least a day with very tight trading action in either direction
(for the evening star). The gap between the first and second days attracts
sellers, which keeps the stock from going much higher than the first day’s
open. The third and final day is down, and this final day closes the gap
226
Part III: Making the Most of Complex Patterns 

between the first and second days. After the struggle of the doji or near doji
second day, the bears show their teeth on the third day, and the price action
begins to trend downward. Take a gander at Figure 10-10 for an example of
both the evening star and bearish doji star patterns.
Using the evening star and bearish doji star patterns to make trades
For a sound example of the evening star pattern that pans out in a real-world
trading environment, check out Figure 10-11. The chart in that figure is for a
company called Archer Daniels Midland (ADM), a large distributor of corn.

227
Chapter 10: Trading with Bearish Three-Stick Patterns

As you look at the chart, notice the following:
 The first day is just another up day in a very long uptrend.
 The second day adheres to the price action that occurs on the second
day of a doji or evening star pattern; there’s a small gap up and a tight
trading range between the open and close. It’s not quite a doji, but it’s
certainly enough to qualify as the second day of an evening star pattern.
(If it were a bona fide doji, then the pattern would be a bearish doji star
pattern, but the price action and result would be basically the same.)
 Finally, the third day is a down day, and the pattern is complete.
I like the example in Figure 10-11 because it works quickly and includes a 
nice gap down that probably resulted from some negative news about the
company. Without that news (and the corresponding gap down), the pattern
wouldn’t have formed correctly, and predicting the trend reversal would’ve
been much more difficult.
Failing to indicate lower prices
You can find a case where the evening star pattern fails in Figure 10-12. It’s a
chart of Pep Boys (PBY), which is an auto parts retailer. (I’ve been analyzing
and trading retail stocks for years, so forgive all the examples.) I believe retail
is a good sector for novice traders to focus their efforts because the retail
business is easy to understand, and plenty of public retailers exist for trading.
The evening star pattern in Figure 10-12 shows up during an uptrend, and it
begins as it should, with an up day. The trend in question appears to be
rolling over a bit — an encouraging signal. The second day is also up, with a
Figure 10-12:
The evening

and offers a
failed signal.
228
Part III: Making the Most of Complex Patterns 

small gap created between it and the first day. Note that the open and close
of the second day are closer to the low than the high, which is also encourag-
ing as the pattern develops. The third day is a down day, and it appears that
a downtrend is commencing. Looking good!
But then disaster strikes. The downtrend is short lived, and anyone trying to
short the signal is out of luck. Just a couple of days after the pattern emerges,
the stock starts to trade higher again, and then with a gap opening and a
strong bullish day, the pattern completely fails.
The bearish abandoned baby pattern
The bearish abandoned baby pattern is fairly rare, but when it pops up, it 
can be a very powerful indication that a quick trend change is in the works.
In fact, the abandoned baby pattern examples in this book — both the bullish
examples in Chapter 9 and the ones I present on the following pages — were
some of the most difficult patterns for me to find when I was gathering chart
examples. And it’s worth noting that it was especially hard to find examples
where the pattern failed.
Spotting the bearish abandoned baby pattern
A bearish abandoned baby pattern starts with an up day in an uptrend.
That’s followed by a day that sticks way out by itself on the chart, and that
day is often a doji with a gap opening that isn’t filled in. The third day is down
and includes a gap down opening between the second and third days. You
can see a bearish abandoned baby in Figure 10-13, but please don’t call child
services. It’s only a candlestick, after all.

229
Chapter 10: Trading with Bearish Three-Stick Patterns

Trading on the bearish abandoned baby pattern
I’m fond of the bearish abandoned baby example on the chart in Figure 
10-14 — a chart of the stock for eBay — because the trend is rolling over at
the same time that the pattern shows up. The first day is clearly bullish, and
the uptrend is in place, even though it looks to be rolling over. There’s a gap
between the first and second day, and the open and close of the second day
are in a tight range. That range falls near the low end of the wick, which
serves as a bearish indicator. The third day is up, but only after a very large
gap down opening. Even though the bulls make a run on the third day, the
close is pretty discouraging for them, because it falls near the low of the first
day. After the final day, a sustained downtrend kicks in, and anyone who was
working a clever short would be in for some profits.
Failing to signal lower prices ahead
Now for a failing bearish abandoned baby. It’s a rare occurrence, but 
it does happen. In this case it happens on a chart (in Figure 10-15) of Xilinx,
Inc. (XLNX), a maker of basic semiconductors that go into just about any
electronic product you can think of. XLNX has so many ups and downs that 
I honestly believe you can make a trading career trading only its stock. It’s a
wild ride.
The bearish abandoned baby appears in Figure 10-15 at the beginning of an
uptrend. The pattern has an up first day, followed by a gap opening and a
second day with a fairly narrow range. The third day kicks off with a gap
down opening, and the gaps on either side of the second day mean that the
pattern is in place.

Part III: Making the Most of Complex Patterns 

The signal doesn’t hold up for very long. A long white candle occurs just two
days after the pattern, invalidating the trend reversal signal. Shorts would be
stopped out, and sellers would be disappointed because the price is headed
higher in the short term.
The bearish squeeze alert pattern
Like its bullish counterpart from Chapter 9, I’m fond of the bearish squeeze
alert. This signal either works or doesn’t work quickly, and it appears fre-
quently because the criteria for the pattern are relatively flexible.
Familiarizing yourself with the bearish squeeze alert pattern
The bearish squeeze alert pattern can take on a few different forms, and you
can get a feel for one of them by reviewing Figure 10-16. The first day of the
pattern has to be a down day, and the longer the better. The second and third
days can be up or down, just as long as they’re inside days relative to the pre-
vious day. That means that both days must have a high that’s lower than the
previous high and a low that’s higher that the previous low. In other words,
the body of each candle has to have a range that doesn’t exceed the upper or
lower ends of the body of the previous day’s candlestick.

Chapter 10: Trading with Bearish Three-Stick Patterns

Using the bearish squeeze alert pattern in your trades
After you’ve figured out how to spot the various forms that the bearish
squeeze alert can take, consider how to use it for trading. To get started, take
a look at the chart in Figure 10-17. The chart shows the price action for the
stock of the investment bank JP Morgan Chase (JPM). The stock has close
ties to the market, and the company has operations in just about every facet
of the financial world. JPM is also one of the oldest banks in America, dating
back to 1823. That probably seems like a long time, but remember that 
candlestick charting was around several hundred years before J.P. Morgan
hung out his shingle.

Figure 10-16:

232
Part III: Making the Most of Complex Patterns 

The bearish squeeze alert in this chart occurs at the top of an uptrend that
appears to be fading a little. The first day is an up day, but it doesn’t quite
make a new high for the recent uptrend. The second and third days are both
inside days relative to the first day, and the bears would be happy to see that
both days are also black candles.
When you see black candles for the second and third days of the bearish
squeeze alert pattern, it’s a good sign. The bears are controlling the price
action and offer additional assurance that the prevailing uptrend is about to
roll over.
The bears also appreciate the third day, where the body of the candlestick is
low in the range of the day’s trading action and near the low of the day. If you
spot a similar pattern in a similar environment, get ready to short!
Falling short with the bearish squeeze alert pattern
Like the successful bearish squeeze alert pattern example in Figure 10-17 
(see preceding section), the failure example in Figure 10-18 happens on the
chart of an American icon: Coca-Cola (KO). As a steadily growing consumer
company, Coca-Cola’s shares usually aren’t terribly volatile and, therefore,
may not be the best trading stocks around.
There’s a very solid uptrend in place before the pattern in Figure 10-18
emerges. A long white candle shows up on the first day, followed by two
inside days, both of which are black candles. The pattern is completed, but
the bears have only one day to feel good about their short position before
the pattern is proved invalid. The day after the pattern is a bearish day, and it
really does appear that the trend will turn, but then the bulls show up on the
second day after the pattern and violate any level that can be considered
resistance.

Chapter 10: Trading with Bearish Three-Stick Patterns

Forecasting Downtrend Continuations
Like the patterns described in the preceding pages of this chapter, the bear-
ish three-stick patterns that foreshadow the continuation of a downtrend 
are mirror images of their bullish counterparts, which you can read about in
Chapter 9. The patterns in this section are useful, but more so as confirma-
tions for trades that are already on than as inspiration to initiate a new 
trading position.
You can initiate new positions by using bearish three-stick continuation pat-
terns, but keep in mind that with trending signals there’s already been some
price movement in the direction you’ll be trading (sometimes considerable
price movement). Trends are your friends, but they don’t last forever.
The bearish side-by-side 
black lines pattern
The first of the bearish three-stick trending patterns is the bearish side-
by-side black lines. It’s just plain ugly if you’re a bull or an owner of the secu-
rity with price action that produces the pattern on a chart. The pattern 
is extremely bearish, and if you see it as you’re looking through your charts,
you can feel pretty confident that the prevailing downtrend will keep 
on diving.
Identifying the bearish side-by-side black lines
The bearish side-by-side black lines pattern has a distinctive appearance, and
you can see it firsthand in Figure 10-19.
The days play out like this:
 The first day is a down day that comes on the heels of a downtrend.
 The second day has a gap down and also trades bearishly. Note that 
the gap between the high of the second day and the low of the first day
isn’t filled.
 On the third and final day, the bears have their way again and, like 
the second day, there’s a lasting gap. The bears are definitely in 
charge.
234
Part III: Making the Most of Complex Patterns 

Using the bearish side-by-side black lines pattern
You can harness the bearish power of the bearish side-by-side black lines to
give yourself confidence that a downtrend will continue. For an example, see
Figure 10-20, which includes a chart of one of my favorite companies. I’m a
red-blooded American, and I love my Direct TV (DTV). Even though I love the
company’s products and service, if the right pattern shows up, I’m more than
happy to short the stock and cheer for it to drop. Seems a little odd to be
watching financial television stations on Direct TV and using the information
to profit when the company’s stock heads south, but such is the ironic life of
the trader.
It’s also worth noting that because of the competitive nature of its industry,
DTV has been a great stock to trade for years.
As you can see in Figure 10-20, the stock is already in the early stages of a
downtrend when the bearish side-by-side black lines start to develop. The
first and second days are down, and there’s a substantial gap between them.
The third day is also a bearish day, and so the pattern is complete, and the
downtrend continuation is verified.

Chapter 10: Trading with Bearish Three-Stick Patterns

Failing to confirm a downtrend
Although normally there’s some rebounding shortly after the appearance of a
trending pattern like the side-by-side black lines, that’s not the case with the
pattern in Figure 10-21. You can spot a little bit of bullishness a few days after
the pattern shows up, but there’s no real move into the gap.
You may ask yourself if an ultra bearish pattern like the bearish side-by-side
black lines can ever fail. The answer is a resounding yes. For an illustration,
consider Figure 10-21, which features a chart of CenturyTel (CTL), a provider
of telecommunication services in 25 states. Telecommunication companies
have to deal with constant change and competition, and their stocks are very
volatile and, therefore, great for trading.
The chart in Figure 10-21 is a fun one because two instances of the bearish
side-by-side black lines pattern show up. One appears early in a downtrend,
and the other one pops up a little later. The gaps are small on both patterns,
so not a lot of distance is covered. And each pattern is followed by some
buying, which gives patient traders a better entry level for a short than 
they would’ve found at the completion of the pattern. The entry opportunity
is fine, but the pattern turns out to be a dud. Both patterns fail at the 
same time, and I indicate exactly where and when that failure occurs. The
bearish side-by-side black lines pattern is rare, and when it appears, it’s
almost always legit, so don’t expect to see too many examples similar to 
this one.

Part III: Making the Most of Complex Patterns 

The bearish side-by-side 
white lines pattern
The bearish side-by-side white lines pattern is similar to the pattern in the
previous section, but its second and third days are white candles instead of
black ones. It’s still a bearish pattern, but not quite as bearish.
Spotting the bearish side-by-side white lines pattern
The first day of this pattern is a long black candle in a downtrending market
or stock. The second day kicks off with a gap down opening, and throughout
the course of the day, the bulls push prices higher. The bulls try hard, but
they’re unable to push prices over the low of the first day, and this failure
results in a gap.
The final day of the pattern once again sees a lower opening and a push at
higher prices, and once again, the first day’s low isn’t reached. After two 
days of effort from the bulls, a gap still remains on the chart. You can see
what I mean in Figure 10-22.

Working with the bearish side-by-side white lines
Figure 10-23 offers a look at a successful occurrence of the bearish side-by-
side white lines pattern. The figure is a chart of Monsanto (MON), which is a
supplier of agricultural products to farmers in the United States and
Germany. The stock’s exposure to agricultural markets means that it’s unpre-
dictable and presents some nice trading opportunities as a result.

238
Part III: Making the Most of Complex Patterns 

The bearish side-by-side white lines show up in Figure 10-23 in a downtrend,
and the first day is a down day. The second day opens with a gap down, but
the bulls go to work and the stock trades up a little. However, there’s a fairly
substantial gap left between the first and second day. The third day opens
lower, and once again, the bulls give it a go, but they don’t do much to move
the price into the gap between the first and second days. The result? A 
bearish side-by-side white lines pattern. Then for the next few days the stock
is basically trendless, but soon a patient short is rewarded as the downtrend
starts up again.
Failing to predict a downtrend continuation
In a perfect world the bearish side-by-side white lines pattern would always
provide a safe, comforting signal that a prevailing downtrend will continue
for days, weeks, or even months to come. But this is the real world, and
sometimes these things fail. For a look at how a failure can happen, refer to
Figure 10-24, which represents ownership in Exxon Mobil (XOM). I’m using 
it for an example of a pattern with side-by-side white lines, but it’s better
known for a product that keeps automobiles everywhere running between
the white lines.
As for the chart, the pattern appears with a downtrend in place. The first day
is a long black candle, and it’s followed by a big gap and a bullish second day.
The gap begins to get filled during the bullish third day, and that upward
momentum continues. If you wait for a rock solid failure level before exiting a
short, you have to wait a few weeks, but you probably recognize the strong
uptrend and exit before that painful level is reached.

Chapter 10: Trading with Bearish Three-Stick Patterns

The downside tasuki gap pattern
The downside tasuki gap pattern is the mirror image of a bullish version that
you can read about in Chapter 9. Compared to the other bearish three-stick
trending patterns in this chapter, this pattern is more useful for you if you’re
looking to put on a new trade. This is because of the higher closing price that
occurs when the close of the third day moves into the gap between the first
and second day.
Understanding how to identify the downside tasuki gap pattern
The downside tasuki gap begins with a black candle that appears during a
downtrend. The second day sees a gap opening downward and bearish trad-
ing that result in a lower closing. When the third day rolls around, however,
the bulls show up to push prices higher. They push enough to make the third
day an up day with a closing price that’s higher than the high of the second
day. But don’t count on the bullish behavior to continue. The bears are will-
ing to sell within the gap between the first and second days, and they soon
stop the bulls in their tracks. Want to see an example? Check out Figure 10-25.
Making a trade with the downside tasuki gap pattern
The downside tasuki gap is one of the bearish three-stick trending patterns
that makes for a good candidate when you’re looking to initiate a short 
position.
Figure 10-25:
The
downside
tasuki gap
pattern.
240
Part III: Making the Most of Complex Patterns 

Figure 10-26 is a chart of International Paper (IP). The downside tasuki gap
shows up in a downtrend, and coincidentally enough, the action that takes
place before and including the first day of the downside tasuki gap is another
pattern that I cover in this chapter: the three black crows (see the section,
“The three black crows pattern” earlier in this chapter).
The second day of the downside tasuki gap pattern sees a gap down that isn’t
filled. The third day is an attempt by the bulls to move the price higher, and it
stalls very low in the gap between the first and second day. The pattern is
then followed by a pretty sustained downtrend.
Because the tasuki gap finishes close to the high of the pattern, you may
want to enter on the close of the third day if you’re looking to short. In this
example, that strategy would’ve provided you with an excellent short entry
before the continuation of the downtrend.
Catching the failing trend at the end of the pattern
For my failure example of the downside tasuki gap, I turn to a chart of
Harrah’s Entertainment (HET). Harrah’s operates casinos throughout the
United States, and just like gambling in their establishments, trading their
stock can be quite exciting because it’s an unstable security in an unpre-
dictable industry. The chart appears in Figure 10-27.
Figure 10-27 is a fun example of the downside tasuki gap. If you’ve read
through any of the other examples in this chapter, then you’re probably
expecting an outright pattern failure, but in this case an exit signal shows up
before the pattern fizzles out. An astute user of candlestick patterns may
have caught this signal before the trend changed and taken a profit instead of
being stopped out for a loss.
Figure 10-26:
The
downside
tasuki gap
pattern

chart of IP.
241
Chapter 10: Trading with Bearish Three-Stick Patterns

The first day is a down day at the upper end of the downtrend. This day is 
followed by a gap down that isn’t filled during the day and a down second
day. Finally, on the third day of the pattern, a small rally occurs, and prices
trade inside the gap, but the gap isn’t filled.
Trading after the pattern in Figure 10-27 is interesting, with a few attempted
rallies that get into the gap but don’t trade over the high of the first day.
There’s also a drop to new lows, so the price action is really quite varied.
Then, after the drop, a bullish reversal pattern shows up!
One more thing to look for in Figure 10-27: I highlight an outside up day — 
a bullish reversal pattern — that precedes a change to an uptrend. A wise
candlestick pattern user would use that as an exit signal or even a chance to
put on a long position. On the flip side, a short who isn’t looking out for 
candlestick patterns wouldn’t see the writing on the wall and would probably
be stopped out in the next few days as prices exceed the pattern’s highs.
The downside gap filled pattern
The downside gap filled pattern rounds out my discussion of the bearish
three-stick trending patterns. It’s the most tradeworthy of all the patterns 
in this section because its close is higher than the others. It also calls for
some pretty tight stops, so you’ll know quickly whether the pattern is going
to succeed or fail.
Recognizing the downside gap filled pattern
As you can see in Figure 10-28, the downside gap filled pattern starts off with
a down day in a downtrend. Like the other trending patterns in this chapter,
Figure 10-27:
The
downside
tasuki gap
pattern (kind
of) fails 
on a chart 
of HET.
242
Part III: Making the Most of Complex Patterns 

the second day is a gap down, and it’s bearish. At first the gap between the
first and second day isn’t filled and remains on the chart. On the third and
final day there’s a lower open, but then the bulls push the price higher over
the course of the day. The gap between the first and second day is then filled.
However, at some point the bears decide it’s time to take over again and the
rise in prices stops, usually in the lower half of the first day’s trading range.
The downtrend is still in place.
Trading the downside gap filled pattern
To give you an idea of how you can trade the downside gap filled pattern, 
I provide the example in Figure 10-29. It’s a chart of Ingersoll Rand (IR), a
manufacturer of various commercial and consumer machinery goods. The
company is tied to the overall economy, so the stock can experience periods
of volatility that present ample trading opportunities.
The downside gap filled pattern appears at the upper end of the downtrend,
beginning with a black candle for the first day. There’s a gap down opening
for the second day, and the gap isn’t filled as the day progresses bearishly.
The third day completes the pattern with an up day that fills in the gap, and
the downtrend continues after that.
If you shorted using this pattern, you’d be pleased to see some bearish action
that continues for a while after the pattern is completed. However, after a few
weeks, a bullish reversal pattern emerges. There’s a doji followed by an up
day in a downtrend, which is usually an indication that prices have reached a
bottom. That would mean that it’s time to exit your short position and walk
away with your profits.

Chapter 10: Trading with Bearish Three-Stick Patterns

Failing to signal a continuing downtrend
I hate to end the chapter on a down note, but I do feel obligated to present
you with a failing example of the downside gap filled pattern. For that I turn
to Figure 10-30, a chart of DuPont (DD).
The pattern emerges in a downtrend, with a black candle that’s followed by a
gap down, which is eventually filled on the third day. All is as it should be in
terms of pattern formation, but if you look closely, you can see an indication
that the pattern may not hold up for too long. The strength of the downtrend
appears to be moderating, and because the trend has been in place for a long
time, it may lead you to believe that a reversal is on deck. These indications
prove to be true when the trend turns upward over the course of the next
couple of weeks. The high of the pattern is violated, rendering it null, void,
and more than a little annoying.

traders have proven that to be a profitable route. But that shouldn’t make
you think twice about combining candlesticks with other technical indicators.
You can take advantage of a wide range of indicators to confirm the conclusions
you draw from your candlestick charts, and your results are often more reliable
and profitable. You may very well find that you can’t live by candlesticks alone!
Many candlestick patterns — from single sticks to complex multiple-stick
formations — depend on the market context in which they appear. For exam-
ple, a bullish signal in a bearish market sparks skepticism and may even be
ignored. But what constitutes a bull or bear market? (As I write this, I have a
financial TV show on in the background and two market professionals are vig-
orously debating whether we’re in a bull or bear market. If these market pros
can’t agree on the nature of the market, how are individuals supposed to
figure it out?) It’s simple: use technical analysis! More specifically, use indica-
tors that attempt to define the market trend.
Traders use many different types of technical indicators to enhance and com-
plement their trading styles. Traders are always trying to come up with the
perfect combination of indicators and signals. (I confess to walking around
with old business cards and a pen so I can jot down trading ideas when they
pop in my head.) You never know when inspiration will strike! That brilliant

new way to incorporate candlestick charting in a new trading scheme may
reveal itself at any moment.
Technical indicators share one of a couple of goals. The first is to define the
current trend, whether up, down, or even sideways (more on that later). To
quote a popular trading saying, “The trend is your friend.” The other indica-
tors try to identify market extremes or reversals. That information allows a
trader to “fade the market,” or go against the trend in hopes that the trend
will soon fade out and reverse. There are heated arguments over whether
trading with the trend or trying to profit from reversals is the key to success-
ful trading, and as long as traders are still making a living (and losing their
shirts) using both styles, the debate will continue.
There are more complex indicators than you can shake a (candle)stick at. (In
fact, Technical Analysis For Dummies, by Barbara Rockefeller [Wiley] covers
them extensively.) In this chapter, I clue you in on a few tried-and-true indica-
tors that you can use to determine the trend of the market and make your
candlestick-based decisions even more reliable. These indicators include
trendlines, moving averages, relative strength index (RSI), stochastics, and
Bollinger bands.
Using Trendlines
Trendlines can be the most basic of all technical indicators. A trendline is
exactly what it sounds like: a line on a chart that shows the general direction
a stock is trending. If a stock is moving up in price, its trendline slopes
upward from left to right. If a stock is trending down in price, its trendline
slopes downward from left to right.
In this section, you discover how to draw a trendline on a chart. Also, some
hints on how to determine the direction (up or down) are given. Finally there’s
a quick overview of how machines (a computer) can draw trendlines for you.
Drawing trendlines
Trendlines seem pretty straightforward, but drawing a trendline can be
tricky. Based on how you think a stock is performing, you draw a line of sup-
port (in a bullish case) or a line of resistance (in a bearish case).
You can construct a trendline with nothing more than a printed out chart, a
ruler, and a pencil. If you can’t find a ruler, just close this book and use the
spine. Anything that allows you to draw a straight line between two points will
do. To draw a trendline, simply draw a line that connects two or more low
price points (for an upward trending line) or two or more high price points (for
a downward trending line). Figure 11-1 shows a prime example of a trendline.

Part IV: Combining Patterns and Indicators 

Don’t let the ease of trendline construction fool you into thinking that trend-
lines are simple or cut-and-dried. In fact, it’s difficult to refer to a trendline on
a chart as a technical indicator because the drawing of the line is such a sub-
jective task. Much like the market experts debating on TV, it’s very likely that
two traders can come up with completely different lines when asked to draw
what they consider the most significant trendline on a chart. If a trader hap-
pens to be biased against a certain stock for some reason, she may be more
inclined to look at a chart and find a downtrend.
Despite all the subjectivity involved with drawling trendlines, some very suc-
cessful traders rely heavily on them for their buy and sell decisions. When I
began my career as a runner in the cattle trading pits 15 years ago, a very
successful trader I knew based decisions on nothing more than daily charts
and trendlines that he’d drawn during his train ride every morning. I’ve heard
that he’s still using the same method today.
Considering trendline direction
Although different trendlines drawn on the same chart may differ a bit, you’ll
usually find that at least the direction of the trendlines are the same. Trendlines
can trend up, down, or not at all. For simplicity’s sake, Figure 11-1 has an obvi-
ous up (bullish) trend. (I say it’s obvious, but I wonder how many of my col-
leagues will insist I’m wrong!) After you determine that a trend is bullish, you
may consider it with a bullish candlestick pattern and look to buy. On the other
hand, if you witness a bearish candlestick pattern, you may be inclined to
ignore it, or at least to take caution before implementing a sell signal.

Chapter 11: Using Technical Indicators to Complement Your Candlestick Charts

Taking trendline direction into consideration helps you determine the status
of the market. Understanding the market helps you use the most appropriate
candlestick pattern — one that makes your trading decisions more effective
and profitable. Trendlines can be subjective, but there’s no easier or quicker
way to define a trend.
Taking advantage of automated trendlines
You can take some of the subjectivity out of trendline drawing by using a soft-
ware package that constructs trendlines for you. All you have to do is choose
your preferred time frame, and the software does the rest. Even Microsoft
Excel includes this option in its charting function. (In Chapter 4, I explore
how to use Excel for charting, but for now, I point out the way Excel deter-
mines a trendline for the data presented.)
Figure 11-2 displays the same data as Figure 11-1, but instead of the hand-
drawn approach, this trendline was generated by Excel. The placement of the
line is a bit different than in Figure 11-1, but the trend is still clearly positive.
Using software cuts down on the subjective nature of trendlines, but it doesn’t
completely remove subjectivity. There’s still a subjective component to
software-drawn trendlines. The user still determines the time frame for the
trendline, which can have a definite impact on the type of line that’s gener-
ated. As with any computer program that involves user input, the data you
get out is only as good as what you put in.

Utilizing Moving Averages
When it comes to technical analysis, it doesn’t get much easier than drawing
a trendline. But what if you’re in need of a slightly more complex indicator?
The next step up from drawing trendlines is calculating moving averages. Put
simply, a moving average is the average of the closing prices of a stock over a
certain period of time. You can compare a closing price with a moving aver-
age to help you determine a trend.
Like most technical indicators, there are several different types of moving
averages, and I explain a few in this section. First, though, it’s important that
you understand how to make good choices about the time frames you use
when calculating your moving averages.
Selecting appropriate moving
average periods
The time frames of your moving averages are determined by the number of
closing prices you include. To decide on that number, consider the types of
trading decisions you make based on your moving average. Pick a time frame
that’s appropriate for the amount of time you intend to have a trade on. For a
trade that’s to be held for only a day or two, a five- to ten-day moving average
will suffice.
For instance, the five-day example in Figure 11-3 is very short-term and is
most useful for traders who trade for a day or two, or even for less than a
day. I trade a system based on a moving average that uses data from only the
two previous days’ closing prices. The holding period for this system is just
half a day, so the short moving average makes perfect sense.
The range of moving averages I’ve seen used on charts varies from 2 days to
200. A 200-day moving average is very long-term, but in many circles it’s con-
sidered very significant when determining a stock’s long-term trend. In fact,
the common definition of a long-term bull or bear market can be whether an
index is trading above (bull) or below (bear) its 200-day moving average.
Using simple moving averages
The most basic type of moving average is the simple moving average. It’s also
the easiest to calculate and the most common — so common, in fact, that the
word “simple” is often left off when a simple moving average is displayed on a
253
Chapter 11: Using Technical Indicators to Complement Your Candlestick Charts

chart. Look at Figure 11-4, where a five-day simple moving average is calcu-
lated by using the closing prices from five previous days. It can’t be much
easier: The five closing prices are added up and divided by five. If you keep
the number of closing prices in your simple moving averages low, you can
easily work them out with a calculator.
The five-day simple moving average in Figure 11-4 comes out at 114.20, and
the closing price on the fifth day is 113.87. Some technical analysts would
say that indicates a downtrend, because the close on the final day is lower
than the moving average. That can be very useful information if you’re work-
ing on a short-term trade.

Part IV: Combining Patterns and Indicators 

But if you’ve got a longer term trade in mind, it wouldn’t make much sense to
fret over the fact that a closing price dipped below a five-day moving average.
There just aren’t enough data points (closing prices, in this case) involved —
a relatively minor change in a closing price can have a sizable impact on the
average. A moving average calculated over a longer period of time (with
many more closing prices) — say, 100 days or more — is less likely to reveal
any closing prices that cross the average.
The longer your time horizon for a trade (or even an investment), the longer
the moving average you need.
Figures 11-5a and 11-5b contain the same pricing data, but Figure 11-5a has a
5-day moving average, while Figure 11-5b uses a 20-day moving average.
Notice the extreme differences in trends between the two charts.
Using other types of moving averages:
What have you done for me lately?
Two fairly common deviations on the simple moving average are the weighted
moving average and the exponential moving average. These types of moving
averages are calculated in different ways, but they both have the same goal:
to place more emphasis on recent prices.
Why would a trader want to explore more complex moving averages? Well,
the major advantage one of these more complicated moving averages has
over the simple moving average is that it’s better at revealing a change in
trend more quickly. Being able to detect trend changes faster helps to make
you a more agile trader. Also, traders (especially short-term traders), have
very short memories. Ask me what the market did yesterday, and I’m pretty
sure I can give you a quick answer. Ask me what it did two Fridays ago, and I
would be quickly pulling up a chart (a candlestick chart, of course!) to get
you an answer. Because a short-term trader places more emphasis on more
recent price action, using a charting method that does the same typically
works better for shorter term styles of trading. Weighted and exponential
moving averages both emphasize recent price action, and the only substan-
tial difference between the two is the method of calculation.
If you were to rank the three most commonly used types of moving averages —
simple, weighted, and exponential — according to their emphasis on recent
price action, exponential moving averages, which place a lot of emphasis on
recent prices, would top the list. Weighted moving averages would be a close
second and simple moving averages a distant last.

Part IV: Combining Patterns and Indicators 

Calculating a weighted moving average
To calculate a weighted moving average, multiply the most recent stock price
by the total number of prices in your chosen time frame. Then multiply the
second most recent stock price by the total number of prices minus one, and —
using the same method — work your way back to the first price in your time
frame.
For Figure 11-6, I’ve taken the same five-day data used for the simple moving
average in Figure 11-4 and calculated a weighted moving average. Note: For
Day 5, the weighted close is equal to 5 × 113.87 or 569.35, while the weighted
close for Day 1 is simply the closing price × 1 (114.70). To determine the
weighted moving average, the weighted closing prices are added up and
divided by the sum of the weights. In this case, that number is
[(1 × Day 1 closing price) + (2 × Day 2 closing price) + (3 × Day 3 closing
price) + (4 × Day 4 closing price) + (5 × Day 5 closing price)] ÷ 15.
Refer to Figure 11-4 and Figure 11-6 for the difference between the simple
moving average and the weighted moving average. There’s a pretty signifi-
cant difference! The lower recent prices mean that the weighted moving aver-
age is quite a bit lower.
Calculating an exponential moving average
You can calculate an exponential moving average in a handful of different
ways, and I suggest that you use . . . none of them. The math involved in the
calculations is a bit complex, and for your purposes, I recommend leaving the
hard work to a charting package. (See Chapter 4 for more info on popular
charting software.)

Combining two moving averages
Comparing closing prices with moving averages is a great way to use moving
averages to determine a trend, but it’s not the only way. You can also com-
bine and compare two moving averages to define the current trend. For
example, you may calculate both a 5- and 20-day moving average for a stock,
and then compare them to spot a trend. To do so, work your way though the
following steps:
1. Calculate the two moving averages, using the process described ear-
lier in this chapter.
2. Determine which of your two moving averages is fast, and which is
slow.
The fast moving average is always the one with the fewest number of
data points (closing prices). It’s labeled “fast” because its small number
of data points makes it prone to change much more quickly (completely
different than the reasons someone gets labeled “fast” in high school).
The slow moving average is slower to change because of its heftier
number of data points.
3. Compare your moving averages to spot a trend.
If the fast moving average is higher than the slow moving average, that
indicates an uptrend. The logic is exactly the same as comparing a clos-
ing price to a moving average to determine trend, but the fast moving
average takes the place of the closing price.
If you notice this type of trend, be more inclined to follow a bullish
candlestick pattern and consider buying. If the fast moving average is
lower than the slow moving average, that indicates a downtrend. If that’s
what you see, you should follow a bearish candlestick pattern and look
to sell.
Take a look at Figure 11-7, which contains the same data as the previous
charts in this chapter, but overlays both a 5- and 20-day moving average. The
5-day moving average is represented by the solid line, while a dashed line is
used for the 20-day moving average. You can clearly see the higher volatility
of the 5-day moving average compared to the 20-day. And you can also see
that the chart indicates an uptrend!
Experts often use a combination of the 5- and 200-day moving averages to
define a long-term bull or bear market. These choices may seem somewhat
arbitrary, but they’ve been cemented as rules of thumb in the market.
Combining three moving averages
Two moving averages can be pretty useful company, but is three a crowd?
Who really needs to use three moving averages? Believe it or not, some very
258
Part IV: Combining Patterns and Indicators 

successful longer term trading systems make comparisons using three
moving averages. The technique is useful because it allows the market to be
defined as having no trend, as opposed to either an up or downtrend.
You may be thinking, “No trend? The market and stock prices change daily!
There has to be a trend!” But some markets (and individual stocks in particu-
lar) have long droughts without an up or downtrend. Identifying a market
without a trend can be extremely helpful, as it’s pretty difficult to make
money trading when there isn’t much price movement. With that in mind,
taking a look at combining three moving averages is certainly worth the time.
Comparisons using three moving averages are made by identifying each aver-
age as either fast, medium, or slow. Just like comparisons with two moving
averages, the one considered “fast” has the lowest number of data points.
The slow moving average has the most data points, and the medium one is
somewhere in the middle. To help you visualize, see Figure 11-8, which con-
tains a 5- and 20-day moving average but also includes an additional 10-day
moving average.
In Figure 11-8, the averages are represented by different lines:
 The 5-day moving average is represented by the solid line.
 The line with long dashes is the 10-day moving average.
 The 20-day moving average is the line with the short dashes.
Figure 11-7:
A chart with
both a 5-day
and 20-day

259
Chapter 11: Using Technical Indicators to Complement Your Candlestick Charts

With any chart containing three moving averages, you can pick out an
uptrend when the fast moving average is higher than the medium one, and
the medium one is higher than the slow one. You can see an uptrend on the
right side of this chart, where all three moving averages are in order and
trending together.
You can identify a downtrend when the fast moving average is lower than the
medium one, and the medium one is lower than the slow one. If the fast-,
medium-, and slow-moving averages aren’t lined up either fast to slow or vice
versa, you can safely say that the market has no trend.
Knowing the type of market you’re dealing with is key to using many candle-
stick patterns correctly, so you may need to use three moving averages.
That’s especially true for longer term trading. The more certain you can be
about a trend, the more likely you are to properly identify and trade effec-
tively on a bullish or bearish candlestick pattern.
Examining the Relative Strength Index
My personal favorite indicator is the relative strength index (RSI). The RSI
compares the strength of a stock’s up days against the strength of its down
days, and RSI proponents believe that as a result, the RSI can cut through
erratic changes and really confirm price movement. This index is considered
a leading indicator because you can usually count on the direction of a secu-
rity’s RSI to change ahead of its price action.

Part IV: Combining Patterns and Indicators 

The RSI is classified as a momentum oscillator. The “momentum” in that term
comes from the fact that as a security is in an up or downtrend, the RSI’s
trend should correspond. And it’s an “oscillator” because RSIs fluctuate
between 0 and 100 percent.
Another attractive feature of RSIs is they include levels that indicate when a
security is considered overbought or oversold. When the security reaches
one of these levels, a savvy trader should be on his toes, waiting for a corre-
sponding change in the trend of the RSI, or even better, some sort of revealing
bullish or bearish candlestick pattern that lets him know it’s time to buy or sell.
Calculating the RSI
Calculating an RSI is fairly complex, even when using a spreadsheet. Instead
of spending several pages going through the steps for calculating an RSI, I
give you a brief overview of the formulas that drive it:
1. Add up the price change on up days and the price change on down
days for the number of periods (usually 14) in your look-back range.
2. Take those individual sums and divide them by 14.
3. Then calculate the relative strength (not the relative strength index)
by dividing the up day average by the down day average.
RS = Average up days ÷ Average down days
The RSI takes the up and down days and plugs that data into a fairly complex
formula, resulting in a reading between 0 and 100. The following equation
explains the math behind the RSI:
RSI = 100 – (100 ÷ Relative Strength)
261
Chapter 11: Using Technical Indicators to Complement Your Candlestick Charts
The origin of overbought and oversold levels
You may be wondering how the overbought and
oversold levels were established. Those bench-
marks came from the mind of renowned techni-
cal analyst J. Welles Wilder, who introduced the
RSI in his 1978 book New Concepts in Technical
Trading Systems. In the book, Wilder recom-
mends using 30 as an oversold level (an attrac-
tive area to buy) and 70 as an overbought level
(an area to exit or sell short). Look at Figure 11-9.
The oversold level of 30 and overbought level of
70 are indicated with lines along the bottom of
the chart to allow you to see when the level
penetrates either of these significant levels. He
also suggests using 14 as the standard number
of price periods for calculating RSIs, which is
the input used for the chart in Figure 11-9.

Reading an RSI chart
As with many technical indicators, RSIs are much easier to digest in chart
form. In Figure 11-9, the lower chart is a daily six-month long chart on Intel,
(symbol INTC). The top section of the chart is a basic candlestick chart
depicting the price action in Intel stock from July to December 2007.
Numerous bullish and bearish candlestick formations are charted on this
chart, but for now, just focus on the RSI component.
In the bottom quarter of the chart in Figure 11-9, there’s a slow-moving line
that depicts the RSI. This line is normally how an oscillator is depicted on a
chart. Unlike a moving average, which is imposed on top of a chart’s price
component, the RSI (or any other similar indicator) appears below the price
component. Note how the RSI seems to flow along and mirror the movements
of the closing prices. However, at times the RSI either flattens while the price
continues to move or even moves in the opposite direction. This change is
called a divergence.
Divergences are the key to using the RSI, and a divergence combined with a
corresponding candlestick pattern that matches the direction of the diver-
gence can provide you with a profitable trade signal.
But the RSI’s usefulness doesn’t end with its role as a momentum indicator.
RSIs may also be used as signals that reveal when the price of a security has
reached a level that’s too high or too low for the near term, or a level where a
reversal of trend is more likely.

The simplicity may sound too good to be true, and of course, it is. Using the
RSI by strictly buying when it hits 30 or selling when it hits 70 is a disastrous
strategy. It does make for a good rule of thumb, however, when you consider
it alongside a signal from a candlestick pattern or a divergent move in the RSI
relative to the price chart.
Combining a divergent RSI with a candlestick pattern is a smart move, and
adding the overbought or oversold levels into the equation is even smarter,
and can provide you with much more reliable buy and sell signals. The
strength of the RSI as both a momentum and oscillating signal is why it’s one
of my personal favorite indicators.
Cashing In on Stochastics
Another useful indicator with an extremely clumsy name is the stochastic oscil-
lator. This momentum indicator considers the current closing price of a secu-
rity in relation to a high-low range of prices over a set number of look-back
periods. This oscillator can be very useful when used in tandem with your
candlestick charts. And in addition to its usefulness as an indicator of momen-
tum, the stochastic oscillator may also be used as an overbought or oversold
indicator when readings are at extreme levels: 30 percent for oversold and 70
percent for overbought (see the section on RSI earlier in this chapter).
Grasping the math behind
the stochastic oscillator
George Lane developed the stochastic oscillator in the late 1950s. The math
behind it is pretty remarkable for an indicator some 50 years old. There are
actually two readings for a stochastic oscillator that are combined on a chart.
They’re referred to as the slow (%D) and the fast (%K) stochastics. The slow
one is generally a moving average of the fast one.
The formulas for the slow and fast stochastic oscillators are as follows:
 Fast Stochastic:
%K = 100 × (Recent Close – Lowest Low(n) ÷ Highest High(n) –
Lowest Low(n))
N = number of periods used in calculation
 Slow Stochastic:
%D = 3-period moving average of %K
263
Chapter 11: Using Technical Indicators to Complement Your Candlestick Charts

Interpreting the stochastic oscillator
Luckily, most (if not all) charting software calculates the stochastic oscillator
for you, so you don’t need to memorize or even fully understand the formulas
behind it (whew!). You really just need to know how to interpret the lines on
a chart. For a depiction of how the stochastic oscillator shows up on a chart,
refer to Figure 11-10. This is a chart of the same INTC data in Figure 11-9, but
the RSI has been removed, and a stochastic indicator has been inserted.
When interpreting the stochastic oscillator, you use methods similar to those
used in interpreting the RSI and moving averages (see respective sections
earlier in this chapter).
Using stochastic oscillators as you would two moving averages
Knowing how to use two moving averages is helpful when interpreting sto-
chastic oscillators. For defining a trend, if both the fast (%K) and slow (%D)
stochastics are trending higher, and the fast line is higher than the slow line,
you’re looking at an uptrend. It’s like when you’re using two moving averages,
and the moving average with the shorter look-back period is up above the
moving average with the longer look-back period: The trend is considered up.
Another parallel to using two moving averages is that a change in trend may
be signaled when the fast stochastic changes from being over or under the
slower stochastic. Keep an eye out for those important changes.
The rule on this is if the fast stochastic is above the slow one, an uptrend is
in place; if the fast one is under the slow one, a downtrend is in place. When
they cross, there’s a trend change! When they are in overbought territory and
the fast one crosses under the slow one, that may be considered a good sell-
ing opportunity. Conversely, when they are in oversold territory and the fast
one crosses over the slow one, it’s a good buying opportunity.
Using stochastic oscillators as you would the RSI
You can use the stochastic oscillator as an overbought or oversold indicator,
just as you use the RSI (covered in the section, “Examining the Relative
Strength Index”). Like the RSI, both the fast and slow stochastic levels oscil-
late between 0 and 100 percent. Below 30 is considered oversold (a buying
level), and above 70 is considered overbought (sell level).
The benefit of having a slow and fast stochastic is that when the overbought
or oversold levels are reached and a corresponding crossover of the fast and
slow stochastic occurs, you can enjoy a much more reliable signal. For exam-
ple, if both of the stochastics are in overbought territory, and you see the
slow stochastic move from over to under the fast one, that’s considered a sell
signal. The reverse is also true: If both stochastics are oversold, and the slow
one moves from under to over the fast one, that makes for a nice buy signal.
264
Part IV: Combining Patterns and Indicators 

Buddying up with Bollinger Bands
The idea behind Bollinger bands is that when a price for a security gets too
high above or below a moving average, that security may be considered over-
bought or oversold. Bollinger bands look just like moving averages on a price
chart (see “Utilizing Moving Averages,” earlier in the chapter), but they’re
positioned a certain distance above and below the real moving average on a
chart. The bands mark the areas where a security may be considered over-
bought or oversold.
Bollinger bands received their name from the renowned technical analyst
John Bollinger.
Creating Bollinger bands
You may do well to leave the necessary calculations of Bollinger bands to a
charting package, but it starts out simple enough with the calculation of a
simple moving average of a price series. (Find that process in this chapter’s
“Using simple moving averages” section.) Bollinger suggests a 20-day moving
average, and many charting software programs use that as the default, so
that’s always a good place to start.
After calculating the 20-day moving average, things get a bit trickier. The
bands that run above and below the moving average are based on a statisti-
cal measure known as standard deviation. The bands are placed a certain
number of standard deviations higher and lower than the moving average.

Chapter 11: Using Technical Indicators to Complement Your Candlestick Charts

Without getting into too much detail, the distance of the bands from the
moving average is determined by the amount of volatility in the market. The
more the market is moving around, the wider the bands are spread.
As the standard deviation rises and falls with the level of market volatility,
the overbought and oversold levels tend to adjust for the market environ-
ment. An excellent example of a Bollinger band chart can be seen in Figure
11-11. This is the same data used in the previous two figures, but now the
only indicators on the chart are the Bollinger bands.
Using the bands
Bollinger bands make for great overbought or oversold indicators. Broadly
speaking, when the price of a security is higher than the upper Bollinger
band on a chart, you’re in a sell area, and when the price is lower than the
lower Bollinger band, you’re in buy territory. As you can see in Figure 11-11,
there are plenty of buy and sell opportunities using these bands. But not
every one of those opportunities is worth acting on immediately, so combin-
ing them with your handy candlestick charts can be an ideal way to minimize
risk and separate the great signals from the mediocre ones.

Chapter 12
Buy Indicators and Bullish
Reversal Candlestick Patterns
In This Chapter
 Making successful long trades by combining the relative strength index and
candlesticks
 Using stochastic indicators and candlestick patterns for profitable long trading
T
his chapter clues you in on the ways in which you can begin combining
your trading tools to make your trades even more efficient and profitable.
More specifically, the strategies I describe in the next few pages help you
understand how you can use two buy indicators (the relative strength index —
RSI — and stochastics) in tandem with bullish trend reversal candlestick pat-
terns to pick the best times and situations for entering and exiting long trades.
I’ve found the two technical indicators I discuss in this chapter to be reliable
and relatively easy to combine with candlestick patterns. However, please
don’t think for a second that the RSI and stochastic indicators are the only
ones that work well with candlesticks. There are several others, and I
strongly encourage you to research those indicators and find some that work
best with your personal trading style.
Buying with the RSI and Bullish
Reversal Candlestick Patterns
The relative strength index (RSI) is a fairly reliable indicator that can tell you
whether a stock or market is overbought or oversold. The RSI fluctuates
between 0 and 100, although it hardly ever reaches either of those levels. You
can choose the levels between 0 and 100 that you think indicate that a stock
is overbought or oversold, but for the sake of analysis in this chapter, I use 30
as my oversold level and 70 as my overbought level. Therefore, RSI readings
under 30 tell you that a bottom could be coming soon and that you should be
ready to buy, and readings over 70 should lead you to consider putting on a

short or selling a long. (For more of the nitty gritty details of the RSI, check
out Chapter 11.)
The RSI has two potential uses when you’re working on candlestick analysis:
 You can combine the information from an RSI with reversal patterns to
further confirm that a reversal is imminent, and it’s time to take a long
position.
 You can also use the RSI to help you select your exit levels, whether they
are stops to prevent losses or exits that allow you to walk away with a
tidy profit.
Using the RSI to help pick
a long entry point
In this section, Figure 12-1 provides a solid example of the type of situation
that calls for using the RSI in combination with a bullish reversal pattern.
This chart is from Applied Materials (AMAT), which is a very large technol-
ogy company that creates machinery used to manufacture semiconductors.
The free-wheeling, rock ’n’ rollin’, throw-caution-to-the-wind experts in this
industry refer to it as the semiconductor equipment industry.
A three inside up reversal pattern appears after a couple of bearish days,
during a short-lived downtrend. (Check out Chapter 9 for more on the three
inside up pattern.) The RSI helps confirm that the candlestick pattern is
sound because the RSI closes under 30 on the pattern’s first day. That means
that the stock is oversold if the standard oversold level 30 is being used, and
bullish buyers will soon be on the scene to drive up the price of the stock.
Figure 12-1:

268
Part IV: Combining Patterns and Indicators 

The last two days of a three inside up pattern are bullish days. Bullish behav-
ior generally means that the RSI is moving out of the oversold level. Consider
RSI levels over the course of a pattern, not just on one of the pattern’s days.
Bullish reversal patterns like the three inside up usually end with bullish
moves, so it would be pretty rare to find an RSI reading under 30 (or what-
ever level you consider oversold), at the end of a pattern.
It’s also worth mentioning that some traders use the RSI to buy when it goes
below the oversold level and then moves back above this level. That move is
more important to them than the simple act of the RSI dipping below the
oversold level, and they use it as confirmation that the trend has reversed.
On the AMAT chart in Figure 12-1, the trend definitely reverses on the three
inside up pattern combined with an RSI reading under 30. The result is an
uptrend that lasts for a few weeks but never quite reaches the overbought
level. If you watch a stock and see a bullish trend reversal candlestick pattern
that coincides with an oversold reading on the stock’s RSI, buy and look for
an uptrend to dominate the chart soon.
I offer one more example of how you can use the RSI in combination with a
bullish reversal pattern in Figure 12-2. This figure features a chart of the stock
for Amazon (AMZN). The RSI on the chart in Figure 12-2 spends some time
trading around the oversold level of 30, dipping below and then rising above
that level on two different occasions. What’s the difference between these
two instances? The second (and successful) move was accompanied by a
bullish reversal pattern.

269
Chapter 12: Buy Indicators and Bullish Reversal Candlestick Patterns

A bullish three outside up pattern (refer to Chapter 9 for details) appears on
this chart at a time when the RSI closes under 30 and then rises over the
oversold level. The resulting move is an uptrend that lasts a couple of weeks
and then rolls over. If you spot those developments and quickly establish a
long position, ride the uptrend for a while and then trade out when things
start heading south. The result is a nice quick profit. In fact, from the bottom
of the pattern to the spot where the stock rolls over is a move of 100 percent,
or a double-your-money move from below 20 to just about 40. All that in
about four weeks! You can see how combining candlestick patterns with RSI
signals can tip you off to the best spots to enter a long position.
Using the RSI to help pick long exits
An additional benefit to using technical indicators for determining entry points
is that they may also help you figure out when it’s time to exit a position. When
used properly for entries, an indicator tells you when to buy an oversold secu-
rity or sell short when a security’s price reaches an overbought level. You can
take advantage of that same concept when deciding when to exit trades.
For example, suppose you took a long position on a stock when you saw that
its RSI was oversold, and as a result you’re sitting on what could turn out to
be a handsome profit. But then the RSI changes course, and soon it’s into the
overbought level. What should you do? You may have a trading rule in place
that tells you that it’s time to exit the trade without considering other
options. But you may also take a slightly more liberal tack and simply keep a
close eye out for trend breaks or reversal patterns. You can play out the situ-
ation in several ways, and if you can combine the technical indicator with
your knowledge of candlestick patterns, you stand a much better chance of
exiting the trade at the most opportune moment.
For short-term long trades involving the RSI, I begin to look for an exit point
when the RSI trades over 50. Until that level is reached, I stick to the stop
level prescribed by the candlestick pattern I used to enter the trade. After the
RSI reaches 50, I start to watch for a reversal or trend break. You may think
that I’m potentially leaving too much profit on the table, but just because a
stock has traded higher and the RSI is above 50 doesn’t mean I’m out. It just
means I’m more cautious if I think things are going to turn. Consider a similar
strategy for yourself.
For an idea of how you can combine candlestick patterns with the RSI to figure
out when to enter and exit a trade, look at Figure 12-3 — a chart of the oil and
gas exploration company Devon Energy (DVN). As you can see, the stock
trades off pretty hard, and the RSI is well under 30. Then around the time that
the RSI trades back up to about 50, a bullish reversal pattern appears. It’s the
three outside up pattern, and you can read all about it in Chapter 9.
270
Part IV: Combining Patterns and Indicators 

If I were trading the scenario you see in Figure 12-3, I’d place a stop loss order
based on the low of the candlestick pattern and keep that stop in place until
the RSI crosses above 50. That way I’d still be in the trade even if a small pull-
back occurred. After the RSI reached 50, I’d simply keep an eye on the trend.
The trend eventually heads higher with a clearly defined trend break, and
when that trend break occurs, I’d execute a sell order and pocket a nice
profit. I know that it looks quite easy in hindsight, but it really is a prime
example of how you can use the RSI in conjunction with candlestick patterns,
particularly bullish reversal patterns.
Still not convinced? I offer another example in Figure 12-4. That figure fea-
tures a chart of Texas Instruments, which is a technology and semiconductor
company that trades under the symbol TXN. You can see that the ideal entry
point is when the RSI has been under 30, and then a three outside up pattern
appears which indicates that the trend is headed upward, and you need to
buy and take on a long position.
After a promising start, the stock stalls out and things look a bit disappoint-
ing. The trading is essentially trendless for a couple of weeks. The support
level isn’t broken, and an uptrend doesn’t develop. If you stay patient,
though, eventually you see the stock make a small run. The RSI gets back
up to 50, and then on the following day, a hanging man pattern appears.
(Flip back to Chapter 6 for more on the hanging man.) That’s a reversal
signal, which indicates that the trend is heading southward, and the time
has come to sell the stock, enjoy a small profit, and move on to the next
trade.

Chapter 12: Buy Indicators and Bullish Reversal Candlestick Patterns

Buying with the Stochastic Indicator and
a Bullish Reversal Candlestick Pattern
The stochastic indicator is another very useful indicator for detecting over-
bought or oversold security conditions. It has two components: the slow and
the fast stochastic. When the fast is under the slow, there’s a downtrend in
place, and when the fast is higher than the slow, there’s an uptrend. The
slow and fast stochastic indicators oscillate between 0 and 100 and have
fairly complex look back periods, much like the RSI. (See “Buying with the
RSI and Bullish Reversal Candlestick Patterns” earlier in this chapter for
more info on RSI.)
For simplicity’s sake I use the 14-period look back, which is a standard level
in charting packages. The standard oversold level for a stochastic indicator is
20, and the standard overbought level is 80. For a detailed explanation of the
nuts and bolts of the stochastic indicator, flip back to Chapter 11.
You can use the trend reversal signals that stochastic indicators provide in
combination with candlestick patterns to pick outstanding entry points for
your trades. And you can also utilize stochastic indicators to select exit
points — just keep an eye out for when the slow and fast stochastics cross.
Allow me to elaborate in the following sections.

Part IV: Combining Patterns and Indicators 

Using the stochastic indicator
to help pick a long entry point
You can use the stochastic indicator to determine a good time to buy a stock
if you watch for instances where the slow and fast levels both trade below
the oversold level of 20, and then the fast stochastic crosses over or goes
higher than the slow stochastic. I’ve always felt confident in the stochastic
indicator because of that feature; even though the levels are technically over-
sold, it’s not truly a buy signal until the trend starts to move just a little bit
higher. And it’s even more comforting when you combine it with a bullish
reversal candlestick pattern. You can see what I mean in Figure 12-5.
Figure 12-5 is a chart of Johnson Controls (JCI), a manufacturer of large sys-
tems and parts for cars and buildings. The company is very much tied to the
overall economy, and I like trading it for that reason.
The chart begins with a downtrend. The slow and fast stochastic levels trade
below the oversold level of 20. Then a three outside up reversal pattern
appears on the chart, when the stochastic levels are still well under the 20
level. But the second two days of this pattern are very bullish, and the slow
and fast stochastic readings start to move higher. The icing on the cake is a
cross of the fast stochastic over the slow. The stochastic indicator is indicat-
ing an uptrend, the stock has been oversold, and a bullish reversal pattern
has developed on the chart. It’s the perfect time to put on a long position!

Chapter 12: Buy Indicators and Bullish Reversal Candlestick Patterns

The trend that follows the sequence of events in Figure 12-5 is pretty impres-
sive. It’s so strong that the stochastic indicator stays in an overbought state
for several weeks.
You can see another example of how you can combine the stochastic indica-
tor with a bullish reversal pattern in Figure 12-6. The chart in this figure is of
the stock TXU, a Texas utility that was taken private while I was in the
process of writing this book.
The stock has clearly been in a downtrend. (Note that the downtrend
occurred after a bearish pattern appeared on the chart a few weeks prior —
aren’t candlesticks great?) The stochastic readings reach the oversold level,
and a three outside up pattern develops. At just about the same time, the fast
stochastic moves above the slow one, signaling a change in trend from down
to up. It’s time to buy, buy, buy! The uptrend continues for several weeks, and
a savvy trader who identifies the combination of the stochastic indicator and
the bullish reversal pattern will have her profits piling up.
Using the stochastic indicator
to help pick long exits
You can also use the stochastic indicator to help you determine when it’s
time to exit a long trade. For instance, if you’re in a long position and the fast
Figure 12-6:

indicator
and a bullish
reversal
pattern

on TXU.
274
Part IV: Combining Patterns and Indicators 

stochastic moves below the slow stochastic, that can tip you off that the
uptrend may be changing to a downtrend, and the time for getting out of your
long is probably drawing near.
Stochastic indicators can signal a trend change even when the stochastic
readings haven’t yet reached an overbought or oversold level. For an exam-
ple, check out Figure 12-7 — a chart of the 30-year U.S. Treasury bond
futures. I highlight a case where an uptrend changes to a downtrend outside
of a stochastic indicator’s overbought level. Notice, too, that some other mid-
level trend changes appear earlier on the chart.
Just keep in mind that with your exits, you may need to act and get out of a
trade when the fast and slow stochastics cross, regardless of whether they’re
in overbought or oversold territory.
I provide an excellent example of how you can combine the stochastic indica-
tor with a candlestick pattern to identify a successful entry point and prof-
itable exit in Figure 12-8. This chart of Plumb Creek Timber (PCL) shows the
company’s timber lands throughout the United States.
You can see that the entry point shows itself after a downtrend, when the
stochastic levels make an upward break after spending some time under
the 20 buy level. The break coincides with a three outside up bullish reversal
pattern, and that combination of factors is a crystal clear indication that it’s
a good time to get in on a long trade. The uptrend gets going quickly after
that.

275
Chapter 12: Buy Indicators and Bullish Reversal Candlestick Patterns

The stock trades higher, and both the slow and fast stochastic readings move
up with it. They both reach an overbought level, and then as the trend dwin-
dles, the fast stochastic crosses under the slow one. That’s a good indication
that the uptrend is on its last legs, and it’s especially true in this case
because the crossover occurs with both stochastics above the overbought
level of 80. The stock does continue to grind higher but not for long.
The final example to close out the section is a bit different from the other
examples in this chapter because it’s a relatively lousy trade (albeit one with
a small profit) and it includes a doji (dojis are covered in Chapter 5). It’s all
included in Figure 12-9, which features a chart of Apple Inc. (AAPL).

276
Part IV: Combining Patterns and Indicators 

The chart shows that the stochastic levels are under 20 after a short-lived
downtrend. The levels then cross, forecasting the emergence of an uptrend.
There’s also a doji hanging out all by itself — another indication that the
trend direction is about to change. The stochastic levels get over 80 pretty
quickly, and the early stages of an uptrend begin to appear. It looks like it’s
time to buy.
But wait. Although the stochastic levels run to 80, they then cross again, indi-
cating that the uptrend may not be around much longer. A nimble trader can
recognize this sign as the time to exit and be happy with a profit, no matter
how small. An even nimbler trader notices that just after the crossover to a
downtrend, a bearish reversal candlestick pattern emerges.
I didn’t highlight it, but if you look closely, you can see a three inside down
candlestick pattern. You can also see that the stochastic readings indicate a
forthcoming shift to a downtrend. Many traders see that and think that an
opportunity to make some money on a short is on the way. They’re wrong.
The stock climbs much higher and stays overbought for some time. If a
trader initiated a short position, hopefully he included a solid protective
stop.

In This Chapter
 Using the relative strength index and candlestick patterns for your short trades
 Shorting with combinations of the stochastic indicator and bearish candlestick patterns
T
echnical indicators are useful in many trading situations, and as I
describe in the other chapters in Part IV, you can use them in tandem
with candlestick patterns to conduct some outstanding trades. In this chap-
ter, I fill you in on how to combine a couple of common technical indicators
with bearish candlestick patterns to help you make wise decisions about
short trades.
I focus much more on the prospects for shorting than the opportunities to
use candlesticks and indicators to tell you when to exit a long trade, because
realizing when to exit a long is relatively easy: If it looks like a trend is ready
to tank, sell and get out!
I know some people are resistant to short selling, but it’s part of the game,
and not using the short side of trading puts you at a disadvantage. Risks are
involved, but if you employ the methods I describe in this chapter, you can
minimize those risks. With any luck, after reading my Chapter 13, you won’t
have to file Chapter 13!
Shorting with the RSI and Bearish
Candlestick Patterns
The relative strength index (RSI) is an indicator that can reveal an oversold or
overbought security. The RSI typically appears in an area below a chart, and
visually, it’s represented by a line that moves up and down between 0 and
100. It’s really up to you to choose which levels in that range will be consid-
ered overbought and oversold, but in this chapter, I use 30 as my oversold

level and 70 as my overbought level. That means that an RSI reading under 30
tells you that a bottom is forthcoming. Be ready to buy when that situation
presents itself. Using 70 as an overbought level means that an RSI over 70
should alert you to either put on a short or sell a long position, because the
trend is about to head south. You can read all about the nuts and bolts of the
RSI in Chapter 11.
When combined with candlestick patterns, the RSI can provide an even
stronger indication of when the situation is ripe for executing short trades or
selling on long positions. In this section, I discuss the ways in which you can
combine your candlestick charts with the RSI to make some clever, profitable
trades.
Picking short entry points with 
the RSI and candlesticks
When using the RSI combined with a candlestick pattern to pick a good time
to enter a short position, you want to see an RSI reading over 70 (or your
personal overbought level) that coincides with the formation of a bearish
candlestick pattern. If you have your eye on a chart and you see those two
things come together, get your short pants on! (That’s just a figure of speech,
of course — I encourage everyone to wear pants of an appropriate length
while trading.)
What better way to master these scenarios than to see them on a chart, so
please take a gander at Figure 13-1. This example is a situation when you can
combine the RSI with a bearish reversal candlestick pattern to figure out
when to put on a short. The chart in Figure 13-1 is of the stock for Masco
(MAS), a manufacturer and distributor of home improvement and building
products. With fundamental exposure like that, it’s an excellent stock to trade
when the economic outlook is in question.
The RSI in Figure 13-1 goes into the overbought range early in November, and
when you see that happen, start looking for bearish reversal candlestick pat-
terns. In this example, the pattern comes in the form of a gravestone doji.
(Check out Chapter 5 for the gravestone doji details.) The gravestone doji
can indicate a reversal in either direction, but in this case there’s an estab-
lished uptrend, and the RSI reading has been overbought for some time, so
it’s very safe to say that this particular gravestone doji is signaling a bearish
reversal.
280
Part IV: Combining Patterns and Indicators 

If you keep an eye on this overbought RSI and you spot the gravestone doji,
you’d put on a short position, because the gravestone doji really shows that
the bears are taking control of the price action after a run by the bulls. The
pattern is followed by a small downtrend that lasts just a couple of weeks.
You wouldn’t be able to go out and start shopping for yachts if you trade this
pattern successfully, but it’s certainly worth studying, because it’s a fairly
reliable indication of bearishness.
Perhaps it’s most important to note that this example shows you how the RSI
(or other technical indicators, for that matter) can be very useful when you
spot a reversal signal that doesn’t tell you definitively which way the trend
will go. You’ve got to really be sure of the market environment in those cases,
and the RSI can tell you what you need to know.
Good things do come in pairs, so I provide another example of how you can
combine the RSI with a bearish candlestick pattern in Figure 13-2. This figure
features a chart of the futures contracts that trade based on the level of U.S.
Treasury bonds.
You can see in Figure 13-2 that the price action produces a three inside down
pattern, which is a pretty reliable bearish reversal pattern that I describe in
detail in Chapter 10. The pattern’s first day is a white candle that occurs in an
uptrend. More importantly, this first day combined with the price action lead-
ing up to it causes the RSI reading to close over 70, which tells you that
you’re looking at an overbought situation. The pattern is complete with a
bearish second day that’s inside the first day, and a down final day.

281
Chapter 13: Sell Indicators and Bearish Reversal Candlestick Patterns

If you want to capitalize on a situation like this, enter a short sale near the
completion of the pattern or be prepared to put on a short on any small
rebound during the next couple of days. The combination of the candlestick
pattern and the overbought level of the RSI turns out to be a solid sell signal.
The price action following the end of the pattern results in a quick drop of
over three points in the Treasury bond futures. Although three points may
not sound like a lot, consider that a point move in a single contract is worth
$1,000 (when you’re on the right side).
Using the RSI to help pick 
short entry and exit points
You can combine the RSI with your candlestick patterns to pick wise entry
points for a short trade. But that’s not the whole story. You can also use that
same combination of trading tools to indicate when you should exit a short.
Figure 13-3 presents a situation in which a combination of the RSI and a bear-
ish candlestick pattern can show you when to get in and out of a short posi-
tion. The chart is for Peabody Energy (BTU), a mining company that focuses
on coal production.
Peabody Energy’s symbol may seem a little odd at first, but BTU stands for
British Thermal Unit, which is a measure of the heat value of various fuels.
Makes sense for a coal producer, right?

Part IV: Combining Patterns and Indicators 

The bearish candlestick pattern in Figure 13-3 starts to develop after several up
days in a row. Along with this strength in the stock’s price, the RSI rises to a
level over 70 (overbought). The three outside down pattern then appears, with
a black candle on the second day that’s an outside day relative to the first day.
The pattern is completed with a down day on the third day. (To understand the
inner workings of the three outside down pattern, check out Chapter 10.) The
uptrend is reversing to a downtrend, so the time is right for entering a short.
There’s another element to the chart in Figure 13-3 that’s worth highlighting.
The three outside down pattern is completed when the RSI level is just a hair
over 70. Seeing the RSI in an overbought range when a reversal pattern is
completed is pretty rare, because a reversal pattern normally occurs when a
trend changes direction, and when that happens, the RSI usually ends up in
the middle range between overbought and oversold.
The exit level for this short isn’t set in stone, but it should definitely yield a
profit on the trade. The RSI moves down below 50 fairly quickly with the
downtrend, and that should serve as a signal to start keeping an eye out for
some sort of exit pattern or reversal in the downtrend. Unfortunately,
another reversal pattern doesn’t come along to tell you when to exit the
short. But that doesn’t mean that you have to just take a stab in the dark to
figure out when to get out. There’s a period of four days where the down-
trend appears to be in trouble; the trend flattens and a couple of bullish days
pop up. You can decide at that point that the trend has run its course, and it’s
time to get out and take a profit. You can enjoy even larger profits if you hold
on just a little while longer, because the downtrend kicks back in and the
stock trades lower still. But you have to exit the position sometime, and a
good opportunity for that comes when the RSI pushes below the oversold
level. Even without a pattern to confirm it, that should serve as a pretty solid
sign that it’s time to exit and book your profits.

Chapter 13: Sell Indicators and Bearish Reversal Candlestick Patterns

I provide one more example of how you can use the RSI in tandem with bear-
ish candlestick patterns to flesh out short entries and exits for short trades
in Figure 13-4. This chart is of Radio Shack (RSH), which is an electronics
retailer that covers the U.S. with more than 1,000 stores.
The RSH stock in Figure 13-4 is in a well-defined uptrend with the RSI reaching
just a tad over 70. The day that the RSI reaches 70 is also the first day of a
three outside down pattern (see Chapter 10 for details), and that serves as a
signal for you to enter into a short trade.
If you short after seeing this combination of an overbought RSI and a bearish
reversal candlestick pattern, you’re quickly rewarded with a gap down on the
opening of the day after the pattern is completed. You may shudder a bit two
days later when there’s a gap up and the high of the pattern (a resistance level)
is approached, but that level isn’t violated and the signal remains valid. The
stock continues to trade off, and during this downtrend the RSI works its way
down to below 50. Here is where you should start watching out for an exit
point.
The exit signal in Figure 13-4 comes quickly, with a one-day reversal pattern.
With the downtrend in place and the RSI in the bottom half of its range, a
hammer day appears. (You can read all about the hammer pattern in Chapter
6.) The signal is a reversal pattern, and determining the trend that follows the
pattern generally depends on the market context in which the pattern
appears. The prevailing trend is clearly down in this situation, so you can bet
that the hammer indicates that a switch to an uptrend is in the works. That
turns out to be just the case, and the stock starts trading higher.

Part IV: Combining Patterns and Indicators 

The hammer pattern serves as a useful short exit signal in Figure 13-4, but
the profits on the trade weren’t exorbitant. However, you still earned some
revenue, and by using the candlestick pattern for an exit signal you avoided
seeing your earnings winnowed down (or even turned into losses) as the
trend heads upward for a stretch.
Using the Stochastic Indicator
and Bearish Candlestick
Patterns for Shorting
If you’re interested in another reliable technical indicator that you can com-
bine with bearish candlestick patterns to help you in your short trades, look
no farther than the stochastic indicator. The stochastic indicator can be a very
useful trading tool when you’re trying to determine when a security is over-
bought or oversold. You can read all about the stochastic indicator in
Chapter 11, but for this discussion just keep in mind the following points:
 The stochastic indicator includes two components: the fast and slow
stochastic.
 The fast and slow stochastics oscillate between 0 and 100.
 When the fast stochastic is under the slow stochastic, there’s a
downtrend in place.
 When the fast stochastic is above the slow stochastic, there’s an
uptrend in place.
 The stochastic indicator can be based on a variety of look back periods.
In this chapter my examples have a 14-period look back, which you’ll
find is a standard level in charting packages.
 Overbought and oversold levels on the stochastic indicator can vary,
but in this chapter I use the standard levels of 20 for oversold and 80 for
overbought. Keep in mind that this is slightly different than the standard
oversold and overbought levels used for the RSI.
This section focuses on how to use the stochastic indicator alongside your
candlesticks in shorting situations. Keep in mind, though, that you can use
the same information to help you figure out when to get out of a long posi-
tion. The rule is fairly simple. If you have a long position and the trend looks
like it’s going to head downward, exit and book your profit!
285
Chapter 13: Sell Indicators and Bearish Reversal Candlestick Patterns

Picking short entry points
Picking the best entry point for a short can be a difficult undertaking, but
using the stochastic indicator as a supplement to your candlestick patterns
can make the task much easier. For a prime example of how the stochastic
indicator can be used with a bearish candlestick pattern to pick a short
entry, take a look at Figure 13-5.
In the figure, you see a chart of Convergys Corporation (CVG), a provider of
specialized software solutions for business customers. Its headquarters is in
Cincinnati, Ohio, and Cincinnati’s airport code is CVG. Coincidence? Nah,
probably not. As you can see, the stock’s price action is pretty bullish for a
few days, and the result is a stochastic indicator reading over 80. The three
inside down candlestick pattern forms shortly after the indicators reach this
overbought level. Feel free to flip back to Chapter 10 for more information on
the three inside down candlestick pattern.
The situation is ripe for a short entry, and the short entry situation gets even
better when the fast stochastic crosses under the slow stochastic while both
are still in overbought territory. If you see that combination of factors come
together, you should be quick to enter a short position, because all signs
point to a forthcoming downtrend.
For a second example, see the chart of Xerox (XRX) stock in Figure 13-6.
Xerox has become synonymous with document solutions for all businesses
great and small.

Part IV: Combining Patterns and Indicators 

In the middle of the chart in Figure 13-6, I highlight three points where the
stochastic reading is overbought. Two of those points are accompanied by
bearish candlestick patterns, and one isn’t. Guess which ones provide the
best entry point signals? I explain each scenario:
 The first of the three points at which the stochastic indicates that the
stock is overbought occurs as the stochastic indicator comes to the end
of an uptrend that was in place for a few weeks. The overbought level is
reached just when a hanging man (a bearish reversal signal covered in
Chapter 6) appears on the chart. On the very next day, the fast stochas-
tic crosses under the slow stochastic, which signals a short entry point
and a confirmation of the hammer pattern as a reversal signal.
Initiating a trade on this day, can prove profitable. Bearish activity pre-
vails for a few days after the signal, but it’s not the significant downtrend
a short seller would hope for. Still, though, it can result in a profitable
trade.
 The second of the three points comes when the stochastic indicator
rebounds into overbought territory. The indicator almost provides some
signals, but nothing really comes of it for a few days. Finally, the indica-
tor appears to signal a short entry opportunity, but as you can see, there
isn’t a corresponding bearish candlestick pattern.
If you rely solely on the stochastic indicator in this situation and initiate
a short position, you’ll be sorry. The downtrend promised by the sto-
chastic indicator doesn’t appear, and the stock continues to trade
higher. Ouch!

Chapter 13: Sell Indicators and Bearish Reversal Candlestick Patterns

 The last and best of the three signals occurs after the trend has contin-
ued upward and the stochastic readings have reached an overbought
level yet again. This time, though, the three outside down pattern (see
Chapter 10 for more details) emerges, and during the pattern’s formation
the fast stochastic crosses under the slow one. A downtrend is probably
on the way, and entering into a short position is smart at this time. Then
you’d be rewarded handsomely, because the stock trades off heavily for
quite some time and the potential profit is quite attractive.
Deciding when to get in and out of shorts
Knowing when to exit a trade can be as important as knowing when to make
an entry, and luckily the stochastic indicator — when used in combination
with bearish candlestick patterns — can provide you with guidance for cov-
ering a short. Truth be told, the stochastic indicator actually does an okay
job on its own, but when you use this indicator correctly with candlesticks,
the odds of success are in your favor. To close out this chapter, I present a
couple of examples of how you can use the stochastic indicator with bearish
candlestick patterns to determine when to get in and out of a short.
The first example comes in the form of Figure 13-7 and a chart of First
Horizon National (FHN), which is the parent company of First Tennessee
Bank and some other financial subsidiaries. Also, for the sake of full disclo-
sure, I used to work for this company, and their stock is the first I ever
owned. But I’m talking about Wall Street, here, not Memory Lane, so let me
get on with it.

Part IV: Combining Patterns and Indicators 

The stochastic readings in Figure 13-7 are in overbought territory when the
first day of a three inside down candlestick pattern emerges. Coincidentally,
the fast stochastic crosses under the slow stochastic as the pattern comes
together, and the result is a full-blown short-sell signal.
The resulting downtrend stays in place for a couple of weeks, and the
stochastic levels finally reach an oversold level after a long black candle
pushes prices down. The following day sees a small rebound, and more
importantly, a cross of the fast stochastic over the slow one. That’s your
exit signal.
Keep in mind that generally speaking, you can forego a revealing candlestick
pattern and rely on another technical indicator when picking a spot to exit a
trade. Exits are usually a little less precise, and often one technical indicator
is enough to go on. It’s better to have a candlestick pattern for confirmation,
but it isn’t absolutely necessary.
You’d need to get out of the short in Figure 13-7 quickly, because the next
day gaps higher and the gap isn’t filled. Prices just keep moving up, which
is pretty scary for a short in this position. Not exiting quickly when a stop
loss signal is hit can result in worse losses. Figure 13-7 is a prime example.
Figure 13-8 is a real beaut. This chart is of Vornado Realty Trust (VNO), a
real estate investment trust that owns office buildings in the New York
City area.

Chapter 13: Sell Indicators and Bearish Reversal Candlestick Patterns

This chart is another good example because there are three potential action-
able signals in a row, each with its own unique characteristics. Working from
left to right:
 The first highlighted candlestick reversal pattern is a doji that occurs
after several very strong days in a row that have pushed the fast and
slow stochastic readings into the overbought range. The fast stochastic
crosses under the slow stochastic on the day after the doji, and that
cross confirms the doji and offers a short entry point. The resulting
bearish price action is pure happiness for shorts: ten bearish days in a
row after the confirmation day. It culminates with both stochastic read-
ings reaching the oversold level.
Then, on the tenth down day, another reversal signal appears! It’s a
hammer pattern, and given the market environment, it’s pretty clear that
this hammer indicates that the trend will be heading upward soon. It’s
time for the shorts to cover and walk away with an appealing profit.
Before I move on to the second sell signal on this chart (the next bullet
point), note that the hammer pattern isn’t just an exit signal. It can also be
used as a buy signal for a long trade! There’s nothing wrong with making
money on the same stock being both long and short. From personal ex-
perience I can tell you it’s actually a lot of fun, and can be quite profitable!
 The second sell signal on the chart in Figure 13-8 is a gravestone doji, and
it appears because the stochastic levels are both in overbought territory
(details of the gravestone doji in Chapter 5). Much like the first signal, it’s
followed by a down day that results in a crossing of the fast stochastic
under the slow one. That’s confirmation that the gravestone doji indeed
signaled a trend reversal, and it presents a short entry opportunity.
The second trade doesn’t work out quite as well as the first, but if you
trade nimbly you may break even at the very worst, and you more than
likely will book a small profit if you follow the rules. The entry day is fol-
lowed by a little bearishness, but the bulls come in and cause the sto-
chastic indicator to show a change in trend to the upside. A quick exit of
the short would be in order.
 The third sell signal has a pattern that’s a little more elaborate and is a
three inside down reversal pattern (covered in Chapter 10). Like the
previous two reversal signals (previous two bullets), it occurs with the
stochastic indicator in the overbought range, and during the pattern
formation the stochastic indicator signals a change in trend to the
downside. You guessed it: That serves as a short entry signal.
The exit on this last trade is pretty quick and not terribly profitable.
Once again the stochastic indicator changes trend just a few days after
the short entry point. Luckily, if followed correctly, a small profit
would’ve been booked.

Chapter 14
Using Technical Indicators
Alongside Bullish-Trending
Candlestick Patterns
In This Chapter
 Combining trendlines with bullish-trending candlestick patterns
 Making profitable trades with moving averages and bullish-trending candlestick 
patterns
You can combine candlestick patterns effectively with a variety of techni-
cal indicators to produce information that helps you decide when to 
put on and get out of trades. Like candlestick patterns, many technical indica-
tors tell you when a trend is about to reverse, but several others can let you
know that a prevailing trend continues. These indicators are powerful
weapons that can add to the versatility of your trading arsenal.
If you understand how to use technical indicators in tandem with bullish-
trending candlestick patterns, it’s easier for you to spot situations where
buying to enter a long position is a wise move. And you can also use techni-
cal indicators to confirm market or individual security predictions that
you’ve made based on candlestick patterns.
I cover all that and more in this chapter, and I focus my discussion on two of
the most common technical indicators: trendlines and moving averages. If
you need a refresher on those two indicators, flip back to Chapter 11. If you
have a basic understanding of how they’re created and how they work, read
on and get trading!

Using Trendlines and Bullish-Trending
Candlestick Patterns for Buying and
Confirmation
The trendline is one of the oldest and easiest to understand of all the techni-
cal indicators. You’d be hard pressed to find any current charting software
that won’t draw a trendline automatically for you, but you can also hark back
to the good ol’ days and draw a trendline yourself with nothing more than a
chart, a ruler, and a pencil. If you need to get familiar with trendlines or brush
up on what you already know, flip back to Chapter 11.
Trendlines have a positive slope during an uptrend or a negative slope during
a downtrend, and those simple signals can be very useful when you’re trying
to confirm your opinion of the market trend.
In this section, I show you how to use the trend confirmation that trendlines
provide in combination with bullish-trending candlestick patterns, which
signal that a trend in place will continue. You can use the combinations to
decide when it’s time to buy to enter a long position or when you should
stick with a trade to realize additional profits.
Using trendlines and bullish-trending 
candlestick patterns to pick long entry
points and confirm trends
Because trendlines are so useful for trend confirmation, you can trade with
confidence when you combine bullish trendlines with bullish candlestick
patterns. That tandem can help you decide when to stick with a position or
initiate a new one.
It’s pretty obvious where a trendline should be drawn on a chart, but some-
times you may question its placement. Don’t stress about it too much,
because as a trend goes along and changes, you can always alter the trend-
line accordingly. I present a couple of examples of how you can combine a
positive trendline and bullish-trending candlestick patterns in this section.
The trendline and bullish pattern on a chart
Figure 14-1 is a chart of Apple Inc. (AAPL), the computer company turned
consumer electronics company that’s scored big with iPods and iPhones.
292
Part IV: Combining Patterns and Indicators 

Both of the patterns on this chart are bullish neck line patterns, where a bull-
ish day is followed by a gap opening. (You can read all about the bullish neck
line pattern in Chapter 7.) That attracts some bears, and they push the clos-
ing price down near the point where the bulls raised the price the previous
day. If you spot these patterns while reviewing charts, you can feel quite con-
fident that an uptrend is indeed in place, and you’d be wise to anticipate
higher prices and a buying opportunity.
The first of the two bullish neck line patterns occurs after the uptrend has
been in place for only a few days. After recognizing that pattern, you should
draw a trendline to better define the uptrend and buy to enter a long posi-
tion. The trendline makes it easier to see the strength of the uptrend, and it
provides a support level for several days to come.
In the midst of the established uptrend, another bullish neck line pattern
appears. It’s a bit above the trendline, and it shows up after the trend has
been in place for quite awhile, so buying to get into a long position may not
be the best move. It’s like a stale green traffic light: You know it’s going to
turn soon. On the other hand, it’s still a bullish-trending candlestick pattern,
so if you saw it and were already in a long position, you can be confident that
the uptrend carries on at least a little farther.
Another example of a trendline working with a bullish pattern
My second example of bullish candlestick patterns and trendlines working
together is present in Figure 14-2. In that figure, you see the exchange-traded
fund (ETF) based on the 100 biggest stocks trading on the NASDAQ exchange.
The symbol for this ETF is QQQQ. Hopefully, I can provide some A’s for all
those Q’s.

293
Chapter 14: Using Technical Indicators  

On the chart in Figure 14-2 a bullish thrusting line pattern emerges as QQQQ
is just a few days into an uptrend. This pattern is one of my favorites because
the close is an attractive entry point due to a bit of retracing of the price into
the range of the pattern’s first day. Buying low while in an uptrend is the best
of both worlds!
This bullish thrusting line pattern shows up several days into a bullish trend.
If you see it on a chart, you may want to draw a trendline to further define
the uptrend and give yourself a support level. If that level is violated, you
know it’s time to sell and exit the trade.
Picking long exits and determining 
stop levels with trendlines and bullish-
trending candlestick patterns
In addition to confirming trends and letting you know when to get in on a
long trade, trendlines can also help with your decisions on when to exit a
trade. Put simply, a bullish trendline may serve as an exit point when it
occurs in a bullish trend. It’s not always easy, because trendlines are con-
stantly changing, but that can also be a plus because the trendline is moving
in the same direction of your position (higher). Sound confusing? Let me
clear things up with a couple of examples in the next sections.

QQQQ with

294
Part IV: Combining Patterns and Indicators 

Trendline and patterns for entries and exits
Figure 14-3 is the same chart I use in Figure 14-2, but the trendline has been
expanded a bit to include a level where you exit a long trade if you use the
trendline to define the prevailing uptrend.
Once again, the pattern is a bullish thrusting line pattern that pops up in an
uptrend, and the trendline, which offers a support level for the uptrend, is
established. In a nutshell, if the stock continues to trade above this line, it’s
still in an uptrend. And as long as it’s in an uptrend, you want to be on board
with a long position!
You can clearly see the exit level in Figure 14-3. The stock has a day where it
drops below the trendline, and that’s where you want to get out. In fact, plac-
ing a stop order on the level of that trendline would be a good idea, so that
any dip below it would result in an exit. You may be a bit dismayed shortly
after because the stock quickly recovers and the trend resumes for a few
more days. There was still a little more money to be made, but you can take
comfort in the fact that you followed the rules and exited the trade when it
was prudent. Hindsight is 20/20, of course, and in the long run you come out
ahead if you stick with your rules.
Another entry and exit with a trendline and bullish pattern
I provide one more example of how you can use a trendline alongside a bull-
ish candlestick pattern to pick an exit level in Figure 14-4. The chart in this
figure is for the stock of General Electric (GE). At this point it’s pretty difficult
to get away from GE if you’re living in the developed part of the world.

Chapter 14: Using Technical Indicators  

The chart in Figure 14-4 is interesting because the bullish neck lines pattern
appears and there’s an uptrend in place, but what to do in terms of trading
action is a little blurry. The prevailing trend is a long one, and the pattern
occurs with quite a lot of price difference between its close and the trendline
that would be drawn at that time. (The trendline on the chart would be old
news by then.)

Part IV: Combining Patterns and Indicators 
Exiting with a trendline
You may be wondering how it’s possible to use
a trendline as an exit stop level because it
moves every day. That’s a valid concern! Unlike
the set points associated with candlestick pat-
terns, a trendline’s level on a chart changes
daily. You can deal with that challenge in one of
two ways:
 The first is to determine the level of the 
support trendline each and every day, and
place an appropriate stop order that’s good
only for that day. That strategy works well
because the line moves with the trend and
your exit point moves accordingly daily. On
the downside, you do have to commit to
making the change every single day, which
can be tough for some busy amateur
traders.
 Second, you can choose to exit the trade
only if the closing price is lower than the
trendline. Going with that strategy keeps
you from having to place trades everyday,
but it does require you to check your chart
toward the close of each day. It’s attractive
because it can keep you from getting
stopped out of a potentially valid trade if the
price happens to take a slight dive. On the
flip side, though, the price can fall dramati-
cally under the trendline during the day and
close at a low level as well, meaning that
your exit would be far lower than if you
went with the first stop level strategy.

Even though the trend is your friend, sometimes stocks get so far ahead of
the trend that holding out for a better entry price — on both the long and
short side — or possibly just skipping the trade altogether is wise. The exam-
ple chart in Figure 14-4 proves prudent to pass on the trade, because if a long
position is initiated, then its exit level comes up rather quickly and the trade
appears to be a small loser.
Combining Moving Averages and Bullish-
Trending Candlestick Patterns
The moving average is a technical indicator that is reliable and easy to under-
stand, at least as far as technical indicators go. See Chapter 11 for more info
on moving averages.
In basic terms, a moving average is the average of the closing prices of a
security over a certain period of time. Moving averages can be helpful when
you’re looking to confirm a trend, so you can rely on them to boost your 
confidence in the trading decisions you make based on bullish-trending 
candlestick patterns.
Using moving averages with bullish-
trending candlestick patterns to 
confirm trends
If you haven’t yet made your way through my discussion of technical indica-
tors in Chapter 11 or you need a refresher, the first rule of thumb with using
moving averages as trend indicators is if a security’s price is above the
moving average, an uptrend is in place. With that in mind, take a gander 
at my first example of combining moving averages with bullish-trending 
candlestick patterns.
Charting the moving average and a bullish-trending pattern
Figure 14-5 is a chart of the stock for Yum! Brands (YUM). When you realize
that Yum! Brands operates various fast food restaurants, including KFC, 
Taco Bell, and Pizza Hut, you can understand where it got its company’s
name and stock symbol.
297
Chapter 14: Using Technical Indicators  

In Figure 14-5, YUM is trading over its ten-day moving average for several
weeks. In the middle of that sustained uptrend, two bullish thrusting line pat-
terns appear. The patterns appear about two weeks apart, and after both
occurrences, the stock continues to trade higher. These patterns and the ten-
day moving average certainly confirm each other on this chart. The moving
average is tested several times, but the price holds for quite awhile until it
starts to top out on the right side of the chart. If you monitor this situation
on a chart, you’d initiate a long position after spotting one of the two pat-
terns, and ride it until you stopped out or noticed a trend reversal signal of
some sort.
The trend reversal signal shows up rather quickly, and before I move on to
the next example, I want to point out just where the uptrend in Figure 14-5
starts reversing. I didn’t highlight it on the chart, but if you look closely, you
can spy a bearish reversal candlestick pattern at the top of the uptrend. It’s a
three outside down pattern, and it’s another case of how getting very familiar
with the appearance of candlestick patterns can pay off when trading.
The example in Figure 14-5 uses only one moving average, but don’t feel like
you have to stick to using just one. You may very well want to add more
moving averages to your charts, and using two or more can be revealing if
you can keep up with them all.

Part IV: Combining Patterns and Indicators 

Using a couple of moving averages and a bullish-trending pattern
When you use two moving averages on a candlestick chart, the trend is
defined by the location of one moving average relative to the other moving
average. When the moving average with the lower number of days is trading
higher than the one with more days, the trend is positive. For the examples in
this chapter that include two moving averages, I use 10- and 20-day moving
averages. So when the 10-day moving average is higher than the 20-day
moving average, the trend is positive. Sound simple enough? I’ll dive right in
with an example.
Sticking with the fast food theme, Figure 14-6 is a chart of McDonald’s (MCD).
It’s an Illinois-based chain of hamburger restaurants that often uses a clown
in its ads — maybe you’ve heard of it? This chart includes both a 10-day and
a 20-day moving average, and for much of the chart the former is higher than
the latter, which means that an uptrend is in place, and after looking at the
chart it’s hard to argue.
As if the evidence provided by the moving averages weren’t enough, further
assurance of the bullish trend comes in the form of a bullish thrusting line
pattern. It turns up just a few days after the 10-day moving average has
cleared the 20-day moving average. Looks like an uptrend is on the way! And
nothing makes traders hungrier than a strong bullish candlestick pattern
appearing early in an uptrend.

Chapter 14: Using Technical Indicators  

Using the moving average and bullish-
trending candlestick patterns to pick 
long exits and determine stop levels
Making a wise decision when it comes time to pick an exit point or stop level
for a long trade can be the difference between booking a tidy profit and 
suffering a frustrating loss.
In the preceding section, I explain how you can use moving averages when
you’re deciding when to get in on a long trade, but you can just as easily use
them when you’re trying to figure out when to exit a trade. If you’re in a long
position and a moving average reading tells you that the trend is headed for a
reversal, be prepared to sell and get out. Allow me to elaborate with a couple
of examples.
An entry and exit with a single moving average and bullish pattern
Figure 14-7 is a chart of the oil giant Exxon Mobil (XOM). Over the course of
several days, the stock on this chart establishes an uptrend and it’s solidly
over the ten-day moving average. Although quite a bit of ground has been
covered, the bullish thrusting line pattern shows up, and the conditions are
ripe for a buy signal.

After the buy signal, the stock continues to work its way higher until there’s a
break of the ten-day moving average. That break signals the potential end of
the uptrend, and it means that if you entered a long position after spotting
the bullish thrusting line pattern, you need to exit. The price at the exit is
high above the level of the pattern, so you walk away with a tidy profit. 
Not bad!
Setting stops is trickier with moving averages than it is with trendlines. You
can anticipate the level of a trendline because it’s simply the slope of the line
moving forward by a day (or other time period). However, the moving aver-
age level changes more erratically, depending on the price action.
If you can’t constantly monitor your trading positions, use the previous day’s
moving average as a stop. If a security dips below the prior day’s moving
average, initiate a sell.
In the case of the XOM trade in Figure 14-7, a stop should’ve been in place
because the price continued to fall and settled well under the moving average
on the day it broke this support level.
An entry and exit with two moving averages and a bullish pattern
Another example of how to combine moving averages with bullish candle-
stick patterns comes in the form of Figure 14-8, a chart of the futures contract
that trades based on the level of the United States ten-year Treasury notes.
This chart has a great uptrend that can lead to a very appealing entry and
exit if a trader makes the right moves.

Chapter 14: Using Technical Indicators  

The bullish thrusting line pattern appears several days into the uptrend, 
but it’s so close to the ten-day moving average that it’s hard to think that the
contracts have gotten too far ahead of themselves. Looks like a pretty reason-
able level to enter a long trending trade.
After the entry has been executed, things continue to go swimmingly with the
10-day moving average staying above the 20-day moving average. The 10-day
and even the 20-day moving averages are violated by the absolute price of
the contracts, but that’s not an exit signal because the trend changes when
the 10-day moving average moves under the 20-day. In this case, keeping that
in mind keeps you from getting out of the trade too early and missing profits
or even taking a loss.
The added check offered by the combination of two moving averages is one
of the primary reasons I use more than one moving average with my candle-
stick charts whenever possible.
The downside to using two moving averages is that you have a tougher time
figuring out just where to set your stop orders. If you want to use a moving
average crossover as an exit signal, you may find it very hard to do so if you
have a job or another reason that you can’t check in on your trades through-
out the course of the day. Some commercial software packages send you an
e-mail when a crossover is imminent, but if you can’t access your e-mail all
day, that’s not much help.
My advice is that if you want to use a moving average crossover as your stop
level, don’t worry about a crossover that may occur during the day until the
moving averages get close to each other. After you see that happen, you can
start to estimate where an appropriate stop should be placed. And you can
always just wait until the crossover has occurred and exit on the following
day, if you can deal with the occasional slight erosion of your profits on a
trade.

I
n this chapter, I explore the ways you can use trendlines and moving aver-
ages with bearish-trending candlestick patterns to uncover promising
trading opportunities. Those two versatile types of technical analysis meth-
ods are great for detecting downtrends, and when you pair them with
bearish-trending candlestick patterns, it can be much easier for you to pick
the best spots for entering short selling trades. And as if that weren’t enough,
you can also use that potent combination to determine when it’s time to
cover your short position and (hopefully) pocket a profit.
Putting Trendlines Together with
Bearish-Trending Candlestick Patterns
for Selling and Confirmation
Trendlines are one of the most straightforward technical indicators. If an
uptrend is in place, a trendline has a positive slope. If a downtrend is the
order of the day (or week or month), a trendline has a negative slope. This
concept sounds simplistic, but it can be hugely helpful when you’re trying to
determine a market’s trend. If that trend turns out to be down, you can use a
downward-sloping trendline alongside bearish-trending candlestick patterns
to inform your short trading decisions.

If you’re blanking on trendlines, make a quick flip to Chapter 11, where I 
discuss them in detail.
Short trades and trend confirmation 
with trendlines and bearish patterns
Selecting the most appropriate time to get into a short trade can be a trying
task. Timing is critical, and any decision-making help can be a real blessing.
Luckily for you, considering trendlines and bearish-trending candlestick pat-
terns together can provide just that type of help. I show you what I mean in
this section with a couple of real-world examples.
A short trade example with a bearish 
trendline and candlestick pattern
You can find the first example in Figure 15-1, which features a chart of Altera
Corp. (ALTR), a maker of semiconductors that go into a variety of electronic
and industrial products.
The downtrend in the chart in Figure 15-1 is about as convincing as you can
find. The stock just keeps grinding lower. Short sellers would be pinching
themselves with each passing day! The downtrend is so pronounced, in fact,
that I run out of room for it on the right side of the chart.

Part IV: Combining Patterns and Indicators 

The first bearish pattern that pops up on the chart is the bearish-thrusting
line pattern (see Chapter 8 for details), and its bearish prediction should be
just what you need to initiate a short position. This pattern’s appearance
helps to establish a bearish trendline, which just keeps on extending until the
chart runs out of room.
The second pattern is another bearish-thrusting line pattern, and it signals
that the price will continue to drop. It also makes for a nice second chance
for any traders who didn’t get on board with a short position after the first
pattern, because the downtrend looks to still be in its early stages.
This trend stays in place for a fairly long time, and then a new bearish-
trending pattern appears. This time it’s a bearish neck line pattern (also
described in Chapter 8), which predicts a continuation of the downtrend; at
this point, however, the downtrend has been in place for quite a while, and
it’s probably too long to initiate a new short position. However, if you’re
already in a short, it’s very comforting to see some assurance that even lower
prices may be on the horizon in the immediate future. If that’s the case, hang
on and ride the downtrend just a bit lower to maximize your profit!
Another bearish trendline and bearish pattern leading to a short trade
One more example of how you can combine a bearish trendline and a bearish-
trending candlestick pattern is on display in Figure 15-2. This diagram is a
chart of Motorola Inc. (MOT). Originally a maker of radios and an innovator
in the creation of the car radio, it’s now known mostly for its cell phones.

Chapter 15: Combining Technical Indicators and Bearish-Trending Patterns 

As you can see, a downtrend is in place when the bearish-thrusting line pat-
tern appears not once but twice. (The bearish-thrusting line pattern appears
many times in Chapter 8, where I discuss it extensively.) When the first pat-
tern appears, the stock has moved so much in such a short period of time
that it’s tough to place a trendline based on recent activity. More aggressive
traders initiate a short sell after seeing this first pattern, even though a defin-
able downtrend isn’t really in place. Then after the appearance of the second
pattern, you have a good opportunity to draw a downtrend line by using the
high of the rally between the two patterns.
The second pattern presents another possible entry point, and some may
think it’s more reassuring than the first pattern because of the downtrend
line. The trend points down and the pattern pops up, but there’s a lot of room
between the end of the pattern and the trendline, so the risk level is relatively
high. It’s a pretty perilous short trade to enter at this point.
Bearish trendlines and candlestick 
patterns leading to short entries 
and exits
Trendlines are useful not only for determining the ideal time to get into a
short trade but also for figuring out when to exit. This section focuses on the
ways you can evaluate trendlines alongside bearish-trending candlestick pat-
terns to pick the best time to cover a short.
Shorting and covering using a trendline 
combined with a candlestick pattern
Figure 15-3 features a chart of the stock for one of The Big Three — Ford
Motor Company (F).
The candlestick pattern highlighted on the chart in Figure 15-3 is the bearish-
thrusting line pattern, and it pops up in the midst of a pretty significant
downtrend. The trendline is established based on the peak of the last bullish
trend and the high a few days later. If you’re looking for an illustration of the
nature of the downtrend, this trendline fits the bill, and the stock price stays
under this trendline for some time.
You can see that midway between the pattern and where the trendline is
broken, the high comes perilously close to pushing above the trendline at
one point. That event offers a trendline validation of sorts. Then a few weeks
later, the trend flattens out, and the trendline is broken. If you short this
stock, that’s when you want to get out of the trade.
306
Part IV: Combining Patterns and Indicators 

One final note on the chart in Figure 15-3 before I move on. Astute chart
observers will notice a bullish reversal pattern at the bottom of the down-
trend; did you catch it? It’s the bullish three outside up pattern, and it signals
that the downtrend is about to change directions and head up. You can always
use a reversal pattern as an exit when it shows up on a chart, and in this case
it helps you lock in just a little more profit on the short trade. Also, if you’re so
inclined, you may use this bullish pattern to establish a long position.

Chapter 15: Combining Technical Indicators and Bearish-Trending Patterns 
Determining trading levels with trendlines
Trendlines are great indicators for a lot of rea-
sons, but one slightly tricky feature of trendlines
is figuring out how to use them as exit stop
levels. This judgment is difficult because they
move every day. How can you deal with that?
You have a couple of choices:
 First, you can draw a new trendline every
day, to keep up with the changing price
action. This method works because your
line moves consistently with the trend, and
you can place corresponding stop orders
that are good for that day only. But that
method can also be taxing, because you
have to commit to changing the trendline
every single day.
 The other option is to set up a stop that gets
you out of the trade only if the close for a
day is above your trendline. That strategy
eliminates the need for a daily trendline
change, but it does require that you check
your chart toward the close of each day.
Some traders also like the second option
because it keeps them from getting stopped out
of a trade if the price makes a little run above
the trendline, but other traders contend that the
price can rise dramatically (and close quite a bit
higher) and erase profits or even cause losses
before the stop took effect. It’s up to you to
decide which method works best with your
trading strategy and style.

Exiting one trade doesn’t mean that you have to stop working with a particu-
lar security for any period of time. If you’re in a trade and riding a prevailing
trend, and you spot a trend reversal candlestick pattern, don’t rule out the
possibility of exiting the current trade and jumping right back in with another
trade that rides the trend in the opposite direction!
Shorting and covering with a downtrend line and bearish pattern
I’ll offer one more example before I wrap up this explanation. Figure 15-4 is a
chart of the futures contracts that trade based on the Swiss franc level versus
the U.S. dollar.
The contracts are in a downtrend when the bearish-thrusting line pattern
shows up. The trendline I drew on this chart leaves a lot of room for retracing
to a stop, but if you see this signal and decide to take the risk, your reward
can be pretty amazing.
Soon after the exit, this chart becomes a little heartbreaking for the shorts
because the stock moves even lower and it’s clear the shorts could’ve made
additional profits. It’s frustrating, but you have to make sure that you don’t
let situations like this get you down. As I say time and time again, it’s better
to stick with trading rules and exit when it’s prudent than to break rules, take
risks, and lose your shirt in the long run.

Part IV: Combining Patterns and Indicators 

Combining Moving Averages and
Bearish-Trending Patterns 
for Short Situations
The moving average is another technical indicator you can combine with
bearish-trending candlestick patterns to help figure out when to enter and
exit your short trades. You can read all about moving averages (and several
other technical indicators) in Chapter 11, but, broadly speaking, a moving
average is the average of the closing prices of a security over a certain period
of time.
Moving averages are very useful in confirming trends, and that functionality
makes them good bearish-trending candlestick pattern partners. Read on to
find out more.
Pinning down short entry points 
and confirming trends
You can use one or multiple moving averages to determine trends on a chart,
and in this section I work with real-world examples of both.
A short trade using a signal moving average and bearish pattern
Figure 15-5 is a chart of Merck & Co, Inc. (MRK) — one of the world’s largest
pharmaceutical companies. I like this example because you can clearly see
how the moving average defines the trend and how that trend is enthusiasti-
cally confirmed by a bearish-trending candlestick pattern (or two).
It’s hard to argue that the stock is in a downtrend when the first bearish-
trending candlestick pattern appears. That pattern is followed quickly by a
bearish-thrusting line pattern. All this bearish signaling occurs over the
course of just four trading days and with the stock well under the ten-day
moving average.
This chart makes a very good case for the use of moving averages over trend-
lines because when the first candlestick pattern appears, it’s very difficult to
draw a line that corresponds with the recent price action. But moving aver-
ages avoid this problem by relying on mathematically defined levels that
don’t have to be shaped to fit recent prices, and in this case a ten-day moving
average is appropriate.
309
Chapter 15: Combining Technical Indicators and Bearish-Trending Patterns 

If one moving average is good, are two moving averages great? That’s often
the case, because you can compare the two moving averages to glean even
more information about the nature of the price action and the prevailing
trend.
When using two moving averages on a chart, you can detect a bearish trend
when the moving average with fewer days looking back, or the one that uses
a fewer number of days in the calculation (the fast one), is below the moving
average with more days looking back (the slow one).
Two moving averages and a bearish pattern giving a short signal
You can see a great example of how it’s possible to combine two moving aver-
ages with bearish-trending candlestick patterns in Figure 15-6, which is a
chart of American Express (AXP), a company best known for its credit card
business. This chart is dominated by a bearish trend, revealed by a 10-day
moving average that stays mostly below the 20-day moving average.
Two different candlestick patterns show up on the chart in Figure 15-6. The
first pattern is a straightforward bearish neck lines pattern that pops up
while trading is going on well below both moving averages. A signal like that
is enough to justify an entry point in most similar situations.
The second pattern is a bearish-thrusting line pattern, and it appears while
the downtrend is still in place. Note that part of the first day of the pattern
trades over the moving averages, and a few of the days before the pattern
show trading over the moving averages as well. But the trend remains bear-
ish, and the 10-day moving average stays below the 20-day moving average.
That means the downtrend is still intact, and you want to hang on to your
short position for the immediate future.

Part IV: Combining Patterns and Indicators 

Using moving averages and bearish-
trending candlestick patterns to pick 
short exits and select stop levels
Moving averages can be a huge help when you combine them with bearish-
trending candlestick patterns to pick short trade entry points, but you can
also use that dynamic duo to help you determine stop levels and exit points. 
I wrap up this chapter with a couple of examples that show you how to do
just that.
A single moving average and bearish pattern 
for a short trade and trade exit signal
Figure 15-7 features a chart of the stock for the media conglomerate Time
Warner (TWX). This chart has a single ten-day moving average, and the bear-
ish trend is in place when the stock price is lower than that moving average.
The stock is trading under the ten-day moving average when a bearish-thrust-
ing line pattern appears. If you watch this chart and wait to initiate a short
position, that’s the wisest place to do it. At that point the price has been
under the moving average for only a couple of days, but it appears that a
downtrend has been in place for some time. The price works lower, but
enough volatility exists to cause the stock to trade over and under the ten-
day moving average fairly frequently.
Figure 15-6:

AXP where

averages
and a
couple of
bearish-
trending
candlestick
patterns

311
Chapter 15: Combining Technical Indicators and Bearish-Trending Patterns 

This frequent volatility ends up really frustrating a short seller on this trade.
Even though the trend continues lower for some time, a short seller with a
stop that kicks in when the price moves or closes over the ten-day moving
average — both logical stops — would be stopped out of position fairly
quickly. But the downtrend continues, and more profits can be made. This
whipsawing (quick moving around) of the price action makes a good argu-
ment for using two moving averages, and you can see an example of that
strategy in the next section.
In cases where there’s such volatility, it may be best to leave trading in this
stock to the more seasoned traders or possibly just trade fewer shares of 
this stock than you normally would until you become more familiar with this
type of action.
Two moving averages along with a bearish pattern 
for a short sale and exit trade
Figure 15-8 is a chart of Citigroup Inc., (C), and it includes both a 10- and 
20-day moving average. For the majority of the time covered on this chart,
the 10-day moving average is under the 20-day moving average, indicating
that a downtrend is in place.
A bearish-thrusting line pattern shows up on this chart during the prevailing
downtrend, providing a potential entry point for a short trade. It turns out to
be an attractive entry point, because the 10-day moving average doesn’t
cross over the 20-day moving average for several potentially profit-producing
days.

Part IV: Combining Patterns and Indicators 

Picking stop levels and exit points can be difficult when you’re working with
more than one moving average on a short trade, so consider taking an easy
route and setting a stop level that gets you out of a short on a close after the
moving averages have crossed.
It’s also worth noting in Figure 15-8 that the price trades above the 10-day
moving average several times, and even over the 20-day moving average on a
few occasions. This occurs even though the downtrend stays in place and the
10-day stays below the 20-day. Using these two moving averages together
keeps you in the trade longer, making for a much more profitable trade.

technical analysis.

Chapter 16
Ten Myths about Charting, Trading,
and Candlesticks
In This Chapter
 Getting the facts on trading and candlestick misconceptions
 Discovering some trading tips
T
hroughout this book I reveal how charting techniques — especially
candlestick charts — are a path to making money in the markets. But
my views on the subject aren’t unanimous among those interested in the
markets. Many folks are critical of technical analysis in general. Also, some
say there’s no benefit in keeping an eye out for candlestick patterns. (I
know, unthinkable!) Many of you who’ve attended business school have
heard the arguments from professors (not professional investors or traders)
that the markets are efficient and nothing can be done long term to out-
perform this efficiency. But rest assured that the reverse is true. I’ve worked
with some very smart people who’ve done just what these professors say
can’t be done, and they’ve done it well.
In this chapter, I dispel ten common myths and misconceptions about trading
and candlestick charts to set your mind at ease and help keep you confident
in your trading pursuits.
There’s No Difference between
Candlesticks and Bar Charts
If you’ve already read some of the material in this book, hopefully, you roll
your eyes when you see this myth. Candlestick charts are far superior to
ordinary bar charts, for a whole host of reasons:

 Candlestick charts are aesthetically appealing.
 They also feature patterns that can be easily discerned and used as the
basis for profitable trading decisions.
 Although the exact same price action shows up on bar charts, the dull
presentation makes it difficult for you to pick up on the intricacies of the
price movement.
 There aren’t any exotic names for bar chart patterns. After you’re used
to marubozus and dojis and haramis, how can you go back?
Market Efficiency Makes It Impossible 
to Beat the Market over the Long Run
They drilled this into my head in college and did it again in graduate school.
Why, oh why was I trying to get a degree in finance to get into the investment
field if it was impossible for me to make any money at it? Why were all these
classes full of people wanting to move on to careers picking stocks, making
investments, or trading securities? Because some people do make good
money as investors and traders. And because everyone believes that
America is the land of opportunity, and with hard work, you can achieve
some level of success.
Market efficiency is the belief that all investors have access to the same infor-
mation and are making informed investing decisions. Some say that because
these decisions are well informed and rational, current market prices reflect
the proper value of a stock or commodity. But that simply isn’t true. Traders
make impulse purchases, and prices are always moving. Prices do get out of
line, and it’s possible to profit from the results.
Only a Full-time Professional Can 
Make Money in the Markets
Plenty of professionals make money as traders or full-time investors. If this
game is truly made up of winners taking money from losers, how can a part-
time amateur with a small account and limited time for analysis be expected
to profit? It’s easy: focus.
318
Part V: The Part of Tens 

One of the most successful traders I know is a person in the state of Arkansas
who does nothing but focus on trading stocks in a specific retail stock. I
won’t say which one, but it’s very, very large. He knows the company inside
and out, and trades nothing but options and stock on this particular big box
store, where you can get anything and everything. He’s been doing this for
years and doing well at it. As a side note, he doesn’t work for the company —
he just happens to live where it’s based, and he’s watched it emerge as one of
the largest companies in the world.
If you work in a particular industry, focus on the stocks in that industry. You
already have a leg up on the competition because you have a fundamental
knowledge of the industry through experience, which is something that many
traders will never gain. For instance, if you work for a regional bank, find a
handful of similar banks to focus on, or if you work for a construction com-
pany, focus on the companies that supply to builders. By narrowing your
focus, you may just find a small niche where you can profit while profes-
sionals are spreading themselves too thin looking at multiple stocks and
industries.
Technical Analysis Is Nothing More 
Than Reading Tea Leaves
This one gets me every time, probably because I just love it when charting is
compared to psychic or supernatural activities. It’s ludicrous! There’s quite a
bit of upper level math that goes into various methods of charting and trad-
ing. Also, when back testing is conducted on technical trading methods, the
statistical measures used are similar to those used to check for errors in
other hard sciences.
Not convinced of the seriousness of technical analysis? Tell that to the mem-
bers of the Market Technicians Association (MTA). The MTA is a professional
society with a professional designation called a Chartered Market Technician
(CMT) that requires hours of study and the successful completion of three
levels of tests to obtain. There are loads of extremely smart people that make
a living using technical analysis who belong to this organization, and they all
argue vehemently against the idea that technical analysis isn’t a hard science.
And you’d be hard pressed to find a tarot card or crystal ball owner any-
where in the group. For more information on the organization and the desig-
nation, you can visit its Web site at www.mta.org.

Chapter 16: Ten Myths about Charting, Trading, and Candlesticks

Charting Is for Short-Term Traders Only
Charts are wonderful for short-term trading. They depict the emotion behind
what the market is doing and allow more rational traders to pick points to
buy and sell. I can’t imagine trading over the short term without them.
However, long-term charts are also very useful, despite what you may hear
from naysayers.
Those of you with full-time jobs outside of trading probably don’t have the
time to trade full time. If you still want to get involved with trading, one solu-
tion would be to trade by using longer holding periods. You simply need to
work with longer time periods on your charts (use weekly instead of daily
charts, for instance) and just plan on holding your trades for a bit longer.
One of the more successful technical traders is William O’Neil, the publisher
of Investor’s Business Daily. O’Neil has a longer term charting methodology
that he highlights in his newspaper and through his charting service. If
you’re interested in longer term trading, seek more info on his strategies at
www.investors.com.
You Must Be Rich to Start Trading
Don’t get me wrong: No one should be speculating with money he or she
can’t afford to lose. If you’re interested in day trading stocks, you must open
an account with at least $25,000, which is more than most people can lose
without suffering major repercussions. You shouldn’t take out a second mort-
gage or bet the kids’ college fund on a trading strategy, regardless of how
confident you are in your abilities. Trading is stressful enough without worry-
ing about the potentially devastating impacts of losing money if you don’t
have the appropriate means.
That said, you can also open a small account with a discount broker by using
just a few thousand dollars, and trade lower priced stocks or futures con-
tracts. In order to trade futures with a small account, you should concentrate
on futures contracts that aren’t terribly volatile or use some sort of strategy
that employs stops to limit losses. You can get started with a small account,
but you should be prepared to either expect limited returns or use very tight
stops.
320
Part V: The Part of Tens 

Trading Is an Easy Way 
to Get Rich Quick
Trading isn’t easy. I can’t emphasize that enough. Imagine working on some-
thing for a while, and then instead of reaping monetary rewards for your hard
work, you end up losing money. If trading was easy, we’d all do it for an hour
a day and live a life of luxury. Becoming consistently profitable requires quite
a bit of hard work.
It took me a few years of working on systems (and losing some money) before
I became consistently profitable trading for myself. My beautiful wife will
attest to the amount of work I have and continue to put into my personal
trading endeavor, which is almost like a second full-time job. However, I’ve
noticed a direct correlation between how much time I devote to trading
preparations and how well I’m doing. Hard work does pay off in trading, but
don’t expect to strike it rich with a half-hearted or lackadaisical effort.
Candlestick Charts Require More Data
and Are More Difficult to Create
Okay, if you’re drawing your charts by hand then yes, candlesticks are
tougher to create. But with very few exceptions, candlestick charts are
widely available and can be created by using the same information that’s
used to make bar charts. For more info on all the electronic resources you
can tap into to view and build candlestick charts, flip back to Chapter 4.
The Trading Game Is Stacked 
against the Small Trader
This myth may have been true years ago, when almost all trading went
through a trading pit or floor specialist. Now that the Internet has trans-
formed trading into a mostly electronic medium, there aren’t professionals
standing between you and the execution of a trade. Technology has leveled
the playing field.
321
Chapter 16: Ten Myths about Charting, Trading, and Candlesticks

Also, professionals used to pay much lower commissions than individual
traders, but this too is in the past. There are several discount brokers that
charge individuals the same low rates that institutions and large traders pay
to trade. Small traders now have many versatile tools at their disposal and
can more than fend for themselves in most markets.

Selling short can be a difficult and nerve-racking business, especially when
working with stocks. There may be extra fees involved, and if your broker is
unable to borrow a particular stock, you may not even be able to put on the
desired short position. And keep in mind that the overall long-term trend of
the stock market is for prices to move higher, so you’re always trying to buck
the long-term trend when selling a stock short. Finally, in theory, the potential
loss on a short is unlimited, while buying a stock limits your losses to the
sum of your initial investment.
Despite all the downsides associated with shorting, I can honestly say that
it’s silly to assert that selling short is for professionals only. Not many indi-
viduals consider shorting, so there’s ample opportunity to make money at it.
If you’re interested in trying your hand at shorting, consider selling futures
contracts short as an initial effort. The barriers for shorting futures contracts
aren’t quite as high as those involved with shorting stocks. Plus there’s never
a futures contract that needs to be borrowed — you just short and wait for a
price drop to buy back.

Ten Tips to Remember about
Technical Analysis
In This Chapter
 Getting some sound advice on technical analysis
 Finding the right balance in your data
 Remembering to always back up your data
A
debate continues to rage about the validity and usefulness of technical
analysis in security trading. I’m a firm believer that, when used cor-
rectly, technical analysis is an outstanding trading and investing tool. There
are also other methods of investing and trading, but for my purposes, techni-
cal analysis combined with candlestick charting has worked quite well. As
you begin or continue your trading efforts, you almost certainly encounter
differing opinions on technical analysis, and I use this chapter to set out ten
points on the topic that you should remember as you cut through all the dis-
cussions and get down to the business of trading.
Charts Can Give False Signals
I am the first to admit that sometimes — in some cases up to 50 percent of
the time — signals can be wrong. If all signals were reliable, then you could
just see A and do B time after time, and you (and all your trading peers)
would rake in the profits.
But the reality is that charts do give false signals, and it’s up to you to use
proper money management to limit the losses that can occur when good sig-
nals go bad. Always use wise stops when you put on a trade, and remember
that when a signal fails, you must get out and move on.

People Will Give You a Hard Time
Some people regard charting and trading as nothing more than glorified gam-
bling or guessing at the future. Let them talk. Just smile and bite your tongue,
and think about the profit you just earned after closing out a winning posi-
tion. Remember, people tend to make fun of things they don’t understand.
Plenty of successful traders make a comfortable living using technical analy-
sis as a primary trading tool. One of them even owns a professional baseball
team. Who’s gonna try to ridicule you when you’re buying a sports franchise?
Okay, your trading goals may not be that lofty, but you see my point.
There’s No Definite Right or 
Wrong Opinion of a Chart
Because charting combines many factors and approaches, two traders or
analysts can view a chart and have two completely different opinions about
whether the chart is bullish or bearish. The reason for the differing points of
view may be as simple as the time frame that each trader has in mind for a
trade, or it can be something as unusual as one of the traders holding a bias
about a particular stock or market depicted on a chart. Regardless of the
reasons, both opinions have some measure of validity. Also, keep in mind it
takes a buyer and seller to make a market, so when you make a trade, the
other side of that trade has a differing opinion than you.
Try to remember that wrong opinions don’t exist, just those that don’t pan
out in a specific scenario. You want people to at least be open-minded about
your use of charts for trading and investing, right? So, you should offer
others the same level of respect and consideration. After all, differing
opinions are a crucial component of an active market!
A Single Chart Doesn’t Tell a Whole Story
Multiple factors affect the prices of securities, from the health of the overall
economy to industry-specific concerns to individual company events. And a
multitude of individuals trade specific stocks daily, all with a variety of goals
and time frames.
324
Part V: The Part of Tens 

One solitary chart can’t provide insight into what all the various players and
influences are hoping to accomplish as they buy and trade a security over a
period of time. Keep this in mind as you develop your trading strategy, and
be sure to look at charts with time frames that don’t necessarily match up
exactly with the time line you use for your trades.
For example, you may be looking for a trade that lasts two or three days — a
pretty short time frame. It certainly doesn’t hurt to look at charts with a
longer time frame as you search for a good environment for your trade. It
may be a little confidence booster if you believe some traders with a longer
time horizon are going to be on the same side as you! It’s well worth the small
amount of extra time and effort you spend to retrieve and study the addi-
tional chart.
Charting Is Part Science, Part Art
Although higher math is crucial for technical analysis, there’s also what I like
to refer to as the art component. Some people seem to have a knack for look-
ing at charts and getting an instant (and profitable) feel for how the future
trading action will develop with a stock or market. I think these few talented
individuals just have a sixth sense, much like traditional artists have natural
talents. These abilities are rare, but I’ve seen them in action. Unfortunately, it
wasn’t when I was looking in the mirror.
That said, I have been able to take the natural talents I do have for analyzing
charts and enhance them with study and practice. You can do the same! Keep
reading up on your patterns and maintain a watchful eye on your charts, and
you can develop the ability to analyze and trade quickly and efficiently, too.
You Can Overdo It
I stated earlier in this chapter that you should consider varying time frames
when putting together your trading ideas, but make sure you don’t overdo it!
How can you overdo it? You can look at so many time frames and indicators
that you end up seeing both bullish and bearish features on every security
you analyze. You can end up with so much information influencing your opin-
ion in both directions that you develop analysis paralysis, and you can’t
make a decision.
325
Chapter 17: Ten Tips to Remember about Technical Analysis

Don’t overcomplicate your trades. Look at a few charts, draw your conclu-
sions, and make a reasonable move. And don’t forget to place your stops
wisely! (For more information on stops, see the chapters with examples of
trades starting with Chapter 7 and running through Chapter 15.)
Develop a Backup System
Whatever system you choose for your charting and data needs — whether
it’s a high-end system that charges hundreds of dollars a month or a free 
Web site — make sure to have a backup plan. No matter how costly or clever,
systems do go down, and problems usually strike just when you need the sys-
tems the most. Make sure that you have a backup that you can rely on when
you’re faced with a system failure.
You should also have a backup system that you can use for confirmation
when something just doesn’t look right on a particular chart, or when it looks
too good to be true. Data errors are a part of the game, and using a backup
system for checking on what seems like a sure thing can save you some
heartache and losses.
For more information on how to choose a primary and backup system for
your data and trading needs, flip back to Chapter 4.
Error-Free Data Doesn’t Exist
I can’t emphasize the fact enough that error-free data isn’t possible. If you
start to back test your trading theories with historical data, keep in mind that
there are errors in almost all data. Personally, I use two sources of data and
compare them before performing tests, but I have the luxury of some pro-
gramming knowledge and access to several data sources.
If you’re on a limited budget, compare charts from two sources or use free
data from two sources and make sure everything matches up. If you spot dis-
crepancies, find a third data source and see which of your first two is correct!
No System Is Silly As Long As It Works
The world is filled with outrageous money-making theories, and the markets
are no exception. However, if you have an idea of what works in the market,
and you can properly test it and execute it to make consistent profits, your
326
Part V: The Part of Tens 

idea is worth incorporating in your strategy. I don’t care if you say, “When it
rains on Wall Street on a Friday it’s time to short the DIA ETF” — if it works
consistently, don’t discount it, no matter how ridiculous it may seem. If some-
thing works historically for you in real money situations, keep an open mind
when you’re considering whether to keep doing it.
Past Results Don’t Always Predict 
Future Performance
Sometimes the best laid trading plans just don’t work. You can come up with
a logical plan that’s worked in the past and execute it while following all the
right rules, and you can still fail to make money (or even lose it).
The market environment can change in erratic ways, and predicting what
your trading peers will do all the time is very difficult. If you trade long
enough, you’re bound to get knocked down in situations where you expected
to leap ahead. What’s the best thing to do when that happens? Dust yourself
off, chalk it up to experience, and begin looking for your next promising trade.
