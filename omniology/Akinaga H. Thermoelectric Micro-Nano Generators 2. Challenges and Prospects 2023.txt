Thermoelectric materials can be utilized in solid state devices (i.e. 
thermoelectric generators) to convert heat to electricity. They therefore are 
of high potential interest, in usages for conversion of waste heat to save 
energy, and as convenient and maintenance-free sources to power the huge 
number of Internet of Things (IoT) sensors. With this background in mind, 
the two volume edition of Thermoelectric Micro/Nano Generators has been 
brought together, to serve as an important, comprehensive set of books 
encompassing the fundamental principles, state of the art advancements, and 
outlooks for this topic, as also noted in the Preface of Thermoelectric 
Micro/Nano Generators 1. Volume 1 mainly dealt with the fundamental 
physics, materials and measurements of thermoelectrics. 
In this volume, Volume 2, we will mainly deal with the challenges and 
prospects, especially in relation to thermoelectric devices and applications, 
while also introducing some non-conventional attempts. As presented in 

x     Thermoelectric Micro/Nano Generators 2 
Volume 1, the performance of thermoelectric materials has greatly advanced 
in recent years, as has the development of sustainable, abundant elemental 
materials. There are still various aspects that must be addressed in order to 
bring thermoelectric materials to viable energy conversion applications, such 
as various applicative considerations related to devices, e.g. durability, 
processing, design, and identification of suitable applications. These are 
covered in this volume. After a brief introduction on the landscape of 
thermoelectric generators in energy harvesting technologies by several of the 
editors, a comprehensive chapter titled “Reliability and Durability of 
Thermoelectric Materials and Devices: Present Status and Strategies for 
Improvement” (Chapter 1) is given by Congcong Xu, Hongjing Shang, 
Zhongxin Liang, Fazhu Ding, and Zhifeng Ren. They present in detail 
several key issues to bridge the gap between fundamental thermoelectric 
research and the succesful implementation to thermoelectric applications. 
Firstly, they overview the thermal stability of several prominent, sustainable, 
high performance, new generation thermoelectric materials, i.e. Mg3(Sb.Bi)2-
type, Zn4Sb3, skutterudites, copper chalcogenides, and also GeTe, which can 
be the lead-free replacement to PbTe. They analyze any thermal or material 
stability issues and give routes for improvement of stability. Secondly, as the 
main part, they give a detailed analysis of thermal device design, since it is 
critically important to construct devices that are thermally and mechanically 
reliable. They consider thermal stress, such as from thermal cycling and 
shock, interface issues, such as contact, barrier layers and joining 
technologies, etc. and importantly, they give comprehensive guidelines for 
particular designs and strategies to address these issues. Finally, they give 
several illustrative detailed thermoelectric module case studies. 
Chapter 2, written by Chenguang Fu, Chaoliang Hu, Qi Zhang, Airan Li, 
and Tiejun Zhu, deals with “Effect of Microstructure in Understanding the 
Electronic Properties of Complex Materials”. As also reviewed in Volume 1, 
microstructuring has been demonstrated to be a very powerful method to 
selectively scatter phonons and enhance the figure of merit ZT. In this 
chapter, the authors focus on the detailed effects of such microstructuring on 
the electronic properties that are less well established. They demonstrate 
how to gain insight into this from experimental data of the Seebeck 
coefficient, electrical conductivity, mobility, and discuss strategies on how 
to minimize the detrimental effects on the electronic transport from point 
defects, grain boundaries texturing, etc., which are important for effective 
phonon scattering. The next three chapters cover developments of  
some novel systems/mechanisms. Olga Caballero-Calero and Marisol 
Martín-González review the developments in thermoelectric nanowires 

Preface     xi 
(Chapter 3). Nanowires are of interest for both thermoelectric and thermal 
conductivity aspects. The famous quantum confinement effect proposed by 
Hicks and Dresselhaus particularly targets nanowires, since it was proposed 
that in low dimensional nanostructures, the sharp features of the energy 
derivative of density of states could be utilized to enhance the Seebeck 
coefficient. Furthermore, the nanostructure could lower the thermal 
conductivity. Here the authors comprehensively present the fabrication 
methods, measurements and thermoelectric properties of nanowires 
regarding a wide variety of materials. They also cover nanowire-based 
devices and the outlook for these morphology materials and devices. Sylvie 
Hébert, Ramzy Daou, and Antoine Maignan cover the impact of chemical 
doping or magnetism in model thermoelectric sulfides (Chapter 4). They 
particularly focus on the intercalation stategy in the layered sulfide TiS2, and 
as a broad principle, the role that magnetism can play to enhance the 
Seebeck coefficient. Sulfides have followed oxides in being an interesting 
playground where magnetism can play a direct role in enhancing the entropy 
part of the Seebeck coefficient, for example. Such a mechanism is at least 
partly indicated for the CuCrTiS4 spinel, and doped CoS2 exhibits an 
interesting spin polarization dependence. Related to the magnetism and 
thermoelectricity theme, in Chapter 5, Akito Sakai and Satoru Nakatsuji 
review thermoelectric generation using the anomalous Nernst effect (ANE). 
While the anomalous Nernst effect is still much smaller than the Seebeck 
effect, recent advancements have shown a large increase in the effect from 
much smaller levels, and mechanisms such as dependence on the Berry 
curvature, Weyl points, etc. are becoming clearer. This chapter reviews such 
fundamental physics, and covers various topological magnets such as 
magnetic Weyl semimetal, Weyl magnet examples showing promising ANE 
features. In the final chapter of this section, Bin Xu, Harsh Chandra, and 
Junichiro Shiomi have written a useful counterpart to the previous chapter on 
the microstructure effects on the electrical transport with a comprehensive 
review of phonon engineering (Chapter 6). They review fundamentals in 
phonon transport, various methodology in measurements and computation, 
and phonon engineering such as via superlattices. One particular emphasis of 
the chapter is on discussing the breakdown and analysis of the anharmonic 
properties of phonons leading to low thermal conductivity. 
The final three chapters deal with thermoelectric devices and 
applications. The first by Slavko Bernik kicks off this section by giving an 
introductory overview of the current state of thermoelectric technologies and  
 
 

xii     Thermoelectric Micro/Nano Generators 2 
applications with prospects (Chapter 7). Starting with the background of 
thermoelectric applications, the author gives a broad overview on the various 
materials classes and discussions on considerations for applicability, and 
also goes into detail regarding the basic structure and various requirements 
for devices, including fill factor, integration, packaging, etc., and also 
considerations for the different power ranges for applications. Sylvain  
Le Tonquesse, Mathieu Pasturel, Franck Gascoin, and David Berthebaud 
write a detailed and practical treatise entitled “Processing of Thermoelectric 
Transition Metal Silicides Towards Module Development” (Chapter 8). 
Transition metal silicides have attracted attention because their respectable, 
while not ground-breaking, thermoelectric performance is augmented largely 
by their being very abundant, inexpensive, materials with generally good 
mechanical properties. The authors particularly focus on synthesis and 
processing methods with a view to being compatible to industry, and present

What is the essential infrastructure of our society? It is an Internet of 
Things (IoT) network where we can communicate and receive information. 
Nowadays it is possible to connect to every corner of the world with a 
smartphone. By sending and receiving information day and night across 
national borders, we can see what is happening around the world. Of course, 
in order to use information terminals such as smartphones, we need electric 
power. In everyday life, electric power can be obtained from outlets. Where  
 
 
 
 

xiv     Thermoelectric Micro/Nano Generators 2 
there is no outlet, for example, when traveling in the woods, you will 
probably carry a charger with you. However, it is not always possible to get  
enough electricity. If there is a natural disaster such as a typhoon or an 
earthquake, or if society becomes unstable for whatever reason, the power 
supply will stop for a long time. We must be able to run smartphones and 
generate enough power to communicate when needed. A thermoelectric 
generator is a technology that uses the heat around us to generate electricity. 
The dissipating heat can be harvested and converted into electric energy 
by thermoelectric energy harvesting (Snyder and Toberer 2008; Champier 
2017; O’Dwyer et al. 2017; Siddique et al. 2017; Akinaga et al. 2018; Haras 
and Skotnicki 2018; Kishore and Priya 2018; Mori and Priya 2018; 
Petsagkourakis et al. 2018; Yan et al. 2018; Akinaga 2020; Hewawasam  
et al. 2020; Jaziri et al. 2020; Nandihalli et al. 2020; Zoui et al. 2020; Tohidi 
et al. 2022). This effect is called the Seebeck effect, and when a temperature 
difference ΔT is given at two ends of a material, a voltage ΔV is generated as 
proportional to ΔT. The proportionality coefficient of this phenomenon  
S (= ΔV / ΔT) is called the Seebeck coefficient. The Seebeck effect occurs 
because the charge carriers diffuse when a temperature difference is applied 
to the material, which results in the electrical voltage, ΔV, to be generated. 
Thermoelectric materials are frequently evaluated by the dimensionless 
figure of merit ZT = (S2σ/κ)T, where σ is the electrical conductivity, κ is the 
thermal conductivity, and T is the absolute temperature. S2σ [W/m/K2] in the 
numerator is called the power factor (PF) and indicates how much power can 
be obtained with a temperature difference of 1℃ per unit length of the 
device under test.  
The thermoelectric conversion efficiency is given by η = ηCarnot[(1 + 
ZTm)1/2 − 1] / [(1 + ZTm)1/2 + Tc/Th], where the ideal Carnot efficiency ηCarnot 
= (Th − Tc)/Th, Th and Tc are the hot side and cold side temperatures, 
respectively, and Tm is the average temperature. 

Introduction     xv 
 
Figure I.1. Landscape of Thermoelectric Generators 
The long-standing issue in achieving high conversion efficiency in 
thermoelectric materials is how ZT has competing requirements in the 
physical properties of which it is comprised. It could be thought that the 
properties of thermoelectric materials should be metallic, because of σ in the 
numerator, and from an application standpoint, in order to decrease the 
contact resistance of the electrodes. However, ordinary metals cannot 
achieve a high thermoelectric conversion efficiency because the number of 
charge carriers does not greatly change with the temperature, and thereby 
Seebeck coefficients are typically small. Furthermore, S, σ and κ in the 
equation for ZT are functions of carrier concentration and are difficult to 
control independently.  Therefore, in order to achieve high thermoelectric 
performance, it is necessary to find a way to overcome these material 
paradoxes (Qian et al. 2021; Hendricks et al. 2022). For example, 
researchers have attempted to improve the effective thermoelectric 
properties of materials by utilizing nanotechnology and multi-disciplinary 
concepts. To give a couple non-conventional examples, the control of 

xvi     Thermoelectric Micro/Nano Generators 2 
thermal conduction in phononic crystals with a periodic nanostructure is an 
interesting approach (Nomura et al. 2018). The utilization of magnetic spin 
degrees of freedom is also a promising method (Koshibae et al. 2000; 
Uchida et al. 2008; Hendricks et al. 2022). Although various thermoelectric 
materials have been reported, a considerable number of them show a 
relatively large decrease in ZT near room temperature (RT). This is why 
Bi2Te3 has typically been almost the only choice of thermoelectric material 
near RT. It is also difficult to obtain a sufficiently large temperature 
difference near RT. Research to improve the properties of thermoelectric 
materials near RT is extremely important for the IoT application, and recent 
advances have been made (Wang et al. 2020; Liu et al. 2021, 2022; Oku  
et al. 2021). To increase the use of thermoelectric generators in society, it is 
also necessary to establish techniques for evaluating the various 
thermoelectric properties of materials and devices with a sufficiently high 
accuracy as well as reproducibility. The development of device, module and 
upscaling manufacturing processes developments, are also key issues for 
thermoelectric generators to achieve viable applications. 
If thermoelectric generator can replace batteries for IoT, it will have a 
huge social impact from the viewpoint of sustainability (Figure I.1). It will 
also enable us to deliver affordable, reliable and sustainable electricity to 
people around the world. Considering the amount of electricity, 
thermoelectric generators will contribute not only to the IoT field but rather 
to industries and transportation. It is well known that about 70% of the 
global primary energy is lost. Most of the energy is lost as waste heat and 
dumped into the environment (Forman et al. 2016). Although the 
temperature range of waste heat can be over 300 degrees, for a variety of 
applications, about 60% of the waste heat streams arise at a temperature 
below 100℃. In addition, global energy consumption is expected to increase 
by 40% by 2040 compared to 2015, according to International Energy 
Outlook (U.S. Energy Information Administration 2017). This outlook 
shows that the industrial sector continues to account for the largest share of 
energy consumption. 
The worldwide increasing demand in energy has increased social unrest 
and political tensions. Environmental impact of global climate change from 
the use of fossil fuels is among the most well-known challenges that 
humanity has ever faced. As a measure to solve these problems, diversified 
renewable energies are being promoted. There is a great tendency towards 
renewable energy sources, but unlike fossil fuel energy sources, renewable 
energy sources are unreliable and intermittent, requiring technological 

Introduction     xvii 
development to utilize them in a complementary way. Thus, our society 
needs stable and sustainable electricity. As a means to solve the 
abovementioned energy problems, the thermoelectric generator, which uses 
a large amount of waste heat that is constantly being generated, will become 
indispensable to our society as a stable and clean source of electricity.

1.1. Introduction 
The performance of a thermoelectric material is usually evaluated by its 
operating temperature (T) and three other interrelated parameters: electrical 
conductivity (σ), Seebeck coefficient (S) and thermal conductivity (k). These 
parameters together determine the thermoelectric dimensionless figure of 
merit (zT), 
2
.

 The thermoelectric conversion efficiency is  
 
 
 

4     Thermoelectric Micro/Nano Generators 2 
dependent on the zT. Theoretically, higher zT values can guarantee higher 
thermoelectric conversion efficiency, so there has been a great effort to 
improve zT over the past several decades, and the zT of some materials has 
been reported exceeding 2. Nevertheless, the development of thermoelectric 
devices has been somewhat lagging in comparison to the performance 
optimization of materials. 
Additional scientific and engineering challenges are faced during 
thermoelectric device development, including long-term material stability, 
material parameter matching, contact layer selection, device structure and 
thermoelectric system design, etc. Among these challenges, stability is a 
prerequisite for the actual application of materials. Since thermoelectric 
devices are operated under large temperature differences, the environment 
faced by thermoelectric materials, especially in thermoelectric power 
generators, is relatively harsh. Repeated thermal cycles, thermal shocks and 
high temperatures will not only reduce the thermomechanical properties of a 
material but may also change its composition, which ultimately leads to 
deterioration in the thermoelectric performance and even complete device 
failure. In addition, the potential thermal stress caused by repeated thermal 
expansion and contraction imposes more stringent requirements on the 
stability of the device interface and the thermomechanical matching of the  
p- and n-type materials. Unfortunately, in comparison to the effort to 
improve zT, less attention has been paid to the stability issue for 
thermoelectric materials and devices, limiting their practical application. 
Here, we will highlight this issue and bridge the gap between 
thermoelectric research and actual applications by discussing the durability 
and reliability challenges of both thermoelectric materials and devices. We 
first address the thermal stability of several thermoelectric materials and 
strategies for thermal stability improvement. Secondly, we analyze in detail 
thermoelectric device design, including thermal stress and interface issues. 
Finally, we summarize recent progress in the design and fabrication of 
reliable and durable thermoelectric modules and provide an outlook for 
future research needs. 
 

Reliability and Durability of Thermoelectric Materials and Devices     5 
1.2. Thermoelectric material stability 
For actual applications, a material’s stability is at least as critical as its 
thermoelectric properties, if not more important. Different kinds of  
instability, including component decomposition, elemental evaporation and 
phase transition, can result in the degradation of thermoelectric material 
performance, further leading to the decreased energy-conversion efficiency 
of thermoelectric modules. In the following section, typical instability issues 
of several materials with decent thermoelectric performances are discussed 
in detail. Strategies that have been used to improve the thermal stability of 
these materials are also summarized and discussed. 
1.3. Mg3(Sb, Bi)2  
Mg3(Sb, Bi)2 exhibits a CaAl2Si2-type crystal structure consisting of an 
octahedrally coordinated Mg2+ cation layer and a tetrahedrally coordinated 
anion structure [(Mg2Sb2)2-] (Shuai et al. 2017a; Song et al. 2019; Mao et al. 
2018). It had long been considered a p-type semiconductor with 
undistinguished performance, but Te-doped n-type Mg3(Sb, Bi)2-based alloys 
were recently reported to show high thermoelectric performance, 
demonstrating good potential for both power generation and cooling 
applications (Tamaki et al. 2016; Zhang et al. 2017). Subsequently, various 
strategies, including tuning the carrier scattering mechanism (Mao et al. 
2017a; Shuai et al. 2017b), defect engineering (Mao et al. 2017b; Li et al. 
2019, 2020a) and doping (Shi et al. 2019b, 2019c; Shu et al. 2019), have been 
successfully applied in Mg3Sb2-based alloys, achieving a state-of-the-art 
average zT value up to 1.1 in the range of 300~500 K (Imasato et al. 2019a; 
Shi et al. 2019a; Shang et al. 2020a; Wood et al. 2019).  
Among all defects in Mg3Sb2-based materials, Mg vacancies have the 
lowest defect formation energy around the Fermi level, thus resulting in the 
intrinsically high concentration of Mg vacancies causing p-type conduction 
of these materials (Zhang et al. 2019). The addition of extra Mg into the 
matrix has been reported to be successful in reducing the Mg-vacancy 
concentration and achieving n-type conduction (Shuai et al. 2018; Kuo et al. 
2019). At the operating temperature of 773 K, the corresponding vapor 
pressures of elemental Mg, Sb and Bi are 7,390 Pa, 139 Pa and 9.64 Pa,  
 
 
 

6     Thermoelectric Micro/Nano Generators 2 
respectively. Such a great difference in vapor pressure will result in 
significant Mg loss at high temperatures. Jørgensen et al. (2018) studied the 
thermal stability of Mg3Sb1.475Bi0.475Te0.05 via high-temperature synchrotron 
powder X-ray diffraction and found that a Bi impurity phase forms in 
thermal cycles from 300 K to 725 K, suggesting the compound’s  
high-temperature structural instability. Shang et al. (2020b) reported that 
Mg3Sb2-xBix 
alloys 
(Mg3.2Sb1.5Bi0.49Te0.01, 
Mg3.2SbBi0.99Te0.01 
and 
Mg3.2Sb0.49Bi1.5Te0.01) showed performance degradation at 673 K and 773 K 
via long-term in situ measurements of their thermoelectric properties, 
although they demonstrated the stable electrical properties of these 
compounds at 573 K, as shown in Figure 1.1. It can be seen that the Seebeck 
coefficient of Mg3.2Sb0.49Bi1.5Te0.01 crosses over from negative values  
(n-type) to positive values (p-type) at 773 K, which has been attributed to the 
Mg loss notable by microstructural analysis and results in the formation of 
Mg vacancies that pin the Fermi level, eventually enabling the p-type 
conduction. Fortunately, coating the surfaces of the Mg3Sb2-xBix alloys  
with boron nitride was found to significantly improve their thermal stability 
by 
effectively 
limiting 
Mg 
loss 
at 
high 
temperatures. 
The  
time-dependent Hall carrier concentration of Mg3Sb2-xBix with cationic 
doping by La (Imasato et al. 2018), Yb (Wood et al. 2020) and Y (Shi et al. 
2019c) at high temperatures and in a dynamic vacuum was also explored, 
and the cation-doped samples showed a delayed decrease in the carrier 
concentration compared with their Te-doped counterparts, indicating that 
doping with a cation rather than with Te can also improve the thermal 
stability of Mg3Sb2-xBix to some extent. Considering the large differences in 
the vapor pressures of the elements in Mg3Sb2-xBix, high-temperature Mg 
loss that results in structural instability and decreased thermoelectric 
performance is common, thus restricting the operating temperature ranges of 
these materials. This disadvantage overshadows the high-temperature zT 
values and makes practical applications less appealing at temperatures higher 
than 673 K. Therefore, determining how to improve the thermal stability of 
Mg3Sb2-xBix compounds is more significant than simply focusing on 
enhancing their zT values.

1.4. Zn4Sb3 
β-Zn4Sb3 is a well-known p-type thermoelectric material for applications 
in the intermediate temperature range (473~673 K) and exhibits high zT 
values up to 1.3 at 673 K (Zou et al. 2015). The high thermoelectric 
performance of β-Zn4Sb3 and its good potential for thermoelectric applications 
mainly result from its low lattice thermal conductivity (~0.3 W m-1 K-1 above 
500 K), which is largely caused by its disordered structure that includes 
interstitial Zn (Dasgupta et al. 2013).  
However, with the increasing temperature, β-Zn4Sb3 starts to decompose 
at 473 K due to a loss of Zn, forming ZnSb and Zn as decomposition 

8     Thermoelectric Micro/Nano Generators 2 
productions and degrading its thermoelectric performance (Hao et al. 2011; 
Yang et al. 2017a, 2017b). Thus, it is of great significance to improve the 
thermal stability of β-Zn4Sb3 for practical applications. Based on both 
experimental results and theoretical calculations, doping with heavier metals 
can hamper the Zn migration and subsequently freeze β-Zn4Sb3 in its local 
disordered structure, eventually improving its thermal stability. It has also 
been found that this doping strategy can optimize the compound’s electrical 
properties. For example, Wang et al. reported that Pb-doped β-Zn4Sb3
 shows 
increased carrier mobility, achieving an optimized zT value of ~1.2 at 660 K 
(Wang et al. 2012), while its thermal stability is clearly improved due to  
the decreased Zn evaporation at high temperatures. Similar results were  
also reported by Deng et al. (2017). Furthermore, the addition of any of  
Ag (Song et al. 2018), Cd (Yin et al. 2010), Ge (Moghaddam et al. 2019), 
In/Sn (Shai et al. 2015), ZnO (Tang et al. 2015), etc. into β-Zn4Sb3  
can also simultaneously improve its thermoelectric performance and  
high-temperature stability.  
1.5. Skutterudites 
In recent years, skutterudite-based materials have attracted significant 
attention due to their outstanding performance over a wide temperature 
range and their relatively inexpensive constituent elements. Among  
the various kinds of skutterudites, CoSb3, a diamagnetic (Co3+, 3d6)  
narrow-bandgap semiconductor, demonstrates high carrier mobility and a 
relatively 
large 
effective 
electron 
mass. 
Generally, 
CoSb3-based 
thermoelectric generators can operate at temperatures up to 773 K. However, 
a series of studies have revealed that CoSb3-based skutterudites undergo 
oxidation and Sb sublimation when the operating temperature exceeds  
673 K, resulting in short service life (Sales et al. 1996; Zhang et al. 2016; 
Liu et al. 2020). Therefore, effective and reliable approaches are needed to 
address these instability issues. 
The most effective method reported thus far is physical isolation, or 
inhibiting the sublimation of elements by spraying on a protective coating 
such as metal (El-Genk et al. 2006), ceramic (Zhang et al. 2016; Chen et al. 
2013), glass (Dong et al. 2012), aerogel (Sakamoto et al. 2008) or a 
multilayered composite (Xia et al. 2014; Zhang et al. 2016). Introduction of 
the coating under certain conditions can indeed improve the stability of 
CoSb3-based skutterudites at high temperatures, but it may result in some 
new problems at the same time. For example, the diffusion of a metal 

Reliability and Durability of Thermoelectric Materials and Devices     9 
coating into the thermoelectric legs may result in decreasing performance 
over increasing thermal cycles (Dong et al. 2012). Moreover, the metal 
coating would cause an electrical short in actual applications. Although 
aerogel coating is highly robust and resistant to high temperatures, it could 
include micropores that may serve as escape channels for elemental oxidation 
and sublimation. Coating with another material such as glass or a ceramic  
may result in a mismatch of coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE) values or 
poor adhesion strength. Thus, coating with a multilayered structure consisting 
of different kinds of material is proposed. Zhang et al. (2016) reported a more 
effective multilayered coating with Mo, SiOx and glass-ceramic layers. As 
shown in Figure 1.2, compared with samples without coating and with 
single-layered coating, that with the multilayered coating exhibits better 
stability in air at 873 K, indicating the effective suppression of both 
oxidation and sublimation. Nevertheless, suppressing decomposition in and 
improving the stability of skutterudite-based materials remain very 
challenging in practical application scenarios.

1.6. Cu2-xX (X = S, Se, Te) 
Copper chalcogenides Cu2-xX (X = S, Se, Te) possess complex atomic 
arrangements, and the Cu-deficient region in the Cu–Se system (Cu2-xSe) 

10     Thermoelectric Micro/Nano Generators 2 
exhibits two distinct phases, a low-temperature α phase and an  
intermediate-temperature β phase (Liu et al. 2012). The low-temperature α 
phase with a low-symmetry crystal structure, where the Cu atoms are 
ordered and not superionic, is stable up to ~400 K and eventually transitions 
to the intermediate-temperature β phase with a cubic structure at ~400 K. In 
the β phase, the superionic Cu ions are kinetically disordered, leading to its 
remarkably low thermal conductivity and high thermoelectric performance. 
Significant advances have recently been obtained in studies of the p-type 
Cu2-xSe materials, and the zT value reportedly reaches 2.4 at 1,000 K for  
Cu2-xSe/carbon nanotube (CNT) hybrid materials, showing promise for 
applications (Nunn et al. 2017, Lu et al. 2020b, Zhang et al. 2020b).

rate of 10 K/min. Reprinted from Liu et al. (2019) 
Unfortunately, Cu2-xSe materials suffer from thermal instability issues 
when they are applied at a high temperature and exposed to a large current, 
limiting their application in large-scale thermoelectric power generation (Shi 
et al. 2020). Thus, it is urgent to find out the mechanism of the instability 
issues of Cu2-xSe materials and improve their performance liability. Bohra  
et al. (2016) studied the effects of thermal cycles on the thermoelectric 
properties of Cu2-xSe in the temperature range of 320~1,070 K and found 
that electrical resistance increased with increasing thermal cycles, resulting 
in a reduction in the power factor from 13 μW cm-1 K-2 for the first cycle to 

Reliability and Durability of Thermoelectric Materials and Devices     11 
8 μW cm-1 K-2 for the third cycle at ~1,070 K. This change was attributed to 
Se loss and phase transition with increasing thermal cycles. Xue et al. (2019) 
reported that a high synthesis temperature not only enhances the 
thermoelectric performance of Cu2-xSe but also effectively improves its 
thermal stability; specifically, the Seebeck coefficient, electrical conductivity 
and thermal conductivity were found to be nearly constant between the 
heating and cooling cycles over the temperature range of 300~723 K for a 
sample fabricated at 1,273 K. Furthermore, a Ni/Mo/Cu1.96Se0.8S0.2 
thermoelectric unileg was able to exhibit a very steady power output over 
400 thermal cycles between 473 K and 873 K through the control of its 
chemical composition (Mao et al. 2019b). Other dopants, such as Li (Kang  
et al. 2017), CNTs (Nunn et al. 2017), W (Bohra et al. 2020) and Cd  
(Lu et al. 2020a), can also improve the thermal stability of Cu2-xSe  
materials, allowing them to be applied for power generation. Additionally, 
single-crystal α-Cu2-xSe was fabricated using the Bi-flux method and no 
weight loss occurred below the melting point (~1,403 K), as shown by the 
thermogravimetric-differential thermal analysis (TG-DTA) results displayed 
in Figure 1.3. The DTA curve shows the endothermic peak at ~400 K, which 
has been attributed to the Cu2Se α–β phase transformation. The power factor 
of the single-crystal samples did not obviously decrease after three thermal 
cycles in the temperature range of 300~690 K, demonstrating their improved 
thermal stability compared with the polycrystalline materials (Liu et al. 
2019). However, single crystals are usually more expensive than the 
polycrystalline materials, so they are not preferred for large-scale 
applications. 
1.7. GeTe 
GeTe-based thermoelectric materials were first studied in the 1960s, and 
they re-emerged as a subject of research interest only recently. Thanks to 
band engineering and defect engineering strategies, the zT values exceeding 
2 have been achieved in GeTe-based materials, showing their promise for 
applications (Hong et al. 2020; Zhang et al. 2020a). Nevertheless, the actual 
application of GeTe-based modules have a major obstacle to overcome 
concerning how the pristine GeTe undergoes a reversible transition between 
a low-temperature rhombohedral structure and a high-temperature cubic 
structure around 700 K, as illustrated in Figure 1.4. It should be noted that 
such structural instability can seriously reduce the reliability of devices if it 
is not handled properly. Additionally, there is a considerable change in  
the coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE) between the two phases 

12     Thermoelectric Micro/Nano Generators 2 
(11.2×10-6 K-1 for the rhombohedral structure and 23.4×10-6 K-1 for the cubic 
structure), and such CTE change is extremely detrimental in device 
applications since it can cause significant thermal stress during operation 
(Xing et al. 2021). Thus, methods to suppress the phase transition are 
required. 
Fortunately, Liu et al. (2018) successfully obtained GeTe-based material 
that is in the cubic phase over the entire operating temperature range through 
simple Mn and Bi co-doping at the Ge site. Soon afterwards, Zheng et al. 
(2018) reported that the lower-temperature cubic GeTe can also be achieved 
by Mn and Sb co-doping and found that the transition temperature was 
reduced from 700 K closer to room temperature. The above two studies 
show that Mn plays a significant role in inhibiting the phase transition.  
Bi and Sb can also adjust the crystal structure to a certain extent, but they are 
more responsible for regulating the carrier concentration. Recently, resonant 
bonding properties induced by a symmetrized crystal lattice were found in 
the Ti-doped GeTe-based material (Li et al. 2020c). Ti doping not only can 
reduce the lattice constant c/a ratio to achieve a cubic structure but can also 
enhance the Seebeck coefficient due to the increased band degeneracy 
(Shuai et al. 2019).

1.8. Outlook on thermoelectric materials stability 
Admittedly, the instability issue is universal in thermoelectric materials 
because of their weak chemical bonding and highly disordered content. In 
this section, different typical instability issues faced by several kinds of 

Reliability and Durability of Thermoelectric Materials and Devices     13 
materials were briefly introduced, and the corresponding strategies to 
address these issues were also discussed in detail. In addition to the  
above-discussed thermoelectric materials, other promising materials with 
excellent thermoelectric performance, including PbTe (Wang et al. 2018), 
BiCuSeO (Li et al. 2014) and half-Heuslers (Rausch et al. 2016), also suffer 
from thermal instability, which markedly impedes their commercial 
applications, especially for the generation of thermoelectric power. 
Generally, the instability issue can be solved either chemically or physically. 
From a chemical point of view, doping or heat treatment can improve the 
stability of a thermoelectric material’s constituent elements and structure on 
a microscopic level. For some special materials with phase transitions, 
reasonable chemical doping can alter the phase-transition point, thereby 
avoiding the instability of the material in the operating temperature range. 
From a physical point of view, isolating a material from the external 
environment, such as with a coating or through vacuum packaging, is also an 
effective measure to effectively enhance its stability. These strategies should 
be thoroughly evaluated and rationalized in future studies with the help of 
advanced characterization tools and theoretical simulations. Without these 
methods, it would be difficult to understand the origin of phase-transition 
regulation or structure-stability preservation when introducing external 
dopants. In addition, for long-term stability, developing a rapid and scalable 
method for preparing thermoelectric materials with fewer defects is 
advantageous. In short, to achieve the practical uses of thermoelectric 
materials, greater efforts should be made with enhancing the thermal 
stability of existing materials and searching for new materials with both high 
performance and good stability. In particular, reporting the stability data of 
high-zT materials together with their transport property measurements is 
recommended for at least the papers on device performance.  
1.9. Thermoelectric device design analysis 
1.9.1. Thermal stress analysis  
Despite the tremendous improvements in thermoelectric material 
performance over the last several decades, research into building thermally 
and mechanically reliable devices has been very slow. Since thermoelectric 
modules are subjected to large temperature gradients over long periods, the 
thermomechanical properties and thermal stability of various constituent 
components must be considered in device design and manufacturing (Karri 
et al. 2018). Significant thermal stress, deformation and even failure may 

14     Thermoelectric Micro/Nano Generators 2 
occur in thermoelectric devices due to mismatches in the thermal, 
mechanical and rheological properties of the constituent components caused 
by material specificity, cyclic thermal loading and possible mechanical 
vibration (Music et al. 2016). As a result, in designing a thermoelectric 
device, it is critical to conduct temperature distribution and thermal stress 
analyses in order to effectively reduce thermal stress through material 
selection 
or 
structure 
optimization. 
The 
main 
aim 
of 
such 
a 
thermomechanical stress study is to maintain the thermoelectric device’s 
high output performance under a long-term operation. 
In this section, thermomechanical stress in thermoelectric modules is 
discussed in depth. We first discuss the coefficient of thermal expansion, 
which is a significant factor in determining thermal stress, as well as other 
design considerations relevant to thermal stress, including module 
configuration and geometry. We then present an analysis of the lowest value 
of thermal conductivity based on the maximum allowable thermal shear 
stress, emphasizing the importance of balancing the high zT generated by 
phonon scattering with mechanical reliability. These analyses elucidate the 
relationship between the above factors and the performance, reliability and 
durability of thermoelectric devices, shedding light on the optimal design of 
reliable thermoelectric devices. 
1.9.1.1. Coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE) 
The coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE, α ) of a material is its length 
change in response to temperature variation. Differing expansion of 
constituent parts of a thermoelectric device under a considerable temperature 
gradient would result in high thermal stress and hence a greater risk of 
interfacial damage during long-term operation (He et al. 2018). For example, 
cracking or exfoliation at the interface of an oxide-based module is due to 
the widely differing CTEs of oxides and metallic contact materials (Liu et al. 
2015).  
The temperature-gradient-induced mechanical stress

product (Eα) for representative thermoelectric materials. Data obtained from Ni et al.

conductivity (r) for pure metals. Data obtained from Chowdhury et al. (2009). For a 
color version of this figure, see www.iste.co.uk/akinaga/thermoelectric2.zip 
Clearly, a large CTE value and a high Young’s modulus are undesirable 
for reduced thermal stress. According to calculation results, a CTE mismatch 
between different components in a thermoelectric module can result in 
excessive thermal stress and in situ fracture (Ravi et al. 2009). In other 
words, CTE has a significant impact on the module’s thermomechanical 
robustness. Hence, obtaining thermal expansion statistics for commonly used 
thermoelectric materials and investigating the underlying relationship 
between the structure and the thermal expansion coefficient of each  
are critical for achieving thermally match systems in thermoelectric  
devices. 
The 
measured 
CTE 
results 
for 
commonly 
investigated 
thermoelectric materials with high zT values are summarized in Figure 1.5a. 
Clearly, most high-performance thermoelectrics have CTE values of more 
than 15 × 10-6 K-1, which can be attributed to the weak chemical bonding in 
these materials that also results in their low lattice thermal conductivity. The 
large CTE values emphasize the importance of selecting appropriate metal 
electrodes and designing reliable contact layers for the thermoelectric legs in 
a module in order to reduce thermal stress (Ni et al. 2013). Additionally, the 
CTE values of thermoelectric compounds should be optimized to establish 
better matches between p- and n-type materials or between thermoelectric 
materials and electrodes by tuning the compositions, filler atoms, grain sizes 
(Rogl et al. 2017) and additives (Rogl et al. 2010). However, these solutions  
 

16     Thermoelectric Micro/Nano Generators 2 
need to be carefully examined to ensure that high zT values are retained. The 
CTE and electrical conductivity values of pure metals are shown in  
Figure 1.5b as a reference to choose suitable contact layers for both CTE 
matching and low electrical resistivity. Music et al. (2016) used the first-
principles calculation method to investigate the thermomechanical response of  
20 thermoelectrics. They found that oxides exhibit larger products of linear 
thermal expansion coefficient and elastic modulus, implying that 
thermoelectric oxides are susceptible to thermally induced stress, shock and 
fatigue. For convenience in prediction and matching, it was also suggested that 
equilibrium volume, an easily measurable parameter, can be used to estimate 
this product and the thermal response of thermoelectric materials. 
1.9.1.2. Module configuration and geometry design  
Realizing high conversion efficiency or output power density in a 
thermoelectric module relies on a specific configuration and geometry, so its 
fabrication always involves the design and optimization of these factors (Wu 
et al. 2014). The principle of thermoelectric device configuration design is to 
minimize the internal stress caused by temperature difference and thermal 
shock while making full use of the heat source. 
The π-shaped, O-shaped and Y-shaped structures, schematically 
illustrated in Figure 1.6, are the most common thermoelectric-module 
configurations (Zhang et al. 2016). In a typical π-shaped module as shown in 
Figure 1.6a, many thermoelectric unicouples consisting of an n-type leg and 
a p-type leg are connected electrically in series and thermally in parallel. In 
order to maximize the use of temperature differences, the direction of heat 
flow is usually perpendicular to the substrate. It should be noted that when 
this design is applied at higher temperatures, the thermally induced stress, 
expansion and diffusion of different materials should be thoroughly 
considered because the repeated heat shock may cause severe deformation 
and even device failure, especially at the contacts. An O-shaped module 
(Figure 1.6b) consists of a coaxial assembly of many annular flat gaskets 
consisting of alternating n- and p-type thermoelectric rings. Compared to the 
π-shaped configuration, the O-shaped configuration makes it easier to 
achieve device integration, efficient heat transfer and low-stress structure 
design, but the manufacturing and joining technology needed for the 
specially shaped thermoelectric elements and the metal electrodes is very 
difficult to master if not impossible. The Y-shaped module configuration 
(Figure 1.6c) has been designed mainly to eliminate the impact of thermal 
expansion mismatch between different constituent components while 

Reliability and Durability of Thermoelectric Materials and Devices     17 
maintaining excellent thermoelectric performance. In this configuration, 
rectangular n- and p-type thermoelectric materials are alternately connected 
to electrode plates in a sandwich structure, which allows the thermoelectric 
elements to be maintained in a non-fully constrained state and reduces the 
thermal expansion and deformation caused by the constraints of the hot and 
cold sides. The horizontal series connection of the n- and p-type materials 
also avoids the stress concentration caused by the difference in their thermal 
expansion coefficients.

modules. Reprinted from Zhang et al. (2016). For a color version  
of this figure, see www.iste.co.uk/akinaga/thermoelectric2.zip 
In addition to the shape of the module, the unicouple geometry plays an 
important role in maximizing performance and maintaining it under large 
thermal stress (Shittu et al. 2020). Recent thermodynamic and thermal stress 
studies of thermoelectric generators have revealed that the highest stress 
level is found at the edges of a module, particularly those on its hot side  
(Al-Merbati et al. 2013). By tuning the pin geometry, the temperature 
variation can be improved, and thus the lifetime of the module can be 

18     Thermoelectric Micro/Nano Generators 2 
prolonged. Fabián-Mijangos et al. (2017) compared the effects of various leg 
shapes, including square, hexagon, octagon and circular prisms, on overall 
thermal stress and found that cylindrical legs are preferable under the fixed 
hot side condition, while square prisms are more reliable under the free hot 
side condition. Although modifying the leg dimensions can improve a 
module’s thermal reliability, a unilateral focus on thermodynamic properties 
may result in low output-power performance. Erturun et al. (2015) found 
that there is an inverse relationship between output performance and  
thermal integrity by using three-dimensional finite-element analysis and 
experiments, indicating the importance of determining the optimal shape for 
balancing performance and stability. More specifically, Sarhadi et al. (2015) 
recommended that the thermoelectric legs should be long enough to achieve 
high efficiency and low thermal stress while short enough to maintain a high 
output power density. A segmented module presents a more complicated 
situation since more factors are involved in its structural optimization. In 
most cases, a compatibility factor match between segmented materials is 
sufficient to produce an effective segmented device. However, Jia et al. 
(2014) noted that when considering the strength requirements, a high 
conversion efficiency in a segmented device is not always possible. In short, 
multi-parameter optimization of thermoelectric generators is required to 
achieve both maximum efficiency and structural reliability. 
Modulating the hot-side design of a thermoelectric device by taking into 
consideration the connection structure and heat flux direction is another 
strategy to reduce thermal stress and obtain a durable interface. Sun et al. 
(2021) examined a new design that uses a step structure of ceramic plates 
with thermoelectric legs inserted into them, which separates the heat and 
current conduction paths at the hot-side electrode (Figure 1.7). As a result, 
interconnect cracking is only affected by the connection between the  
hot-side ceramic plate and the metallic interconnect adjacent to it, which 
reduces the thermal stress damage of the interconnect and increases the 
number of operation cycles prior to failure. Additionally, the design was 
calculated to have a favorable impact on the module’s power output 
performance, showing simultaneous improvement in thermomechanical 
stability and thermoelectric performance. In the future, a real module should 
be prepared and evaluated to substantiate this new design and initiate further 
improvements, and also to show the cost difference since the new design will 
be more expensive. 

Reliability and Durability of Thermoelectric Materials and Devices     19

conventional thermoelectric unicouple geometry and (b–e) the new hot-side design 
geometry with different parameters. Reprinted from Sun et al. (2021). For a color 
version of this figure, see www.iste.co.uk/akinaga/thermoelectric2.zip 
When considering the substrate design specifically, there are two main 
strategies for protecting the module from thermal stress. Increasing the 
thickness of the ceramic plates can relieve thermal stress while ensuring that 
the device’s output performance remains nearly constant. Another effective 
way to reduce thermal stress is to replace rigid substrates with compliant 
pads for electrical insulation (Kambe et al. 2010). Nevertheless, in this case, 
the derived module will be mechanically weak and will need additional 
encapsulation. Most thermoelectric modules currently investigated use 
alumina substrates because of their high thermal conductivity. A Cu 
electrode strip can be deposited onto each substrate prior to assembly. The 
thickness of the Cu electrode strips can be adjusted according to the 
maximum expected output current of the module.  
1.9.1.3. Materials design for reduced thermal stress: engineering 
thermal conductivity κeng 
Decreasing lattice thermal conductivity by introducing multi-scale 
microstructures has been widely applied to improve the performance of 
thermoelectric materials. In particular, nanostructured grains are proposed to  
 
 

20     Thermoelectric Micro/Nano Generators 2 
scatter phonons significantly without degrading electrical transport, which is 
beneficial for the overall improvement of zT values. Intuitively, the 
thermoelectric performance of a material would be significantly improved if 
its lattice thermal conductivity could be reduced to the minimal value 
predicted by theoretical calculations. However, because of the corresponding 
weak chemical bonding and significant anharmonicity, materials with 
exceptionally low lattice thermal conductivity are usually brittle, limiting 
their practical applications. In other words, even though carrier mobility is 
unaffected, the low lattice thermal conductivity attained by creating vast 
defects may degrade mechanical strength and stability since thermoelements 
will be subjected to large thermal gradients and thermal stress. Thus, 
reconsidering the phonon scattering technique is critical to balancing zT 
values and mechanical brittleness. Inspiringly, Kim et al. (2016) 
hypothesized that when exposing materials to shear thermal stress, there is a 
minimal value of thermal conductivity which is safe to employ (Figure 1.8). 
To begin, they proposed that there is an appropriate range of leg length (L), 
where the lower limit of leg length (Lmin) is dictated by the yield strength and 
the upper limit of leg length (Lmax) may be computed using thermoelectric 
material parameters and boundary conditions. For materials with higher 
thermal conductivity, a larger value of Lmax could be expected for a fixed 
cold-side temperature. If Lmax is greater than Lmin, it is safe to reduce the 
thermal conductivity so that Lmax is closer to Lmin, therefore enhancing the 
efficiency of the device. Engineering thermal conductivity (κeng) is the 
thermal conductivity value when Lmin and Lmax are the same. Thus, κeng can 
be defined as the lower limit of a material’s thermal conductivity that still 
assures the device’s thermal reliability in a steady-state operation. On the 
other hand, since thermoelectric devices are subjected to thermal loading and 
thermal shock in real applications, it is also important to investigate the 
minimum thermal conductivity of thermoelectric materials during transient 
operation, which can be estimated from the dynamic boundary conditions 
and the thermomechanical properties of the materials. Based on these 
findings, Kim et al. (2016) investigated a Bi2Te3-based module as a case 
study and found that further reduction in thermal conductivity for zT 
improvement should not be attempted because the thermal conductivity of  
current-generation p-type Bi2Te3 already approaches the steady-state κeng. In 
contrast, more reliable performance improvement may rely on boosting its 
electrical properties.

1.9.2. Interface analysis, design and fabrication  
The interfaces between thermoelectric materials and metal electrodes in a 
thermoelectric device undergo complex physical and chemical processes 
during operation due to repeated thermal cycling and thermal shock. In 
addition to the thermal stress mentioned above, more engineering problems, 
such as bonding strength, contact resistance and high-temperature diffusion, 
are confronted when considering interfaces. These issues have a great impact 
on the reliability and durability of the device. In the following section, the 
relationship between the interface properties and the device performance, as 
well as the failure behavior of the interfaces are first analyzed in detail, 
demonstrating the great importance of the interfaces. Subsequently, general 
selection and design principles for high-performance and reliable interfaces 
are introduced.  
1.9.2.1. Interface-induced performance degradation and device failure 
Contact thermal and electrical resistance at the interfaces between 
different components of the module will result in lower power output 
performance because of the wasted electricity and heat. Such a performance 

22     Thermoelectric Micro/Nano Generators 2 
discrepancy can occur at either a pristine imperfect joining or an interface 
that is increasingly degraded over long-term thermal cycles. In order to 
evaluate the effect of the interface contacts on device performance, Kim 
(2018) developed a numerical method for the performance analysis of 
thermoelectric generators with thermal and electrical contact resistance, in 
which the effectiveness was defined as the ratio of the thermoelectric 
generator’s power output with any resistance to that without resistance. 
Effectiveness thus indicates how much of the potential performance is 
actually achieved in the presence of any resistance, and the corresponding 
mathematical results and numerical modeling for this parameter are shown 
in Figure 1.9. It is clear that the effectiveness increases with increasing 
thermal contact conductance (i.e. decreasing thermal contact resistance) and 
decreases with increasing electrical contact resistivity. According to the 
numerical simulation, low contact thermal conductance can cause 
performance degradation of up to ~30%, while large electrical contact 
resistivity can cause performance degradation of more than 40%. The results 
of this study emphasize the importance of interfaces on the actual 
performance of thermoelectric generators.

on this formula, the relationship between COPrev and the length of the 
thermoelectric material at different

It is clear that COPrev varies under different 
ratio
κ
 and 
ratio
ρ
 values. The 
COPrev of a 1-mm leg increases by ~18.6% when 
ratio
κ
 decreases from 0.1 to 
0.001 (i.e. the thermal conductivity of the contact layer increases), while it 
decreases by ~12.6% when 
ratio
ρ
 increases from 0.1 mm to 0.2 mm (i.e. the 
electrical resistivity of the contact layer increases). A dramatic decrease can 
be observed in COPrev when the length of the thermoelectric leg is less than  
2 mm. The thermal and electrical resistance of the contact layer become 
increasingly more important once the length of the thermoelectric leg is 
relatively short. Therefore, in thermoelectric cooling devices, for which the 
service environment is not as harsh as that for the thermoelectric generators, 
a relatively slight increase in contact resistance still leads to notable 
degradation in the cooling performance.  
In actual applications, device failure frequently occurs at the interfaces 
which undergo repeated thermal shocks, which place greater demands on the 
interfaces. Figure 1.11 shows the results of long-term thermal stability 
testing of a MnSi1.77/Mg2Si1-xSnx-based thermoelectric module (Mejri et al. 
2020) and a Bi2Te3-based thermoelectric leg (Barako et al. 2012). For the 
MnSi1.77/Mg2Si1-xSnx-based thermoelectric generator, the thermoelectric legs 
were soldered to metalized ceramic plates using silver, as shown in  
Figure 1.11a. The barrier layer between the legs and the solder consists of a

thin layer of Au/Ti (300/100 nm). During testing, thermal cycling between 
423 K and 673 K was applied at the hot side of the module while its cold 
side was maintained at 323 K. After 400 cycles (~100 hours) of testing, 
serious cracks occurred at the hot-side material interface, as shown in  
Figure 1.11b. In another example, Bi2Te3-based thermoelectric legs were 
tested by quickly switching the temperature between 253 K and 419 K at one 
side for ~45,000 cycles, while the other side was maintained at the ambient 
temperature, and the results are shown in Figures 1.11c and 11d. It can be 
clearly seen that cracks developed at the interface between the 
thermoelectric leg and the electrode, which would undoubtedly cause 
performance degradation. In summary, whether due to thermal shock or 
large interface resistance, imperfections in the contact layer can have a great 
impact on device performance, suggesting the importance of interface 
research for reliable thermoelectric modules.

1.9.2.2. Interface design principles 
A thermoelectric device can be reduced to its essential component, a 
complete circuit consisting of p- and n-type thermoelectric legs (i.e. a 
unicouple), as schematically illustrated in Figure 1.12. The contact interface 
of a unicouple is a complicated region containing many layers. The design of 
such a multi-layer interface usually requires a more complex processing 
technique. Ideally, the interface design should be as simple as possible  
since, in practical applications, a simple interface structure facilitates 
manufacturing and processing. Therefore, in early studies on thermoelectric 
devices, researchers attempted to connect the thermoelectric legs directly to 
a conductive-strip (e.g. Cu) substrate. However, numerous experimental  
 
 

Reliability and Durability of Thermoelectric Materials and Devices     27 
results showed that the loss of thermoelectric energy conversion efficiency 
could be as high as 40% due to the large contact resistance caused by the 
diffusion between the bonding material and the thermoelectric legs (Ren  
et al. 2018). Additionally, this diffusion phenomenon also leads to performance 
deterioration in the thermoelectric legs, thereby shortening the service life of 
the device. Taking the Bi2Te3-based thermoelectric cooling devices as a 
typical case, it was found that although the Bi2Te3 legs and Cu strips can be 
joined at 503 K by using a Sn–Sb–Bi solder, the diffusion of Sn into the 
thermoelectric legs leads to high electrical resistance. Although the electrical 
resistance was reduced in later studies by replacing the Sn–Sb–Bi solder 
with a Sb–Ag solder, it was found that Ag diffusion into the thermoelectric 
legs could also be detrimental to the device (Rosi et al. 1962). In addition, 
Cu is also highly diffusible into Bi2Te3 at the operating temperature of  
~523 K (Yang et al. 2013). Thus, the concept of adding a metal contact layer 
to serve as both the electrode and the solder diffusion barrier was proposed. 
For example, a Ni-metalized layer applied in a Bi2Te3-based thermoelectric 
device can effectively prevent the diffusion of the Sn from the Sn–Sb–Bi 
solder into the thermoelectric legs (Lin et al. 2017).

28     Thermoelectric Micro/Nano Generators 2 
A good metal contact layer and the corresponding connection technology 
should have the following characteristics for either a thermoelectric power 
generator or a thermoelectric cooler (He et al. 2018; Liu and Bai 2019): (1) 
the coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE) of the metal contact layer must 
match that of the thermoelectric leg; (2) the metalized layer must have high 
thermal conductivity and electrical conductivity to reduce extra energy loss 
at the interface; (3) low contact resistivity at the interface between the metal 
contact layer and the thermoelectric legs is necessary; (4) the connection 
technology between the metal electrodes and the thermoelectric legs should 
be simple, and the bonding strength should be high enough to ensure the 
stability of the device while operating at high temperatures and (5) avoiding 
doping or alloying effects due to high-temperature atomic diffusion at the 
interfaces is important since these could significantly alter the compositions 
of the thermoelectric legs and the electrode materials, leading to 
performance deterioration. The metal electrode should be inert to the 
thermoelectric material to avoid serious chemical reactions. Although 
diffusion is necessary for establishing a strong bond, it should be terminated 
when the joining is complete. In fact, it is very difficult to meet all of the 
above criteria at the same time. Therefore, determining how to balance 
various influencing factors in interface design is an important subject that 
needs to be studied for the development of thermoelectric devices. In 
general, the interface design needs to be adjusted according to actual 
application requirements. 
From the perspective of a practical application, CTE matching is the most 
important issue when selecting the metal contact material since the mismatch 
of CTEs could cause severe internal stress, resulting in the failure of the 
device. Mismatched CTEs could also increase the difficulty in 
manufacturing thermoelectric devices. Ravi et al. (2009) carried out detailed 
measurements and analysis of the CTEs of some advanced thermoelectric 
materials, and their results confirmed that the CTE has a profound effect on 
the thermomechanical robustness of the devices in which these materials are 
incorporated. Therefore, CTE matching requires careful engineering to meet 
performance expectations such as long-term durability. The CTEs of various 
thermoelectric materials are quite different from one another, so the metal 
electrode materials require targeted optimization such as composition tuning 
in the contact layer that is sensitive to the elemental ratio of the 
thermoelectric legs (Liu and Bai 2019). Additionally, multi-layer  
 
 

Reliability and Durability of Thermoelectric Materials and Devices     29 
contact materials can be applied to gradually match the CTE of the 
thermoelectric materials. 
In addition to CTE matching, a strong bond between the metal contact 
layer and the thermoelectric legs is essential for device reliability and 
durability. Generally, the metal contact layer can be made through either a 
chemical route (i.e. electrochemical plating or electrochemical deposition) or 
a physical route (i.e. sputtering, spraying, or direct hot pressing) (Zhang  
et al. 2016). An interface made by electrochemical plating or 
electrochemical deposition is very thin, and although this reduces the total 
electrical and thermal resistance at the contact region, the bonding strength is 
relatively low (~10 MPa) (Weitzaman 1967; Feng et al. 2013). This bonding 
strength could be adequate for refrigeration applications like commercial  
Bi2Te3-based devices, but it is far lower than that needed for power 
generation under thousands of thermal cycles and thermal shocks. Many 
studies have confirmed that increasing the surface roughness through 
chemical etching or sandblasting could effectively enhance the bonding 
strength because it would result in a larger contact surface area and an 
enhanced anchor point effect (Zhang 2018; Liu and Bai 2019). Compared to 
the chemical methods for metal contact layer production, some physical 
techniques produce a stronger bond between a metal electrode and the 
thermoelectric legs; these include thermal spraying (e.g. 18 MPa~25 MPa 
bonding strength between a Ni-metalized layer and a Bi2Te3 thermoelectric 
leg) (Zhang et al. 2014) and direct hot pressing (e.g. 50 MPa bonding 
strength between a Ti-metalized layer and a half-Heusler thermoelectric leg) 
(Joshi and Poudel 2016). Unfortunately, greater bonding strength is 
accompanied by higher contact resistance since it is usually achieved by 
deep interdiffusion or interface reactions in which an intermetallic layer 
could be formed between the metal contact layer and the thermoelectric leg. 
Although moderate diffusion is beneficial to interface bonding strength, 
uncontrolled diffusion and chemical reactions may cause increased thermal 
and electrical resistance, as well as significant changes in the composition of 
the metal contact layer and the thermoelectric legs, which will eventually 
cause performance deterioration in the device, or even device failure. 
Therefore, a balance should be found between bonding strength and other 
factors such as diffusion rate and contact resistance.  
 
 

30     Thermoelectric Micro/Nano Generators 2 
Using a single-layer metal contact can simplify the production process, 
but it makes meeting all of the above requirements at the same time difficult 
in some cases. For instance, there may be a large mismatch between the 
CTEs of the metal electrode and the thermoelectric legs; the metal contact 
layer could react with the thermoelectric legs quickly to form an 
intermetallic layer, which may lead to the deterioration of the entire device; 
or it may not be possible to produce a strong bond between the metal contact 
layer and the thermoelectric leg. Therefore, multi-layer interface technology 
has been introduced (Xia et al. 2014; Zhang et al. 2016; Xing et al. 2021), in  
which a barrier layer (also known as a transition layer) between the electrode 
and the thermoelectric leg serves as a buffer not only to slow down the 
diffusion behavior but also to improve the wettability of the material in order 
to facilitate brazing. Meanwhile, the barrier layer itself should also have high 
thermal and electrical conductivity to reduce the extra energy loss at the 
interface and thus improve the reliability of the device. 
1.9.2.3. Joining  
Joining processes are of great significance for the interface properties of 
thermoelectric modules. In particular, a proper joining technology can 
reduce the interface stress and improve the bonding strength, thereby 
increasing the reliability of the thermoelectric device to a certain extent. 
Over the past decades, several methods, such as the chemical and physical 
routes mentioned above, have been applied to join metal electrodes and 
thermoelectric legs. Among these methods, two major ones stand out as the 
most reliable and suitable for industrial manufacturing: diffusion welding 
and thermal spraying (see Figure 1.13). Diffusion welding, also known as 
one-step sintering, has been successfully applied in the fabrication of 
Mg3Sb(Bi)2 Zintls, MgAgSb, skutterudites, half-Heuslers, etc. (Zhao et al. 
2012; Joshi and Poudel 2016; Zhang et al. 2016; Yin et al. 2020; Ying et al. 
2021). As shown in Figure 1.13a, for the diffusion welding process, the 
electrode material powder and the thermoelectric material powder 
(sometimes including barrier material powder) are added into a graphite die 
in order, and the die is subsequently heated by using a direct hot press or a 
spark plasma sintering method. Using this process, the sandwich structure 
composed of the electrode material, barrier material and thermoelectric 
material powder is thus formed at one time. The main advantages of this 
method include its simplicity and the resulting high interface bonding 
strength. Thermal spraying, a newer technology, is more efficient and  
 
 

Reliability and Durability of Thermoelectric Materials and Devices     31 
scalable as compared to diffusion welding. As shown in Figure 1.13b, for the 
thermal spraying process, the thermoelectric material is cut to the desired 
dimensions for the thermoelectric legs and then plugged into a prefabricated 
frame made of a polymer or a ceramic. The metal electrode material and the 
barrier layer material can then be directly sprayed onto the contact surfaces 
of the thermoelectric legs. Thermal spraying is conducive to the 
simultaneous realization of interface processing and module integration for 
the device. Additionally, joins prepared by this method show higher stability 
at high temperatures (Zhang et al. 2016).

legs and metal contact layers: (a) diffusion welding. Reprinted from Ying et al. (2021) 
and (b) thermal spraying. Reprinted from Zhang et al. (2016). For a color version of 
this figure, see www.iste.co.uk/akinaga/thermoelectric2.zip 
After the metal electrode layer and the barrier layer are successfully 
connected to the thermoelectric legs, this working structure needs to be 
connected to the base (i.e. the substrate and the Cu conductive strips, which 
are generally joined in advance) by soldering or brazing. The selections of 
solder, interface pretreatment and soldering method are critical since the 
solder exhibits the highest CTE and the lowest yield strength among the 
interface components. The solder, in the form of a powder, paste or foil, is 
placed at the interface between the working structure and the base and 
should be heated and pressed to promote melting, and it is then cooled to 
firmly join the two parts (Kähler et al. 2014; Tewolde et al. 2015). Based on 
the above, one basic requirement for the solder is that its melting point 
should be lower than that of the thermoelectric legs and the conductive  
 
 

32     Thermoelectric Micro/Nano Generators 2 
strips. Given that the maximum stress level is located on the thermoelectric 
legs near the hot-side plate, the use of a low-yield soldering alloy at the hot 
side and the promotion of plastic deformation in the solder can result in 
considerable thermal stress relief. The melting point of the solder should also 
be higher than the operating temperature to prevent interface softening or 
failure of the module during service. Additionally, soldering thickness has an 
impact on the temperature gradient and thermal stress distribution. An 
optimal soldering thickness will achieve both high conversion efficiency and 
low thermal stress (Wu et al. 2014). Currently, the most used solder 
materials are Sn-based alloys, such as Sn–Ag, Sn–Cu and Au–Sn.

Bi2Te3-ySey thermoelectric alloy (a) before and (b) after post-CMP (chemical 
mechanical polishing) cleaning (reprinted from Feng et al. (2011)) 
It is worth noting that the quality of the soldering interface is not only 
associated with the type of solder and the soldering process but also with the 
cleanness of the interface. Careful surface cleaning is beneficial for 
removing surface oxides and hence reducing the contact resistance. In 
addition, surface cleaning can increase wettability significantly, which is 
beneficial for promoting welding. In a typical example, the contact angle of 
water dripped onto a Bi2Te3 surface was reduced from 79.7° to 53.6° (i.e. 
hydrophilicity increases) after a five-step treatment combining chemical and 
physical methods, as shown in Figure 1.14 (Feng et al. 2011). An interface 
incorporating solder has an inevitable shortcoming since it is easy to 
introduce contamination during the soldering process and form undesired 
phases which are harmful to the thermoelectric legs. In addition to applying  
 
 
 

Reliability and Durability of Thermoelectric Materials and Devices     33 
a metal contact layer and a barrier layer, which can reduce the deterioration 
on the thermoelectric legs caused by solder to a certain extent, some new  
joining processes, such as non-soldering-based joining, have been developed 
and investigated (Malik et al. 2017). The solder composition could also be 
adjusted appropriately for different thermoelectric compositions. 
1.10. Advanced thermoelectric module case studies 
In the previous section, an overview of thermoelectric device design and 
the major related issues was provided. Generally, the design principles 
described above can be applied to most thermoelectric materials. However, 
for particular materials, targeted strategies are required to address issues 
such as thermal expansion, thermal stress, bonding strength, contact 
resistance and interfacial reaction or diffusion due to the differences in these 
materials’ unique characteristics and specific operating temperature ranges. 
Hence, the reliability-related issues of some advanced thermoelectric 
modules and the corresponding strategies to address these issues are 
introduced in the following section.  
1.10.1. Bi2Te3 
Since they are among the most successful commercial thermoelectric 
materials, Bi2Te3-based materials have been studied extensively for decades. 
Usually, Ni is applied as a metal contact layer (3~10 μm in thickness) in 
Bi2Te3-based devices and the diffusion of Ni at the interface is negligible 
when the operating temperature is under 473 K. Additionally, Ni can 
effectively inhibit the formation of brittle Sn–Te intermetallic compounds 
resulting from the reaction between Sn-containing solder and the 
thermoelectric matrix. Therefore, as a metal contact layer, Ni is appropriate 
for refrigeration applications. However, when it is applied to thermoelectric 
power generators, a number of problems appear. Park et al. (2012) carried 
out a thermal cycling test from 303 K to 433 K on a commercial Bi2Te3 
module, as shown in Figure 1.15a. During the first 2,000 cycles, the power 
output was found to remain consistent with the prediction value, but between 
2,000 and 6,000 cycles, there were 11% and 12% reductions in the power 
output for load resistance values of 47 Ω and 1,000 Ω, respectively, as 
shown in Figure 1.15b.

module. Reprinted from Park et al. (2012). (b) Power output as a function of load 
resistance. Two power output data point (maximum and minimum values) for each 
load resistance value indicate the degradation of the thermoelectric module during 
thermal cycling. Data obtained from Park et al. (2012). For a color version of this 
figure, see www.iste.co.uk/akinaga/thermoelectric2.zip 
Liu et al. (2013) studied the interface reaction between Ni and n-type 
Bi2Te2.7Se0.3 and that between Ni and p-type Bi0.4Sb1.6Te3 by analyzing the  
interface 
microstructure of each sample hot-pressed at different 
temperatures, as shown in Figure 1.16. It is clear that the thickness of the 
interface reaction layer increases with increasing hot-pressing temperature. 
The thick diffusion layer is beneficial for strong bonding at the interface, but 
the diffusion of Ni was found to form a p-type region within the n-type 
Bi2Te2.7Se0.3 leg, resulting in a large contact resistance for the n-type 
interface (~210 μΩ cm2), while the contact resistance remains low for the  
p-type Bi0.4Sb1.6Te3 leg (<1 μΩ cm2) (Liu et al. 2013). Applying a barrier 
layer between the Ni contact layer and these thermoelectric materials is 
advised to address severe interface reactions at high temperatures. 
Additionally, seeking out new materials for the metal contact layer could be 
an alternative for this interface design. Research on devices based on Bi2Te3 
remains ongoing and is currently mainly focused on improving output 
performance. For instance, Nozariasbmarz et al. (2020) reported that a 
record 8% conversion efficiency and 2.1 W/cm2 power density were obtained 
in an n-/p-type Bi2Te3-based module for waste heat recovery (298 K~523 K). 
In addition, a Bi2Te3/half-Heusler-based segmented unicouple and a 
Bi2Te3/skutterudite segmented module also show remarkable energy  
 
 
 

Reliability and Durability of Thermoelectric Materials and Devices     35 
conversion efficiency around 12% (Li et al. 2020d). Unfortunately, results 
from aging tests and long-term service tests were not provided in these 
reports.

1.10.2. Mg3(Sb, Bi)2 
N-type Mg3(Sb, Bi)2-based materials have attracted tremendous attention 
in recent years because of their promising thermoelectric performance, low 

36     Thermoelectric Micro/Nano Generators 2 
cost and good mechanical properties. It is worth mentioning that Mg3(Sb, 
Bi)2-based devices can be used for different applications in several 
temperature ranges, for example, room-temperature thermoelectric cooling 
(Mao et al. 2019a; Shu et al. 2019a), low-grade heat recovery (Imasato et al. 
2019b; Liang et al. 2021) and power generation in the medium-temperature 
range (Xu et al. 2021), by tuning the ratio of Sb and Bi to either Sb-  
or Bi-rich. As an emerging material system, Mg3(Sb, Bi)2-based 
thermoelectrics have received little attention in terms of interface research. 
Zhu et al. (2019) were the first to report on the Mg3(Sb, Bi)2 contact 
interface in 2019. In their study, a good junction interface with low contact 
resistivity 
and 
strong 
bonding 
strength 
was 
formed 
between 
Mg3.1Co0.1Sb1.5Bi0.49Te0.01 and Fe using a direct hot-pressing method, which 
was found to lead to a high energy conversion efficiency of 10.6% between 
373 K and 773 K. Fe has since been successfully used as a metal contact 
electrode layer in a thermoelectric cooling system (Mao et al. 2019a) and a 
low-grade waste heat recovery device (Liang et al. 2021). In a later study, Ni 
was found to play a role similar to that of Fe as a contact layer (Mao et al. 
2019a). Ni can also ensure a low electrical contact resistance for soldering 
once it is electroplated on both sides of the Mg3(Sb, Bi)2 thermoelectric leg 
(Shang et al. 2020b; Xu et al. 2021). On the other hand, the Fe contact layer 
could degrade upon long-term aging, which may be attributed to the 
mismatched CTE values and the undesirable interface reaction between the 
thermoelectric material and Fe. Thus, 304 stainless steel was introduced as a 
potential replacement by Yin et al. (2020). An interface constructed using 
304 stainless steel and a Mg3(Sb, Bi)2-based thermoelectric material shows 
smaller changes in its electrical and mechanical properties with aging 
compared to that constructed using Fe due to its suppressed diffusion and 
enhanced expansion coefficient match, as shown in Figure 1.17. A high 
conversion efficiency of up to 9% at a temperature difference of 370 K in a 
single leg incorporating this Mg3(Sb, Bi)2-based thermoelectric material and 
304 stainless steel was reported in the same study. Unfortunately, no studies 
of the long-term operation of an integrated module based on Mg3(Sb, Bi)2 
have yet been reported. In short, despite the good thermoelectric properties 
of Mg3(Sb, Bi)2-based materials, only with abundant contact layer research 
and module evaluation can these compounds achieve a large-scale practical 
application.

1.10.3. GeTe 
Research on GeTe as a thermoelectric material began as early as the 
1960s, but it was not studied in depth for long since it has an excessively 
high carrier concentration (~1021 cm-3) and an undesired phase change at 
~700 K. In recent years, GeTe has returned as a focus of thermoelectric 
research because it was found that its carrier concentration can be reduced to 
an ideal range (~1020 cm-3) by doping with Sb or Bi (Liu et al. 2018; Zheng 
et al. 2018). Additionally, its undesired phase transition can be suppressed 
by element doping, as discussed in section 1.5. GeTe has subsequently 
become a promising candidate for use in thermoelectric generators for waste 
heat recovery in the mid-temperature range. Although the thermoelectric 
performance of GeTe has been greatly improved, device research is currently 
lagging significantly, delaying actual applications. At high temperatures, fast 
chemical reactions and diffusion can occur between the metal electrodes and 
the thermoelectric legs in GeTe-based thermoelectric modules. Thus, a 
barrier layer is required. An Al–Si alloy was recently proposed as a diffusion 
barrier for GeTe-based thermoelectric legs by Li et al. (2020b). In their 
study, a good connection between Al66Si34 and Ge0.9Sb0.1TeB0.01 was 
obtained using the spark plasma sintering method and the resulting 
thermoelectric legs underwent aging testing for 16 days at 773 K. After the 

38     Thermoelectric Micro/Nano Generators 2 
16-day test, their contact resistivity increased slightly from 20.7 to  
26.1 μΩ·cm2. The thickness of the interface diffusion layer increased quickly 
from ~8 to ~18 μm during the first 4 days of aging but slowed down after  
8 days of aging. Overall, the thickness of the interface diffusion layer 
increased to ~23 μm after 16 days of aging, as shown in Figure 1.18a–c. The 
shear strength of the thermoelectric legs also increased from 26.6 MPa to 
41.7 MPa after the aging test, which may be attributed to the thicker 
diffusion layer. Xing et al. (2021) chose Mo as an effective diffusion barrier 
material for GeTe-based thermoelectric legs by testing 12 pure metals (Cr, 
Hf, Nb, Ti, Mo, Ni, Ta, Zr, Al, Co, V and Fe). The result of resistance line 
scanning across the interface of GeTe/Mo/GeTe indicates that an 
extraordinarily low value (less than 1 μΩ·cm2) can be obtained. 
Furthermore, a Ge0.92Sb0.04Bi0.04Te0.95Se0.05/Mo/Ni thermoelectric leg was 
constructed and underwent aging testing at 800 K, and its interface 
microstructure was found to remain stable after 10 days of testing, as shown 
in Figure 1.18d–f. Finally, an eight-couple Ge0.92Sb0.04Bi0.04Te0.95Se0.05/Yb0.3 
Co4Sb12 thermoelectric module was fabricated and achieved an energy 
conversion efficiency of 7.8% and a power density of 1.1 W·cm-2 under a 
temperature difference of 500 K.

1.10.4. Skutterudites 
Filled skutterudites show promising thermoelectric and mechanical 
properties for mid-temperature power generation. The contact design of 
skutterudites has been extensively examined in recent decades. Pure metals 
and alloys like Ni, Ti, Zr, Nb, Mo-Cu and Co-Fe-Ni have been employed 
and evaluated as metal contact layers (Zhang 2018; Liu and Bai 2019). 
Although Ni is a good candidate for most thermoelectric materials in 
interfacial design, it is not suitable for skutterudites due to its larger CTE. 
Therefore, a buffer layer is needed when Ni is applied as the metal contact 
layer for skutterudites. Ti- and Zr-based contact layers often suffer from a 
severe interfacial chemical reaction during the aging process, so they do not 
provide adequate stability for long-term power generation service. The  
Mo–Cu alloy is another potential candidate for the metal contact layer 
because of its high electrical and thermal conductivity. Additionally, its 
composition can be easily tuned to match the CTE of the filled skutterudite 
(Zhang 2018). However, it is very difficult to bond the Mo–Cu alloy onto the 
surface of a skutterudite thermoelectric leg. In fact, the most significant 
challenge in choosing a metal contact layer for skutterudites is that their 
main element, Sb, is highly reactive, which may cause a severe interfacial 
reaction and diffusion at high temperatures, and thus significantly degrade 
the device performance. To balance effective bonding and a durable 
interface, Chu et al. (2020) recently proposed a criterion to predict the 
bonding behavior as well as the interfacial reliability of CoSb3-based filled 
skutterudite/metal electrode interfaces by combining the interfacial reaction 
energy (EIR) value of a metal with its Sb migration activation energy barrier 
(EMig) value, as shown in Figure 1.19a. Generally, EIR should be negative to 
promote the progress of the interface reaction and produce a mechanical 
force at the interface, while EMig should be large enough to limit Sb diffusion 
and prevent the interface reaction layer from growing too quickly. Based on 
their simulation results, they defined a “sweet spot” area as shown in Figure 
1.19a, and metals in this region were determined to be potential candidates 
for the metal contact layer. To validate the proposed criterion, Nb was 
chosen as the metal contact layer to fabricate a CoSb3-based filled 
skutterudite thermoelectric leg. Their experimental results showed robust 
bonding with no obvious diffusion under thermal cycles, confirming that the 
interface reaction was inhibited and the interfacial resistivity was reduced. 
The derived module also showed excellent stability in output power as well 
as internal resistance after 846 hours of service testing, as shown in Figure 
1.19b. In addition, work–function matching is another effective guiding 
principle for interfacial design that was proposed by Jie et al. (2015). They 

40     Thermoelectric Micro/Nano Generators 2 
reported that the matching of the work function between a metal contact 
layer and a filled skutterudite can play a crucial role in determining the 
electrical contact resistance based on their study of the interface behavior 
between the p-type Ce0.45Nd0.45Fe3.5Co0.5Sb12 and a Cr–Fe–Co alloy or a  
Cr–Fe–Ni alloy.

1.11. Summary and outlook  
In comparison with zT improvement among various thermoelectric 
materials over the past decades, the development process from 
thermoelectric materials to devices has been much slower. For the materials’ 
optimization, more effort should be devoted to improving the thermal 
stability and mechanical robustness of the materials with relatively high zT 
because commercialization will not be possible until such improvement is 
achieved. To accelerate commercialization, a multi-criteria evaluation 
method needs to be developed based on the performance and reliability 
requirements. Since the interfacial layer plays an important role in 
performance maximization and structure integrity, it is meaningful to 
construct a rational model based on experiment and simulation to guide the 
design of high-performance contact layers. For device development, 
evaluating the performance of each lab-prepared module based on multiple 
industrial standards (e.g. vibration testing, mechanical shock testing, 

Reliability and Durability of Thermoelectric Materials and Devices     41 
temperature cycle endurance testing, etc.) can help to determine commercial 
viability in realizing actual applications. Most importantly, it is time to try 
all possible device applications to demonstrate some of the promise of the 
past decades of materials research to build a case for economical adaption of 
this technology to real applications. With enough practical applications of 
thermoelectric devices, more research will be funded and can be carried out, 
which in turn will enhance the device applications. Such a healthy,  
self-propelling cycle is what the thermoelectric research community needs 
going forward.

2.1. Introduction 
The conversion efficiency of a thermoelectric (TE) device depends on the 
Carnot efficiency and the TE materials’ dimensionless figure of merit zT, zT 
= S2σT/(κe+κL), where S, σ, T, κe and κL are the Seebeck coefficient, 
electrical conductivity, absolute temperature, electronic and lattice thermal 
components of total thermal conductivity κ, respectively. The S, σ and κe are 
intercoupled and mainly related to the charge carrier transport behavior, 
while κL is relatively independent and dominated by the phonon transport 
behavior. Hence, many microstructure engineering strategies, such as the 
introduction of atomic-scale point defects, nanoscale second-phases, 
mesoscale dislocations, textures and grain boundaries, have been widely 
used to suppress phonon transport, aiming at the minimization of κL and the 
improvement of TE performance. The mean free path (MFP) of phonons has

54     Thermoelectric Micro/Nano Generators 2 
a strong dependence on the frequency, and the induced microstructure in 
different length scales could hinder the propagation of phonons with various 
MFPs (Chen 2006). This is why microstructure engineering strategies are 
generally effective and popularly used in suppressing κL (Biswas 2012; Hu 
2012). In contrast, the effect of microstructure engineering on the electronic 
properties of TE materials is more complicated and less studied. The 
electron can carry both heat and electric charge. Therefore, the electronic 
parameters S, σ and κe could also be affected when using the microstructure 
engineering strategies. A very common case is that the carrier mobility μ is 
deteriorated due to the introduced multi-scale scattering sources, which may 
reduce the gain to zT from the suppressed κL. In some other cases, the 
introduced scattering sources may be beneficial for S if they could scatter the 
low-energy charge carriers. 
In section 2.2 of this chapter, we will first summarize the basic principles 
about electronic transport parameters and discuss how to gain insight into the 
carrier transport mechanisms from the experimental data of S, σ and μ. 
Then, in section 2.3, we will present several examples concerning the effect 
of point defects on electronic properties by focusing on isoelectronic 
alloying and intrinsic defects. Meanwhile, the effect of grain boundary and 
texture on electronic properties will also be elaborated. To conclude, in 
section 2.4, we will briefly highlight the future direction to gain a deeper 
understanding of the relationship between microstructure and electronic 
properties to minimize its negative effect on the TE properties.  
2.2. Basic principles of electronic transport parameters 
The electronic transport properties of heavily doped TE semiconductors 
could be understood using the Boltzmann transport equation under the 
relaxation time approximation. A detailed derivation of the expressions can 
be found in some classic books on thermoelectricity (Slack 1995; Goldsmid 
2010). Here, the expressions obtained under the single parabolic band (SPB) 
model are given (Snyder 2012), which have been justified to be useful and 
feasible for understanding the electronic transport behavior of many bulk TE 
materials

scattering factor, η is the reduced Fermi level (EF/kBT) and ξ is the reduced 
energy level (E/kBT).  
Based on equations [2.1]–[2.7], we can easily find that the electronic 
transport properties are closely related to mb
*, η, r and τ0. These four 
parameters could be divided into two groups: the band-structure-related mb
* 
and η, and the scattering-related r and τ0. Concerning the effect of 
microstructure on electronic transport properties, we could understand it 
through the change of either the band-structure or scattering mechanism: 
1) mb
* is inversely related to the curvature of an electronic band. 
Chemical doping and the formation of solid solutions may change mb
* and 
thus affect the electronic properties. Other microstructure strategies, such as 
grain boundaries, nano-composites, dislocations, may not significantly 
change mb
*. 
2) η reflects the position of the Fermi level with regard to the edge of 
conduction or valence bands. Generally, the mb
* of a single parabolic band 
does not change with the tuning of the Fermi level, and the value of η 
directly determines the concentration of charge carriers according to 
equation [2.1]. Chemical doping and the tuning of native defects could 
change η.

For carrier transport, the dominant scattering mechanism may vary at 
different temperatures and carrier concentrations. Before discussing how to

Table 2.1. The energy dependence of relaxation time, as well as the temperature 
dependence of carrier mobility under the non-degenerate and degenerate limits, 
respectively, for several scattering mechanisms that commonly occurred in TE 
semiconductors 
The energy-dependent relaxation time and temperature-dependent carrier 
mobility for several scattering mechanisms that commonly occurred in TE 
semiconductors are summarized in Table 2.1. We can find that the exponents 
r and s vary for different scattering mechanisms, providing a way to judge 
the dominant scattering mechanism of carrier transport. Because the  
energy-dependent relaxation time is difficult to be characterized through 
transport measurements, the dominant carrier scattering mechanism could be 
judged using the μ ~ T s relationship. As shown in Table 2.1, μ decays 
rapidly with increasing T with an exponent s of -1.5 (non-degenerate case) or 
-1 (degenerate case) if the acoustic phonon scattering dominates the carrier 
transport. This is commonly observed in the carrier transport of good TE 
semiconductors above room temperature. If the acoustic phonon scattering 
dominates the carrier transport, the scattering factor r is -1/2, according to 
equation [2.8]. With the confirmed value of r, we can thus understand the 
electronic properties through the SPB modeling analysis using equations 
[2.1]–[2.7]. For TE materials with isoelectronic alloying or high-content 

58     Thermoelectric Micro/Nano Generators 2 
doping, the alloy scattering may contribute significantly to the carrier 
transport. In such a condition, the μ(T) will decay slower with rising T, and 
the exponent s is -0.5 or 0 for the non-degenerate and degenerate cases, 
respectively. Luckily, the scattering factor r stays the same as that of the 
acoustic phonon scattering. Hence, we can still use the SPB model to study 
electronic properties. 
However, under the conditions of other scattering mechanisms, such as 
grain boundary and ionized impurity, r may change significantly, leading to 
much different σ, μ, S, κe. For lightly doped semiconductors, the ionized 
impurities may dominate the carrier transport at low temperatures, giving an r 
of 3/2. This indicates that high-energy carriers will be weakly hindered by the 
ionized impurities and could have a larger relaxation time compared to the 
low-energy ones. Under the ionized impurity scattering, μ will increase rapidly 
with rising T and s is 3/2 and 0 for the non-degenerate and degenerate cases, 
respectively. Polar optical scattering may contribute to the carrier transport for 
TE materials with the ionic bonding interaction. When it is the dominant one, r 
is 1/2, indicating an increased μ if n increases. This is the point to distinguish it 
from acoustic phonon scattering, as they show the same s value.

Microstructure in Understanding Electronic Properties     59 
Distinct from the above four scattering mechanisms, there is no fixed r or 
s for the grain boundary scattering. In some cases, mixed scattering 
mechanisms can also occur in the TE materials, which makes the analysis of 
their carrier transport behavior more difficult. For instance, there has been a 
recent debate on the carrier transport mechanisms in some polycrystalline 
TE materials near room temperature, i.e. whether it is dominated by impurity 
scattering or grain boundary scattering (Imasato et al. 2020; Li et al. 2020). 
In the next section, we will exemplify some experimental cases and discuss 
the effect of point defects, grain boundary and texture on electronic 
properties, and offer feasible strategies to realize enhanced TE performance, 
as summarized in Figure 2.1. 
2.2.1. Solid solutions 
The formation of solid solutions (i.e. alloying), initially proposed by Ioffe 
(1957), has long been employed in suppressing the κL of TE materials 
through enhancing the scattering of high-frequency phonons. However, the 
introduced alloying disorder may also scatter the charge carriers. To benefit 
the TE performance, a large value of μ/κL is desired when using this 
strategy. Aiming at a lower κL, an alloying element that has large mass and 
strain contrasts with the host elements is necessary. Meanwhile, to maintain 
μ, the alloying element should not introduce a strong perturbation to the 
periodic potential. Empirically, Ioffe made an argument on the selection of 
the alloying elements, i.e. an alloying element that makes less contribution to 
the charge-conducting band should be chosen (Wang et al. 2015). Through 
quantitative transport models, an instructive criterion that the alloying 
element should have small alloy scattering potential Eal, as well as large 
mass and strain contrasts, was proposed by Wang et al. (2013). The question 
then becomes how to choose an alloying element that could generate a small 
Eal. Several theoretical models were proposed to estimate Eal, i.e. considering 
the differences in the energy bandgap (Makowski and Glicksman 1973), the 
electron affinity (Harrison and Hauser 1976a) and the electronegativity 
(Ferry 1978). Based on the electronegativity theory, the difference in the 
covalent radius between alloying and host elements can be viewed as an 
indicator of Eal, offering an intuitive way to choose the alloying element. 
Experimentally, Liu et al. (2018) demonstrated that lanthanide 
contraction serves as an indicator for selecting alloying elements. Owing to 
the lanthanide contraction, the radii of the period-6 transition metals are 
smaller than expected, which exhibit a similar value to the corresponding 

60     Thermoelectric Micro/Nano Generators 2 
isoelectronic period-5 elements. Thus, the formation of solid solutions using 
isoelectronic period-5 and period-6 elements could generate a large mass 
contrast, but a small strain contrast, which could effectively suppress the κL 
while maintaining the μ (schematically shown in Figure 2.1). As 
experimentally demonstrated in the half-Heusler TE systems (Figure 2.2), 
the isoelectronic alloying of Zr/Hf or Nb/Ta weakly changes the lattice 
parameters, leading to a slight change in μ. In comparison, there is a large 
change in the lattice parameter of the n-type PbTe1-xSex system, which leads 
to a strong alloy scattering of the carriers and thus largely reduces the μ. 
These examples highlight the importance of the selection of alloying 
elements in optimizing the TE properties of solid materials.

several solid solution systems (Wang et al. 2013; Liu et al. 2015, 2018; Yu et al. 
2018); a0 and μ0 denote the lattice parameter and carrier mobility of the unalloyed 
compound (x = 0), respectively 
2.2.2. Intrinsic defects 
In the above-mentioned cases, the formation of solid solutions induces 
alloying disorder and thus affects both the μ and κL. But in some other TE 
materials, such as the Bi2Te3-based system, the formation of solid solutions 
(alloying Sb at the Bi site or Se at the Te site) will produce more 
complicated effects on the electronic and phonon transport properties, owing 
to the alloying-induced change of intrinsic point defects (Zhu et al. 2016). 
Although it is isoelectronic alloying in Bi2-xSbxTe3 and Bi2Te3-xSex, n and S 
can vary significantly with the increased content of the congeners, even 
changing the sign (Figure 2.3). It should be noted that the electronic 
properties of Bi2Te3-based single crystals will be discussed first. Bi2Te3 ingot 

Microstructure in Understanding Electronic Properties     61 
is a p-type semiconductor resulting from the antisite defect BiTe
’  (Miller and 
Li 1965). The hole concentration increases by alloying Sb (Birkholz 1958; 
Starý et al. 1988; Ivanova and Granatkina 1995). This is because the 
formation energy of the antisite defect SbTe
’  is lower than that of BiTe
’ , owing 
to the smaller differences in the electronegativity and covalent radius 
between the cation and anion (Starý et al. 1988; Zhu et al. 2016). On the 
contrary, if the differences increase, the formation energy of the antisite 
defects and anion vacancies will increase and decrease, respectively. The 
anion vacancies VSe
∙∙ can provide two electrons and thus the Bi2Se3 ingot 
shows an n-type semiconducting behavior (West et al. 2012). Alloying Se at 
the Te site increases the formation energy of antisite defects and decreases 
the formation energy of anion vacancies. Therefore, the electron 
concentration increases and the p–n transition happens, as shown in the 
Bi2Te3-xSex region (Figure 2.3) (Birkholz 1958; Horák et al. 1985; Lošt’ák  
et al. 2010). 
However, the situation is different for polycrystalline Bi2-xSbxTe3-based 
alloys prepared by powder metallurgy (Figure 2.3) (Oh et al. 2000). The 
electron concentration increases for the fabricated bulk polycrystalline Bi2-
xSbxTe3-based alloys compared to the single crystal counterparts, which was 
called the “donor-like effect” (Navrátil et al. 1996). This effect was 
explained by Navarátil et al. who propose a possible reaction mechanism 
between the vacancies and the antisite defects in the polycrystalline samples 
(for simplicity, we take Sb2Te3 as an example): 
2VSb
’’’+3VTe
∙∙+SbTe
’ →VSb
’’’+4VTe
∙∙+SbSb
x +6e’ 
[2.14] 
The antisite defects are present in the melted ingots at relatively high 
concentrations. Subsequently, the cation and anion vacancies with a ratio of 
2:3 are introduced by the non-basal slip during mechanical deformation 
(Schultz et al. 1962). The following hot-pressing sintering process will 
accelerate the reaction described in equation [2.14], resulting in the increase 
of electron concentration in the bulk polycrystalline samples. Thus, both 
mechanical deformation and the sintering process play vital roles in the 
generation of the donor-like effect (Zhang et al. 2019). Strong mechanical 
deformation and high sintering temperature will create more vacancies and 
accelerate the reaction of equation [2.14], respectively, facilitating the 
donor-like effect and thus increasing the electron concentration. On the other 
hand, changing the compositions can tune the concentration of antisite 
defects, thus affecting the donor-like effect and electron concentration (Hu  

62     Thermoelectric Micro/Nano Generators 2 
et al. 2014). In short, changing the composition and the preparation method 
can effectively tune the intrinsic point defects and carrier concentration in 
Bi2Te3-based alloys and thus the TE properties. This could also happen in 
some other TE systems, particularly if their optimal carrier concentration is 
in the same order of magnitude as the concentration of the intrinsic defects.

and Bi2Te3-xSex systems, both in their single crystals and hot-pressed  
alloys (Birkholz 1958; Oh et al. 2000; Hu et al. 2014) 
2.2.3. Grain boundary 
The grain refinement of bulk TE materials, usually introduced through 
the ball-milling method (Poudel et al. 2008), has been widely employed to 
enhance the grain boundary scattering (GBS) of phonons and suppress the κL 
of bulk TE materials in the past few decades. This bulk nanostructuring 
strategy was successfully used to improve the TE performance of a few TE 

Microstructure in Understanding Electronic Properties     63 
materials (Minnich et al. 2009; Joshi et al. 2011; Yan et al. 2011; Dahal et al. 
2014), such as, in the nanostructured Si80Ge20P2, an obvious enhancement of 
the zT, which was achieved by Wang et al. (2008) (Figure 2.4(a)). Such an 
enhanced zT mainly results from the reduced κL, while the σ  (Figure 2.4(b)) 
and μ are not significantly suppressed. These successes motivated extensive 
studies in the past decade to employ the nanostructuring strategy for the 
performance optimization of TE materials. 
However, although grain refinement has shown its efficacy in optimizing 
the performance of a few TE materials, it has not always worked well for 
some other TE systems. As recently observed in the n-type Mg3Sb2  
(Figure 2.4(c)), the grain refinement leads to a much lower zT in the 
polycrystalline sample near room temperature (RT), resulting from the 
largely reduced σ (Figure 2.4(d)) (Κanno et al. 2018). The rising σ with 
increasing T near RT incurs the debate on the carrier scattering mechanism, 
i.e. it is ionized impurity scattering or GBS. Although initially being 
recognized as the former, more evidence now supports that GBS is the 
dominant scattering mechanism near RT in the grain-refined polycrystalline 
samples, particularly when comparing the σ(T) with that of single crystals. 
That is, the σ(T) of n-type Te-doped Mg3Sb2 single crystals demonstrates the 
acoustic phonon scattering dominated carrier transport behavior (Imasato et 
al. 2020). It is worth noting that the n and S for n-type Mg3Sb2 samples are 
almost not affected by the grain refinement (Imasato et al. 2020). Moreover, 
owing to the intrinsically low κL and thus small phonon MFP, the phonon 
transport is also not significantly suppressed with increasing grain 
boundaries (Xin et al. 2018). Hence, for n-type Mg3Sb2, it is important to 
make large-size polycrystals or single crystals to achieve high  
room-temperature zT by eliminating the negative effect of GBS on the σ 
(Imasato et al. 2020). As observed from Figure 2.4(c), the average zT from 
300 to 700 K displays an obvious increase in the large-size sample (Kanno  
et al. 2018). 
By comparing the experimental results of n-type grain-refined Si80Ge20 
and Mg3Sb2, we can find that whether the grain refinement is effective in 
enhancing the TE performance strongly depends on its effect on the carrier 
transport. According to equation [2.13], the potential barrier height Eb is a 
crucial parameter that determines whether GBS will significantly suppress the 
σ and μ (schematically shown in Figure 2.1). The Eb could be described as 
𝐸௕=
௘మொ೟
మ
଼ேఌబ 
[2.15] 

64     Thermoelectric Micro/Nano Generators 2 
where e is the elementary charge (C), Qt is the density of trapping states at 
grain boundaries (C / m2), N is the concentration of ionized impurity atoms 
(usually dopant atoms, m-3) and ε0 is the static dielectric constant (C2/N m2). 
It can be concluded that in the lightly doped samples with small ε0, GBS 
is more likely to have a great effect on σ. The experimental evidence could 
be found in several cases: 1) for n-type Ir-doped NbFeSb, Eb decreases from 
50 meV to 30 meV with increasing carrier concentration, resulting in higher 
μ (Shen et al. 2019); 2) for p-type PbSe, with the increased alloying content 
of NaSbSe2, which has a lower ε0 than that of PbSe, Eb was found to rise 
quickly from 1.6 meV to 68 meV, leading to deteriorative σ (Slade et al. 
2020). 
Since GBS may result in a serious deterioration of μ and σ, once GBS is 
confirmed to be the dominant carrier scattering mechanism, large-grain 
polycrystalline samples or single-crystalline samples are desired to exhibit 
better electronic properties and also higher TE performance. Generally, TE 
materials with intrinsically high κL, large ε0 and higher n may benefit from the 
grain refinement strategy. In contrast, those with intrinsically low κL, small ε0 
and lower n may exhibit better TE performance if their grain sizes are larger.

2.2.4. Texture 
Some TE materials, such as Bi2Te3, SnSe and BiCuSeO, show anisotropic 
electronic and phonon transport properties. That is, the TE performance in a 
specific direction is higher than in other directions. Taking n-type Bi2Te3 as 
an example, the σ in the in-plane (perpendicular to the c-axis) is about 4–7 
times higher than that in the c-axis (Delves et al. 1961; Goldsmid 1961). In 
comparison, the κL in the in-plane direction is only twice higher than that of 
the out-of-plane (Shen et al. 2011). Consequently, the in-plane zT is higher 
than the out-of-plane zT. The Bi2Te3-based ingots prepared by the directional 
solidification are highly oriented polycrystals, which exhibit superior  
in-plane zT and are thus used for commercial TE modules. However, for 
polycrystalline Bi2Te3-based alloys prepared by powder metallurgy and  
hot-pressing (HP), the grains are randomly oriented in the bulk and the TE 
properties lose the anisotropy to a large extent, exhibiting deteriorated zT 
compared with the in-plane zT of single crystals (Pei et al. 2020). 
Texturing is an effective method to improve the orientation of the 
polycrystalline samples, which could enhance the μ (schematically shown in 
Figure 2.1) and TE performance in the in-plane direction. Electron 
backscatter diffraction (EBSD) and X-ray diffraction (XRD) pole figures are 
useful methods to represent the texture of polycrystalline samples, which are 
thus often used to visually show the texture of polycrystalline Bi2Te3-based 
alloys (Hu et al. 2018; Wu et al. 2019). Besides, there is an easy and feasible 
way to characterize the texture, i.e. using the so-called orientation factor F of 
the (00l) plane. F is calculated by the Lotgering method according to the 
XRD results as follows (Lotgering 1959): 
𝐹=
௉ି௉బ
ଵି௉బ, 𝑃଴=
∑ூబ(଴଴௟)
∑ூబ(௛௞௟), 𝑃=
∑ூ(଴଴௟)
∑ூ(௛௞௟) 
[2.16] 
where the P and P0 are the integrated intensities of all (00l) planes to the 
(hkl) planes for the preferentially and randomly oriented samples, 
respectively. Some fabrication methods, such as the hot deformation (HD) 
(Hu et al. 2018) and liquid sintering (Yan et al. 2010; Kim et al. 2015) can 
facilitate the directional alignment of grains and enhance the texture of 
Bi2Te3-based alloys, as shown in Figure 2.5 (Wu et al. 2017). All the HD 
samples show higher F than the HP samples, indicating the increased texture 
of HD samples. The increased texture can also be visually observed from the  
 
 

66     Thermoelectric Micro/Nano Generators 2 
fracture SEM images of the HP and HD samples (Wu et al. 2017). Due to the 
enhanced texture, the TE properties become more predominant in  
the direction perpendicular to the pressure. Therefore, the μ increases for the 
HD samples, as shown in Figure 2.5, which is favorable for a higher zT. 
For TE materials that have non-cubic crystal structures, anisotropic 
transport properties in different crystallographic directions will occur. It is 
worth noting that whether the highest TE performance is achieved in the  
in-plane or the out-of-plane directions depends on the specific system. For 
instance, both p-type and n-type Bi2Te3-based alloys (Carle et al. 1995) show 
higher zT along the in-plane direction due to the higher μ, despite also 
having a higher κL. In comparison, the n-type SnSe (Chang et al. 2018) and 
SnSe2 (Xu et al. 2017) show a higher zT along the out-of-plane direction, 
mainly contributed to the much lower κL. Thus, finding which direction 
exhibits higher TE properties is crucial for non-cubic TE systems. Based on 
this, the textured polycrystalline samples with the preferred direction can be 
fabricated to realize both good TE performance and mechanical strength.

2.3. Summary 
Microstructure engineering, including the formation of solid solutions, 
native defects, grain refinement, texture and nanocomposites, have been 
widely used in TE studies, with the main purpose of the minimization of the 
lattice thermal conductivity. Since the MFP of phonons distributes in a broad 
range with respect to their frequencies, the microstructure engineering 
strategies are generally effective in suppressing the lattice thermal 
conductivity. However, the gain to the zT may be offset by the deteriorative 
carrier mobility and electrical conductivity. Thus, to benefit from 
microstructure engineering, its effect on electronic properties must be 
considered. Here, we exemplified several systems and discussed how to 
minimize the negative effect of point defects, grain boundary and texture on 
the electronic properties, aiming for the enhancement of TE performance. 
However, to the best of our knowledge, for some other types of 
microstructures, such as dislocations and nano-composites, their effects on 
electronic properties remain elusive and await future studies. Further, 
whether we can use microstructure engineering strategies to realize a 
simultaneous enhancement of electronic properties and suppress lattice 
thermal conductivity is an interesting issue waiting to be explored.

3.1. Introduction 
Among the different paths which can be followed to improve the 
properties of thermoelectric materials, the fabrication of nanoscale structures 
has been one of the most active. On the one hand, it is possible today to 
fabricate high-quality structures at the nanoscale of different thermoelectric 
materials. Techniques such as electrochemical deposition, vapor-liquid-solid 
processes, etc. are being used to obtain nanowires (NWs) with diameters 
ranging from tens to hundreds of nanometers and high aspect ratios. On the 
other hand, the nanowire structures can be approached as a one-dimensional 
structure for most transport phenomena, and thus, the obtained results can be 
successfully interpreted with one-dimensional theories, simplifying both 
explanations and predictions. Therefore, they are used as an important 
platform for understanding the influence of dimensionality reduction in 
thermoelectric materials. It is generally assumed now that the increased 
surface-to-volume ratio produced in nanowires increases the diffusive 
phonon scattering, which reduces the thermal conductivity. In these kinds of 
structures, the study of the influence of the surfaces on the phonon

74     Thermoelectric Micro/Nano Generators 2 
scattering, from the theoretical point of view, has helped us to further 
understand the thermal transport at the nanoscale. Recently, more 
sophisticated structures, based on nanowires and maintaining their enhanced 
properties for thermoelectric applications, have been implemented and 
tested. 
In this chapter, we will present the different paths that are being studied 
to obtain relevant thermoelectric enhancements in nanowire structures and to 
what extent they have been developed. We will review the fabrication 
methods for obtaining thermoelectric nanowires, along with the 
measurement techniques and physical properties obtained in the literature. 
This will provide us with a way of understanding the physics behind the 
different ways that are being studied to enhance the thermoelectric efficiency 
in these structures. Then, we will briefly discuss the implementation of 
thermoelectric nanowires in actual devices with some examples. Finally, we 
will take a look at a new family of nanostructures based on the combination of 
nanowire structures in three-dimensional arrangements and their properties, 
concluding with some outlooks for future developments in this field. 
3.2. Nanowires: a way to enhance thermoelectric efficiency 
As previously discussed in this book, the thermoelectric performance of a 
certain material is related to its figure of merit, zT. In this parameter, 
different properties of the material (S, Seebeck coefficient, σ, electrical 
conductivity and κ thermal conductivity) are involved. Several strategies can 
be followed in NWs to improve the thermoelectric performance of materials 
(see Figure 3.1) which will be discussed here. 
The figure of merit is proportional to the power factor, S2·σ, and inversely 
proportional to its thermal conductivity. One of the main obstacles to increase 
the figure of merit has been that all parameters involved are interlinked in 
classical physics. Then, going to low-dimensional structures, such as 
nanowires, we can decouple those parameters and produce an enhancement  
of thermoelectric efficiency. In 1993, Dresselhaus predicted that in  
low-dimensional structures, the thermoelectric power factor would be 
drastically increased due to quantum confinement effects (Hicks and 
Dresselhaus 1993). To understand the actual effects that take place at the 
nanoscale, we should take into account the form that these parameters have 
using the Boltzmann transport equations. Then, σ and S are expressed as 
follows:

[3.2] 
In these equations, e is the electron charge, g(E) is the total electronic 
density of states (DOS), v(E) is the electron velocity at a given energy E, 
𝜏(𝐸, 𝑇) is the carrier’s relaxation time at a certain energy and temperature, 
f(E) is the energy distribution function, and kB is the Boltzmann constant. In 
the case of charge carriers, f(E) is a Fermi–Dirac distribution, and its 
derivative with respect to energy has a peak at the Fermi level, EF, ensuring 
that only the carriers close to that energy contribute to both the electrical and 
thermoelectrical transport. Also, g(E) in semiconductors is proportional to 
the effective mass of the charge carrier of the DOS, m*. 
The increase of the carrier concentration (through doping, for instance) 
produces an increase in EF and a higher amplitude of g(E), increasing 𝜎 (see 
equation [3.1]). But it also causes a less symmetrical distribution of the 
function g(E) around EF, which reduces the value of S. Therefore, a way of 
increasing the power factor is to find the optimal carrier concentration  
to maximize both σ and S. The carrier’s relaxation time, 𝜏(𝐸, 𝑇), is  
energy-dependent, and it is inversely proportional to the carrier mobility μ, 
and it also appears in equations [3.1] and [3.2], and thus, influences the 
power factor. If we assume 𝜏(𝐸)~𝐸௥, that is, a scattering law that goes as 
the energy E to a certain power, named r, and parabolic energy bands of the 
form 𝐸= 𝐸௖± ℎଶ𝑘ଶ/2𝑚∗ (+ for electrons, − for holes), which can be 
assumed when reaching the quantum regime, the power factor can be written 
as follows: 
𝑆ଶ𝜎 ∝

ாಷିா಴
௞ಳ்+ ቀ𝑟+
ହ
ଶቁቇ

[3.3] 
Then, for higher r values, the power factor will be higher, which can be 
understood as a higher scattering of low energy carriers. Another effect that 
can enhance the power factor is to modify the DOS, which was the route 
proposed by Dresselhaus in 1993 (Hicks and Dresselhaus 1993). In this 
work, the authors proposed sharp DOS at low dimensions, along with  
quantum-confined sub-bands, and following this way of thought, the zT on 
these structures would be highly enhanced. These effects cannot be achieved 

76     Thermoelectric Micro/Nano Generators 2 
in bulk materials, but the fact of reducing the dimensionality makes it 
possible to reach these phenomena. Nevertheless, the achievements of these 
effects in nanowires have not been proven experimentally, due to the 
extremely small diameters and high quality required, or the actual DOS 
shape, which is more complex than the theoretical approximations. But the 
research carried out in this sense has resulted in other ways of improving the 
zT in these structures, such as the Coulomb blockade effect, which is a 
charging effect that blocks the transport of electrons through the structure, 
found in InAs NWs (Wu et al. 2013) or the “carrier pocket engineering”, 
also introduced by Dresselhaus (Koga et al. 1998), which consists of 
engineering the DOS in such a way that the valley degeneracy increases, 
forming quantum well states which can separate the carriers in different 
“pockets” in the real space, minimizing the inter-valley scattering, and thus, 
enhancing the power factor. 
Another important strategy for increasing zT is the reduction of thermal 
conductivity. It is made up of the sum of two terms: one due to carriers and 
thus linked to transport properties like σ, and another due to phonons and 
lattice parameters, which can be engineered independently of the other 
transport properties. The first results in this sense were triggered by the 
research in NWs when trying to enhance the power factor, and it was found 
that, even though the dimensions needed for getting quantum effects were 
not easily achieved, the increase of the surface-to-volume ratio in these  
one-dimensional structures provided a way of reducing the thermal 
conductivity (by increasing the phonon scattering on the surface). For 
instance, enhanced figures of merit for silicon (zT of 0.01 at RT) when it was 
engineered in the form of nanowires of 20 nm in diameter were found up to 
0.25 at RT (Boukai et al. 2008). Moreover, a zT of 0.6 at RT was achieved 
for silicon nanowires of 50 nm in diameter when the surfaces were rough, 
and thus, the phonon scattering was further increased (Hochbaum et al. 
2008). Also, in the case of Bi2Te3 nanowires, a thorough study on the 
thermal conductivity decrease obtained when decreasing the diameter 
presented in 2017 showed that the phonon scattering, in this case, can be 
understood under the Kinetic Collective model (Rojo et al. 2017) in all the 
diameters studied in this work. In this sense, once the effect of the size 
reduction in phonon scattering processes is understood, further enhancement 
of phonon scattering in NWs has been achieved through devising complex 
morphologies (segmented or diameter modulated NWs, for instance) which 
will produce a reduction in the total thermal conductivity and, thus, an 
increase on zT.

Merit, zT, can be implemented in nanowires, being zT the thermoelectric figure of

3.3. Fabrication of thermoelectric nanowires 
A wide variety of techniques have been used to fabricate thermoelectric 
nanowires, most of them being bottom-up approaches, but also some  
top-down methods, usually focused on the fabrication of silicon nanowires, 
such as electron beam lithography (Pennelli and Piotto 2006), nanosphere 
lithography (Hamdana et al. 2017) or atomic force lithography (Martinez  
et al. 2008) along with oxidation or etching processes (Mallavarapu et al. 
2020), have been used in the literature. These methods, although widely used 
for the microfabrication of different structures, are usually more expensive 
than most bottom-up approaches for nanowire fabrication, although they 
provide better reproducibility as far as crystallinity, composition or doping are 
concerned, given that those properties can be tailored in the bulk and then, the 
nanowires engineered from that bulk will maintain those properties. Other  
top-down techniques that have been developed lately are metal-assisted-
chemical-etching (MACE), which has proven more cost-efficient and suitable 
for large-scale production of vertical silicon nanowires (Elyamny et al. 2020) 
and porous silicon nanowires (Yang et al. 2021) or focused ion beam 
irradiation by the implantation of gallium and selective etching to obtain 
suspended silicon nanowires (Llobet et al. 2018). 
Given that the most extended approaches are bottom-up (Zhu et al. 2021), 
we will discuss them more in-depth. Among the advantages of these 
techniques, we can count the possibility of large-scale fabrication at a lower 
cost, and the achievement of smaller structures than those obtained by  
top-down approaches. Nevertheless, it is not always possible to find a 
bottom-up technique producing the desired composition or crystalline 
orientation and posing questions in order to find the right chemical process 
to produce them have to be taken into account. Among these techniques  

78     Thermoelectric Micro/Nano Generators 2 
vapor-liquid-solid (VLS) has been widely used to produce Si (Díez et al. 
2020, Hochbaum et al. 2008), or SiGe nanowires (Fonseca et al. 2021), and 
sometimes, even chalcogenides such as Bi2Te3 (Park et al. 2016) or Bi2Se3 
(Kong et al. 2010). VLS was proposed by Wagner and Ellis in 1964 while 
working at Bell Labs (Wagner and Ellis 1964), and consists of using metal 
catalytic nanoparticles on a silicon substrate, which are then exposed to a 
vapor phase precursor, such as silane or germane, of the nanowire material. 
Then, under each metallic nanoparticle the crystallization of the material is 
produced and a nanowire is grown, for instance, GaAs NWs (Ghukasyan  
et al. 2022). This method is highly compatible with silicon technology and 
the fabrication of horizontal arrays of silicon nanowires for their integration 
in thermoelectric devices has been performed with this technique (Dávila  
et al. 2012). Lately, the growth of certain nanowires, such as single-crystalline 
Ag2Te, has been carried out via a vapor-transport method without the need 
for a catalyst (Pillai 2021). Chemical Vapor Deposition (CVD) has also been 
used to obtain a CdSSe nanowire-based chip (Ding et al. 2021). Another 
technique widely used for semiconductors, molecular beam epitaxy (MBE), 
using metal nanoparticles to promote the growth of the semiconductor 
nanowires, has been employed to grow thermoelectric nanowires of Ge 
(Lange et al. 2020) or Bi4Te3 (Wang et al. 2009) or Chemical Beam Epitaxy 
as for InAsSb nanowires (Peri et al. 2022). 
Other families of bottom-up techniques are those where the growth is 
obtained from a solution (Zhu et al. 2021), such as the hydrothermal (the 
synthesis is done in water) or solvothermal (other solvents) methods, which 
has been used to obtain Sb2Se3 or Cu2Se thermoelectric nanowires (Kim et al. 
2021). Other solution-based techniques are the sonoelectrochemical processes 
(Qiu et al. 2005), template-assisted die-casting (Vivekanandan et al. 2022) or 
template-assisted electrochemical growth, which is the most widely used 
method for obtaining thermoelectric nanowires. Electrochemistry provides a 
scalable to industry, room temperature and cost-effective method for obtaining 
a wide variety of materials in a reproducible and controlled way. If ion-track 
polycarbonate membranes or anodic alumina templates, where a high density 
of pores in the range of tens to hundreds of nanometers in diameter and microns 
in length can be easily achieved, are used as templates, the electrochemical 
growth will fill those pores and produce nanowires with the corresponding 
geometry. However, other techniques, such as Atomic Layer Deposition (ALD) 
for ZnO nanowires (Ruoho et al. 2016), and Sb2S3 on VLS grown Sb2Se3  
NWs (Yang et al. 2010) or vacuum melting and pressure injection methods  
(to produce Bi nanowires (Bisrat et al. 2007; Zhang et al. 1999) or  
Poly(3-hexylthiophene) – P3HT – nanowires, for instance (Rojo et al. 2014)) 

Thermoelectric Nanowires     79 
can also be used to fill such hollow membranes and produce nanowires. In the 
literature, we can mostly find template-assisted electrochemically produced 
thermoelectric nanowires: Bi2Te3 (Manzano et al. 2019) (Rojo et al. 2013b) and 
other chalcogenides from groups V–VI, as Sb2Te3 or ternary compounds 
BiTe:Sb or BiTe:Se (Manzano and Martín-González 2019) or single elements 
like Bi, Sb, etc. (Gorokh et al. 2017).

(Hamdana et al. 2017), (Llobet et al. 2018), (Manzano et al. 2019) and (Fonseca  
et al. 2021) 
As a whole, there is a wide variety of techniques that, depending on the 
material or the properties needed, can be chosen to obtain the best nanowires 
for a given application. Figure 3.2 presents some of the possible nanowire 
configurations and properties associated with the most widely used techniques. 
3.4. Measurement of thermoelectric properties in nanowires 
There 
are 
different 
experimental 
techniques 
devised 
for 
the 
measurements of the thermoelectric properties of nanowires to characterize 
both the power factor and the thermal conductivity (see, for instance, Rojo  
et al. (2013a) for a detailed review on them). It is important to note that in 

80     Thermoelectric Micro/Nano Generators 2 
most cases, when measuring nanowires we are aiming at the nanoscale, and 
even though nanotechnology is greatly developed nowadays, most of the 
measurements and understanding of the results remain an experimental 
challenge (Yang et al. 2022). Moreover, there is a lack of metrology in these 
measurements, and it is important to have different techniques to compare 
obtained results in different laboratories, as was done, for instance, in Rojo 
et al. (2017), where two different methods were used to characterize the 
thermal conductivity of Bi2Te3 nanowires. In most cases, the zT of the 
nanowires is obtained from separated measurements of the different 
properties, S, σ and κ. 
In general, we can divide these techniques into two: (i) those who measure 
ensembles of nanowires as a whole, for instance, inside the templates in which 
they are grown, considering a composite material, or after pressing a  
bunch of nanowires into a pellet or thin film (Chen et al. 2022); and  
(ii) single nanowire measurements, developed with the aid of micro- and 
nanotechnologies, usually imply the fabrication of a micro-chip in which a 
single nanowire is individually connected and measured. Figure 3.3 shows 
schematically all these techniques along with their main advantages and 
drawbacks, which will be briefly discussed next. 
Within the measurements carried out for an ensemble of nanowires, those 
usually employed when nanowires are grown inside a template, for instance. 
In that case, the nanowires embedded in the template are treated as a 
composite, and then the contribution of the matrix and the nanowires are 
separated. Examples of these measurements are thermal conductivity 
measurements with the photoacoustic technique, in which the effective 
medium theory is used to extract both contributions from the measurement 
(Abad et al. 2016, 2017; Biswas et al. 2009) or the measurement of GaAs 
NW arrays with the 3ω technique (Ghukasyan et al. 2022). In the case of 
electrical conductivity measurements, the main problem is that they are 
mostly two-probe measurements, and thus, have a great associated error. 
Finally, for the Seebeck coefficient measurement, it can be done by 
contacting electrically the top and the bottom part of the nanowires and 
maintaining a thermal gradient, obtaining the Seebeck from the thermal 
gradient established and the voltage obtained. An example of such 
measurements can be found in Cassinelli et al. (2017). Also in this category 
of measurements, we can include those performed in high numbers of 
individual nanowires pressed together in the form of pellets (Brockway et al. 
2014) or thin films (Tai et al. 2008) and then treated as a composite material. 
In those cases, the techniques employed can be the same used for bulk or 

Thermoelectric Nanowires     81 
thin films, but several assumptions have to be made to obtain the 
contribution of the individual nanowires to the different parameters (for 
instance, the contact resistivity when measuring electrical conductivity). 
 
Figure 3.3. Schematic summary of the different configurations used in NWs  
to measure the thermoelectric properties, either in ensembles or for single  
nanowires. Their general advantages are in green and drawbacks in red 
The characterization of single nanowires can be done either when those 
are still inside a template matrix, or for isolated nanowires, which in the case 
of template-assisted fabrication methods, can be obtained after dissolving the 
matrix. The first type of measurements in embeded nanowires can be 
performed using Scanning Probe Microscopies (SPM). In them, conductive 
SPM probes can be used to contact the end of a single nanowire at one side 
of the template, while the other end is electrically connected also, and make 
a standard two-probe σ measurement or thermoresistive probes which enable 

82     Thermoelectric Micro/Nano Generators 2 
the characterization of the thermal conductivity of single nanowires, as it is 
done in 3ω-Scanning Thermal Microscopy (3ω-SThM) (Rojo et al. 2013b). 
In the case of SThM measurements of nanowires within a matrix, a model 
must be used to extract the value of the nanowires, since the tip exchange 
radius is normally higher than the diameter of the nanowires to be measured. 
The SThM technique to measure thermal conductivity at the nanoscale is 
becoming more popular since the SThM are now commercial and not  
lab-developed as they were previously. The second family of measurements 
on single nanowires are those based on micro-platforms designed for 
different properties (Yang et al. 2021). For instance, a single nanowire can 
be placed on a microchip and contacted at both ends (two or four-probe 
measurements) to characterize its electrical conductivity. If a temperature 
gradient is also created along the nanowire (with microheaters in the same 
chip), then the temperature drop can be measured with two electrodes which 
can also be used as thermometers, and thus, the Seebeck coefficient can be 
obtained (Mavrokefalos et al. 2009). Also, field-effect transistors can be 
used to modulate the carrier concentration in the nanowires by changing the 
gating, and thus, the power factor can be obtained (Sun et al. 2018; Fust  
et al. 2020). Suspended microdevices have also been employed to perform 
thermal conductivity measurements in nanowires, where two pads containing 
heaters and electrodes are bridged with the nanowire, which is then 
electrically contacted (Valentín et al. 2013) or by performing 3ω 
measurements in single nanowires (Peri et al. 2022). The main problem with 
these kinds of measurements is assessing an ohmic contact with the NWs, 
which is crucial to obtain reliable results. Another possibility is to use an 
SPM to scan the surface of the NW in the chip, and thus measure the 
electrical conductivity along its length, achieving high-spatial resolution 
(Rojo et al. 2016). Alternatively, Sojo-Gordillo et al. (2021) use the 
previously cited SThM technique to measure the thermal conductivity of 
suspended nanowires. 
In the last few years, there have been results on different kinds of 
nanowires prepared by the different techniques discussed above. In the 
following table, we present a summary of the publications where the three 
parameters S, σ, κ have been measured in the nanowires and the zT is 
reported. Those values are visually summarized in Figure 3.4. Table 3.1 
includes the material, NW diameter, growth technique, S, σ, κ, zT, values at 
room temperature along with the reference.

It can be seen that the influence of the dimensionality reduction in 
materials that are considered as good thermoelectric materials is not so 
relevant when achieving zT values below or similar to those reported in bulk. 
However, it can be observed that the smaller the diameter, the higher the zT. 
 
Figure 3.4. Summary of the reported zT at room temperature (RT) for nanowires of 
various materials (green for Bi2Te3 and related alloys; orange for PbTe and PbSe; 
blue for other chalcogenides; gray for silicon, SiGe, and CrSi2; and finally red for 
perovskites and other oxides) based on published values. The zT values at room 
temperature (RT) are represented versus the nanowire diameters and versus the 
publication year. The data has been taken for the references listed in Table 3.1. For 
comparison purposes, the different nanowire values have been compared with the zT 
of the bulk material at RT, which has been represented along the column values in 
the cases where they overcome the bulk values for direct comparison. These zT 
values at RT are 0.01 for bulk Si (Hochbaum et al. 2008), 0.15 for bulk PbTe (Guo  
et al. 2022), which has been represented in darker orange, and the highest being 
0.32 for bulk Bi2Te3 (Ruiz-Clavijo et al. 2021) represented in light green. In the case 
of electrodeposited Bi2Te3, it is more accurate to compare the obtained zT of the 
electrodeposited 3D network and nanowires with that of electrochemically grown 
Bi2Te3 films grown under similar conditions and with the same crystal orientation, 
since the same technique and conditions are used. This value is of 0.04 at RT 
(Manzano et al. 2016), which are represented in a darker green

3.5. Nanowire-based thermoelectric devices 
To take advantage of the improved properties of nanowires for 
thermoelectric applications, along with exploiting the reduced size of NW 
structures, NW-based thermoelectric generators (TEGs) have been 
implemented in the last few years. In most cases, a suitable fabrication 
process, along with the integration of the NWs in the final device, is not 
straightforward, but the development of micro- and nanotechnology has 
provided different approaches to doing so. 
The most straightforward configuration would be the substitution of the 
bulk thermoelectric material in a conventional TEG by an array of vertical 
nanowires (Elyamny et al. 2020; Borshchevsky et al. 2005). Nevertheless, in 
reality, this configuration needs mechanical stability, which is difficult to 
achieve in most cases. Dense and aligned NWs are required, and the 
fabrication of the electrical and thermal contacts is also challenging, 
although it has been achieved in some cases, even with bottom-up 
approaches (Dávila et al. 2015). An alternative to increase its robustness is to 
employ nanowires embedded in a matrix, either the template in which they  
are grown or dispersed inside a polymeric matrix. In the case of  
template-assisted growths, the fabrication can be done in such a way that the 
same matrix is used for both p- and n-type materials and stays in the final 
TEG (Lim et al. 2005). In the case of dispersing a high number of NWs in a 
polymer (PEDOT:PSS, for instance), this enables the formation of 
composites which can even be formulated for printing (Karalis et al. 2021). 
These kinds of composites are also proposed for fabricating flexible TEGs, 
which can be used to power wearable devices (see, for instance, Li et al. 
2019; Koukharenko et al. 2018). Finally, nanowires pressed into thin films 
have also been proposed for the design of stretchable TEGs, such as Te, 
Cu1.75Te, or Ag2Te NWs (Chen et al. 2022). 
A different approach is that proposed by Professor Fonseca’s group, 
where CVD-VLS fabricated p- and n-type Si-NWs have been fabricated in a 
horizontal configuration within a microdevice (Dávila et al. 2012). Apart 
from being completely compatible with CMOS, this kind of TEGs is 
improving its performance with modifications in the design, NW fabrication, 
etc., obtaining powers in the range of μW·cm-1 (Fonseca et al. 2021, 
Sojo‐Gordillo et al. 2022). A similar approach has been used to develop 
TEGs based on InAs NWs of diameters around 540 nm, reaching lower 
produced powers in the range of NW (Koskinen et al. 2021).

3.6. Interconnected 3D nanowire networks 
A novel configuration that, on the one hand, overcomes the difficulties 
for the integration of thermoelectric NWs in bulk devices in a vertical 
configuration, and on the other hand, maintains the NW properties, has been 
developed lately: the fabrication of 3D interconnected nanowire networks. 
These structures provide a mixture between the enhanced thermoelectric 
properties of low-dimensional structures with the robustness of a  
scaffold-like structure. Then, these structures can be handled at the 
macroscale and their implementation in TEGs is much straightforward. 
These self-sustained structures can be obtained by electrochemical  
template-assisted growth, provided the template has a 3D structure. This can 
be performed in polycarbonate (PC) films where a net of nanotubes can be 
formed by irradiating the PC at two different angles and then etching them. 
The growth of a thermoelectric material produces an interconnected structure 
of nanowires (see Figure 3.5a (Wagner et al. 2021)). Also, these PC films 
have been used to fabricate interconnected NWs of magnetic materials 
(CoNi, Cu or Permalloy) and even multilayered 3D networks, which show a 
thermoelectirc voltage which can be further controlled in the presence of a 
magnetic field (da Câmara Santa Clara Gomes et al. 2022; Marchal et al. 
2020). Another way of fabricating 3D templates is the fabrication of  
3D Alumina templates (3D-AAOs), proposed in 2014 by Martín-González  
et al. (2014). These 3D-AAOs consist of longitudinal nanotubes which are 
interconnected with their first neighbors at certain positions, which can be 
tailored during the fabrication. Then, the filling of such structures with 
thermoelectric materials, as Bi2Te3 (Ruiz-Clavijo et al. 2018) produces an 
ordered 3D nanowire network at the macroscopic scale (even after the 
dissolution of the matrix), which maintains the properties of nanowire 
configuration (see Figure 3.5b). For instance, the thermal conductivity, 
obtained for a 3D network of Bi2Te3 NWs, is reduced to 0.5 W·m-1·K-1, as 
compared to 2.2 W·m-1·K-1 for films or to 0.72 W·m-1·K-1 when compared to 
NW of the same diameters (50 nm), as shown in (Abad et al. 2016). 
Moreover, recent results from our group have shown that these structures 
preserve the high electrical conductivity found in electrodeposited Bi2Te3 
films and an increase in the Seebeck coefficient when compared to 
electrodeposited nanowires and films has been measured. This latter effect 
may be caused by the topological surface states that are present in nanowires 
(given that Bi2Te3 is a topological insulator material and the high quality of 
the 3D nanowires that have been measured) (Ruiz-Clavijo et al. 2021). These 
results on 3D nanowire networks open a new research avenue to implement 

88     Thermoelectric Micro/Nano Generators 2 
nanowires into devices with improved thermoelectric performance versus 1D 
nanowires or films.

3.7. Summary and outlook 
In this chapter, we have shown the latest developments in thermoelectric 
nanowires, from the motivation behind their development to the different 
techniques used for their fabrication to their implementation in actual 
generators, which is a field in continuous development. Moreover, the 
recently introduced 3D nanowire networks have opened up even more 
possibilities for developing these structures for thermoelectric applications. 
This, along with the number of open questions still unanswered, makes the 
research on thermoelectric nanowires an interesting path to increase the 
thermoelectric performance of a great number of materials. 
The future of this field should be two-fold under our point to view. On 
the one hand, the study of the underlying physics behind the different 
parameters and how they can be engineered in nanowires, and in 3D 
metamaterials, not only to further understand their physics (for instance, how 
the enhanced the reduction in thermal conductivity or how the surface effect 
in topological insulators can be controlled to enhance the thermoelecrtric 
efficiency) but to engineer better-performing devices. On the other hand, the 
development of nanotechnology tools will enable the fabrication of even 
more complex and controlled nanowire structures, along with possibilities of 
more reliable measurement techniques at the nanoscale and better metrology. 
These ever-growing possibilities should pave the way to novel 
breakthroughs in the performance of these low dimensional structures and 
their implementation in efficiency enhanced thermoelectric generators.

Thermoelectric Sulfides 
Sylvie HÉBERT, Ramzy DAOU and Antoine MAIGNAN 
ENSICAEN, UNICAEN, CNRS, CRISMAT, Normandie Université, Caen, France 
The optimization of the thermoelectric properties of chalcogenides is 
classically performed by modifying the doping and the micro- or 
nanostructure, by using materials with complex crystallographic structures or 
by optimizing the defects chemistry. Among all these possibilities, we will 
highlight the results obtained for model systems among sulfides. First, the 
investigation of doped TiS2 single crystals and dense textured ceramics will 
be presented, along with the determination of doping and anisotropy effects 
in these 2D structural types. Second, in transition metal chalcogenides, the 
magnetism can strongly modify transport, with a direct influence on the 
thermoelectric properties, as shown in the case of itinerant (CoS2 and Co9S8) 
or localized (CuCrTiS4) carriers in denser 3D structures. These two 
examples picked up among sulfides illustrate the richness of chalcogenides 
for thermoelectricity.

4.1. Introduction  
To overcome the limitations of Bi2Te3-based thermoelectric (TE) 
materials related to their decomposition at low T, the tellurium toxicity and 
scarcity, great attention was given to transition metal oxides offering much 
larger chemical stability at high T (Hébert et al. 2001; Guilmeau et al. 2009; 
Koumoto et al. 2010). Although promising TE power factors (PF = S2/ρ with 
S and ρ for the Seebeck coefficient and electrical resistivity, respectively) 
were achieved, as, for instance, in the so-called misfit cobaltites (Sotelo et al. 
2011), their too large thermal conductivity, for a textured Ca3Co4O9 dense 
ceramic κ300K = 4.4 W.K−1.m−1 (Torres et al. 2019), led to too low values for 
their figure of merit (zT = S2T/(ρκ) = (PF)T/κ; κ is the sum of the electronic 
(κel) and lattice (κl) parts). Nonetheless, such 2D materials, where the Co 
cations sit at the center of octahedra forming CdI2-type metallic layers 
separated by rock-salt type insulating layers (Masset et al. 2000), could be 
considered as a realization of the PGEC Slack concept, i.e. phonon glass 
electron crystal (Slack 1997), especially if we consider the misfit structural 
character of the sublattices, CdI2- and rock salt-types.  
In that respect, layered transition metal disulfides with similar networks 
of edge-shared MS6 octahedra were rapidly proposed as an alternative to 
CoO2-based 2D magnetic oxides (Imai et al. 2001; Wan et al. 2010; 
Guilmeau et al. 2011; Hébert et al. 2013a; Guilmeau et al. 2015). Among 
them, TiS2 is close to being a textbook case (1T common form, P-3m1 
hexagonal layered structure): its [TiS2]∞ successive layers are separated by a 
van der Waals (VDW) gap, allowing chemical substitutions in the former 
and/or cation intercalation (including self-intercalation) in the latter to be 
made (Guilmeau et al. 2015). The consequences of adding cations in the 
VDW gap and/or substituting aliovalent cations at the Ti4+ site are double, 
change in (Ti3+) electron concentration (band filling) and hindering of 
phonon propagation (κl decrease).  
Another route has been offered by chalcogenides containing transition 
metal cations with partially filled d orbitals belonging to strongly correlated 
systems: their TE properties are sensitive to the interplay between charges 
and spins (Maignan et al. 2003; Wang et al. 2003; Behnia et al. 2004), as 
probed by magnetic field-dependent thermoelectric power (MTEP) (Hébert 
et al. 2021a). As the Seebeck coefficient depends on both transport 
coefficients and entropy (Peterson et al. 2007), large orbital or spin degrees 
of freedom of the carriers result in large S (Koshibae et al. 2001). At first, 
considering metal transition oxides, the MTEP measurement of NaxCoO2 

Impact of Chemical Doping or Magnetism in Model Thermoelectric Sulfides     101 
(Wang et al. 2003) and misfit cobaltites (Maignan et al. 2003) demonstrated 
this spin entropy role. More recently, a similar role of spins was evidenced 
for the spin glass CuCrTiS4 thiospinel, for which MTEP was reported 
(Berthebaud et al. 2018).  
In the present chapter, we report on these two different strategies by 
focusing, for the first part, on TiS2-based TE materials, and for the second, 
on two Co-S binary sulfides, Co9S8 pentlandite (Hébert et al. 2021b) and 
CoS2 pyrite (Hébert et al. 2013b), and on the CuCrTiS4 quaternary thiospinel 
(Berthebaud et al. 2018; Hébert et al. 2021a). Such examples give only a 
very partial overview of the numerous studies on TE sulfides, such as the 
very recent ones on compounds derived from minerals, which zT values 
approach or are close to unity for the p-type side, including tetrahedrite, 
colusite and copper-deficient binaries Cu2-xS (Powell 2019 and references 
therein), or, for the n-type ones, CuFeS2 pyrite (Li et al. 2013), Co3Sn2S3 
shandite (Mangelis et al. 2020), compounds with zT lower than those of their 
p-type counterparts. 
4.2. TiS2: intercalation chemistry to combine power factor 
optimization and lattice thermal conductivity degradation 
The question of whether TiS2 is intrinsically semiconducting or  
semi-metallic (Stoliaroff et al. 2019) comes from the property discrepancy in 
different publications for compounds of nominal TiS2 composition. The 
careful study of SPS-densified ceramics of Ti1+xS2, where x is the Ti excess 
in the nominal composition to create Ti self-intercalation in the VDW gap, 
allowed us to give an answer to that long-term problem (Beaumale et al. 
2014). │S300K│ values as high as 300 µV.K-1 could be achieved by tuning x 
precisely, indicating that when un-doped, TiS2 is rather semiconducting. 
Also, instead of Ti self-intercalation, other cations can be intercalated on 
purpose to optimize the TE properties, such as Cu (Guilmeau et al. 2011), 
Co (Guélou et al. 2016), Fe (Pawula et al. 2019) or Ag (Barbier et al. 2015), 
but with staging in the latter case, with Ag not intercalated in every VDW 
gap. Remarkably, the CuxTiS2-densified ceramics with x > 0 were found to 
exhibit larger zT values than the x = 0 pristine TiS2 prepared in similar 
synthetic conditions, such as for Cu0.05TiS2, where zT = 0.46 at 800 K 
(Guilmeau et al. 2017). Along that intercalation, as Cu brings positive 
charges, the charge carrier concentration increases (Ti3+ electrons), and so ρ 
and │S│ values decrease concomitantly, leading to a rather constant PF. The 
more important improvement comes from the κl decrease outperforming the 

102     Thermoelectric Micro/Nano Generators 2 
κe increase, resulting from the ρ decrease evidenced in these SPS-densified 
ceramics.  
As this compound possesses a 2D structure, its anisotropic TE properties 
are difficult to measure on these platelet-like crystals. Measuring κ in thin 
crystals of intercalated TiS2 (grown by iodine vapor transport (Kawano et al. 
1989), exhibiting typical thicknesses of 20 µm) can hardly be realized by 
diffusivity measurements, as laser flash requires a 1 mm thick sample at 
minimum.  
 
Figure 4.1. Anisotropy in the lattice thermal conductivity of TiS2 and derivatives as a 
function of carrier concentration. Single crystals (FexTiS2 and TiS2) and oriented 
ceramics (CuxTiS2) are compared to the calculated thermal conductivities of the 
perfect structure derived from ab initio calculations (see the text) 
Using cleaved FexTiS2 crystals, cross-plane thermal conductivity was 
measured by picosecond time-domain thermos-reflectance, whereas the  
in-plane values were measured using the steady-state technique involving a 
calibrated heat pipe to measure the thermal power entering the sample 
(Pawula et al. 2019). This allowed us to measure the thermal conductivity 
anisotropy (Figure 4.1) at room temperature with reasonable uncertainty.  

Impact of Chemical Doping or Magnetism in Model Thermoelectric Sulfides     103 
κc is found to increase as the Fe content (x) increases, suggesting that 
intercalated Fe atoms may start to function as phonon conduction paths, 
rather than as phonon-scattering sources. Moreover, these values, all in the 
range from κc = 0.6 W.K−1.m−1 to κc = 1.1 W.K−1.m−1 (Pawula et al. 2019), 
much smaller than the unique published value for a TiS2 crystal, κc =  
4.2 W.K−1.m−1 (Imai et al. 2001), point towards a larger κab/κc anisotropy, of 
about 6, than the previously reported one, κab/κc ≈ 1.5 (Imai et al. 2001). 
While a degree of κ anisotropy is also found in textured ceramics  
(Figure 4.1) (Guilmeau et al. 2017), it is not as marked as in single crystals, 
which is to be expected given the spread of orientations present. In any case, 
in comparison to the ρ anisotropy of such 2D materials, of about ρc/ρab ≈ 750 
in crystals at 300 K (Imai et al. 2001), the high in-plane PF of TiS2, 
PF = 37.1ψ μW.K-2.cm (Imai et al. 2001), similar to that of the best Bi2Te3 
values (Scherrer and Scherrer 1995), is unlikely to be beaten by the c direction, 
as a strong anisotropy in thermopower is not expected in this material; unlike, 
for example, similarly structured covalently bonded layered oxide PdCoO2, 
where the out-of-plane thermoelectric power is predicted to be very large as a 
result of the strong energy dependence of the conductivity (Ong et al. 2010). 
Comparing different crystals, self-intercalated, intercalated by Co, or 
substituted by Ta for Ti to bring even more electrons (Daou et al. 2015), it 
turns out that the most efficient way to reduce κ is the substitution, with, at 
T=300K, κtotal = 1.2 W.K−1.m−1 in Ti0.9Ta0.1S2 crystal against κtotal =  
4.3 W.K−1.m−1 for our self-intercalated TiS2 crystal (Daou et al. 2015). But 
for that Ti1-xTaxS2 series, with the charge carrier concentration becoming too 
large (for x = 0.1, ne(300 K) = 3.7x1021 cm-3), PF drops to about PF = 
3.4 μW.K-2.cm, i.e. one order of magnitude smaller than the aforementioned 
best TiS2 crystals (Imai et al. 2001). Consequently, this comparison shows 
that optimizing zT of TiS2 crystals remains challenging, as the κl decrease 
induced by intercalants or substituents, more efficient in-plane than  
out-of-plane, is not sufficient to compensate the PF decrease induced by the 
ne increase.  
Such a conclusion is consistent with those drawn from the study of  
in-plane and out-of-plane TE measurements in CuxTiS2 SPS prepared 
textured ceramics (Guilmeau et al. 2017), with texturation leading to 
anisotropic properties with ρout-of-plane > ρin-plane (1) and κout-of-plane < κin-plane (2) 
(Figure 4.1), at all x, in agreement with measurements on crystals (Imai et al. 
2001). Nevertheless, the most surprising result is the existence of an S 
anisotropy, with │Sin-plane│> │Sout-of-plane│(3), a result differing from that 
reported for Bi2Te3 crystals that showed an isotropic S (Fleurial et al. 1988). 

104     Thermoelectric Micro/Nano Generators 2 
In CuxTiS2, by combining the relations (1) and (3), the in-plane PF is always 
higher than the out-of-plane one, but when calculating zT, it appears that this  
in-plane superiority is always compensated by the relation (2), leading to 
similar zT values for in-plane and out-of-plane orientations (Guilmeau et al. 
2017). 
In other words, for TiS2 and its related compounds, there is no advantage 
in texturing the material, as the zT values along the in-plane or out-of-plane 
directions are always similar. This explains why the zT values of crystals 
and polycrystals of that material are the same. 
To conclude that chapter on TiS2, it must be added that other strategies 
have been developed to take advantage of the 2D feature of its structure with 
a VDW gap. Misfit compounds of the (MS)1+x(TiS2)2 formula (with M = Pb, 
Sn, Bi) have also been investigated (Wan et al. 2010, Guilmeau et al. 2015). 
The same kind of conclusions were drawn, the intergrown (MS)1+x extra 
layers being responsible for a decrease of the thermal conductivity, but by 
charge compensation between (MS)1+x and (TiS2)2 layers, a PF reduction was 
also measured. Successful grafting of organic chains in between the [TiS2]∞ 
successive layers to produce hybrid TE materials was also shown to be 
promising: for instance, the hybrid inorganic–organic superlattice of TiS2 
[tetrabutylammonium]x was proposed as a flexible thermoelectric (Wan et al. 
2017). 
4.3. Magnetism and thermoelectricity in sulfides 
The Seebeck coefficient can be written as the sum of two terms, the 
transport term (depending on the energy and charge currents) and the 
entropic term associated with the chemical potential (Peterson et al. 2010). 
The magnetic field dependence of thermopower has been actively 
investigated in the field of spintronics, and large magnetothermopower 
(MTEP) can be observed simultaneously with large magnetoresistance (MR) 
in Fe/Cr or Co/Cu multilayers (Sakurai et al. 1991; Piraux et al. 1992). For 
these metallic and spin-polarized multilayers, the MTEP values depend on 
the relative ratio between spin-up and spin-down channels (Piraux et al. 
1992) following Mott’s formula. Large enhancements of zT induced by a 
magnetic field have also been achieved in metallic nanowires such as Ni 
(with ΔzT/zT = +22% in 0.5 T and 300 K), or with flexible Co/Cu nanowire 
networks (Mitdank et al. 2012; Araujo et al. 2019). More recently, large  
 

Impact of Chemical Doping or Magnetism in Model Thermoelectric Sulfides     105 
magnetothermopower values have been evidenced in topological insulators 
(Qu et al. 2012) induced by the peculiar band structures of these materials 
and associated with extremely large magneto-resistance values. All these 
effects are mostly due to the transport term of the Seebeck coefficient. 
In the case of oxides such as NaxCoO2 (Wang et al. 2003) and misfits 
cobaltites (Maignan et al. 2003), or sulfides and selenides (Peix et al. 1985; 
Berthebaud et al. 2018), large magnetothermopower values have been 
obtained, but mostly due to the entropic part of thermopower. The presence 
of paramagnetic spins leads to a large magnetic entropy term, which can be 
quenched by the magnetic field application. This term can reach values as 
large as 60 μV/K in BiCaCoO misfits, with a relative magnetothermopower 
reaching -70% at 2 K and 9 T (Maignan et al. 2003). This contribution can 
be observed in a large T range, i.e. below 75 K in CuCrTiS4 (Berthebaud  
et al. 2018) or below 100 K in misfits (Maignan et al. 2003).  
Apart from this magnetic entropy term arising from the paramagnetic 
spins, a second entropic term has been evidenced in the case of narrow band 
systems such as NaxCoO2 and misfits, following the generalized Heikes 
formula. At sufficiently high temperature (i.e. T >> characteristic energy 
scales such as t, the hopping parameter), the atomic limit can be reached and 
the Seebeck coefficient is equal to the chemical potential, and thus depends 
on the spin and orbital entropy of the different transition metal cations inside 
the material (Doumerc 1994; Koshibae et al. 2001). Large values for this 
entropic term have been reported and considered to explain the large 
thermoelectric power, as in NaxCoO2 (Koshibae et al. 2001; Wang et al. 
2003).  
Magnetism is therefore an interesting tuning parameter of the transport 
and thermoelectric properties. The entropic term can be more easily 
observed in oxides, due to the narrow electronic band induced by electronic 
correlations (Koshibae et al. 2001; Peterson et al. 2007), but sulfides can also 
exhibit a large magnetothermopower or a large interplay between 
thermoelectric coefficients and magnetism. We review here recent results 
obtained in sulfides to show the positive impact of magnetism on the 
Seebeck coefficient in the presence of spin-polarized transport or with 
paramagnetic spins.  
The thermopowers of two binary cobalt sulfides are presented in  
Figure 4.2.

Figure 4.2. The Seebeck coefficient of CoS2 and Co9S8 as a function  
of temperature. Inset: electrical resistivity of CoS2 and Co9S8  
The Seebeck coefficients of Co9S8 and CoS2 are negative with values 
reaching –25 μV/K and -50 μV/K, respectively, at 700 K. Co9S8 is metallic 
with very small values of electrical resistivity (inset of Figure 4.2), close to 
0.08 mΩ.cm at 300 K, and is reported to be antiferromagnetic with a very 
large TN (Heidelberg et al. 1966), or a Pauli paramagnet (Covino et al. 
1982), i.e. no magnetic transition is observed for the two cases up to at least 
1,000 K. Only few reports can be found on this material, and its magnetic 
properties are still debated. The S values are almost linear up to 300 K, with  
relatively modest values in good agreement with its metallic behavior. The 
electrical resistivity follows a Bloch Gruneisen behavior suggesting 
electron–phonon-dominated transport (Hébert et al. 2021b). Contrary to 
Co9S8, CoS2 has been deeply investigated and can be considered as a model 
system for spin-polarized transport, with its ferromagnetic behavior below 
TC = 122 K coexisting with metallicity. Spin polarization is very large and 
can reach 85% by the Fe for Co substitution (Leighton et al. 2007). The 
strong coupling between charges and spins leads to a clear accident on the 
ρ(T) curve at 122 K (inset of Figure 4.2). The S values are much larger for 
CoS2 throughout the T range, and moreover a peak of S (Figure 4.2) is 
observed in the ferromagnetic state below 122 K, which can be fitted by a 

Impact of Chemical Doping or Magnetism in Model Thermoelectric Sulfides     107 
T3/2 behavior (Figure 4.3) reminiscent of a magnonic contribution (Hébert  
et al. 2013b).  
 
Figure 4.3. The Seebeck coefficient of Co1-xFexS2. The dashed  
line is a fit of S ~ a+bT+cT3/2 extracted from Hébert (2013b) 
The absolute values of S steadily increase up to 700 K, and almost 
saturate to S = -50 μV/K. The resultant power factor S2/ρ is very large and 
moreover strongly increased when entering into the FM state, exceeding  
5 mWm-1K-2 at low temperatures (Hébert et al. 2013b). The impact of Fe 
substitution can be observed in Figure 4.3.  
As Fe content increases, the low T peak of thermopower gradually 
decreases, while the values above TC remain unaffected. The peak is 
completely suppressed for x > 0.15 in Co1-xFexS2 (Acevedo Salas et al. 
2019). This critical x value directly corresponds to the value where spin 
polarization reaches its maximal value (Leighton et al. 2007), suggesting that 
the increase of the imbalance between spin-up and spin-down channels as x 
decreases from x = 0.15 is at the origin of the peak. The tuning of spin 
polarization in such a metallic material can thus generate very large Seebeck 
values and very large power factors.  

108     Thermoelectric Micro/Nano Generators 2 
Magnetism can also play a role in the thermoelectric properties in the 
case of localized carriers. In the thiospinel CuCrTiS4, a spin glass behavior 
has been reported at T = 8 K (Nagata et al. 2012). A deviation from the 
Curie–Weiss law is observed below T ~ 75 K (Figure 4.5 of Berthebaud  
et al. (2018)). Resistivity values are typical of localized carriers (Figure 4.4), 
and the ρ(T) curve displays a variable-range-hopping behavior below 75 K. 
Remarkably, very large values of magneto-resistance (MR) are observed 
below ~ 100 K, with MR reaching -50% at 20 K and 9 T (Figure 4.5, left 
axis) and up to -95% at 5 K/9 T (Berthebaud et al. 2018). All the MR curves 
can be rescaled on a single curve following the Brillouin function as (1-BJ
2), 
where BJ is the Brillouin function with J = 3/2. This scaling is consistent 
with the hopping of Cr3+ (S = 3/2), and with the strong reduction of ρ as Cr3+ 
spins align under the application of a magnetic field. This is reminiscent of 
the behavior of colossal magneto-resistant manganites (Viret et al. 1997).

Seebeck coefficient as a function of temperature, measured under 0 T and 9 T 

Impact of Chemical Doping or Magnetism in Model Thermoelectric Sulfides     109 
Such a large MR has previously been observed in FeCr2S4 thiospinel 
(Ramirez et al. 1997), and contrasts with the behavior of a metallic and Pauli 
paramagnetic thiospinel such as CuTi2S4, in which a small and positive MR 
is observed (Berthebaud et al. 2018). The inset of Figure 4.4 presents the 
thermopower of CuCrTiS4 measured in 0 T and 9 T. The values are negative 
and continuously increase in magnitude as T increases. The two curves are 
superimposed at high temperatures, but below ~75 K, the two curves start to 
separate, with a larger magnitude in 0 T than in 9 T. 
  
Figure 4.5. Magneto-resistance MR (left-axis) and magneto-thermopower  
MTEP (right-axis) as a function of magnetic field at T = 20 K in CuCrTiS4  
As shown in Figure 4.5 (right-axis), the magnitude of S at 20 K 
continuously decreases as a function of field, with magnetothermopower 
values reaching –26% at 5 K and 9 T. For these low temperatures, the very 
large MR (Figure 4.5, left-axis) of -50% induces a positive impact on the 
power factor PF, even if MTEP is negative, as PF increases by 15%. This 
has no direct impact on applications as the temperatures and PF values are  
 

110     Thermoelectric Micro/Nano Generators 2 
much too small, but the combined mechanism of large and negative MR 
together with a negative MTEP, smaller in magnitude, can be interesting for 
materials exhibiting MR values closer to room temperature. The link 
between MR and MTEP is still under investigation. 
4.4. Conclusion 
Two different strategies have been presented here to show how the 
thermoelectric properties of sulfides can be modified or optimized. A careful 
doping investigation has been performed in TiS2 single crystals. Even if the 
thermal and electronic transport are very anisotropic, the zT values do not so 
strongly depend on the anisotropy, showing that texturation is not necessary 
in this family of materials. In magnetic sulfides, the impact of magnetic 
fields and magnetism can be important both for itinerant and localized 
carriers, and magnetism can induce an enhancement of the Seebeck 
coefficient. Magnetism can be considered as an extra parameter, with respect 
to doping, nanostructuration or microstructure optimization, for the 
optimization of thermoelectric properties in these sulfides.

5.1. Thermoelectric conversion – Seebeck effect and anomalous 
Nernst effect (ANE) 
Thermoelectric (TE) conversion, the direct generation of electricity from 
heat current, has been extensively studied for more than a century for using 
waste heat in our environment as a source of energy. In addition, today in 
powering trillions of IoT sensors and wearable devices, there is a rapidly 
growing demand for novel energy harvesting technology instead of batteries, 
in particular in the form of flexible, durable thermoelectric generators. 
Although the thermoelectric conversion has been regarded as a leading 
technology, the practical application using the thermopile based on the

conventional Seebeck effect faces a number of difficulties such as very high 
production cost (for the complicated pillar structure and a large number of 
contacts (Figure 5.1a)) and the usage of the rare, toxic and brittle elements 
such as Bi, Pb and Te. Thus, another type of thermoelectric conversion, the 
anomalous Nernst effect (ANE), has attracted significant attention as the 
next-generation technology (Mizuguchi and Nakatsuji 2019): its transverse 
geometry allows the efficient, large area and flexible coverage of a curved 
heat source with a much lower production cost (Figure 5.1b). Moreover, the 
recent discovery of the significant enhancement in the ANE in topological 
magnets has initiated a new trend in the study of quantum materials and 
paved a path for its TE application (Ikhlas and Tomita 2017; Sakai et al. 
2018, 2020; Nakatsuji and Arita 2022). Thus, the large ANE in topological 
magnets has gained much interest not only from academia but also from 
industrial sectors because of the potential to reduce the production cost of 
thermopiles by two to three orders of magnitude, enabling the design of  
low-cost energy-harvesters for IoT sensors and wearable devices. 
Firstly, let us review the Seebeck and anomalous Nernst effects. Up until 
now, most of the TE conversion is based on the Seebeck effect, which is a 
longitudinal TE response (Figure 5.1a) (Nolas et al. 2001).

[5.1] 
Here, 𝑆௫௫, 𝑬, 𝛁𝑇, 𝛥𝑉, and 𝛥𝑇 are the Seebeck coefficient, electric field, 
temperature gradient, electromotive force and temperature difference, 
respectively. Note that 𝛥𝑉 does not depend on the material’s geometry ℓ, 
since 𝑬 and 𝛁𝑇 are parallel to each other. This effect indicates that the 
carriers in the material (electron or hole) can carry both the charge and heat 
current, which is generalized by the Boltzmann transport equations, 
𝑱௖= 𝜎ො𝑬+ αෝ(−𝛁𝑇) 
[5.2] 
𝑱௤= Π෡𝑱௖+ 𝜅̂(−𝛁𝑇). 
[5.3] 
Here, 𝑱௖, 𝑱௤, 𝜎ො, αෝ, Π෡, and 𝜅̂ are the electric current density, heat current 
density, electrical conductivity tensor, thermoelectric conductivity tensor, 
the Peltier tensor and thermal conductivity tensor, respectively. The first 
term in equation [5.2] and the second term in equation [5.3], respectively, 
represent Ohm’s law and Fourier’s law. TE conversion is described by the 
second term in equation [5.2] and the first term in equation [5.3]. Assuming

If the external magnetic field is applied or the material itself shows a 
ferromagnetic order, the off-diagonal elements can be nonzero. Especially 
for the ferromagnetic case, α௜௝ and σ௜௝ can be finite even at zero external 
magnetic fields owing to the spontaneous magnetization. Assuming the  
z-axis ferromagnetic moment 𝑴∥𝒛 and setting 𝑱௖= 0 and −𝛁𝑇∥𝒙, we can 
obtain: 
𝐽௬= 𝜎௬௫𝑆௫௫+ 𝜎௬௬𝑆௬௫−𝛼௬௫= 0, 
[5.4] 
where 𝑆௬௫ is the anomalous Nernst (AN) coefficient, which is defined by, 
𝑆௬௫≡

[5.5] 
Here, ℓ and 𝑡 are the sample lengths along the direction of temperature 
gradient and along the electromotive force, respectively (Figure 5.1b). In 
contrast with 𝑆௫௫, 𝑆௬௫ depends on the sample geometry ℓ and 𝑡 and more 
precisely scales with 𝑡/ℓ because 𝑬⊥𝛁𝑇. As a result, the device structure 
for the ANE has to be different from that for the Seebeck effect. Namely, the 
conventional thermoelectric device (Peltier device) consists of a large 
number of p- and n-type semiconductor pillars to enhance the voltage 
(Figure 5.1a), while the AN device may have a flexible thin-film structure, 
which can efficiently cover curved and wide heat sources (Figure 5.1b) 
(Sakuraba et al. 2013). However, the ห𝑆௬௫ห for the ordinary ferromagnet is ~ 
0.1% of |𝑆௫௫|, and is too small for any thermoelectric applications. In the 
following section, we describe the relation between 𝑆௬௫ and the electronic 
band structure, and the recent observation of the giant ANE at room 
temperature found in topological magnets (Nakatsuji and Arita 2022).

5.2. Physics of topological magnets 
The electronic band structure, in particular, the bands near Fermi energy, 
𝜀ி governs the electronic transport properties of a conductor. Topological 
magnets possess both magnetic ordering and unique topological band 
structure near 𝜀ி such as linear crossings (Weyl cones) and touching in lines 
(nodal lines). These touching points or lines in the band structure enhance 
the Berry curvature, which can induce a large anomalous Hall and 
anomalous Nernst effect (Nakatsuji and Arita 2022). 
5.2.1. Transverse electrical and thermal conductivity driven by 
Berry curvature

where 
𝑨௡(𝒌) ≡−𝑖⟨𝑛(𝒌)|𝛁௞|𝑛(𝒌)⟩ is the Berry connection of the n-th band |𝑛(𝒌)⟩. 
If 𝐷= 2 and the Fermi energy 𝜀୊ lies within the band gap such as  
two-dimensional (2D) electron systems under magnetic field and 2D band 
insulators, the integration of equation [5.6] is over the entire Brillouin zone, 
resulting in the integer Hall effect σ௫௬= −𝑒ଶ𝐶௡ℎ
⁄ , if the Chern number 𝐶௡ 
is nonzero and an integer value (Thouless et al. 1982). On the contrary, 
equation [5.6] is integrated over 𝜀୊ for 3D metals, resulting in unquantized 
σ௫௬ called intrinsic anomalous Hall conductivity. By using the partial  
derivative of the Hamiltonian 𝛁௞ℋ, the Berry curvature can also be 
expressed as,

[5.9] 
The magnitude of Berry curvature becomes gigantic around the touching 
points or lines since the denominator of equation [5.9] is the energy 
difference of the two bands. Then, in turn, such large Berry curvature 
enhances 𝜎௫௬ and 𝛼௫௬ through equations [5.6] and [5.7] (Nagaosa et al. 
2010; Xiao et al. 2010). We note that to obtain large 𝛼௫௬ since  
డఙೣ೤
డఌ= 𝜖௜௝௟∑

, it is important to simultaneously 
enhance both the Berry curvature and the density of state (DOS) of the band 
generating the Berry curvature. In fact, such a situation is realized in 
Co2MnGa and Fe3X (X = Ga, Al) as we shall describe in section 5.3. 
5.2.2. Magnetic Weyl semimetals, Weyl magnets 
Weyl semimetals possess Weyl points near 𝜀ி, which are the touching 
points of two bands with a linear dispersion and described by the following 
Weyl Hamiltonian, 
ℋ(𝒌) = 𝛾(𝒌−𝛾 𝒌𝟎) ⋅𝝈= 𝛾෍൫𝑘௜−𝛾𝑘଴,௜൯𝜎௜
௭
௜ୀ௫
, 
[5.10] 
where 𝛾= ±1, 𝒌, ±𝒌𝟎, and 𝜎௜, respectively, denote a monopole charge (or 
helicity, chirality), the wave vector, the position of the Weyl points and 𝑖-th 
Pauli matrix. We can easily obtain its eigen energies, 
𝜀± = ±|𝒌−𝛾 𝒌𝟎| ≡±|𝛿𝒌|, 
[5.11] 
which express cone-shaped dispersion touching at the doubly degenerate 
Weyl points 𝒌= ±𝒌𝟎 (Figure 5.2a). The Weyl points are sources (𝛾= 1) or 
sinks (𝛾= −1) of Berry curvature and are always created/annihilated in 
pairs of opposite chiralities (Nielsen–Ninomiya theorem) (Nielsen and 
Ninomiya 1981). If the system has both time-reversal symmetry (TRS) and 
space inversion symmetry (IS), the Nielsen–Ninomiya theorem assures the 
two Weyl points with opposite chiralities at the same 𝒌𝟎 position, resulting 
in a four-fold degenerate Dirac point. Thus, either TRS or IS is broken in 
Weyl semimetals. Especially, Weyl magnets (or magnetic Weyl semimetals) 
break TRS by a magnetic order (Wan et al. 2011; Armitage et al. 2018).

5.2.3. Type-II Weyl semimetals 
The Weyl equation, first appeared in quantum field theory, is originally 
invariant under the Lorentz transformation. In condensed matter physics, 
however, the Weyl equation represents a model Hamiltonian of the 
electronic band structure, and the Lorentz invariance can be violated. Let us 
consider the following Hamiltonian as an example: 
ℋ(𝒌) = 𝛾ℏ𝑣ଶ(𝑘௭∓𝑘଴)𝜎଴+ ℏ𝑣ୄ൫𝑘௫𝜎௫+ 𝑘௬𝜎௬൯
+ 𝛾ℏ𝑣ଵ(𝑘௭∓𝑘଴)𝜎௭. 
[5.12] 
The second and third terms represent Weyl point at ±𝒌଴= (0,0, ±𝑘଴), 
and the first term gives the tilt of Weyl cone. The eigen energy of equation 
[5.12] is: 
𝜀± = ℏ𝑣ଶ𝛿𝑘௭± ට(ℏ𝑣ୄ)ଶ𝑘ୄ
ଶ+ (ℏ𝑣ଵ)ଶ𝛿𝑘௭ଶ, 
[5.13] 
where 𝑘ୄ
ଶ≡𝑘௫ଶ+ 𝑘௬ଶ, 𝛿𝑘௭≡𝑘௭−𝛾𝑘଴. This energy dispersion is illustrated 
in Figure 5.2b. For |𝑣ଶ/𝑣ଵ| ൏1 and setting 𝜀ி= 0, only the Weyl points are 
located at 𝜀ி (type-I Weyl). On the contrary, the tilted Weyl cones cut the 
Fermi energy 𝜀ி= 0 for |𝑣ଶ/𝑣ଵ| ൐1, resulting in electron and hole pockets 
touching at the Weyl points (type-II Weyl) (Soluyanov et al. 2015). Thus, a 
topological phase transition of Fermi surface occurs at |𝑣ଶ/𝑣ଵ| = 1. Here, 
the topology of the Fermi surfaces chagnes across |𝑣ଶ/𝑣ଵ| = 1. This 
transition can be viewed as a quantum Lifshitz transition.

dependence of the Weyl cone

5.2.4. Nodal line magnets 
Weyl points are point nodes in the band structure (zero-dimensional band 
crossing). Such band crossing problems can be generalized and categorized 
by considering the dimensions and symmetry (Chiu et al. 2016). For 
example, the following Hamiltonian can host a one-dimensional band 
crossing called the nodal line, 
ℋ(𝒌) = 𝑘௭𝜎௬+ ൫𝑎−𝑓൫𝑘௫, 𝑘௬൯−𝑘௭ଶ൯𝜎௭, 
[5.14] 
and its eigen energy is 
𝜀±(𝒌) = ±ට𝑘௭ଶ+ ൫𝑎−𝑓൫𝑘௫, 𝑘௬൯−𝑘௭ଶ൯
ଶ, 
[5.15] 
where the band touching occurs at 𝑘௭= 0, 𝑓൫𝑘௫, 𝑘௬൯= 𝑎. Figure 5.3a and b 
shows the ring-shaped 𝑓൫𝑘௫, 𝑘௬൯= 𝑘௫ଶ+ 𝑘௬ଶ (𝑎൐0) and line-shaped 
𝑓൫𝑘௫, 𝑘௬൯= 𝑘௫ nodal lines at 𝑘௭= 0 plane, respectively. The nodal line in 
equation [5.14] can be easily gapped out by introducing a term proportional 
to 𝜎௫. Thus, the band touching can be topologically stable only if 𝜎௫ is 
prohibited by the symmetry such as xy mirror plane. Consequently, many 
nodal lines appear at high symmetry points. Besides, the nodal ring gaps out 
at 𝑎൏0 by itself, in contrast sharply with the Weyl points, where 
creation/annihilation always occurs in pairs. We note that nodal lines are 
well defined in the absence of the spin–orbit coupling (SOC) and a finite but 
small gap ∼Δ𝜀ୗ୓େ opens along them after introducing the SOC. Thus, such 
small gap structure enhances the Berry curvature (equation [5.9]) and 
contributes to the large ANE.

5.3. Experimental realization of the giant anomalous Nernst 
effect 
5.3.1. Weyl antiferromagnets Mn3X (X = Sn, Ge) 
The hexagonal chiral antiferromagnets Mn3X (X = Sn, Ge) are the first 
examples of Weyl magnets (Kuroda et al. 2017). Surprisingly, these 
materials show sizable spontaneous anomalous Hall effects, ANE and 
magneto-optical Kerr effects in the antichiral 120 degree non-collinear 
antiferromagnetic phase below TN ~ 430 K for Mn3Sn and below TN ~ 370 K 
for Mn3Ge (Chen et al. 2020), despite the vanishingly small net 
magnetization (Nakatsuji et al. 2015; Kiyohara et al. 2016; Ikhlas and 
Tomita 2017; Higo et al. 2018; Chen et al. 2021). Such unique properties, 
including the first observation of magnetic spin Hall effect (Kimata et al. 
2019), and the first electronic manipulation of a Weyl semimetallic state 
(Tsai et al. 2020) have stimulated the study of antiferromagnetic spintronics 
(Jungwirth et al. 2016; Šmejkal et al. 2018). 
Figure 5.4f shows the magnetization M dependence of the AN coefficient 
Sji. Sji for Mn3X (X = Sn, Ge) is highly enhanced and two to three orders of 
magnitude higher than the values expected for the conventional scaling 
relations of ferromagnets Sji∝M. However, the magnitude of Sji is only the 
order of ~0.1 μV/K at room temperature. Nonetheless, the vanishingly small 
shape anisotropy due to its antiferromagnetism stabilizes the magnetic 
domain with a large coercivity, and this enables the fabrication of a heat flux 
sensor robust against the magnetic field perturbations (Higo et al. 2021). 
Further enhancing Sji in antiferromagnets would be very beneficial for the 
TE applications by ANE. 
5.3.2. Weyl ferromagnet Co2MnGa 
The first giant ANE at room temperature was found in the Heusler 
ferromagnet Co2MnGa (Figure 5.4a,c,e) (Sakai et al. 2018), whose Curie 
temperature is TC ~ 694 K (Webster 1971). The Heusler alloys have been 
extensively studied in the field of spintronics as candidates for the half metal 
(Varaprasad et al. 2009), and recently, they received more attention owing to 
the possible topological characters in their electronic structures (Kübler and 
Felser 2016; Wang et al. 2016). As shown in Figure 5.4e, the AN coefficient 
Sji reaches ~6 μV/K at room temperature and further increases to ~8 μV/K at 
400 K. This value is more than one order of magnitude larger than that for 

Thermoelectric Generation Using the Anomalous Nernst Effect     125 
conventional ferromagnets (Figure 5.4f) (Hasegawa et al. 2015). We found 
that this large ANE originates from the Weyl points near 𝜀ி (Figure 5.4c) by 
comparing the experimental data to the first-principle calculations. 
Interestingly, the tilt parameter for these Weyl points is close to the one for 
the quantum Lifshitz transition |𝑣ଶ/𝑣ଵ| ∼1, which enhances both the DOS 
and the Berry curvature and results in the giant ANE in this material. 
The observation of the giant ANE in Co2MnGa has caused a major 
impact, leading to various findings such as observation of the Weyl points 
(Belopolski et al. 2019), giant ANE in a thin-film form (Sumida et al. 2020), 
anomalous transverse Wiedemann–Franz law (Xu et al. 2020) and giant spin 
Hall angle (Leiva et al. 2021). Besides, this research also motivates the 
materials search and leads to the discovery of various ANE materials, 
including the Fe3X system mentioned below. 
5.3.3. Nodal-web ferromagnets Fe3X (X = Ga, Al) 
The discovery of the giant ANE in the Weyl ferromagnet Co2MnGa have 
enabled the research and development of new TE conversion based on ANE 
at room temperature. On the contrary, it is also necessary to improve other 
factors associated with TE applications such as materials cost and 
processability. Thus, we searched for new AN materials in iron-based 
compounds by first performing the high-throughput computational search 
and then doing real experiments as iron is one of the most inexpensive 
elements. As a result, we found that the cubic ferromagnets Fe3Ga and Fe3Al 
(Figure 5.4a) exhibit a giant ANE at room temperature. Sji for Fe3Ga and 
Fe3Al, respectively, reaches 6 μV/K and 4 μV/K around room temperature as 
shown in Figure 5.4e. Based on the first principles calculations, we found 
that the large Sji for Fe3X (X = Ga, Al) originates from a nodal-web structure, 
namely, a flat band structure made of interconnected nodal lines  
(Figure 5.4d), which also enhance the DOS and the Berry curvature at the 
same time. 
In addition to the giant ANE, the low material cost and high 
processability for the Fe3X (X = Ga, Al) system are also beneficial for 
developing ANE devices especially by using their thin-film form. Indeed, 
heat flux sensors based on ANE of Fe-Al alloy thin films have been 
fabricated on thin flexible polyimide sheets (Zhou and Sakuraba 2020). 
While the sensitivity is still two to three orders of magnitude smaller than 
that for commercial heat flux sensors based on the Seebeck effect, there are a 

126     Thermoelectric Micro/Nano Generators 2 
lot of room for improvement in the film quality and device structure. Further 
study is necessary for developing ANE-based TE devices.

5.4. Summary and prospects 
TE generation based on the ANE has various potential benefits and 
attracts a lot of attention these days owing to the giant ANE found in 
topological magnets. A number of AN materials have already been found 
including UCo0.8Ru0.2Al showing “colossal” ANE Sji ~ 23 μV/K at 40 K 
(Guin et al. 2019; Asaba et al. 2021; He et al. 2021; Nakamura et al. 2021; 
Chen et al. 2022). Such new findings promote the research for developing 
AN devices such as heat flux sensors as well as the discovery of novel 
topological phases in magnets. We anticipate that these studies will lead to 
innovative TE devices that can be widely used in the future.

A Comprehensive Review  
of Phonon Engineering 
Bin XU, Harsh CHANDRA, and Junichiro SHIOMI 
University of Tokyo, Japan 
6.1. Introduction 
In recent years, climate and environmental problems have boosted the 
rapid development of technological innovation for achieving carbon 
neutrality goals. A great deal of effort has been placed on using clean energy 
and improving energy efficiency. In addition to the progress made on 
enhancing the energy utilization rate, effectively reusing the large portion of 
energy that has dissipated in the form of waste heat is essential. 
Thermoelectrics have a wide range of applications among thermal energy 
harvesting techniques due to their simple structure and maintenance-free 
properties. The performance of energy harvesting of thermoelectric materials 
is indicated by the figure of merit expressed as 𝑍𝑇: 
𝑍𝑇=
ௌమఙ
఑𝑇 
 [6.1] 
where 𝑇 is the temperature, 𝑆 is the Seebeck coefficient, 𝜎 is the electrical 
conductance and 𝜅 is the thermal conductivity. According to this equation 
[6.1], selectively reducing 𝜅 while maintaining high electrical conductivity is 
the key to achieving high 𝑍𝑇. Here, the reduction of 𝜅 is usually achieved by 
modulating the carriers of lattice thermal energy, i.e. phonons, through 

132     Thermoelectric Micro/Nano Generators 2 
“phonon engineering”. Notably, although electrons contribute to thermal 
conduction in metallic and highly doped semiconductor materials, we focus 
on reducing the thermal conduction by phonons, as thermoelectric materials 
require 𝜎 to be maintained. 
Here is a recent representative example of improving the performance of 
thermoelectrical materials through phonon engineering. Silicon is the most 
commonly used semiconductor, with a low price and matured fabricating 
technique. Despite the high Seebeck coefficient and the highly controllable 
electrical properties, single-crystal silicon is not considered to be an effective 
thermoelectric material because of the high 𝑘 (145 W/m-K at room 
temperature) and the resulting low 𝑍𝑇 value of approximately 0.01. This 
problem is overcome by introducing a nanostructure, including a nanowires 
structure, high porosity and small grain size, which decrease the 𝑘 of silicon 
to a few W/m-K, promoting the 𝑍𝑇 to 0.3 at room temperature (Kashiwagi  
et al. 2019; Yang et al. 2021). 
Phonon engineering not only gives us opportunities to broaden the range 
of thermoelectric material candidates to those more abundant, less expensive 
and with more mature manufacturing infrastructures, but can also further 
improve 
the 
energy 
conversion 
efficiency 
of 
those 
commercial 
thermoelectric materials. Poudel et al. (2008) elevated the room temperature 
𝑍𝑇 of BiSbTe to 1.2 by nanocrystalline through a ball-milling/hot press 
method. Yan et al. (2012) improved the 𝑍𝑇 of half-Heuslers 
Hf1−xZrxCoSb0.8Sn0.2 when Zr is replaced by Ti, introducing a significant 
atomic mass difference between Hf and Ti, resulting in low thermal 
conductivity. However, the computational method can also help us to predict 
and explore low thermal conductive lattice structures with excellent 
thermoelectric performance such as PbTe1−xSex (Tian et al. 2012) and SnSe 
(Zhao et al. 2014). 
Regarding the importance of phonon engineering for developing 
thermoelectric materials and the enormous progress that has been made 
recently, it is essential to have a comprehensive understanding of phonon 
engineering. This chapter starts by introducing the basic concept of thermal 
conduction and phonons (section 6.1). Then, we introduce the theoretical 
calculations and experimental methods for predicting/evaluating thermal 
conductivity and phonon properties (section 6.2). The next section introduces 
the mechanism and approaches for phonon engineering and related research 
advances from both mechanistic and methodological viewpoints (section 6.3). 
Finally, the chapter concludes with a summary and future prospects. 

A Comprehensive Review of Phonon Engineering     133 
6.1.1. Thermal conductivity 
Electrons or atomic vibrations mainly carry heat in solids. The lattice 
vibrational waves contribute to thermal conductivity predominantly in a 
dielectric crystalline material and majorly in many semiconductors. In 
principle, thermal conductivity represents how easily a material can conduct 
heat across a given temperature gradient per unit cross-sectional area of a 
material. The thermal conductivity is defined through Fourier’s law of heat 
conduction: 
𝑞= −𝜅 𝛻𝑇 
 [6.2] 
where q is the local heat flux (W/m2), 𝜅 is the lattice thermal conductivity 
(W/m-K) and ∇𝑇 is the temperature gradient (K/m). 𝜅 has an extensive 
range, as illustrated in Figure 6.1, and the materials are used extensively for 
applications such as thermal insulation and thermal management in 
electronics, buildings, automobiles and aerospace.

different materials spanning five orders of magnitude 
6.1.2. Phonons in thermal transport 
6.1.2.1. Harmonic properties of phonons 
For a crystal semiconductor composed of dielectric material, interatomic 
potential 𝑉(𝑥) can be Taylor-series expanded in infinitesimal displacements

Since interatomic force is the derivative of potential with respect to the 
displacement, the lattice dynamics are characterized with the third harmonic 
term and higher order terms. The harmonic approximation shown in  
Figure 6.2 that ignores the higher order terms is often used to identify the 
phonon states, i.e. the eigenvalue and eigenmode of the phonons, although 
higher order terms need to be considered to account for phonon–phonon 
scattering, and even phonon states are known to be influenced by higher 
order terms for crystal with large anharmonicity.

A phonon is described by the vibrational frequency 𝜔 and the wave 
vector 𝐪. 𝐪 is related to wavelength 𝜆 as: 
𝐪=

 [6.4] 
where 𝒒𝟎 is the unit vector of 𝒒, along the propagation direction of the wave 
vector. The propagation velocity of a phonon is given by the group velocity.

 [6.5] 
This is obtained from the dispersion relations, the relationship between 𝜔 
and 𝐪, which can be calculated by the dynamical matrix combing equation

[6.3] and the equation of motion. The group velocity tends to the sound 
speed when 𝒒 → 0 in the limiting case that wavelengths are large. 
To introduce the lattice dynamics, we begin with the one-dimensional 
(1D) atom chain (see Figure 6.3). From Newton’s Second Law of motion 
and Hooke’s Law, the equation of motion of the nth atom in the monoatomic 
chain is given by 
𝑀
ௗమ௫೙
ௗ௧మ= 𝑘[(𝑥௡ାଵ−𝑥௡) + (𝑥௡ିଵ−𝑥௡)] 
[6.6] 
where 𝑥௡ is the displacement of the nth atom from the mean equilibrium 
position, and k is the interatomic nearest neighbor force constant. Here, 𝑀 is 
the mass of an atom and 𝑘 is the nearest-neighbor force constant. We can try 
a solution 𝑥௡ = 𝑥௔௠௣೙exp [i(𝑞𝑛𝑎−𝜔𝑡)] for x = 𝑛𝑎, where 𝑥௔௠௣೙ means 
the amplitude of vibration of the nth atom.

For a more complex case with a basis of two atoms with masses 𝑚 and 𝑀 
for a diatomic linear chain, the lattice dynamical is shown in Figure 6.5. 
 
Figure 6.5. Diatomic linear chain with masses m and M with unit

The equation of motion can be written using Newton’s Second Law and 
Hooke’s Law as: 
𝑚

ௗ௧మ= 𝑘[(𝑥ᇱଶ௡ାଵ−𝑥ଶ௡) + (𝑥ᇱଶ୬ିଵ−𝑥ଶ௡)]

ௗ௧మ= 𝑘[(−𝑥ᇱଶ௡ାଵ+ 𝑥ଶ௡) + (−𝑥ᇱଶ୬ିଵ+ 𝑥ଶ௡)] 
 [6.10]  
where 𝑥ᇱ is the displacement of atoms with mass 𝑀 from their equilibrium 
position, and 𝑥 is the displacement of atoms with mass 𝑚 from their 
equilibrium position. 
Moving ahead, we will determine the solution of 𝑥ଶ௡ and 𝑥ଶ௡ାଵ. Solving 
equations [6.10] and [6.11] yields the following dynamical equation: 
𝜔ଶ𝑥௔௠௣೔=   ∑

From the obtained ω2 function, we can see two different kinds of 
frequencies involved at each wave vector point, which gives the phonon 
dispersion curve of a diatomic chain (Figure 6.6). 
 
Figure 6.6. Phonon dispersion shows two branches  
due to two masses m and M in the chain 
In Figure 6.6, the branch with a higher frequency is called the optical 
phonon branch, resulting from atoms in a unit cell moving out of phase 
directions or in opposite directions. The other branch with lower frequency 
is the “acoustic branch”, which results from atoms moving in-phase with 
each other, as in the case of the monoatomic linear chain (Kittel et al. 1996).

6.1.2.2. Anharmonic properties of phonons 
Consider a crystal with b atoms per unit cell, and let u(𝑎p) represent the 
displacement of the pth atom in the 𝑎th unit cell. Assume that the total 
potential energy 𝒱 of the crystal is a function of the instantaneous position of 
all atoms. We can now expand 𝒱 in a Taylor series in powers of the atomic 
displacements (Ashcroft and Mermin 1976):

where 𝑢ఈ(𝑎𝑝) refers to atom (𝑎𝑝) along the 𝛼 direction, 𝑢ఉ(𝑎ᇱ𝑝ᇱ) refers to 
atom (𝑎ᇱ𝑝ᇱ) along the 𝛽 𝑑𝑖𝑟𝑒𝑐𝑡𝑖𝑜𝑛, and 𝑢ఊ(𝑎ᇱᇱ𝑝ᇱᇱ) refers to atom (𝑎𝑝) 
along the 𝛾 direction. 
At equilibrium, the second term in the above expansion vanishes because 
the first derivative of potential energy at the mean position is 0. Moreover, 
the first term can be set to 0 as it implies zero potential. Therefore, we are 
left with terms starting from the second and beyond as rewritten below:

discussed independently in the anharmonic theoretical treatment of phonons. 
The third term produces the first-order perturbation, which refers to the three 
phonon scattering, while the following high-order perturbation is contributed 
by more complicated interactions engaged by more phonons. The 
perturbation terms result in a deviation from the harmonic behavior of 
atomic displacements and are therefore referred to as anharmonicity (shown 
in Figure 6.7). The anharmonicity is the cause of the finite thermal 
conductivity of single crystals.

For the case of a three-phonon interaction arising due to the first-order

𝐪𝟐 have to satisfy momentum conservation given by 
𝐪+ 𝐪𝟏+ 𝐪𝟐= 𝐆 
 [6.18] 
where 𝐆 is a reciprocal lattice vector, and 𝐪, 𝐪𝟏 and 𝐪𝟐 are constrained to the 
first Brillouin zone. Three-phonon interactions for which |𝐆| = 0 and 
|𝐆| ്0 are referred to as Normal (N) and Umklapp (U) processes, 
respectively. There are two kinds of permissible processes (Figure 6.8):  

140     Thermoelectric Micro/Nano Generators 2 
(i) the annihilation of two phonons and the creation of a third phonon (a type I 
event) and (ii) the annihilation of one phonon and the creation of two 
phonons (a type 2 event). The three-phonon processes have to satisfy energy 
and momentum conservation laws along their polarization dispersion 
branches (optical or acoustic), according to their types mentioned below: 
Type I events: 
𝐪+ 𝐪𝟏= 𝐪𝟐+ 𝐆 
[6.19]  
𝜔(𝐪) + 𝜔′(𝐪𝟏) = 𝜔′′(𝐪𝟐) 
[6.20] 
Type II events: 
𝐪+ 𝐆= 𝐪𝟏+ 𝐪𝟐 
[6.21] 
𝜔(𝐪) = 𝜔′(𝐪𝟏) + 𝜔′′(𝐪𝟐) 
[6.22] 
In a U-process, the quasi-momentum of newly generated phonon 𝐪𝟐 
differs from incoming phonons 𝐪 and 𝐪𝟏 by a non-zero reciprocal lattice 
vector 𝐆 because 𝐆 flips the resultant net vector, and hence, energy direction 
back to the first Brillouin zone. For this reason, N- and U-processes are 
momentum 
conserving 
and 
momentum 
non-conserving 
processes, 
respectively. 
There are various approaches that can be employed to formulate the 
microscopic expression of the thermal transport. One is the Phonon 
Boltzmann transport equation (BTE), which solves for a distribution 
function of phonons at a particular location at a particular time in the crystal. 
Another is the Green’s function-based approach, which deals with quantum 
statistics of disturbances. 
We use the relaxation time approximation, where a phonon experiences a 
collision with a probability per unit time

undergoing a collision in an infinitesimal time 𝑑𝑡 is the time interval per unit 
time

6.2. Methodology of phonon engineering 
6.2.1. Computational method for thermal conduction and phonon 
properties 
The thermal energy carried by phonons can be described by the BTE 
based on the phonon gas model (PGM). The specific heat 𝐶(𝜔) and group 
velocity 𝑣(𝜔) can be calculated by solving the harmonic lattice dynamic. 
The challenge lies in obtaining the relaxation time of phonon scattering 
governed by the anharmonic phonon interaction. Researchers compromised 
on this issue in earlier studies by fitting the experimental result to a 
simplified dispersion relation, such as the Debye model (Klemens 1955). 
This approach can explain some experimental results, but the lack of 
anharmonic details makes the active prediction of the thermal conductivity 
of new materials almost impossible. 
This situation started to change in the late 1990s, when the density 
functional theory (DFT) method was well developed for calculating the 
anharmonicity of phonon scattering and enabled the thermal conductivity of 
new crystal structures to be predicted accurately. Broido et al. (2007) 
performed the density functional perturbation theory (DFPT) calculation to 
obtain the thermal conductivity of Si, which is ideally consistent with the 

A Comprehensive Review of Phonon Engineering     143 
experimental result (Broido et al. 2007). A typical procedure for obtaining 
the thermal conductivity is as follows. First, harmonic and anharmonic 
interatomic force constants are obtained. This can be done either directly by 
DFPT or using other numerical methods, such as the displacement method 
(Esfarjani et al. 2011) and finite difference method (Tian et al. 2012). 
Second, they are used to perform the harmonic and anharmonic lattice 
dynamics explained above to calculate the phonon dispersion relation and 
relaxation time properties. The thermal conductivity 𝜅 can then be given by 
substituting the harmonic properties 𝐶(𝜔), 𝑣(𝜔) and anharmonic properties 
𝜏(𝜔) into the BTE [6.24]. 
Not only for calculating the thermal conductivity of bulk crystal, since 
the thermal conductivity is given as a function of phonon frequency, or the 
relaxation time 𝜏, the accumulated thermal conductivity to frequency 𝜔 or 
MPF (𝛬) can be obtained and provide insight into both the predominated 
phonon for heat conduction and the “size effect” issue in the  
Casimir–Knudsen regime. 
Despite the incredible power of the DFT calculation in precisely 
calculating the intrinsic thermal conductivity and details of phonon 
properties, owing to the complexity in solving the wave equation with  
high-order force constants, the computational cost is relatively high, 
especially for large-scale materials with ultra-fine structures such as those 
with multiple interfaces, embedded with nanoparticles or impurities. 
Although the accumulated thermal conductivity can be used to predict the 
size effect of thermal conductivity, since the classical model describing the 
interfacial phonon transport like acoustic mismatch model (AMM) (Peterson 
and Anderson 1972) and diffuse mismatch model (DMM) (Swartz and Pohl 
1989) do not take the interface details, like the roughness, defects/impurities 
and the adhesion strength, into account, the actual interfacial thermal 
conductance would deviate from the prediction by the classical model, and 
hence results in a significant deviation in the overall thermal conductivity. 
Molecular dynamics (MD) simulation is a useful alternative tool to deal 
with such issues. The classical MD simulation is based on the classical 
Newton’s laws of motion. The principle of MD calculation is much simpler 
than the first-principles lattice dynamics calculations. By inputting each 
atom’s initial parameters, including the position, potential and velocity, we 
can predict the motion of individual atoms after a short time interval. By  
conducting such calculations to all the atoms in the system in cycles, the 
molecular dynamics of the system can be obtained. Both equilibrium 

144     Thermoelectric Micro/Nano Generators 2 
molecular dynamics (EMD) (McGaughey and Larkin 2014) and  
non-equilibrium molecular dynamics (NEMD) (Shiomi (2014)) simulations 
can then be performed based on the system to obtain the thermal 
conductivity. Other important parameters in phonon transport, such as the 
vibrational density of state (vDOS) and the accumulated thermal 
conductivity in the frequency regime, can also be calculated by Fourier 
transformation. MD calculation enables the analysis of phonon transport in a 
complex system and gives a more accurate prediction dealing with the “size 
effect” issue. Since MD simulation strongly relies on interatomic potential 
functions, the key to precise thermal conductivity calculation is to describe 
the interatomic potential accurately. The progress in the MD simulation 
methods, such as the ones with machine-learning potential (Zhang et al. 
2018), enables a more precise prediction of the thermal conductivity and 
broadens the range of materials available for MD simulation, regardless of 
the lack of empirical interatomic potential. 
Overall, the theoretical calculation technique not only enables us to 
predict the thermal conductivity of novel materials and nanostructures, but 
also provides massive information about phonon behaviors. The theoretical 
calculation brings a better understanding of phonon engineering and a clear 
guideline for innovating thermoelectric materials. 
6.2.2. 
Experimental

nano-/micro-scale 
heat 
conduction characterization 
In phonon engineering, measuring the targeted thermal transport properties 
at multiple scales is essential. There are many thermal measurement methods 
for materials at different scales, such as the 3ω method, laser flash, 
thermoreflectance method and steady-state method. Herein, we mainly focus 
on the measurement at a small scale, which is typically applied to phonon 
engineering in current state-of-the-art research works. 
6.2.2.1. Thermoreflectance method  
The ultrafast thermoreflectance pump-probe-based transient time-domain 
thermoreflectance (TDTR) technique has emerged and evolved extensively 
for characterizing the thermal conductivity, thermal boundary conductance 
in nanostructures (Cahill 2004). In TDTR experimental setup, as shown in 
Figure 6.10, tunable laser excitation sources such as Ti:sapphire laser 
oscillators with mode-locked function are typically used as the light source. 
Mode locking enables the tuning of laser wavelength by an extensive range 

A Comprehensive Review of Phonon Engineering     145 
from 700 nm to well above far infrared 1100 nm. The laser source generates 
a femtosecond width laser pulse-train with a repetition rate of 80 MHz. A 
broadband Faraday optical isolator is placed at the exit opening of the 
Ti:sapphire laser oscillator to only allow transmission of the optical signal 
along one direction and also simultaneously prevent the laser beam from 
reflecting into the oscillator. A half-wave plate is installed before the 
broadband Faraday optical isolator to tune the laser power. The incoming 
laser beam is then split into two beams: a pump beam and a probe beam 
through a diffractive beam splitter called a polarizing beam splitter (PBS). 
This results in the pump and the probe beams being cross-polarized to each 
other. Another half-wave plate before the polarizing beam splitter can be 
used to tune the power ratio between the pump and the probe beams. The 
pump beam is modulated at a frequency in the range of 0.1–20 MHz before  
being directed onto the sample through an objective lens using an EOM  
(electro-optic modulator). The EOM modulation frequency serves as the 
reference for lock-in detection because such a lock-in effect makes the 
system capable of picking up/extracting output from the signal in terms of 
frequency and amplitude, even though the signal is buried in noise. Next, the 
probe beam is delayed with respect to the pump beam via a mechanical delay 
stage, which plays the role of changing the optical path length of the probe 
beam. The time-delayed probe beam is then directed on the sample, with the 
probe beam reflecting off the surface of the sample and being detected by a 
photodiode detector. The detected signal is then processed by the lock-in 
amplifier. 
The lock-in amplifier detects the in-phase voltage signal 𝑉inphase =
𝑅𝑒[𝛥ℝ(𝑡)] and out-of-phase voltage signal 𝑉out-of-phase = 𝐼𝑚[𝛥ℝ(𝑡)], 
which is essentially the real and imaginary part of Δℝ(𝑡). Typically, either

is used in the following fitting process to obtain the 
targeted parameters. Next, we can subtract the targeted parameters by fitting 
the decay profile. Figure 6.11 depicts a schematic of the sample structure 
used in a typical TDTR experimental setup. The thermal modeling of TDTR 
experiments consists of two steps: the first is to solve three-dimensional 
anisotropic heat diffusion in a sample made of multilayers with different 
thermal properties in each stack, and the second is to model the data 
collected from the experimental measurements theoretically.

(through-plane) thermal conductivity, respectively, and 𝐶௣ೡ is the volumetric 
heat capacity defined as the product of specific heat and density. 
6.2.2.2. 3ω method 
The 3ω approach (Cahill 1990), as shown in Figure 6.12, employs a 
radial heat flow from a single element that serves as both a heater and a 
thermometer. It is usually used to measure the thermal conductivity of thin 
film at microscale. In brief, the three frequencies involved in the 3ω 
approach are the frequency 𝜔 (fundamental frequency) corresponding to 
metal line current, the frequency 2𝜔 corresponding to the temperature 
variation and the frequency 3𝜔 corresponding to the voltage variation.  
The third harmonic of the voltage across the line is used to measure the 
temperature oscillations of the metal line, thus the term 3ω technique. The 
average temperature fluctuations across the width of the heating line source 
are given by the following expression when a current is applied to the heater 
at a frequency 𝜔, i.e. 𝐼(𝑡) = 𝐼଴cos 𝜔𝑡:

The targeted thermal information of the sample is contained in the second 
and third components in equation [6.32]. To obtain the last term, which is 
typical with a small value, a lock-in processing (Moon et al. 1996) is  
applied using the Wheatstone bridge (see Figure 6.13) to detect the 
amplitude and phase of the 3ω signal. From the 3ω signal, we can obtain the 
temperature response and then subtract the targeted thermal conductivity by 
solving the heat conduction model.

6.2.3. Direct measurement of phonon properties through phonon 
scattering 
Methods involving phonon scattering with photons, X-rays, electrons and 
neutrons have been established to probe the phonon properties directly. In 
this section, we introduce the most commonly used Raman scattering 
spectroscopy (phonon–photon scattering), neutron scattering and the X-ray 
scattering method. 
6.2.3.1. Raman scattering method 
When powerful laser beams irradiate the sample in the UV-visible range 
(𝑣଴) (Ferraro et al. 1994), besides the strong Rayleigh scattering showing  

150     Thermoelectric Micro/Nano Generators 2 
the same frequency as the incident beam, there is weak Raman scattering 
(∼10ିହ of the incident beam) whose frequencies are different from the 
incident beam. The Raman scattered light manifests in vibrational 
frequencies that can be blue-shifted 𝑣଴+ 𝑣௠ (Stokes scattering) or red-
shifted 𝑣଴−𝑣௠ (Anti-stokes scattering) with respect to the original incident 
beam frequency. The observed Raman shift of the Stokes and anti-Stokes 
features is a direct measure of the molecule’s vibrational energies, since the 
energy increase or reduction is proportional to the vibrational energy levels 
in the ground electronic state of the molecule. However, the Raman 
spectroscopy can only probe long-wavelength/high-frequency phonons 
confined to gamma point Γ, i.e. to 𝒒≅0 phonons. 
Raman scattering is a process in which electromagnetic radiation 
exchanges vibrating quanta phonons with a crystal through electrons. A 
thorough understanding of (i) electronic structure, (ii) phonon dispersions 
and (iii) mutual interactions between electrons and phonons (i.e.  
electron–electron, electron–phonon and phonon–phonon scattering) are 
required for a full description. Raman spectroscopy has been an immensely 
robust and versatile tool to characterize the phonon properties in dielectric 
materials such as graphite and its derivatives from bulk to monolayer 
graphene (Basko et al. 2009). The G and D peaks at 1580 cm-1 and 1350 cm-1 
originate from the expansion and contraction modes of six-atom rings and 
corresponding modes activated by defects, respectively. From the frequency 
of G peaks, we can obtain the energy of TO phonons at the Brillouin zone’s 
K point. 
6.2.3.2. Neutron and X-ray scattering method 
The primary benefit of neutrons as a probe is to measure fine details of 
atomic and molecular vibrations via inelastic neutron scattering (INS) (Kohn 
1959), which involves the neutron exchanging energy with the atoms in a 
material. As an example, Kulda et al. (1994) investigated the frequencies and 
eigenvectors of silicon crystal along the tree main symmetry directions using 
INS, which shows good agreement with the theoretical calculation. In the 
mechanism, neutrons can absorb or emit an amount of energy equivalent to a 
quantum of phonon energy h𝑣, when dispersed by a crystalline material. 
This results in inelastic scattering, in which the energy of the neutrons before 
and after scattering differs by a certain amount, ħ𝜔 (i.e. energy transfer). 
Typically, this change is a few terahertz (THz) of frequency in most 
materials, equivalent to phonon energies of a few meV. As illustrated in 
Figure 6.14, the neutron has distinctive velocities, and consequently, 

A Comprehensive Review of Phonon Engineering     151 
different wave vectors before and after it interact with the sample. We need 
to know the neutron wave vector before (𝐤𝐢) and after (𝐤𝐟) the scattering 
event to figure out the phonon energy and scattering vector 𝐐. The neutron 
can be probed by triple-axis spectrometers (TAS), which can provide both 
the momentum 𝐐= 𝐤𝐢−𝐤𝐟 and the energy transfer ħ𝜔= 𝐸௜−𝐸௙. As 
illustrated in Figure 6.15, the monochromator crystal selects an input neutron 
beam of a well-defined wave vector k୍ from the neutron source’s white 
spectrum during a TAS experiment (first axis). After that, the 
monochromatic beam scatters from the crystalline sample (second axis). The 
analyzer crystal (third axis) reflects the intensity of the dispersed beam with 
wave vector k୤ onto the neutron detector (3He-tube), estimating the energy 
transfer ħ𝜔. 
 
Figure 6.14. Scattering triangles for inelastic neutron scattering (INS) 
Inelastic X-ray scattering (IXS) is an alternative method for probing the 
phonon properties based on the inelastic interaction between photon (X-ray) 
and phonon. Unlike Raman scattering, which is limited to near Γ modes, IXS 
can probe the phonon dispersion in an extended wave vector regime due to 
the much smaller wavelength of X-rays, and can provide information about 
the relaxation time spectrum. Compared with INS, IXS is fit for probing the 
relaxation time of high-frequency phonons and is beneficial for measuring 
thin film samples with a thickness of several micrometers using a small 
incident angle, which enables a relatively small penetration depth. Uchiyama 
et al. (2018) used the IXS to measure the dispersion and lifetime spectrum of 
an ScN film.

6.2.4. Phonon engineering for low thermal conductivity 
Because of the broad distribution of phonon MFPs and frequencies, 
effectively suppressing the overall heat conduction carried by various 
phonons is very challenging. Different methods based on multiple 
mechanisms should be applied simultaneously to achieve this goal (Volz  
et al. 2016; Nomura et al. 2018; Hori and Shiomi 2019). Qian et al. (2021, 
Figure 1) illustrated an overall picture of the underlying mechanism of 
phonon engineering for thermal conductivity control. For the low thermal 
conductivity required by thermoelectric materials, we can divide the 
approaches into three according to the relationship of phonon mean free path 
(MFP, Λ) and the characteristic length of the structure (𝑑). For single-crystal 
or poly-crystal bulk material with large grain size (𝑑൐Λ), phonons 
transport diffusively and can be described by Fourier’s law, hence named the 
Fourier diffusion regime. In the Fourier diffusion regime, lower thermal 
conductivity can be achieved by tailoring the phonon dispersion relation and 
phonon scattering rate by increasing the materials’ anharmonicity or crystal 
complexity. If the characteristic length of nanostructures is smaller than 
MFP (𝑑൏𝛬), phonons transport ballistically or quasi-ballistically and 
nanostructures such as interfaces, boundaries and precipitates significantly 
influence the thermal conductivity. This ballistic regime can be further 

A Comprehensive Review of Phonon Engineering     153 
divided into the Casimir–Knudsen and Coherent regimes based on whether 
the phonon phase is preserved or not when scattered by nanostructures. 
In the Casimir–Knudsen regime, the low thermal conductivity is achieved 
by introducing extra phonon boundary scattering, leading to a shortening 
phonon relaxation time. There, the nanostructures do not alter the phonon 
states, i.e. dispersion relations and eigenmodes because the phase of the 
phonons is not preserved at the length scale of the nanostructures. This effect 
becomes predominant when the characteristic length becomes smaller, thus 
usually called the “size effect”. If phonon scattering by the nanostructure is 
phase-preserving, phonons transport coherently and exhibit wave-like nature. 
In this coherent regime, the interaction between phonon and nanostructures 
can affect the dispersion relation of phonons, which can reduce the thermal 
conductivity by suppressing the phonon group velocity. In the coherent 
regime, we expect to see characteristics that reflect wave nature, such as 
interference, diffraction and localization. One of the extremes is the 
Anderson localization where the group velocities of various phonons become 
zero, exhibiting the characteristics of a standing wave. The challenge of 
coherent phonon engineering comes in because the coherent length of the 
phonon is extremely short and easily becomes decoherent. For example, a 
rough interface will easily destroy the wave nature of the phonon. 
Experimentally, due to the abovementioned issue, coherent phonon 
engineering is still challenging, where the effect is typically observed under 
low temperatures. 
The following sections discuss some example of phonon engineering for 
improving thermoelectric materials. 
6.2.5. Intrinsic low thermal conductivity in complex lattice 
structure 
Reducing the intrinsic thermal conductivity of bulk materials, i.e. phonon 
engineering in the Fourier regime, can be achieved through reducing the 
group velocities and relaxation times by heavy element, weak bonding and 
complex unit cell structure. These approaches can be explained by Slack’s 
early theory (Slack 1973) that describes the thermal conductivity of a 
material at a temperature point higher than the Debye temperature: 
𝜅= 𝐴
ெఙఏయ
ఊ்ேమయ
⁄  
 [6.32] 

154     Thermoelectric Micro/Nano Generators 2 
where 𝐴 is the proportional constant, 𝑀 is the mean atomic mass, 𝜎ଷ is the 
average volume of individual atoms, 𝜃 is the Debye temperature, 𝛾 is  
the Grüneisen parameter (𝛾 is related to the phonon scattering), and 𝑁 is the 
number of atoms in a unit cell. According to this equation, intrinsic low 
thermal conductivity can be achieved by heavy elements (large 𝑀), or by 
weak interatomic potential, because 𝜃 is proportional to the group velocity 
𝑣= ට𝐵𝜎𝑀
⁄
 (𝐵 is the bulk modulus). Representative examples are the 
commonly used commercial thermoelectric materials such as Bi2Te3 and 
PbTe, whose constituent elements are located after the fifth period of the 
elemental table, i.e. large atomic masses. Moreover, as the thermal 
conductivity is proportional to 𝑁ିଶଷ
⁄ , a complex lattice structure with a 
large unit cell size such as CoSb3 (Kawaharada et al. 2001) and Zn4Sb3 
(Caillat et al. 1997) have low thermal conductivity. 
However, Slack’s theory still lacks details about the scattering term of 
phonons, which limits the control over the anharmonicity of phonons. This 
issue was solved with the development of the DFT calculations, which 
illustrate a clear picture of the harmonic phonon properties and provide 
fruitful information about the phonon scattering, especially for materials 
with a complex lattice structure, whose phonon properties are difficult to 
predict using the classic theory. With the help of DFT calculation, phonon 
anharmonicity such as the phonon rattling mode was found to lead to low 
thermal conductivity in cage-like structures, such as clathrate (Christensen  
et al. 2008) or skutterudite (Sales et al. 1996). The weak interaction between 
the intermediate heavy atoms and the host structure results in low-lying 
branches in phonon dispersion relations, which leads to scattering of acoustic 
branch phonons, and thus low thermal conductivity (Christensen et al. 2008, 
Figure 3(a)). Another example is the resonance mode in materials like PbTe, 
where the strong interaction between the acoustic and optical branches can 
lead to a negligible band gap between acoustic and optical phonons (Delaire 
et al. 2011). The strong tangling between the acoustic and optical phonons 
introduces significant anharmonicity, and thus low thermal conductivity. 
Hybrid organic–inorganic crystals can also realize ultra-low thermal 
conductivity because of the significant difference in phonon properties and 
weak coupling between the organic network and the inorganic core 
molecules. For example, the hybrid structure of core nanoparticles (Au, 
CdSe, PbS, etc.) connected by ligand networks can give thermal conductivity  
 

A Comprehensive Review of Phonon Engineering     155 
as low as 0.01–0.03 W/m-K, comparable to air (Ong et al. 2013). Although 
these kinds of hybrid materials typically show low electrical conductance, 
which is currently unlikely to be applied as a thermoelectrical material, the 
situation may change because of the recent development of organic 
thermoelectric materials (Wang and Yu 2019). 
6.2.6. Low thermal conductivity by nanostructures 
According to Matthiessen’s rule of phonon scattering, in addition to the 
Umklapp scattering that contributes to the intrinsic thermal conductivity of 
bulk materials, boundary scattering, mass-difference scattering and  
phonon–electron scattering also contribute to determining the thermal 
conduction. Note here, phonon–electron scattering is less important for 
typical thermoelectric materials because of low electrons density. Thermal 
conductivity suppression through boundary scattering and mass-difference 
scattering by nanostructures is the most commonly used method in the 
fabrication of thermoelectric materials. 
The relaxation time of mass difference scattering rates is a function of 
phonon frequency (𝜏~𝜔ସ), which indicates that high-frequency phonons are 
strongly scattered. Typically, this kind of mass difference can be introduced 
by the isotope mixture, alloying and impurities. 
The interest in how the isotope mixture influences thermal conductivity 
arises when exploring both high and low thermal conductivity. For example, 
the thermal conductivity of c-BN is enhanced by 90% compared with nature 
c-BN, by alleviating the degree of the isotope mixture. Other isotope-mixture 
materials like GeC and BeSe also show significant enhancement in thermal 
conductivity when they are changed to be isotopically enriched (Lindsay  
et al. 2013). In the opposite direction, for existing materials that are 
isotropically enriched, such as graphite and carbon nanotubes (12C enriched), 
introducing 13C or 14C can effectively decrease the thermal conductivity 
while maintaining the electrical conductance, which potentially enables the 
application as a thermoelectric material (Anno et al. 2014). Carbon 
nanotubes, whose Seebeck coefficient (S~170 μV/K) is comparable to 
Bi2Te3 (Nakai et al. 2014), can be potentially turned into a promising 
candidate for thermoelectrics when the original high thermal conductivity is 
reduced through the isotope mixture. In MD simulation studies, carbon 
nanotubes composed of a random mixture 13C/12C and periodic 13C/12C 
structure can effectively reduce the thermal conductivity by 30% and 56%, 

156     Thermoelectric Micro/Nano Generators 2 
respectively, (Shiomi and Maruyama 2006). Graphene also shows enhanced 
thermoelectric performance by the isotope mixture, which causes the thermal 
conductivity to decrease to 10%, thus there is a 10 times enhancement in 𝑍𝑇 
(Anno et al. 2015). 
Alloying is one of the most commonly used methods to reduce the 
thermal conductivity of thermoelectric materials. Similar to the isotope 
mixture method, it not only scatters high-frequency phonon by the mass 
disorder, but can also modify the dispersion of phonons. Murakami et al. 
(2013) found that the inhomogeneity of force fields introduced in PbTe1−xSex 
alloys significantly suppressed the thermal conductivity. In relation to this, 
Arrigoni et al. (2018) realized a similar effect of the inhomogeneity of force 
field introduced by the alloy method in In1−xGaxAs alloys. A representative 
case of the alloying method is the alloy between Sb2Te3, Bi2Te3 and Bi2Se3. 
Owing to a complete solid solubility of Bi2Se3, Sb2Te3 and Bi2Te3, they can 
form various alloys with high 𝑍𝑇 by strongly suppressing the lattice thermal 
conductivity without degrading the electronic properties (Wright 1958; 
Kusano and Hori 2002). Many other thermoelectric materials like 
PbTe/Sb2Te3 (Zhu et al. 2005) and As/SiGe (Heller et al. 1976) alloys can 
also effectively suppress the thermal conductivity to achieve high 𝑍𝑇. In 
addition to the alloying method, which suppresses the thermal conduction of 
the 
high-frequency 
phonon 
by 
atomic-level 
mass 
disorder 
and 
inhomogeneity, disorder and nanostructures with relatively larger scale are 
necessary to further decrease the thermal conduction of low-frequency 
phonons. Theoretical studies indicate that nanoscale porosity can strongly 
scatter phonons to reduce the thermal conductivity, while showing a more 
negligible impact on electron scattering (Lee et al. 2010). The effect of 
nanoparticle scattering for lower thermal conductivity is also confirmed by 
theoretical calculation, similar to that of the nanoscale porosity (Zebarjadi  
et al. 2009). 
Thermal conductivity suppression based on boundary scattering can be 
realized in a thin film, nanowire or composite with nanograins. Boundary 
scattering becomes predominant when the characteristic length of the 
nanostructure is smaller than the MFP of phonons. Boundary scattering is 
another widely used method to explore the low thermal for thermoelectric 
application. Promoted by the DFT calculation, which can precisely give the 
MFP of both phonon and electrons, the strategy is to fabricate nanomaterials  
 
 
 

A Comprehensive Review of Phonon Engineering     157 
with a characteristic length longer than the MFP of phonon and shorter than  
that of the electron. The thermal conductivity of silicon can be reduced by  
approximately 100 times due to the significant boundary scattering in 
nanowires (Boukai et al. 2008; Hochbaum et al. 2008). In composite 
materials with a nano-size grain boundary, interfacial phonon scattering and 
transmission becomes important. Poudel et al. (2008) realized high 𝑍𝑇 of 
nanostructured BiSbTe caused by the phonon scattering across the nanograin 
boundary. Miura et al. (2015) suppressed the thermal conductivity of silicon 
by sintering nanoparticles, where small grain size and the resultant high 
interface density significantly reduced the thermal conductivity and 
enhanced ZT. As the interfacial thermal conductance varies significantly 
with the interfacial conditions, controlling the interfacial structure by 
introducing disorder or stress at the interface effectively introduces thermal 
resistance in the composite. The effectiveness of interfacial thermal 
resistance in the total thermal conductivity can be studied using the effective 
medium theory (EMF). Here is a mostly used model of composite materials 
proposed by Nan et al. (1997): 
𝜅eff = 𝜅m
఑p (1+2ఈ)+2఑m+ଶ௙ൣ఑p(1-ఈ)-఑m൧

where subscripts 𝑒𝑓𝑓, 𝑚, and 𝑝 denote the composites, matrix and filler, 
respectively, 𝑓 is the volume fraction of the filler, 𝑟 is the radius of spherical 
filler and 𝐺 is the interfacial thermal resistance. According to this equation, 
the thermal boundary resistance becomes critical when the grain size is 
nano-order. For example, in the composite materials fabricated by sintering 
silicon nanowires, the thermal conductivity decreases significantly due to the 
interfacial thermal conductance reduction caused by the interfacial softening 
and gives a high 𝑍𝑇 of 0.3 at room temperature (Kashiwagi et al. 2019). To 
better understand how the interface influences the overall thermal 
conductivity of thermoelectric silicon composite, Sakata et al. (2015) 
directly measured the interfacial thermal conductance between silicons 
fabricated by the sintering bonding method. The bonded silicon interface can 
mimic the nano-interfaces of silicon composite well (Figure 6.16), which 
indicates the oxidation degree can enormously reduce the interfacial thermal 
conductance.

6.2.7. Coherent phonon engineering in superlattice 
In contrast with the inelastic scattering in which phonon interaction with 
nanoparticles or interfaces is phase-destroying, coherent phonon transport is 
ballistic and passes through the interface in a preserved phase. Since 

A Comprehensive Review of Phonon Engineering     159 
coherent phonon transport can be regarded as a propagating wave, phonon 
interaction with the interface/nanoparticles can be viewed as wave 
diffraction and interference (Maldovan 2015). In analogy to photons and 
electrons, phonons exhibit a wave-like nature when the characteristic length 
of the structure is comparable with the wavelength (Figure 6.17(a)). Take 
light as an example, when the layer thickness is similar to the 𝜆2
⁄  
wavelength, light intensity is suppressed due to wave interference. In this 
sense, phonon interference can create forbidden energy bands in phonon 
dispersion and strongly suppress the thermal conductivity of a particular 
phonon (Figure 6.17(b)). 
 
Figure 6.17. (a) Schematic of phonon interference, and the resultant  
forbidden energy bands in the phonon dispersion relation. For a color  
version of this figure, see www.iste.co.uk/akinaga/thermoelectric2.zip 
Early works on coherent phonon engineering are usually realized by 
layered superlattice or other periodic structures. Note here, multi-interfaces 
are typically used to realize substantial phonon interference through multiple 
transmission/reflection at the interface. Phonon interference can result in flat 
bands in phonon dispersion relation, which means low group velocity. The 
phonon engineering of the coherent phonon is similar to the band 
engineering for bulk material, which modifies phonon harmonic properties. 
There have been many computational works studying coherent phonon 
engineering. For example, the multilayer structure of germanium 
nanoparticles embedded silicon matrix was found to cause collective phonon 
resonances in the embedded germanium nanoparticles region (Feng et al. 
2017). Experimentally, as directly measuring the wave-behavior of 
individual phonons or the dispersion relation are technically challenging, 
coherent phonon behavior is typically confirmed by temperature dependence  

160     Thermoelectric Micro/Nano Generators 2 
thermal conductivity measurement of the structure with various periods and  
individual layer thickness. Ravichandran et al. (2014) observed the coherent 
phonon regime in CaTiO2/SrTiO2 superlattice when the thickness of 
individual periods is smaller than 1 nm. Maire et al. (2017) modified the  
in-plane thermal conductivity of Si thin film fabricated with nanosize holes 
through tuning the coherent phonon transport. Luckyanova et al. (2012) 
observed coherent phonon behavior in GaAs/AlAs superlattice under 150 K, 
and a transition of phonons from coherent to diffusive in GaAs/AlAs 
superlattices with randomly distributed ErAs nanodots in a wide temperature 
range from 30–300 K (Luckyanova et al. 2018). 
On the contrary, simultaneously reducing the thermal conductivity of 
phonons of various wavelengths requires superlattice structures with an 
aperiodic structure whose individual layers have various thicknesses 
comparable to phonon wavelength. In recent studies, simulation combined 
with the machine learning method is implemented to determine the optimal 
aperiodic superlattices. Ju et al. (2017) combined the Green’s function and 
the Bayesian optimization to search for the structure of Ge/Si superlattice 
with minimal thermal conductivity from over 60,000 candidates, and 
realized a 50% reduction of thermal conductivity compared with the periodic 
structure by structure optimization. Experimental demonstration of the  
ultra-low thermal conductivity in aperiodic GaAs/AlAs superlattice 
optimized through machine-learning (Figure 6.18) has also realized a large 
reduction in thermal conductivity than that of the periodic superlattice. The 
simulation shows good techniques with the experimental result and indicates 
that the origin of the decrease in thermal conductivity comes from the 
phonon localization (Hu et al. 2020). Notably, the coherent phonon behavior 
is typically observed under a low-temperature regime because low 
temperature reduces the possibility of inelastic scattering of phonons. The 
challenge comes in realizing the coherent phonon control under room 
temperature or higher temperature, which is essential for thermoelectric 
application. Because coherent phonon engineering requires an ultra-fine 
structure comparable to the phonon wavelength, which is typically  
atomic-scale, the resultant large interface density causes a higher possibility 
of inelastic scattering owing to inevitably introduced defects or interfacial 
roughness during the fabrication. Besides, the superlattice materials are 
limited to those with similar lattice structures, as a large lattice mismatch at 
the interface would result in defects and disorders and destroy the phonon 
technique.

figure, see www.iste.co.uk/akinaga/thermoelectric2.zip 
Recently, the van der Waals stacking structure by two-dimensional 
materials emerged as a perfect candidate to realize the phonon engineering 
technique. The atomic-level flatness/thickness can maintain phonon 
coherence. The van der Waals inter-layer interaction enables assembling 
materials with distinctive lattice structures, resulting in a strong interference 
effect. The work by Hu et al. (2021), based on MD simulation and machine 
learning, has indicated the strong localization for various phonons in a 
graphene/MoS2 aperiodic superlattice structure (Figure 6.19). Experimentally, 
ultra-low cross-plane thermal conductivity is confirmed in structures such as 
the Graphene/MoSe2/MoS2/Wse2 stacking structure (Vaziri et al. 2019) and 
randomly stacking MoS2 superlattice (Kim et al. 2021). However, the 
underlying mechanism is still under debate, whether the low thermal 
conductivity originates from the coherent phonon interference or the 
interfacial inelastic phonon scattering. Another challenge lies in fabricating 
multilayer structures with large scale, i.e. large numbers of layers and large 
areas, and elucidating the correlation between structure and coherent phonon 
control, i.e. how the localization is enhanced by structure optimization. 
Overall, coherent phonon engineering is an ideal approach for 
thermoelectrics, by realizing low thermal conductivity without decreasing 
the electrical conductance. At the same time, severe challenges still require 
further development both theoretically and methodologically.

6.3. Summary and future prospects 
In this chapter, keeping in mind the need for low thermal conductivity in 
thermoelectrics, following the details about the fundamentals of thermal 
conduction and phonons, we comprehensively introduced methods of 
thermal conductivity measurement and phonon properties analysis and the 
basic principles and application examples of phonon engineering.  
From the methodological aspects of phonon properties and thermal 
conductivity analysis, experimental techniques allow us to measure the 
thermal conductivity from nano- to macro-scales accurately. In addition, 
further development based on nanofabrication, frequency modulation and 
dual laser interference techniques provides an indirect approach to unravel 
the anharmonic properties of phonons. Temperature-dependent thermal 
conductivity measurements indirectly reflect the contribution of different 
phonon transport mechanisms to thermal conductivity in a given material. 
On a related point, both harmonic and anharmonic properties of phonons can 
be directly probed by X-ray, neutron, photon and electron diffraction 
methods. On the one hand, computational methods based on first principles, 
lattice dynamics and molecular dynamics, etc., allow us not only to predict 
the thermal conductivity of materials or structures at various scales, but also 
to obtain massive information about phonon transport, such as states, 
velocities, relaxation times, mean free paths, all in a mode-dependent 
fashion, which are essential in explaining the experimental result and 
providing a guideline for effective optimization on the lattice or 
nanostructures for low thermal conductivity. 

A Comprehensive Review of Phonon Engineering     163 
As for the mechanisms and strategies of phonon engineering, low thermal 
conductivity can be realized both intrinsically and extrinsically by various 
approaches. The complex lattice structure, large unit cell, weak interatomic 
interaction and large atomic mass can result in low phonon group velocity 
and significant Umklapp scattering, strongly suppressing the intrinsic 
thermal conductivity. Alloying or isotropic mixtures and nanostructuring 
with grains, pores and precipitates can further enhance extrinsic phonon 
scattering or manipulate the phonon wave-behavior in case phonon phases 
are preserved to reduce thermal conductivity. 
While the remarkable progress in phonon engineering has promoted the 
development of thermoelectric materials, there is still plenty of room for 
advancement. Some examples for potential advancement are as follows. 
The interfacial state could be further incorporated into phonon 
engineering. In the Casimir–Knudsen regime, phonon transport is usually 
characterized by dividing a material into the internal region (e.g. inside a 
grain) and sharp interface (e.g. grain boundary). However, the influence of 
interface to phonon states is known to extend inside the internal region. This 
extension length strongly depends on the phonon mode and can be  
non-negligible compared with the nanostructure length scale (e.g. grain size) 
for low frequency and long wavelength acoustic phonons. In addition, in the 
actual materials, the interface usually takes a complex structure and 
composition, which makes this issue even more complicated. While this 
calls for more advancement in the theory of phonon transport, the presence 
of multiple length scales can also be seen as an opportunity to gain 
controllability. Like the well-known concept of improving thermoelectric ZT 
by nanostructuring using the difference in mean free paths of electrons and 
phonons, i.e. to scatter phonons dominantly by setting the nanostructure 
length scale in between the electron and phonon mean free paths, the added 
degrees of freedom by the interfacial states may be used to separately control 
thermal conductivity, electrical conductivity and the Seebeck coefficient. 
Better usage of phonon coherence by nanostructures is also an issue that 
has been discussed for a long time without being resolved. It is now clear 
that the requirements to do this at room temperature is severe because 
phonon coherence is quite vulnerable against interface roughness due to the 
short nominal wavelength. When material fabrication technology greatly 
advances and enables the fabrication of bulk scale nanostructured materials 
with atomically smooth interfaces, coherent phonon engineering is expected 
to become extremely powerful. An optimistic view of this is that this has 

164     Thermoelectric Micro/Nano Generators 2 
already been realized is some cases; large unit cell compounds (e.g. 
manganese silicide) are in a way self-assembled nanostructures with 
atomically smooth interfaces, and more nanostructures of such may be 
produced by looking into the metastable phase further. There, the currently 
growing materials informatics techniques should be useful to look for new 
metastable structures.  
In the diffusion regime, the studies on highly anharmonic materials so far 
have identified some key quantum features that give rise to strong 
anharmonicity like electrical polarization, electron lone pairs and resonance 
bonding. The next step would be to design and actually fabricate materials 
with the features. Again, expanding the search space to the metastable phase 
should help. It should be noted that when applying thermoelectrics for 
powering IoT sensors/transmitters, the temperature of interest is around 
room temperature, which makes the thermal stability issues of metastable 
materials less important. 
Clearly, all of the above require a research platform that closely couples 
fabrication, solid-state theory, machine learning, numerical simulation and 
measurements, and thus calls for extensive interdisciplinary and international 
collaborations among researchers.

7.1. Introduction 
Water, food and energy are the basics necessary for survival. If you think 
primarily of water and food, when it comes to survival, then you likely live 
in a place on planet Earth, where temperatures are high enough all year 
round so that you do not need to heat your living space (unlike most of the 
human population). In any case, energy in all its forms is one of the 
foundations of prosperity and the key condition to be able to use and exploit 
on a daily basis the advantages of modern technology, which contributes to 
our quality of life. Good (i.e. healthy) food and pure drinking water are the 
qualities required of these substances, but what about quality of our energy? 
Certainly, it is important for energy to be available when needed, in the right 
form, in sufficient amounts, and equally importantly, for an acceptable price.  
 
 
 
 

174     Thermoelectric Micro/Nano Generators 2 
And this must continue to be applied in the future. After all, the affordability 
(i.e. availability, price) of energy strongly affects socio-economic welfare 
and the poverty threshold. However, with the paradigm of sustainability, 
another quality factor, related to the way that energy is produced, and the 
impact on the environment is becoming increasingly important. The 
requirements for energy will continue to grow, despite the global efforts for 
green development and the emphasis on effective and wise consumption. 
This will be related, to some extent, to the growth of the human population 
as well as an increasing energy consumption per person. Accordingly, the 
problem of energy delivery will continue to grow. Hence, the energy 
challenges of our civilization will not be solved without the use of 
diversified, renewable energy sources and enabling technologies, which 
increase current energy production and, to the greatest extent, replace fossil 
fuels and other conventional sources. Importantly, we have the knowledge 
and technologies to enable renewable energy in the forms of light, wind, 
heat, motion, etc., which can be converted into electricity. Electrical energy 
will certainly be the most desired form of energy in the future and the type of 
energy with the fastest demand growth. Hence, it will account for the largest 
share of the growing needs for energy. Solar and wind are the most popular 
and so far, only renewable energy sources exploited for the large-scale 
harvesting of electrical energy using the technologies of photovoltaic panels 
and wind-turbine generators, respectively (Ellabban et al. 2014; Abas et al. 
2015; Ahmad and Zhang 2020; Paravantis and Kontouli 2020; Salvardi and 
Salvardi 2020; Stančin et al. 2020).  
Heat is another renewable source of energy that provides great 
possibilities and should be exploited in the best possible way. Considering 
that the heat dissipated into the environment during the primary production 
of energy from non-renewable fossil fuels accounts for almost two-thirds of 
the produced energy, the conversion of just a small fraction of the wasted 
heat into electricity could contribute a significant amount of energy. 
Furthermore, we could use any source of heat in our environment to extract 
electrical energy, which brings tremendous possibilities. After all, the amount 
of energy that is required for a particular application or function can vary by 
10 or more orders of magnitude in the range from micro-W (μW) to mega-W 
(MW). And such needs for energy are precisely in line with the nature of the 
heat sources, being widely dispersed and greatly varying in terms of the power 
of the source; with the exception of geothermal heat, high-, medium- and 
low-power heat sources are mostly related with the human activities (power 
plants, manufacturing facilities, cars, households, etc.), while natural low- to 
very-low-power heat sources are essentially everywhere in our environment 

The Current State of Thermoelectric Technologies     175 
(Kishore and Priya 2018; Zabek and Morini 2019). Actually, we humans are 
a source of energy, emitting about 100 W of heat while resting and 525 W 
during physical effort. This can also be used to generate electricity. In fact, 
there are numerous examples of devices powered by human-body heat using 
thermoelectric technologies which exploit the Seebeck effect to convert  
heat into electricity (Siddique et al. 2017; Nozariasbmarz et al. 2019; 
Nozariasbmarz et al. 2020a). The large-scale energy harvesting of waste heat 
sources could definitely make a significant contribution to covering our 
growing energy needs. Micro-energy harvesting can probably be neglected 
in the big picture; however, its benefits, which have been increasingly 
recognized in recent years, lie elsewhere. With the rapid development of 
low-power applications in the fields of sensors, MEMS, biomedical devices, 
etc., and in the concept of the Internet of Things (IoT), the possibility to 
extract energy from the environment and to make all these devices energy 
autonomous and wirelessly connected to a remote post, even without 
batteries (which have to be replaced) become extremely interesting. Initial 
predictions for the entry into era of a sophisticated society with sensing of 
the environment using a network consisting of a trillion sensors via IoT 
technology were quickly faced with the impossible reality of how to connect 
each sensor individually to a power source. The other option is batteries, 
which are convenient (i.e. available) despite their disadvantages in terms of 
power, cost and maintenance (i.e. replacement). However, on the predicted 
scale of a trillion sensors in the network, it is practically impossible to keep 
replacing the batteries connected to the sensors. To realize this, the vision of 
a sophisticated societal implementation of an energy-harvesting technology 
is becoming vital. Such micro-energy harvesting can include solar, thermal, 
kinetic, electromagnetic and other environmental energy sources, exploiting 
the photovoltaic, electromagnetic, piezoelectric, triboelectric, electrostatic, 
electrostrictive, pyroelectric, magnetostrictive, dielectric and thermoelectric 
energy-conversion principles. In recent years, we have been witnessing 
tremendous progress in the development of energy-harvesting devices, 
including individual single-source devices and devices with hybrid 
configurations for single and multiple energy sources combining different 
conversion principles (Bai et al. 2018; Prauzek et al. 2018; Ryu et al. 2019; 
Akinaga 2020; Charris et al. 2020; Liu et al. 2021). These hybrid harvesting 
devices are certainly more complex than single-source devices; however, 
their advantage concerns the ability to exploit various energy sources 
simultaneously or each of them when available, thus increasing the 
reliability of the power supply around the clock. A nice example is a 
thermoelectric–photovoltaic hybrid system in which the efficiency of a  
wide-band-gap solar cell can be enhanced by up to 3.1% using a 

176     Thermoelectric Micro/Nano Generators 2 
thermoelectric generator recovering the heat accumulated in the solar cell to 
produce additional power (Lorenzi et al. 2021). In the case of a single energy 
source, hybrid harvesters use different energy-conversion methods for better 
efficiency. In general, it is reasonable to use any source of energy available, 
even better if it is steady and reliable. Such heat sources are mostly available 
everywhere, and hence heat conversion is often one of the elements of 
hybrid harvesting devices. In any case, the basis is the development and 
technological progress of single-source harvesting devices with enhanced 
conversion efficiencies, which would also enable further progress with 
hybrid devices. 
Thermoelectric technologies enable the direct conversion of heat into 
electricity via the Seebeck effect, regardless of the large dispersion of heat 
sources and the broad variations in their power outputs, while by applying an 
electric current via the Peltier effect, the heat can be transferred for either 
cooling or heating, depending on the direction of the current. It should be 
emphasized that no other technology is capable of this. Furthermore, both 
functions, i.e. energy harvesting and cooling, are without any moving parts 
(solid-state construction and operation) and without the production of 
environmentally hazardous waste, while maintenance is also not needed. So, 
why are thermoelectric technologies basically unknown to the general 
public, while almost everyone knows about photovoltaic solar panels and 
wind turbines? This issue is all the more relevant given the many success 
stories using thermoelectric technologies for both energy harvesting and 
cooling. Actually, a quick look at these successful applications of 
thermoelectric technology reveals the key reasons for this situation. An 
excellent and also very illustrative example is thermoelectric generators (i.e. 
TEGS) with a radioisotope for the heat source (i.e. Radioisotope 
Thermoelectric Generators, RTGs), which are widely used for electricity 
power supply in aerospace applications such as space craft, satellites and 
space probes for long-term-stable sources of electrical power (Champier 
2017; Jaziri et al. 2020; Zoui et al. 2020). RTGs use the heat produced by the 
natural decay of radioactive materials and convert it into electricity. Hence, 
the characteristics of the heat source and the RTG are determined by the 
isotope material, which should preferably have low radiation emissions, an 
acceptable half-life within the mission’s duration, a high melting point, a 
high power density and be safe in all conditions. The most suitable isotope 
fuel is the high-cost Pu-238, with a half-life of 89.6 years and heat energy of 
about 0.54 W/g (∼ 5.2W/cm3). The conversion efficiency of RTGs is up to 
about 8.5%, and they are capable of supplying electrical power up to about 
300 W. Some of them have been operating for several decades, thus proving 

The Current State of Thermoelectric Technologies     177 
their reliability as a long-term source of electrical energy and thermoelectric 
devices in general. RTGs are the most important and specific commercial 
application of thermoelectric technology for energy production, despite their 
very high cost. The key basis for their successful application, however, lies 
in the fact that RTGs provide an unsurpassed solution for a long-term,  
non-stop, reliable supply of electrical energy without maintenance in a 
remote area (i.e. space, lighthouses, navigation beacons, weather stations, 
etc.), while price and efficiency are of secondary concern. The focus of the 
media and general public is of course on other aspects of space missions: 
technological aspects like power supply during the mission and the role of 
RTGs are mostly omitted. Another good example, also not in the public 
spotlight, are TEGs using the heat produced by the combustion of  
natural gas, butane or propane for power generation in industrial  
applications in remote areas, like deserts, well sites, offshore platforms and 
telecommunication sites in mountains (Champier 2017; Zoui et al. 2020). 
They can produce between 15 and 550 W, and can be combined for 
installations of up to 5,000 W. Their efficiency is low, around 2.3%; 
however, the high cost of energy is compensated by the fact that in these 
locations, power availability is critical and highly reliable power with low 
maintenance is required, regardless of the climate conditions.  
Some thermoelectric products have been developed for general customers 
and are on the market. These products include camp stoves, designed for 
camping in general, but equipped with a thermoelectric generator using the 
heat of burning wood to produce electric power in the range from 2 W to 
about 10 W, depending on the design, for charging electrical devices via a 
USB port (Gao et al. 2016). On the Internet, the BioLite CampStove2+, 
weighing about 0.9 kg, with the boiling time for 1 liter of water being  
4.5 minutes, enables charging with an electric power of 3 W and has  
3,200 mAh of internal battery store. It sells for about $150. The possibility 
of charging the phone, navigation device and other electronic gadgets while 
cooking a meal in the wilderness is certainly very appealing, especially if we 
are intending to stay there for a longer time. And the price is basically 
affordable, hence, the commercial success of such a product depends 
primarily on its overall practical usability, as perceived by customers and 
confirmed in practice, which is the same as for most consumer goods. A 
camping stove with a charger for a mobile phone can be a practical solution 
in the wilderness, but not really significant in terms of energy sustainability. 
In contrast, it would certainly be a major step forward if we could harvest the 
waste heat from vehicles with a combustion engine, leading to significant 
savings in fuel. After all, two-thirds of fuel energy is lost as a heat, 40% of 

178     Thermoelectric Micro/Nano Generators 2 
which is as a hot exhaust gas. If only about 6% of this exhaust heat could be 
converted into electrical energy, it would be possible to reduce fuel 
consumption by about 10%. Actually, tremendous progress has been made in 
this field, with various systems of thermoelectric generators (TEGs) that can 
be located either on the cooling system or on the exhaust system of cars and 
trucks (Jaziri et al. 2020; Zoui et al. 2020). TEG systems generating power 
from 10 W to about 610 W were reported, although their experimental 
conversion efficiency was below 2.6%. The technology of TEGs for vehicles 
with combustion engines is developed to the level of system prototype 
demonstration in the operating environment (i.e. TRL 7). There are still 
some technological difficulties and concerns related to the long-term 
durability, but the main obstacles for their broad application are basically 
economic reasons, expressed as a poor benefit-to-cost ratio. An additional 
element of uncertainty is the fact that electric cars are coming to the market 
at an accelerating pace, which could likely limit the use of TEGs to heavier 
vehicles with combustion engines, like trucks and ships. 
In contrast to energy harvesting, thermoelectric cooling (TEC) 
applications are much wider spread. In comparison to conventional  
vapor-compression coolers with a high coefficient of performance (COP) 
from 2.6 to 3.0, TEC systems have low COPs of 0.38–0.45, but have 
numerous other advantages, which are essential to be able to ensure cooling 
in a variety of areas. Thus, TEC can provide solutions, and actually, in some 
cases, the only solution, to difficult thermal management problems where a 
low or moderate amount of heat is involved (Gurevich and Velazquez-Perez 
2014; Zhao and Tan 2014; Atta 2018; Yu et al. 2019b; Baru and Bhatia 
2020; Salah and Abuhelwa 2020). Some of the significant features of TEC 
technology are as follows: no moving parts due to the solid-state 
construction and hence no maintenance, high reliability with a very long life 
of about 23 years (compared to 10–12 years for conventional compressor 
coolers), small size and weight, scalability from less than 1 W of cooling up 
to several kilowatts, ability to cool below ambient temperature, accurate 
temperature control (better than ±0.1°C), silent operation, operation in any 
orientation and also in zero-gravity environments (i.e. space), convenient 
power supply (operated directly from a DC power source), spot cooling and 
environmentally friendly. In addition, it should be emphasized that the same 
TEC device can be used for both cooling and heating, and can also generate 
a small amount of DC electrical power when exposed to a temperature 
difference across it. Accordingly, TEC is used in many areas, for example: 
aerospace applications, avionics, black-box cooling, CCDs (Charge Coupler 
Devices), dehumidifiers, integrated-circuit cooling, laser-diode cooling, 

The Current State of Thermoelectric Technologies     179 
microprocessor 
cooling, 
electronic-package 
cooling, 
environmental 
analyzers, thermal cycling devices (DNA and blood analyzers) immersion 
coolers, IR detectors, night-vision equipment, and heated and cooled vehicle 
seats. A nice example is the TEC cooling of the Si(Li)-based detector in 
energy-dispersive X-ray spectrometers (EDS), replacing the conventional 
cooling by liquid nitrogen, which required the timely addition of nitrogen to 
the Dewar to ensure constant cooling, and preventing the destruction of the 
detector. This technical detail about the use of TEC is likely to be known to 
operators of modern scanning electron microscopes equipped with EDS 
detectors, and thus essentially limited to a specific group of scientific people. 
Unfortunately, the same applies for many other technical thermoelectric 
solutions. Another application is decorative wine-bottle coolers based on 
TEC, which could find a place in practically any home of those who like to 
enjoy a glass of good wine. They offer a silent operation, no shaking, 
accurate control of the temperature in just the right temperature range for 
cooling white and red wines, and low energy consumption. All advantages 
are difficult to overlook. 
The above overview shows how extensive progress has been made with 
thermoelectric technologies in recent decades. They are well established in 
many areas, in particular where their unique advantages offer the best (and 
often the only) solution for particular needs, either in terms of energy supply 
or cooling, with the costs being of secondary concern. However, further 
broadening of their applications is hindered in many areas, primarily due to 
the low conversion efficiency and high costs. In general, two main roles of 
TEGs can be recognized. One is the thermoelectric recovery of waste heat 
from power plants (thermal, nuclear), industry, waste incinerators, 
automotive and other high-, medium- and low-power sources, which could 
contribute a significant amount of electrical energy. Here, the motivation is 
not so much the lack of energy, but more in the optimization of the energy 
efficiency. If there is no specific need for the produced electrical energy, the 
implementation of the thermoelectric harvesting predominantly depends on 
an economic justification. In the first place, the economics of such electricity 
harvesting depends on the costs of the thermoelectric technology, (i.e. the 
cost of the thermoelectric generators (TEGs) with the required infrastructure) 
and on the amount of produced electrical energy. The latter is directly 
dependent on the conversion efficiency of the TEGs. And the other, TEGs 
are a source of electrical energy for power supply. In this case, TEGs play a 
key role in enabling numerous low-power applications related to 
autonomous sensors, wireless sensor networks (WSNs), environment 
monitoring, medical applications, etc., thus also enabling IoT ecosystems. 

180     Thermoelectric Micro/Nano Generators 2 
Here, the focus is certainly on the conversion efficiency of TEGs and  
micro-TEGs to ensure a sufficient and reliable power supply from harvesting 
low- and very-low-power environmental heat sources into electricity. 
The aim of this chapter is to provide a general overview of the current 
state of thermoelectric technologies, in particular with a focus on those 
aspects that have the main influence on their development, efficiency, cost 
and applications, i.e. thermoelectric materials, requirements for various 
applications of thermoelectric devices, principles of thermoelectric modules 
and their design and structure, and the fabrication technologies for TEGs. 
This overview will not be going into theoretical details with equations 
describing thermoelectric phenomena, the efficiency of materials and 
devices, the challenges in the development of thermoelectric materials with 
enhanced figure of merit (ZT) and the presentation of numerous 
thermoelectric devices for all ranges of envisaged applications, etc., which 
can be found elsewhere in numerous review articles on topics reported in the 
literature. In doing so, I hope to be able to expose some of the essential 
elements related to the problems and challenges of the complex development 
of thermoelectric devices for various applications, as well as prospects for 
the future. 
7.2. Thermoelectric materials  
Thermoelectric materials have the unique capacity of converting a flow 
of heat into electrical energy based on the Seebeck effect, and vice versa: by 
using an electrical current, the heat can be transferred from one place to 
another (Peltier effect). Exploitation of these phenomena requires the use of 
thermoelectric devices made from at least two materials with different 
Seebeck (S)/Peltier (Π) coefficients. The efficiency increases with the 
increasing difference in S (i.e. Π) between both involved materials. Hence, 
the use of n-type and p-type thermoelectric materials, preferably having a 
high absolute value of S (Π), one being negative and one positive, 
respectively, represents the best combination for a thermoelectric device. A 
basic thermoelectric pair is schematically presented in Figure 7.1. 
Thermoelectric modules typically contain between 10 and 100 of such 
couples of n-type and p-type legs, thermally connected in parallel and 
electrically in series. The thermoelectric efficiency of materials, and also 
thermoelectric devices, is generally expressed by the dimensionless figure of 
merit ZT, which is proportional to the electrical conductivity (σ), and the 
square of the Seebeck coefficient (S), and inversely proportional to the 

The Current State of Thermoelectric Technologies     181 
thermal conductivity (κ) (Snyder and Toberer 2008; Gould 2019; Zoui et al. 
2020). In general, the physical properties of semiconductors provide the best 
way to meet the requirements for such contradictory parameters for good  
n- and p-type thermoelectric materials. The relationship between the value of 
ZT and the conversion efficiency is shown in Figure 7.2. As with the other 
“heat engines”, also for thermoelectric devices, the maximum theoretical 
efficiency is limited by the Carnot efficiency. Traditional power generators 
can reach 40% of Carnot efficiency, and for such conversion efficiency, the 
ZT value of the thermoelectric materials should be at least 3. Accordingly, a 
lot of effort has gone into the development of new thermoelectric materials 
with a high ZT and to enhance the ZT of already-known thermoelectric 
materials in recent decades, after the advantages of thermoelectric 
technologies were widely recognized.  
 
Figure 7.1. Schematic of heat conversion into electricity (i.e. power  
generation mode – Seebeck effect) and thermoelectric cooling  
(i.e. active refrigeration mode – Peltier effect)  
Thermoelectric materials are often classified into two categories, i.e. 
conventional and novel materials. The conventional thermoelectric materials, 
i.e. Bi2Te3/Sb2Te3, PbTe, TAGS and Si–Ge are mostly based on heavy 
elements like Te, Bi, Pb, Sb and Ag, which are rare, expensive, heavy and 
toxic. These materials have been predominantly used in hitherto successful 
applications of thermoelectric generators (i.e. RTGs in space programs) and 

182     Thermoelectric Micro/Nano Generators 2 
for cooling, mostly limited to niche areas of technology. The current 
thermoelectric technologies are still largely based on these conventional 
materials with ZT values around 1. Some materials from this group are still 
irreplaceable, especially those with good thermoelectric characteristics for 
use at temperatures below 150°C. In particular, Bi2Te3 has superior 
thermoelectric performance in this temperature range with a ZT value of 1 at 
room temperature and has no real alternative, despite long-term efforts to 
replace it. Hence, Bi2Te3 is nowadays mostly used in the development of 
body-heat harvesting applications and others related to environmental heat 
sources with low power and small temperature differences (Li et al. 2019; 
Nozariasbmarz et al. 2020a, 2020b, 2019a). The other materials from this 
group, like TAGS and PbTe-based materials, are suitable for applications in 
an intermediate temperature range of 150°C to 500°C. The Si,Ge materials 
are considered suitable for temperatures above 500°C. In contrast to the 
other classified materials, Si,Ge is made from light, abundant, cheap and 
environmentally benign elements, which are very useful characteristics for 
many novel thermoelectric materials.

on the temperature difference and ZT, assuming that the  
cold side temperature is 300 K (Han et al. 2014) 
The family of novel thermoelectric materials is very diverse (Aswal et al. 
2016; Masood et al. 2018; Cai et al. 2019; Freer and Powell 2020), 
comprising materials such as skutterudites (Rogl et al. 2014; Rogl and Rogl 
2017; Liu et al. 2020), clathrates (Christensen et al. 2010; Takabatake et al. 

The Current State of Thermoelectric Technologies     183 
2014; Sui and Kauzlarich 2016), half-Heusler alloys (Chen and Ren 2013; 
Poon 2018; Ciesielski et al. 2020), chalcogenides, i.e. sulfides and selenides 
(Chetty et al. 2015; Li et al. 2018; Wei et al. 2018; Shi et al. 2019; Powell 
2019; Qin et al. 2020; Yu et al. 2020; Guélou et al. 2021), silicides (Liu et al. 
2017; Nozariasbmarz et al. 2017; Burkov 2018; Kim et al. 2019, 2020) and 
oxides (Feng et al. 2017; Ji 2018; Bernik 2021). Based on their ZT values 
and chemical stability, most of them are suitable for applications in the 
medium-temperature range from 250 to 650°C, while some half-Heusler 
alloys, silicides and in particular oxides are also suitable for temperatures 
above 650°C. Their development in recent decades was strongly affected by 
the concept of phonon-glass electron-crystal (Rowe 1995) and nanostructure 
engineering (Chen et al. 2012; He et al. 2013; Mohanraman et al. 2015), 
leading to an increase in ZT to 1 and above. Nowadays, quite a few novel 
thermoelectric materials have ZT values between 1 and 2 and some even 
above 2 (Rull-Bravo et al. 2015; Aswal et al. 2016; Cai et al. 2019; Yu et al. 
2019a; Shi et al. 2020). It is certainly good that in all these groups (i.e. 
systems) of novel thermoelectric materials, the p- and n-type materials are 
available; unfortunately, their thermoelectric characteristics within the same 
group mostly do not match, as one type of material (i.e. usually the p-type) 
has a distinctly higher ZT value than the other. Research efforts are therefore 
often used to enhance the thermoelectric characteristics of this inferior type 
of material from the group, to have p- and n-type materials with the highest 
possible and similar ZT values in the same system. In the case of 
skutterudites, however, n- and p-type materials with comparably high ZT 
values in the range from 1 to 2 are already available (Rull-Bravo et al. 2015; 
Rogl and Rogl 2017). Hence, skutterudites are considered as very promising 
candidates for medium-temperature thermoelectric power generation. The 
ZT values for some state-of-the-art thermoelectric materials are presented in 
Figure 7.3. The commercially available materials have mostly ZT values of 
about 0.7; it is considered that such an average value of ZT for a material 
under an applied temperature gradient would be sufficient for energy 
harvesting. However, looking generally and not just at current ZT values, 
each group of novel thermoelectric materials has some interesting 
advantages for applications in comparison to the others, which encourages 
and justifies their further development. This could be environmentally 
friendly composition (sulfides, silicide, oxides), made from abundant and 
low-cost elements (sulfides, silicides, oxides), lightweight (silicides), 
stability in air at moderate (skutterudites, chalcogenides) and high  
(half-Heusler alloys, silicides, oxides) temperatures, etc.  

184     Thermoelectric Micro/Nano Generators 2 
When referring to novel thermoelectric materials and their progress, we 
should certainly not forget two groups of materials which will likely have an 
immense impact on thermoelectric technologies, particularly at room 
temperature. One is silicon, which has long been considered unsuitable as a 
thermoelectric material due to its high thermal conductivity. This changed 
when a discovery was made: by reducing the dimensions to submicron sizes, 
the thermal conductivity of silicon is drastically reduced (Boukai et al. 2008; 
Hochbaum et al. 2008). The development of thermoelectric silicon that 
followed was a strong motivation, with the possibility to facilitate the 
integration of thermoelectric technologies with Si-based semiconducting 
electronics, which is the core of our electronics and information 
technologies. This resulted in doped silicon materials with ZT values of up 
to 0.6 at room temperature (Tang et al. 2010; He et al. 2019; Tanusilp and 
Kurosaki 2019; Pham et al. 2020).  
 
Figure 7.3. ZT values of state-of-the-art thermoelectric materials  
in the last 10 years and their costs (Shi et al. 2020) 
The other group are organic thermoelectric materials (Zhang et al. 2014; 
Russ et al. 2016; Chakraborty et al. 2018; Wang and Yu 2019; Zhang and 
Park 2019; Zhang et al. 2019; Lindorf et al. 2020) represented by the p- and  
n-type conjugated polymers (Peng et al. 2017; Yao et al. 2018, 2019), 
carbon-nanotube-based materials (CNT) (Blackburn et al. 2018; Wang et al. 
2018; Hung et al. 2019) and graphene-based materials (Amollo et al. 2017; 
Zong et al. 2020). Their development resulted in peak ZT values up to  
0.5. They are mechanically flexible, lightweight, cheap, environmentally 
friendly, easily fabricated in versatile formats and thus very suitable  
for thermoelectric energy-harvesting applications in wearable electronics, 

The Current State of Thermoelectric Technologies     185 
body-heat energy harvesting and in general for applications at environmental 
temperatures.  
The focus of the research in recent decades and to a large extent even 
now is on improving the value of ZT; after all, conversion efficiency and 
with it the output power of thermoelectric devices are positively correlated 
with the ZT of materials. However, ZT is a highly temperature-dependent 
parameter and the conversion efficiency is also higher with higher operating 
temperature differences, rising almost linearly with ΔT, as is clearly evident 
in Figure 7.2. Unfortunately, for most thermoelectric materials, the 
maximum ZT values relate to a relatively narrow temperature range of about 
200–300 K. Hence, for better efficiency in exploiting high-temperature heat 
sources, it is desirable to optimize the ZT over a large temperature gradient, 
which can be done using the concept of segmented thermoelectric modules 
(Bai et al. 2021). It means that selected thermoelectric materials with 
different optimum operating temperatures along the direction of the 
temperature gradient are combined in an electrical series to form each of the 
p- and n-type thermoelectric legs. It soon showed, however, that a simple 
choice according to suitable ZT values is not enough and that materials 
combined into a segmented device must be thermoelectrically compatible to 
achieve an improved efficiency; if they are not, the efficiency will markedly 
decline in comparison to that expected. Based on an understanding of  
the thermodynamics behind segmented thermoelectric devices, the 
thermoelectric compatibility factor (s) was introduced (Snyder and Ursell 
2003), defined as s = (√(1+ZT) – 1)/ST. In accordance with their report, the 
maximum efficiency that the thermoelectric material can provide is only 
achieved when the relative current density (u, i.e. the ratio of the electrical 
current density to the heat flux) is equal to s. This means that for an effective 
thermoelectric device, the u value has to be roughly constant through a 
segmented element, changing by less than 20%. A difference in the 
compatibility factor by a factor of about 2 or more means that a given u 
cannot be suitable for materials connected in series and the segmentation 
will not be efficient. Hence, materials with a high ZT are needed, which also 
have similar s. Given this, continuous efforts to develop a variety of p- and 
n-type materials with enhanced thermoelectric properties in order to have a 
good choice of candidates for constructing the segmented modules according 
to optimal ZT and compatibility are even more understandable. 
ZT and s are certainly very important in segmented devices, because the 
thermoelectric properties can change dramatically from one segment to 
another. However, there are also many other chemical and physical 

186     Thermoelectric Micro/Nano Generators 2 
properties affecting the selection of materials, which are not important only 
for segmented, but actually in general for any thermoelectric module and 
were somehow in the shadow of headline efforts to improve the ZT of 
materials and their conversion efficiency. Due to the service conditions of 
TEGs, these materials are unavoidably subjected to different temperatures 
and a wide range of temperature gradients created within the materials 
themselves. Hence, the temperature dependence of any property of the 
thermoelectric material is a subject of concern. These other property factors 
are the thermal and chemical stability, mechanical and thermomechanical 
properties, aging and fatigue; they affect the long-term reliability of 
materials and modules. Their influence is becoming increasingly critical 
with an increasing operating temperature and temperature gradient across the 
thermoelectric module, and also due to the frequency of the temperature 
cycles of heating and cooling to which the module is exposed. The Young’s 
modulus (i.e. the elastic response to uniaxial loading, either tension or 
compression), strength (i.e. the stress that a material can withstand under any 
load without a permanent change), hardness (i.e. the material’s resistance to 
penetration, also indicative of a resistance to wear) and the fracture 
toughness (i.e. the ability to withstand loading by plastic deformation before 
catastrophic failure; a brittle material is without an ability to plastically 
deform) are the most crucial mechanical parameters for designing devices 
and have to be correct across the entire operating temperature range. After 
all, these mechanical properties of thermoelectric materials are important for 
their ability to be machined into the shapes needed for the manufacturing of 
modules. They are also important for the physical stability, robustness and 
structural integrity of the modules, including normal handling, and also 
under operating conditions for any thermal gradient and possible mechanical 
loads (i.e. compression, vibrations, etc.). In operating conditions, the thermal 
shock resistance (i.e. the material’s ability to withstand the thermal stress 
introduced by a sudden increase in temperature) and the fatigue resistance 
(i.e. the capability of the material to withstand multiple cycles of heating and 
cooling) also must be taken into consideration. The thermal stress (σthermal) 
developed in the material is proportional to the coefficient of thermal 
expansion (α), the Young’s modulus (E) and the temperature difference (ΔT) 
across the material. As long as the thermal stress is lower than the fracture 
stress (fracture toughness), the material will withstand the shock. It is also 
relevant for the material to have good (i.e. higher) thermal fatigue resistance, 
which means that it is capable of withstanding a larger number of thermal 
cycles. In recent reports, the problem of the relevant mechanical properties 
for practical applications and the mechanical characteristics of some 

The Current State of Thermoelectric Technologies     187 
thermoelectric materials (i.e. (Bi/Pb)-tellurides, skutterudites, half-Heusler 
alloys, (Si,Ge)-based alloys) has been well presented (He et al. 2015; 
Wereszczak and Case 2015; Guttmann and Gelbstein 2018). According to 
these reports, most of the thermoelectric materials exhibit an elastic modulus 
similar to common engineering materials in the range from several tens of 
GPa up to about 200 GPa, which is encouraging for the design of 
thermoelectric devices. Unfortunately, thermoelectric materials are mostly 
brittle and show no yield strength. Therefore, their fracture tends to be 
sudden and catastrophic. The hardness of thermoelectric materials can vary a 
great deal: from values much below and around 1 GPa to about 14 GPa 
(Kenfaui et al. 2010; He et al. 2015; Guttmann and Gelbstein 2018). For the 
fracture toughness (in MPa × m1/2) of the thermoelectric materials, values in 
the range of about 0.3 to about 2.8 are reported (Guttmann and Gelbstein 
2018, Li et al. 2021). These mechanical properties are valid for room 
temperature; however, it would certainly be beneficial to also know their 
temperature dependence in the temperature range of the intended use. 
Thermoelectric materials are brittle in nature and prone to damage by 
thermal shock. While the thermal shock resistance can be evaluated via other 
mechanical properties (Wang et al. 2016; Guttmann and Gelbstein 2018; 
Wang and Li 2018), there is certainly a lack of studies about their thermal 
fatigue resistance. The mechanical properties of materials are determined by 
their chemical composition and crystal structure, with the nature of the 
bonds between the atoms and the microstructure (i.e. the phase composition 
and the distribution of phases, the morphology of the grains, the grain size 
and size distribution, texturing, porosity, etc.). Hence, they can be greatly 
affected by the processing of materials due to the rearrangement of the 
internal structure (i.e. microstructure), which gives an opportunity for their 
enhancement. In general, the use of p- and n-type materials from the same 
family, which are chemically and structurally as close as possible, can also 
mean similar mechanical and chemical properties, and therefore not only 
better mechanical but also chemical compatibility in the module. In this 
regard, another factor that has to be considered, in particular for an 
increasing operating temperature to which the materials are exposed, is the 
thermal expansion. Thermal expansion means the tendency of a material to 
change its shape, area, volume and density as a response to a change in 
temperature, which is described by the thermal expansion coefficient, linear, 
areal or volumetric, and usually does not include phase transitions. The 
choice of coefficient depends on the particular application and which 
dimensions are considered as important. The thermal expansion is closely 
related to the nature of the bonding in materials and decreases with an 

188     Thermoelectric Micro/Nano Generators 2 
increase of the bond energy. Hence materials with a higher melting 
temperature are more likely to have a lower thermal expansion coefficient. If 
the body is free to expand, the expansion or strain resulting from an increase 
in temperature can be simply calculated using the applicable coefficient of 
thermal expansion. In a module, however, the materials are not free standing 
and their expansion is restrained. In this case, the stress resulting in a 
material can be calculated by considering the strain during free expansion 
and the stress required to reduce that strain to zero, using the stress/strain 
relationship characterized by the Young’s (elastic) modulus. Thermal 
expansion is certainly a factor threatening the structural integrity of modules 
and can cause their degradation, especially if thermal cycling is applied, 
which makes the thermal expansion coefficient a key design parameter for 
thermoelectric materials (Ravi et al. 2009; Ni et al. 2013; Shtern et al. 2019). 
Accordingly, it is good if a selection of materials, compatible in all the 
required respects, is available and with coefficients of thermal expansion that 
do not vary significantly over the range of temperatures where they are 
designed to function. A nice example is the large family of p- and n-type 
skutterudites with a linear thermal expansion coefficient α somewhere in the 
range from about 5×10-6K-1 to about 14×10-6K-1 (Schierning et al. 2015). In 
general, n-type Sb-based skutterudites have a lower α than a p-type isotype; 
however, for some Fe/Ni-substituted multi-filled skutterudites, a p- and  
n-type material with practically the same α and ZT of about 1 can be 
produced, also having identical hardness and elastic modulus.  
For applications it is also significant that thermoelectric materials are 
available in sufficient quantities of constant and reproducible quality, and for 
a low price. However, in the development of thermoelectric materials, very 
small amounts are typically prepared, sufficient only for their 
characterization. Hence, until quite recently, many materials with good 
thermoelectric characteristics were only available in small amounts, often 
below 1 gram. In general, the processing of bulk thermoelectric materials 
mostly consists of two stages, i.e. the synthesis of the material in the form of 
powder or bulk, and the final consolidation of the material by sintering. 
Processing is well known to affect the thermoelectric characteristics of 
materials significantly and is therefore a powerful tool that has been widely 
studied and is already well exploited to enhance them (Recatala-Gomez et al. 
2020; Ma et al. 2021). But processing, and in particular synthetic methods, 
also have an important influence on the possibility of scaling up the 
production of the material from the laboratory to the semi-industrial and 
industrial quantities needed for applications. Besides the conventional 

The Current State of Thermoelectric Technologies     189 
methods of solid-state synthesis and melting, in recent years, novel 
thermoelectric materials (i.e. chalcogenides, clathrates, skutterudites, half-
Heusler alloys, silicides and oxides) were developed using different 
synthesis methods, such as wet chemical methods (i.e. solvothermal and 
hydrothermal methods, co-precipitation, etc.) and mechanochemical alloying 
(i.e. high-energy milling); they enable the reproducible preparation of 
materials and are relatively easy to scale up. Many of these materials, with 
their excellent thermoelectric characteristics, are now available in much 
larger amounts because they can be reproducibly synthesized in batches of 
several 100 grams. Also worth noting is that these synthesis methods, which 
are usually combined with hot-pressing and spark plasma sintering (SPS), 
inherently support nanostructuring and nanostructural engineering for 
enhanced thermoelectric characteristics (Bux et al. 2011; Baláž et al. 2017; 
Li et al. 2017; Wu et al. 2017; Masood et al. 2018; Baláž et al. 2019, 2020; 
Lei et al. 2019; Young and Reddy 2019; Hamawandi et al. 2020; Kruszewski 
et al. 2021; Novitskii et al. 2021). As these novel thermoelectric materials 
are mostly made from abundant and hence cheap chemical elements, it is 
certainly desirable for them to be processed by cost-effective methods. 
However, for a more comprehensive review of the economics of certain 
thermoelectric materials, in addition to the price of materials, their 
thermoelectric efficiency (ZT) should also be taken into consideration (see 
Figure 7.3); a cheaper material with a higher thermoelectric conversion 
efficiency means a lower price per watt of produced energy (LeBlanc  
2014; LeBlanc et al. 2014; Shi et al. 2020; Jaldurgam et al. 2021). The  
two-stage processing of bulk thermoelectric materials for standard Π-type 
thermoelectric modules is nevertheless time- and energy-consuming, which 
certainly add to the production costs. Hence, rapid fabrication methods  
were also developed in recent years, such as the laser-melting,  
additive-manufacturing technique (El-Desouky et al. 2016).  
7.3. Thermoelectric devices – structure, materials, fabrication 
technology 
In general, the term thermoelectric devices includes devices for 
thermoelectric energy harvesting and thermoelectric cooling. Here, 
primarily, thermoelectric energy-harvesting devices will be discussed, 
although most of the content could also apply to thermoelectric cooling 
devices. Structurally, the main part of thermoelectric modules is the 
thermopile, which consists of thermocouples (Figures 7.1 and 7.4) connected 
electrically in series and thermally in parallel. When the thermoelectric 

190     Thermoelectric Micro/Nano Generators 2 
module is connected to a heat source on one side and a heat sink on the 
other, we are talking about a thermoelectric generator (TEG). For the 
optimum conversion efficiency of the TEG, the good transfer of heat from 
the heat source to the module is essential, as well as the highest possible and 
constantly maintained temperature gradient across the module by the good 
transfer of heat from the module to the heat sink. The standard Π-type 
sandwich structure of the module is shown in Figure 7.4c. This is the 
traditional structure of thermoelectric modules and is the most commonly 
used. It is typical of thermoelectric devices used for the generation of electric 
power in extreme environments, like RTGs for space explorations, TEGs for 
industrial applications in remote areas and TEGs for the recovery of waste 
heat for the production of electricity (Champier 2017). Actually, it is widely 
adopted in commercial thermoelectric products; the thermoelectric modules, 
which can be found on the Internet and are available on the market, have 
such a structure. The standard Π-type structure is characterized by vertical 
heat and current flows (also called a vertical structure), while in comparison 
to other structures, its main advantages are a simple design and the fact that 
it enables a large power output and a high conversion efficiency. In  
power-generation applications, these are certainly advantages that outweigh 
the main drawbacks, which are the difficult and time-consuming fabrication 
and the high-technology requirements. The vertical structure is also widely 
used in TEGs for micro-energy harvesting (μTEGs). However, in  
micro-energy harvesting, certain advantages of other structures, i.e. lateral 
and hybrid structures, are also required (Yan et al. 2018). All the different 
types of structure, i.e. vertical, lateral and hybrid, are schematically 
presented in Figure 7.4. In the lateral structure, the heat and current both 
flow in the lateral direction. The main advantage of the lateral structure  
is that it is easily fabricated in μ-TEG for its compatibility with  
integrated-circuit (IC) planar technology. The main disadvantage is its 
comparatively poor performance due to a high parasitic heat flux through the 
membrane and the difficulty in packaging this chip-like device to apply an 
in-plane temperature difference. Hence, it is rarely used in power generation. 
The lateral structure is normally used in different sensor applications. The 
hybrid structure combines the performance of the vertical and lateral types of 
structures and thus integrates their advantages; the heat from environment is 
provided vertically into one side of the chip, guided through the thermopile 
in a planar direction and ejected vertically on the other side. The packaging 
of thermoelectric modules with a hybrid structure is convenient due to the 
vertical direction of the heat flux on both sides, as in the case of the vertical 
structure. Furthermore, the in-plane thermopiles can be fabricated using  

The Current State of Thermoelectric Technologies     191 
IC-compatible technology, as in the case of the lateral structure. The main 
challenge in the design of the hybrid structure is the optimization of the  
heat-flux path, which is essential for improving the output power of such a 
TE module. The possible effective solutions include introducing a cavity 
beneath or above the thermopile, a metal layer on both sides of the module to 
improve its thermal coupling with the surrounding environment, and the 
optimization of the shape and the distribution of thermopile. The hybrid 
structure is certainly desirable when its performance complies with particular 
applications (Yan et al. 2018).  
 
Figure 7.4. Schematic of structures used in the fabrication of micro thermoelectric 
devices (μTE-modules) and the directions of the heat and current fluxes; a) lateral,  
b) hybrid and c) vertical (i.e. standard Π-type) (Jeziri et al. 2020) 
However, within a given structure, the efficiency and hence the power 
and voltage outputs can be further optimized using the geometrical 
parameters, which make it possible to adjust the differences in the electrical 
and thermal conductivities between the p and n legs of the thermocouples 
and thus affect the current and heat transport through the device. The main 
geometrical parameters are the leg length, the aspect ratio (i.e. ratio of the 
leg length to the leg cross-sectional area) and the fill factor (i.e. the  
 
 

192     Thermoelectric Micro/Nano Generators 2 
proportion of a thermoelectric device’s area, which is occupied by the 
thermoelectric material). Accordingly, for different electrical and thermal 
conductivities of the p- and n-type legs of the thermocouple, the current and 
heat flow through the legs can be equilibrated for maximum efficiency via 
the geometry of the legs, usually by adjusting the cross-section of each leg, 
because the lengths of the thermocouple legs are usually equal to avoid  
the complication of the design and fabrication process, i.e. a larger  
cross-sectional area of the leg from the material with the higher resistivity. In 
the case of the lateral and hybrid structures of the thermoelectric module, the 
thickness of the thermoelectric material is typically limited by the fabrication 
technology, and so the cross-section is commonly adjusted by the width of 
the leg. In general, when a high-power source of heat is available, then the 
design with a small aspect ratio of short legs can be used to maximize the 
power generation. However, this is at the expense of the efficiency. In 
contrast, a high-aspect-ratio design can be used in the case of limited heat 
energy to maximize the efficiency at the expense of the power generation 
(Kim et al. 2016; Yan et al. 2018; Thimont and LeBlanc 2019; Freer and 
Powell 2020). The fill factor is reflected in the thermal resistance parameters 
of the module; it affects the amount of heat transfer from the hot to the cold 
side and hence the temperature gradient in the module. With a smaller fill 
factor, the optimum thickness for the maximum power output is lower (Bahk 
et al. 2015; Zhu et al. 2020). The geometrical parameters also affect the 
amount of thermoelectric materials needed in thermoelectric module and 
hence also the costs. In the case of more expensive materials, reducing the 
volume of the legs while keeping the same aspect ratio can reduce costs. 
However, it must be considered that this affects the thermal and electrical 
resistances and hence the output power and efficiency of the module. The 
geometry parameters of thermoelectric module greatly affect its performance 
(i.e. the efficiency and power output). Hence, the geometrical design and its 
optimization are essential for the successful development and manufacturing 
of thermoelectric devices, while modeling and simulations can also help 
(Lee 2013; Meng et al. 2016; Ma et al. 2017; Ferreira-Teixeira and Pereira 
2018; Dongxu et al. 2019; Karana and Sahoo 2019; Wolf et al. 2020; Tanwar 
et al. 2021). 
The overall complexity of thermoelectric devices and the engineering 
challenges they present are only fully revealed once it comes to their 
assembly and manufacturing, which actually determine their practical 
energy-conversion efficiency and service life. Aside from the thermoelectric  
 
 

The Current State of Thermoelectric Technologies     193 
materials with a direct ability for energy conversion expressed by ZT, which 
have so far largely been in the focus of research and prevail in literature 
reports, thermoelectric devices comprise several other materials, each with a 
specific function in their structure. So, the integration of thermoelectric 
conversion materials into a thermoelectric device also requires the following 
key materials: i) thermoelectric interface materials, ii) package materials and 
iii) housing materials. In addition, solder or brazing materials and electrode 
stripes are necessary for a thermoelectric module (Liu and Bai 2019). The 
key materials for assembling thermoelectric devices are schematically shown 
in Figure 7.5. Their specific characteristics required in regard to their role in 
the structure itself, very much affect the possible choices and bring 
engineering and cost challenges with respect to their availability, 
compatibility and price. The required characteristics of thermoelectric 
conversion materials were presented in the previous section. When it comes 
to their connection with other materials in a thermoelectric device, the 
following are especially relevant: high electrical and low thermal 
conductivities, a proper mechanical strength and the thermal expansion 
coefficient. Interface materials connect the p- and n-legs of thermocouples 
with an electrode strip. Hence, they must have high electrical and high 
thermal conductivities to support the low-energy-loss transport of heat and 
electricity through the device, and must also bond easily and well to the 
thermoelectric conversion material. Good packaging materials have low 
electrical and thermal conductivities and high thermal stabilities. Packaging 
materials fill the empty space between the columns of thermocouples within 
the structure of the thermoelectric module, which is especially important in 
the case of a very low fill factor, when it also has to provide mechanical 
support. Packaging materials encapsulate the thermoelectric conversion 
materials and thus protect them from environmental (i.e. atmospheric) 
influences. Housing materials need to have a low electrical conductivity to 
electrically insulate the module from its surroundings and a high thermal 
conductivity for the good transfer of heat from the heat source to the module, 
and on the cold side, good transfer of heat from the module to the heat sink. 
The housing material has to be thermally stable and mechanically strong to 
provide mechanical integrity to the module and for the protection of the 
thermoelectric conversion material. The choice of housing materials is rather 
limited, in power generation mostly to ceramic substrates of Al2O3, AlN, 
Si3N4 and others, which are expensive.

A variety of materials, interconnected in thermoelectric modules and 
hence with very different interfaces, means real, open engineering challenges 
in regard to bonding strength, contact resistivities, as well as thermal and 
chemical stability. In this regard, in particular the connection of the interface 
material with the thermoelectric conversion material is important as it 
directly affects the electrical and thermal resistivities of the module, hence 
the transport of heat and electricity, and consequently the conversion 
efficiency. The challenges of the key interfaces in thermoelectric modules, 
and the connections between the interface requirements and the design 
principles are schematically shown in Figure 7.6. The problem of the 
interfaces in thermoelectric power-generation modules has been thoroughly 
discussed in recent articles (Liu et al. 2015; Liu and Bai 2019).

in thermoelectric modules, and the connections between the  
interface requirements and the design principles 
The development of thermoelectric modules has been stimulated in recent 
years by the requirements for sustainable technological development, the 
needs for an alternative supply of power in future advanced technologies and 
also significant progress in the development of new thermoelectric materials 
based on elements that are abundantly available in nature, cheap and 
environmentally 
friendly, 
with 
enhanced 
thermoelectric 
properties. 
Accordingly, the development of thermoelectric devices also greatly 
expanded the recovery of waste heat in industries and transport into 
electricity, and to the scavenging of low-power environmental heat sources 
and human body heat into electricity for powering sensors, wireless-sensor 
technologies and IoT, microelectronics, wearable electronics, medical 
devices, etc. A roadmap for the exploitation of thermoelectric technology 
has recently been proposed (Freer and Powell 2020).  
The applications of thermoelectric devices in power generation are still 
mostly limited to the generation of electricity in extreme environments with 
RTGs for space exploration and TEGs for industrial applications in remote 
areas (Champier 2017; Zoui et al. 2020). However, in recent years, a number 
of thermoelectric modules for low- (<250°C), mid- (250–650°C) and  
high-temperature (>650°C) ranges, based on novel thermoelectric materials 

196     Thermoelectric Micro/Nano Generators 2 
(i.e. skutterudites, half-Heusler alloys, silicon-based alloys, Mg-silicide, 
tetrahedrites, calcium/manganese oxides, organics) have been developed and 
some are already available or will be soon on the market (Aswal et al. 2016; 
Champier 2017). Depending on the module, their efficiencies are between 1 
and 8.5%, and in the case of segmental modules, the reported experimental 
efficiency is as high as 15% (Aswal et al. 2016). Their maximum operating 
temperatures are, depending on the module, between 300°C and 800°C, and 
at temperature differences in the range from 300 to 750 K, their produced 
power ranges from about 3 W to 25 W. As an example, TECTEG MFR 
calcium/magnesium oxide modules CMO-32-62S with an upper temperature 
limit at 850°C can produce up to 12.3W in a temperature gradient of 750K. 
At a size of 64.5mm × 64.5mm × 8.6mm, they contain 32 couples, and their 
price in 2015 was $360. The same producer also put on the market, for a 
price 
of 
$560, 
the 
first 
segmented 
thermoelectric 
modules 
of 
calcium/manganese oxide bonded with Bi2Te3 on the cold side. Their size is 
the same as the CMO-32-62S and can produce 11 W at an applied  
gradient of 435°C (assuming a 45°C cold-side temperature). Also, the 
skutterudite-based TEG25 made by the Shanghai Institute of Ceramics can 
produce up to 25W at a temperature gradient of 510 K (cold-side temperature 
65°C). The dimensions of the module are 50mm × 50mm × 10 mm, and it 
contains 32 couples of 5 mm × 5 mm × 8 mm (Champier 2017).  
Micro-energy harvesting with thermoelectric modules for the electric 
power supply of low-power devices such as sensors, micro-electronics, 
biomedical devices, etc., would enable their autonomy and facilitate the 
spread of applications for many advanced technologies with a strong impact 
on the quality of life, including the concept of the IoT (Akinaga 2020). 
Exploiting environmental heat sources certainly represents a great challenge 
as the energy density of these sources is very low, somewhere between 1 and 
1,000 μW/cm2 (or μW/cm3) and the temperature gradients on the module are 
mostly much below 50K and are often only a few degrees (Zabek and Morini 
2019). In the case of the human body, the amount of heat varies from about 
27°C to 35°C, depending on body’s activity, the location on the body and the 
environmental conditions, while the average temperature difference between 
the body and the ambient air is around 13°C (Kumar et al. 2019; Jaziri et al. 
2020). It might seem trivial, but maintaining a temperature gradient in such 
operating conditions, especially at temperatures around room temperature, is 
very demanding and among the key issues for the efficiency of μTEGs. In 
recent years, numerous thermoelectric devices for micro-energy harvesting 
have been developed at the prototype stage and presented in articles with 
their parameters relating to structure (vertical, lateral or hybrid), material, 

The Current State of Thermoelectric Technologies     197 
performance, etc. (Yan et al. 2018; Jaziri et al. 2020). In the thermoelectric 
harvesting of body heat for the electricity supply to wearable electronics and 
for biomedical applications, flexible thermoelectric modules are often 
desired and have been developed (Rojas et al. 2017; Kumar et al. 2019; 
Jaziri et al. 2020; Nozariasbmarz et al. 2020b; Fernández-Yáñez et al. 2021). 
In comparison to traditional thermoelectric modules, these micro-devices 
have the advantages of small size, light weight, low cost and high voltage 
factor, which are characteristics desired in the fields of sensor technologies, 
consumer electronics, biomedical engineering and the IoT. However, they 
are still predominantly based on Bi2Te3, although other novel materials are 
increasingly being used. It is also important for their development and for 
their compatibility with the planar technology of integrated circuits and 
electronics that they can be fabricated using technologies that are already 
well established in the industry of advanced electronics and electronic 
devices, including thin-film deposition methods (i.e. PVD, CVD, PLD, 
magnetron sputtering, flash evaporation, electro-chemical deposition),  
thick-film printing methods (i.e. screen printing, 3D printing) and in the 
technologies of MEMS, CMOS and CMOS-MEMS (Orrill and LeBlanc 
2017; Yan et al. 2018; Jaziri et al. 2020).  
It is difficult to compare the performance of the reported μTEGs due to 
the lack of standard measurements; however, their output power is for now 
typically somewhere in the range from μW to mW. For instance, the power 
requirements of sensors for measurement are in the range from about 3 μW 
(i.e. humidity sensor) to about 2 mW, and in standby mode from about  
0.25 μW to about 17 μW. In the case of wireless sensors and wireless-sensor 
networks 
(WSNs), 
the 
requirements 
of 
power 
consumption 
for 
transmit/receive are from about 40 to 400 mW (Tang et al. 2018). In medical 
applications, the power requirements for common implantable devices (i.e. 
cardia pacemaker, drug pump, glucose monitor, etc.) are in the range from 
about 20 μW to about 10 mW (Kumar et al. 2019). Accordingly, μTEGs are 
still somewhat on the short in terms of generated output power for most of 
the intended applications. The low output power, which cannot meet the 
requirements for most WSNs, is a major drawback for the widespread use of 
μTEGs in the IoT. The main reasons for the low output power are the low 
ZT of the thermoelectric material, too high contact resistances within the 
thermoelectric 
modules 
(in 
particular 
between 
the 
thermoelectric 
semiconductor and the metal of the interface and the electrode) and the low 
thermal resistance of the module from the hot side to the cold side. These are 
also the main challenges that will have to be overcome to improve the 

198     Thermoelectric Micro/Nano Generators 2 
performance of thermoelectric micro-harvesting devices to meet the 
requirements of applications. 
7.4. Summary 
Thermoelectric 
materials 
and 
devices 
have 
undergone 
intense 
development and tremendous progress over previous decades, as the 
successful implementation of thermoelectric technologies would also enable 
the successful application of many advanced technologies on a large scale, 
including efficient cooling for special requirements, harvesting waste heat 
into electricity and the energy autonomy of various systems for the IoT, to 
list just some of the options. The future is in electricity, but about 60% of all 
primary energy in the world is being wasted as heat; converting only a 
fraction of this heat into electricity would be a huge benefit. Thermoelectric 
technology is the only one that can convert heat into electricity directly, 
regardless of the power of source, without moving parts, without the need 
for maintenance and without environmentally hazardous side products. The 
reliability of thermoelectric technology is confirmed by the decades of stable 
operation of radioisotope thermoelectric generators (RTGs) as power sources 
on space missions and in the industrial applications of thermoelectric 
generators (TEGs) in remote areas.  
Today, we have many novel n- and p-type thermoelectric materials based 
on abundantly available, cheap and environmentally friendly elements, 
which have excellent thermoelectric properties at higher temperatures with 
ZT values of around 1 and up to 2, and some even higher. It is important that 
some of them, such as skutterudites and chalcogenides (sulfides, selenides, 
tetrahedrites), are already available in larger quantities as they can be 
produced by processes which allow for reproducible qualities and an easy 
scaling up of the production process. Based on these novel materials, various 
thermoelectric devices have been developed in recent years at a technology 
readiness level (TRL) 3 to 5 (i.e. the laboratory prototype stage) such as 
thermoelectric modules for the recovery of the waste heat into electricity and 
also rigid and flexible modules with different structures (vertical or standard 
p-type, lateral and hybrid) for the micro-energy harvesting of electricity 
based on the small environmental temperature differences as well as human 
body heat. It is certainly an advantage that these thermoelectric modules are 
developed and fabricated using advanced technologies which are already 
well established in the industry of electronics and electronics devices, 

The Current State of Thermoelectric Technologies     199 
including thin- and thick-film deposition methods, and the technologies of 
MEMS, CMOS and CMOS-MEMS.  
Nevertheless, despite significant progress in thermoelectric materials and 
devices, the main limitations for the wider use and commercialization of 
thermoelectric technologies are the still too low conversion efficiency and 
high manufacturing costs. Hence, the further development of thermoelectric 
materials is essential to ensure the supply in sufficient amounts of  
high-quality thermoelectric materials with high ZT values across a broad 
temperature range and for an appropriate (i.e. low) price. Certainly, 
thermoelectric materials with high conversion efficiency at temperatures 
below 300°C would be needed, where the most commercial applications are 
envisaged. Also, the efficiency of thermoelectric modules will have to be 
improved significantly and their manufacturing costs must be reduced. This 
requires the use of low-cost thermoelectric materials with high ZT values, 
which are also thermoelectrically compatible, the optimization of all 
materials assembled in the module with regard to their thermo-electrical, 
thermo-chemical and thermo-mechanical compatibility, and also the further 
enhancement of their fabrication technology, all with the scope to minimize 
the resistivities of the interfaces in the module that are the main reason for 
the low efficiency, and to improve the long-term stability of the modules. In 
doing so, the use of modeling can be a powerful tool for optimizing the 
development of modules with greater efficiency and lower cost. 
Thermoelectric technologies are essential for numerous low-power 
applications, such as wearable electronics, autonomous sensors for 
environment monitoring, devices for medical monitoring, diagnostics and 
treatment, and the IoT. They can contribute to energy efficiency through 
waste-heat recovery into electricity and enable the supply of power in remote 
areas. Thus, thermoelectric technologies support and enable environmentally 
friendly and sustainable development for a better quality of life. It is difficult 
to imagine a future without the benefits that thermoelectric technologies 
could bring. So, can we afford not to invest in the further development of 
thermoelectric technologies?

8.1. Introduction 
Among thermoelectric materials, the group of transition metal silicides is 
neither the most studied nor the most performing. Nevertheless, in the last 
decade, they have been attracting for researchers from both academic and 
industry as they possess many interesting fundamental features and 
advantages which we will develop in the upcoming chapter. So far, the most 
commonly studied transition metals silicide materials (ex: CrSi2,  
β-FeSi2, MnSiγ with γ ~ 1.74) have been chosen for their potential as bulk 
materials since such compounds are not made of critical metals, are low cost,

214     Thermoelectric Micro/Nano Generators 2 
environmentally friendly, suitable materials for mid-range temperature 
applications, and for some of them, possess a relatively high average figure 
of merit zT over a large temperature range. Despite those advantages, there 
is still a need to improve their thermoelectric performances as well as to 
develop new process which would be suitable for the industrial process and 
mass production. In this chapter, we will present recent advances on the 
processing of transition metal silicides for thermoelectricity through  
various techniques, such as magnesiothermic reduction (MR) synthesis, 
mechanical alloying, melting processes and additive manufacturing. The 
above-mentioned techniques not only enables the improvement of 
thermoelectric 
performance 
through 
various 
effects 
such 
as 
nano(meso)structuration or preferential orientation, but can also be 
promising processes for large-scale production of materials, which is an 
essential criterion to determine industrializable candidates for future 
applications. We will also emphasize the importance of a better 
understanding of the crystal structure of these materials and its evolution 
during operating conditions through some examples of advanced structural 
characterization studies of transition metal silicides. Finally, we will shortly 
present recent studies on module/leg development of silicide materials which 
will hopefully pave the way for future applications. 
8.2. Recent progress on the process of thermoelectric transition 
metals silicide 
8.2.1. 
Synthesis 
of 
mesostructured 
silicides 
through 
magnesiothermic reduction 
Owing to its simplicity and low-temperature conditions, MR is a less 
energy-intensive synthesis method with a strong potential for industrial 
scale. Processes of MR consist of the co-reduction of metal oxides by 
magnesium in order to form alloys or intermetallics according to the 
reaction: 
𝐌𝐎𝐱+ 𝐌′𝐎𝐲+ ሺ𝐗+ 𝐲ሻ𝐌𝐠
∆→𝐌𝐌ᇱ+ ሺ𝐱+ 𝐲ሻ𝐌𝐠𝐎 
[8.1] 
This type of reaction has been exploited on an industrial scale (Kroll or 
Ames processes) but very little explored for the synthesis of thermoelectric 
intermetallics, 
since 
it 
has 
many 
advantages 
over 
conventional 
fusion/solidification synthesis methods: it requires oxide precursors 
generally cheaper and more stable in air than their metallic counterpart, 

Processing of Thermoelectric Transition Metal Silicides     215 
lower synthesis temperatures and enables us to obtain submicron powders 
suitable for the densification of mesostructured materials. Recently, this 
method has been applied to synthesize both pure and doped thermoelectric 
silicides – β-FeSi2 and MnSiγ (Le Tonquesse et al. 2019, 2020a). Indeed, 
although these materials are good candidates for large-scale industrialization, 
their synthesis by fusion/solidification is very energy-intensive because of 
their peritectic or peritectoid formations and the improvement of their zT 
necessarily requires a consequent reduction of their high thermal 
conductivities through nano- or mesostructuration. 
The reliable and reproducible synthesis procedure consists of placing 
pelletized oxide precursors with magnesium in a molybdenum crucible in 
order to avoid any reactivity with the reactor. The grain size and 
morphologies of the precursor oxide powders playing an essential role in the 
success of the reaction, it is first necessary to fully optimize the synthesis 
step parameters through reaction mechanism analysis with the help of X-ray 
diffraction study. After this first optimization step, the fast heat treatment 
(less than 24 h including heating ramp, dwell and cooling) performed below 
the decomposition temperature offers the possibility to produce undoped and 
doped compounds with controlled compositions (e.g. V0.04Mn0.96Si1.74 and 
Co0.07Fe0.93Si2) (Le Tonquesse et al. 2019, 2020a). Finally, the obtained 
powders are made of very small (from 20 to 400 nm) and well-crystallized 
particles which are suitable for the shaping of mesostructured spark plasma 
sintered materials with an average grain size of approximately 500 nm. The 
obtained mesostructured compounds were shown to reliably exhibit a 
reduction of the lattice thermal conductivity by up to 20% for MnSi1.74 and  
β-FeSi2 compared to conventionally arc-melted silicides. However, this 
beneficial effect is counterbalanced by a decrease of the power factor. 
Nevertheless, for MnSi1.74, it eventually results in a similar zTmax = 0.4 at 
750 K, while for β-Co0.07Fe0.93Si2, zT is improved with a maximum value 
reaching 0.18 at 773 K in comparison to arc-melted compounds. 
To gain better understanding of the mesostructured effect on the 
thermoelectric properties, advanced structural characterization of these 
silicide materials has been carried out. Indeed, these materials possess a 
complex crystal structure which requires in-depth crystallographic study to 
grasp their structure–properties relationship. In the case of MnSiγ (1.725  
< γ< 1.75), also known as higher manganese silicide (HMS), it crystallizes in 
a Nowotny chimney-ladder structure-type composite composed of two 
tetragonal subsystems of Mn and Si generating an incommensurate 
modulated structure (Miyazaki et al. 2008). This modulated structure can be  

216     Thermoelectric Micro/Nano Generators 2 
described by a modulation vector q = (00γ) and a space group in 3 + 1 
dimensions. It was shown that the γ component of the modulation vector 
corresponds exactly to the overall stoichiometry of the compound. This one 
could be precisely determined by a Rietveld refinement from powder XRD 
diagrams (Figure 8.1). Such X-ray characterization highlights the 
homogeneity of the materials obtained through magnesiothermy synthesis 
which prevents the formation of the MnSi by-product usually found as a 
secondary phase after solidification of the melt. This metallic secondary 
phase grows perpendicularly to the c-axis of MnSiγ and is known to be 
detrimental to the thermoelectric performance of the material, degrading its 
thermopower while increasing its thermal conductivity. Therefore, the 
absence of such secondary phase plays a great role in the remarkable 
decrease of thermal conductivity between MR and arc-melted MnSiγ  
(Le Tonquesse et al. 2020a).

et al. 2016) implemented in the FullProf Suite (Rodriguez-Carvajal 1993). From  
Le Tonquesse et al. (2019) 
As for MnSiγ, the notable effect on the thermal conductivity was 
observed for β-FeSi2 and therefore an in-depth crystal structure study was 
carried out to assess the structure/properties relationship. Contrary to MnSiγ, 
β-FeSi2 does not have a modulated structure but nevertheless possess a 
complex crystal structure due to the presence of stacking faults as reported 
on polycrystalline samples (Yamane et al. 2009) and also observed on thin 
films (Zheng et al. 1992). However, they are rarely considered in the 
literature, whereas they certainly have a non-negligible influence on the 
transport of phonons and therefore on the thermal conductivity of this 
material. To go further, transmission electron microscopy and electron 
diffraction studies were undertaken and confirmed the presence of stacking 
faults (Figure 8.2). This is reflected in the powder pattern by significant 
widening and asymmetry of given peaks which could be modeled using the 
FAULTS software (Casas-Cabanas et al. 2016) based on the DIFFAX 
algorithm (Treacy et al. 1991). In this way, it was possible to determine that 
the probability of the stacking faults was twice higher in the sample 
synthesized by MR compared to the reference samples (arc-melted), 
correlating the observed drop of thermal conductivity in the MR samples.

8.2.2. Synthesis of higher manganese silicide through wet ball 
milling 
As discussed above, when produced with melting methods, MnSiγ always 
contains secondary inclusions of manganese monosilicide MnSi which is 
detrimental for its mechanical and transport properties. In addition, from an 
industrial point of view, synthesis processes with lower-energy consumption 
are often preferred. Therefore, processes such as mechanical alloying has 
been considered as a viable alternative to melting–solidification techniques. 
In recent years, a new process combining wet ball milling and spark plasma 
sintering has been proven as a simple, effective and scalable process to 
synthesize MnSiγ (Nhi Truong et al. 2015). In this study, the ball milling step 
was performed under both wet and dry conditions, the latter used as a 
reference. Indeed, mechanical alloying is usually performed under dry 
conditions, but in the case of HMS, the high amount of energy required for 
its formation leads to the agglomeration of powder. Due to such powder 
agglomeration, the final processed material ends up to be off-stoichiometric 
and the formation of detrimental MnSi secondary phase is observed 
(Miyazaki et al. 2018). The use of a liquid medium has the advantage of 
tackling the agglomeration issue during ball milling as it prevents particle 
welding during collisions. Additionally, it advantageously enables to 
decrease the final particle size. In this study (Nhi Truong et al. 2015),  
n-hexane was used for the convenient removal after ball milling as it has a 
low-boiling point, and also as it does not oxidize the precursor powders. 
Contrary to its dry ball milling counterpart, HMS powder did not contain any 
impurities as proven by the high quality of the X-ray synchrotron 
diffractograms shown in Figure 8.3. Ultimately, the measured transport 
properties of the wet milled sample show a 20% higher Seebeck coefficient 
and a 23% lower electrical resistivity than the dry milled one, over the whole 
measured temperature range. Moreover, the thermal conductivity was 
reduced by up to 30%, leading up to a high value of zT of 0.55 at 850 K for 
an undoped sample of MnSiγ.

8.2.3. Issues of MnSi striations and thermal stability on 
thermoelectric performance of doped higher manganese silicide  
As stated above, one of the major drawbacks of HMS is its thermal 
instability leading to the degradation of properties. This instability is 
explained whether by a temperature-induced change in γ-value for samples 
prepared by magnesiothermy (Le Tonquesse et al. 2020b), or by the 
formation of MnSi secondary phase for samples synthesized through 
melting/solidification processes (Miyazaki et al. 2018). One way to improve 
the properties of HMS is by point defect and microstructure engineering 
through careful optimization of the carrier concentration by elemental 

220     Thermoelectric Micro/Nano Generators 2 
substitution on the Mn or Si sites (Ghodke et al. 2019). Though it is indeed 
possible to play with the charge carrier concentration to achieve better 
thermoelectric properties or, for example, to tune between both p- and  
n-types via doping by Cr and Fe as illustrated by Figure 8.4 (Guo et al. 
2021), in most cases solving the issue of formation of MnSi as a secondary 
phase remains a challenge. 
 
Figure 8.4. Thermoelectric properties of undoped and Cr-doped MnSi1.74 prepared by 
arc melting process followed by spark plasma sintering. From Guo et al. (2021) 
Hopefully, recent work on cobalt- (Nagai et al. 2019) or vanadium-doped 
HMS (Miyazaki et al. 2017) has reignited interest in solidification technics 
for the production of MnSiγ as it was demonstrated that, by a melt growth 
method a 3–4% substitution of Co or a 2% substitution of vanadium for 
manganese was efficient to dissipate MnSi precipitation. Indeed, as seen in 
Figure 8.5, X-ray diffraction patterns of the selected area of Mn0.98V0.02Si1.74 
melt-grown ingot show no traces of MnSi precipitation. To the exception of 
the top side of the ingot where accumulated silicon can be found, the 

Processing of Thermoelectric Transition Metal Silicides     221 
remaining parts of the sample appear to be highly homogenous. These 
observations motivated further studies on HMS synthesis with different 
melting/solidification techniques. 
 
Figure 8.5. Image and X-ray diffraction patterns of V-doped HMS sample  
prepared by a melt growth method (source: original results) 
Other dopants were thus considered to look for similar suppression of 
MnSi precipitation within the material. The highest figure of merit, zT = 1.04 
at 900 K, for an HMS compound has been previously observed on  
Re-substituted Mn (6%) prepared by the liquid quenching technique 
(Yamamoto et al. 2016). Re-doped samples were thus an obvious choice to 
be further analyzed, and subsequent synchrotron X-ray diffraction analyses 
were carried out on powder samples obtained by grinding melted and rapidly 
quenched supersaturated Re-doped HMS (Ghodke et al. 2019). In this  
study, Le Bail’s analyses were performed with the (3+1)-dimensional 
incommensurate super space group approach using JANA2006 software  
(Petříček et al. 2014) on both Re-free and Re-doped samples heated up to 
300, 573 and 873 K. Results of these Le Bail refinements show a phase 
separation at high temperature for the Re-free HMS with a small amount of 
MnSi precipitation directly related to the change of the refined modulation 
vector component γ (i.e. compound stoichiometry). On the contrary, the  
Re-substituted HMS does not possess such a phase separation which would 
lead to degradation of thermoelectric performance. Consequently, and as 

222     Thermoelectric Micro/Nano Generators 2 
expected, its absence leads to less significant degradation of the Re-doped 
HMS transport properties, in a similar way to V-doped samples. 
 
Figure 8.6. Refined component of the modulation vector γ versus  
annealing conditions for HMS synthesized with different techniques.  
From Le Tonquesse et al. (2020b) 
Other studies performed by X-ray powder diffraction at the laboratory 
scale or by synchrotron radiation have also demonstrated the importance of 
monitoring the temperature dependence of the modulation vector component 
γ, whether depending on the sample composition or its thermal history. It 
was first exemplified by Kikuchi et al. (2014) through in situ XRD up to 
1,173 K where the γ ratio was found to decrease above 773 K owing to the 
temperature dependence of the cSi parameter and discussed as a possible 
cause for mechanical failure of some HMS material at high temperature. 
Further characterization performed by synchrotron X-ray powder diffraction 
with different nominal compositions and thermal history demonstrated that 
regardless of these parameters, all the samples will have a similar γ ∼ 1.736 
after an appropriate annealing time, as illustrated in Figure 8.6  

Processing of Thermoelectric Transition Metal Silicides     223 
(Le Tonquesse et al. 2020b). This evolution of γ depending on the thermal 
history of the material is therefore an important parameter to take into 
account before implementing this material into thermoelectric modules. In 
particular, deep structural characterization must be considered beforehand to 
ensure that the material has reached equilibrium, meaning here a stable γ. 
Aside of potential mechanical failure, the efficiency of the material is also at 
stake as it was observed in the latter study that the evolution of γ with time 
was followed by a power factor drop (-19%) only partially compensated by a 
decrease in thermal conductivity, resulting in an overall decrease of zT 
around -12% for zTmax after prolongated annealing (Le Tonquesse et al. 
2020b). 
8.2.4. 
Upscaling 
processes, 
the 
examples 
of 
additive 
manufacturing and RGS process 
In the previous parts of this chapter, we have discussed several scalable 
techniques to synthesize silicide materials as well as the importance of 
carefully investigating their structural properties to obtain equilibrium 
materials with stable performances. Nevertheless, most of these techniques 
require a final sintering process to obtain dense materials. This is usually 
achieved through hot pressing or spark plasma sintering. Though these 
techniques are efficient and reproducible when producing materials at a lab 
scale, they are not always suitable to fabricate complex shape pieces or for  
large-scale production. Here, we will introduce recent works addressing 
these issues. 
For example, recently, a company based in the Netherlands, RGS 
Development, has developed a synthesized way to produce silicide materials 
for thermoelectricity using their RGS (ribbon growth on substrate) technique 
(Pichon et al. 2020). With this solidification technique, initially developed 
for the production of photovoltaic materials (Lange et al. 1990; Hahn et al. 
2004), the silicide materials are directly synthesized by solidification from 
the melt. A flat mold moving under a reservoir containing the liquid melt is 
used to produce sheets of silicide detachable from the mold upon cooling. 
This unique technique has an intermediate solidification velocity between 
the slow ones implying large batches (floating zones, Bridgman, etc.) and 
the fastest ones such as spin-casting, which allows to produce materials with 
unique structural and physical properties. This technique is also of great 
interest for industrial upscaling as it produces large quantities of 
thermoelectric legs with controlled dimensions in one step. 

224     Thermoelectric Micro/Nano Generators 2 
Despite its interesting features and advantages, as a non-equilibrium 
solidification technique, it shares the same above-described issues with other 
melting/solidification techniques. Indeed, most of the RGS-produced HMS 
were found to exhibit a temperature-dependent modulation vector 
component γ resulting in structural and electrical instability. As discussed 
before, such temperature-dependent evolution of the modulation vector 
component leads to MnSi precipitation in the materials and consecutively to 
a reduction of the charge carrier concentration and therefore of the electrical 
conductivity. Only for RGS-produced HMS with a 4% substitution of V for 
Mn does the modulation vector component γ remain temperature-independent, 
preventing MnSi precipitation and keeping stable electrical properties at 
least when the materials are kept at a temperature of up to 873 K. Finally, the 
4% V-doped HMS exhibits a zTmax = 0.52 due to its thermal stability as well 
as because of ionized impurity scattering effects which mitigates the 
Seebeck coefficient reduction due to higher charge carrier concentration. 
This state-of-the-art value for HMS material obtained with this upscaled 
process is an interesting topic for future research for large-scale deployment 
of thermoelectric devices, though additional studies will be necessary to 
confirm its structural stability at higher temperature and for longer operating 
time. 
Another potential industrial process which has recently been considered 
for thermoelectric silicide production is additive manufacturing using  
a selective laser sintering (SLS) or melting (SLM) techniques (Thimont  
et al. 2018). These SLS/SLM techniques are promising to produce  
complex-shaped legs with no requirements of machining-step. In this study, 
the feasibility of producing directly HMS legs through SLS/SLM is 
discussed. Starting from a mixture of its elemental constituents, here  
ball-milled manganese and silicon powders, it was demonstrated that it was 
possible to simultaneously obtain a MnSiγ phase and sinter it by additive 
manufacturing. This production method has many advantages, as it requires 
low amount of energy and does not discard materials, which would reduce 
the cost of leg fabrication compared to other means of production. This study 
is an innovative and encouraging step for future industrial applications but 
the method still requires further work to optimize the layer-by-layer process 
using SLS/SLM technique in order to fabricate any kind of leg geometries 
and sizes for various applications.

8.3. Towards contacts and device developments 
So far, lots of efforts have been devoted to the synthesis and process 
development of transition metal silicide materials but the realization of 
functional devices integrating them still remains a challenge. Some key 
limitations to produce devices made of silicide materials are (i) compatible 
thermal expansion coefficients (TEC) between n- and p-type materials, and 
(ii) the realization of good-quality contacts and diffusion barriers. In the  
past, performances of “all-silicide-modules” have already been evaluated 
(Skomedal et al. 2016). In this study, a module made of HMS as p-type and 
Sn-doped Mg2Si as n-type were designed and tested. In order to overcome 
the issue of large TEC differences between both materials, the module was 
designed in a way to integrate spring-loaded contacts on the cold side to 
mitigate the TEC mismatch. Despite achieving a respectable efficiency of up 
to 5%, the module tested above 673 K shows significant and irreversible 
damage due to oxidation and diffusion issues between the materials and the 
metallization. Anyway, this study demonstrated the possibility to achieve a 
decent power output and efficiency with a module made up of low-cost and 
abundant materials but that still needs improvement of oxidation resistance 
and long-term stability of the devices.  
 
Figure 8.7. Linear thermal expansion coefficient versus melting point  
of selected potential contact metals for direct sintering with CrSi2 

226     Thermoelectric Micro/Nano Generators 2 
In that regard, recent work was focused on the realization of metal 
contacts on CrSi2 in order to develop stable and efficient thermoelectric legs 
(Le Tonquesse et al. 2021). Relatively earth-abundant and nontoxic Nb and 
Ti were selected as potential contact materials for their compatible TEC with 
CrSi2 (Figure 8.7). Preliminary high-temperature XRD measurements were 
carried out to carefully assess the CrSi2 TEC. Sandwiched Ti/CrSi2/Ti and 
Nb/CrSi2/Nb legs were then directly synthesized through spark plasma 
sintering. The Nb contacts demonstrated poor adhesion and metallic 
properties, while the Ti contacts were shown to have limited diffusion at the 
interface and good mechanical resistance. Nb contact failure was attributed 
to sample internal stress due to larger TEC mismatch and also to significant 
silicon diffusion into niobium. The Ti/CrSi2/Ti legs exhibited low contact 
resistance and a moderate efficiency, but most importantly, this study 
demonstrated that it was possible to produce good-quality metallic contacts 
on low-cost transition metal silicide materials with stable mechanical and 
chemical properties. This work paves the way to realize more efficient 
transition metals silicide legs towards more complex architectures and more 
elaborate diffusion barriers.

9.1. Introduction 
Thermoelectric conversion is a technology that was discovered in the  
19th century. It consists of two effects; the Seebeck effect, which makes 
electricity from temperature differences, and the Peltier effect, which makes 
temperature differences from electricity. In the mid-19th century, various 
thermoelectric generators were tried. These can be found in documents of 
that time and museums, including a patent from 1870. However, due to its 
low efficiency, it was never widely used. The Peltier effect was not applied 
until the 1950s when a paper was published on BiTe to produce temperatures 
below 0°C. BiTe is still the main and almost the only practical material used 
in thermoelectric applications. The primary purpose of thermoelectric 
conversion today is in cooling and temperature control. Its products are 
commonly named Peltier devices, and it has become an indispensable 
technology in various fields, from consumer to research and industrial 
applications. However, with the growing awareness of energy-saving and

carbon neutrality in recent years, there have been many attempts to recover 
electricity from the waste heat of factories or engines using thermoelectrics. 
It is also attracting attention as an energy-harvesting power source for IoT 
devices, i.e. as a technology to generate power from minute heat flows in the 
environment. 
Figure 9.1 shows the number of patent applications related to 
thermoelectricity in Japan. There was a peak in the 1950s and 1960s when 
Peltier devices were in their beginning stage, and the following rise was 
during the IT bubble period around 2000. The increase after 2010 reflects 
projects targeting power generation applications. Thermoelectric application 
products are niche, but their market and applications are steadily increasing.

9.2. Thermoelectric module 
A thermoelectric module is constructed by connecting p-type and n-type 
thermoelectric elements as in Figure 9.2. The elements are connected 
electrically in series and thermally in parallel. One pair of p and n elements 
is a minimum set, and the performance relies on the number of pairs. The 
conversion efficiency of an element is almost the same if the cross-section 
and length aspect ratio are the same. As is the case with other electronic 
components, the smaller the size, the greater its relative advantage over other 
technologies because of the size effect. 

Application of the Thermoelectrics; Past, Present and Future     231 
 
 
Figure 9.2. Structure of a thermoelectric module 
A heat exchanger is necessary to transfer heat to and from the 
thermoelectric module. It is designed to match the form of target heat and is 
attached to both sides of the module surface. For the best performance, the 
module and heat exchanger must be designed as a single unit. 
This chapter presents several examples of products that use 
thermoelectric conversion. 
9.3. TEC application for refrigerator and cooler 
It is no surprise that refrigerators and air conditioners were the first to use 
TEC, thermoelectric cooling modules to control temperature. RCA 
announced a prototype of a small refrigerator using thermoelectric panels in 
1954. In 1958, KELK developed a prototype of Japan’s first thermoelectric 
refrigerator. In addition, an article in 1959 reported Westinghouse was 
converting its 250,000-unit-per-year compressor refrigerator plant into a 
thermoelectric refrigerator one. 
It is no wonder that people thought this was a miracle technology to 
replace the conventional refrigerator since it has a straightforward structure, 
just inserting thermoelectric cooling panels. 
The KELK’s refrigerator, shown in Figure 9.3, was water-cooled, and the 
thermoelectric cooling panel used in the refrigerator consisted of 42 pairs of 
elements. When the refrigerator was empty, it was able to lower the internal 
temperature to -6°C after two hours at an outdoor air temperature of 20°C 
and to -2°C at 30°C. When the refrigerator was operated with 3 liters of 
water, the internal temperature was lowered to 10°C after two hours at an  
 
 

232     Thermoelectric Micro/Nano Generators 2 
 
outdoor air temperature of 20°C, and to 4°C after five hours. We confirmed 
that it could function as a refrigerator. 
 
Figure 9.3. Prototype of a thermoelectric refrigerator in 1958 
However, it had low efficiency. The power consumption was seven to 
eight times higher than a compressor refrigerator. The performance of the 
element material used in the prototype was lower. Still, even if we had used 
the current best material, the power consumption would have been about 
four to five times higher. Also, although the structure of the thermoelectric 
cooling panel was supposed to be simple and low cost, the manufacturing 
cost was expensive due to the use of rare metals as materials. 
From these failures, people have learned the following features of 
thermoelectricity and developed valuable products: 
1) Design specifications can be easily adjusted by simply determining the 
number of pairs to achieve the required performance, and the efficiency does 
not decrease even if it is made smaller. 
2) Cooling capacity can be easily adjusted by the electric current value. It 
works for both cooling and heating depending on the current direction. 
3) There are no moving parts, so no vibration or noise. 
If you can design a product that takes advantage of the above, it will 
become a product that cannot be realized with other technologies, despite its 
niche.

A good example is a wine cellar. Thermoelectric devices are ideal for 
wines that lose their taste due to vibration. In addition, the ideal temperature 
for wine storage is 14°C, so thermoelectric devices can fully show their 
performance. 
Another example is a noiseless refrigerator for hotels and hospitals. The 
operating noise of compressor refrigerators is a significant problem in hotels 
and hospitals, where the rooms are small and intended only for sleeping. The 
capacity is small for personal use, and just a small performance is enough as 
the only thing needed is to keep the temperature inside.  
Figure 9.4 shows a prototype of an in-vehicle thermoelectric air cooler 
developed by KELK in 1958. However, this prototype did not have the 
performance to cool the entire car or make the driver comfortable. Today, 
car seat air conditioners that can dry and cool the sweaty areas around the 
back and legs are used in high-end cars. Recently, many consumer goods 
with a thermoelectric module for personal comfort have been on the  
market that provide cooling for the back and neck or air-conditioned 
clothing. These successful applications do not require a big cooling capacity. 
The ability to cool a small area in a short period suits the characteristics of 
thermoelectricity, rather than cooling a large volume of air. 
 
 
Figure 9.4. Prototype of a thermoelectric car cooler in 1958 
Overcoming past failures, a large part of the thermoelectric market is for 
consumer products such as refrigerators and coolers, and it has a high growth 
rate. Figure 9.5 shows the thermoelectric market as of 2004 and 2014.

9.4. TEC for electronic components 
Electronic components have become smaller as they have evolved. The 
application for electronic devices that cool a small area is the best 
application that only a TEC, thermoelectric cooling module can provide. 
Localized hot spots appear when operating microelectronic circuits. The 
smaller the device, the greater the heat density, and the more cooling is 
required to prevent degradation of the device. In particular, the 
characteristics of optical devices are affected by temperature fluctuations. 
Therefore, precise temperature control is required for applications that 
demand advanced performance. 
The use of cooling computer CPUs for improving performance is known 
to mechanics. Data centers use air conditioning power equivalent to that of 
the server machines to cool the entire room and remove the heat generated 
mainly by the high-performance CPU, so that the hot spots do not exceed the 
deterioration temperature. If a TEC module can eliminate the hot spots, it 
may be possible to lower the air conditioning energy. 
9.4.1. TEC for optical communication 
In terms of applications in electronic devices, the largest market is for 
cooling lasers used in optical communications. Figure 9.6 shows the 
structure of the TEC-mounted laser package. Two critical technologies are 

Application of the Thermoelectrics; Past, Present and Future     235 
 
needed to implement the worldwide installation of optical communication 
networks and the spread of the Internet. One is DWDM (Wavelength 
Division Multiplexing), a technology that expands the bandwidth by 
transmitting signals of many wavelengths simultaneously through a single 
optical fiber. Another is EDFA (Erbium-Doped Fiber Amplifier), a 
technology that transmits signals for several hundred kilometers or more 
using an optical laser signal amplifier. 
 
Figure 9.6. Structure of TEC-mounted laser component for optical communication 
The wavelength of light emitted from a semiconductor laser varies with 
the temperature. The length of the laser oscillating semiconductor crystal 
expands as the temperature rises, resulting in an increase in the resonant 
distance and an increase in wavelength. Figure 9.7 shows the properties. The 
wavelength varies by 0.3 nm with a temperature change of 1 degree. The 
optical signal degrades in fiber, through attenuation and the dispersion of 
pulses. The effects depend on the wavelength, and there are wavelength 
bands where these degradations are the weakest, which are the most 
favorable for transmission. The optical wavelength band range suitable for 
the DWDM source laser is only about 30 nm, approximately 1,550 nm. If 
there are 100 wavelengths in 30 nm, the wavelength gap is 0.3 nm, so if the 
temperature changes by 1 degree, the signals will overlap. Therefore, it is 
necessary to control the temperature of the source laser for DWDM in the 
order of 0.1 degrees using a TEC module.  
The pump laser used in EDFA does not require precise temperature 
control. But its laser power is more than 10 times greater than that of the 
source laser. The temperature of the laser cannot be maintained low enough 
unless it is actively cooled so that the device will not deteriorate. Figure 9.8 
shows an example of the correlation between temperature and the lifetime of 
a semiconductor laser. If the temperature rises by 20 degrees, the lifetime 
drops to 1/10. For this reason, the temperature of the laser is usually 
controlled between 25 and 35°C.

9.4.2. Multi-stage TEC for optical sensors 
A single-stage thermoelectric cooling module has a maximum 
temperature difference of 65–75°C when the hot side temperature is 27℃. A 
multi-stage module can produce a larger temperature difference by stacking 
these modules and lowering the temperature in each stage. For example, the 
maximum temperature difference of a four-stage module is 127 degrees and 
that of a five-stage module is 140 degrees. Cold-side temperature is -100°C 
for four stage and -113°C for five stage. These are conditions with no 
thermal load. They usually have a thermal load of several tens to several 
hundred mW, and the cold side temperature is 10 degrees higher. 
Figure 9.9 shows the status of the five-stage module during operation. 
The heat absorption of each stage is equal to the heat absorption of its upper 
stage plus the power consumption. Therefore, the lower the stage, the more 

Application of the Thermoelectrics; Past, Present and Future     237 
 
heat absorption, and the lower the stage, the more the number of element 
pairs. Also, during operation, the COP of the multi-stage module is 
extremely low. The multi-stage module sacrifices this because its function is 
to produce a high ΔT. 
 
Figure 9.9. Status of the five-stage module during operation under no heat load 
Infrared sensors and high-performance optical sensors are the 
applications using the multi-stage module. The following is a description of 
these applications. 
An infrared sensor detects light in the infrared region. It is used for 
security monitoring equipment and thermal imaging cameras. Quantum 
infrared sensors have high sensitivity and excellent response time, but high 
sensor temperature lowers the S/N ratio and causes problems in signal 
detection. Therefore, it needs to be cooled with some method. Figure 9.10 
shows the relationship between the temperature and spectral response 
characteristics of a PbSe infrared sensor. By cooling the sensor from 25°C to 
-20°C, the sensitivity becomes four times higher.  
High-sensitivity, long-exposure image sensors for low-light applications 
such 
as 
fluorescence 
microscopy, 
astronomical 
observation 
and 
spectroscopic measurement use a thermoelectric cooling module. The dark 
current that reduces the S/N ratio in an image sensor is caused by thermal 
noise, and cooling can reduce it. Figure 9.11 shows an example of the dark 
current characteristics of an image sensor. Cooling reduces the dark current 
exponentially. In the low-temperature range, the dark current is reduced by 
half when the temperature drops by 5°C.

These photosensors are passive elements, and power consumption is 
extremely low. The purpose of localized ultra-low temperatures for only 
small sensors is an ideal application to take advantage of the characteristics 
of multi-stage TEC. Using a thermoelectric module (1) eliminates vibrations 
compared to a mechanical refrigerator and enables high-definition images 
without interfering with a precise observation by a microscope or telescope, 
and (2) enables local cooling of the image sensor without condensation on 
the peripheral equipment. These features of the thermoelectric cooling 
module are helpful in long exposure applications.

9.5. TEC for semiconductor manufacturing 
TEC integrated temperature control systems have been widely applied in 
various semiconductor manufacturing processes. In the semiconductor 
manufacturing process, a precise temperature control of about ±0.1°C near 
room temperature is required, and this is a field where the features of 
thermoelectric cooling modules are advantageous. 
Following Moore’s law, semiconductor products have achieved higher 
performance and lower cost year after year by increasing the integration of 
more circuits of the same size. To achieve narrower circuits on silicon 
wafers, eliminating the fluctuations in the process conditions is essential. 
Therefore, it has become necessary to precisely control the temperature of 
the resist, etching and other chemicals, cleaning chemicals, and even the 
silicon wafer itself. Figures 9.12 and 9.13 show the TEC integrated heat 
exchanger for liquid temperature control and silicon wafer temperature 
control, respectively. 
 
Figure 9.12. A heat exchanger for liquid 
 
Figure 9.13. A wafer cooling plate 

240     Thermoelectric Micro/Nano Generators 2 
 
In the semiconductor manufacturing lab, conventional temperature 
control systems for liquid are oversized. They are installed in utility rooms 
rather than cleanrooms due to the problems of dust emission and vibration 
from moving parts. As shown in Figure 9.14, the thermoelectric temperature 
control system is compact and can be installed near the semiconductor 
manufacturing equipment, and has many advantages: 
 
Figure 9.14. Point-of-use concept by small system with TEC 
1) Temperature control accuracy 
The temperature accuracy of the thermoelectric temperature control 
system is less than ±0.1°C. The manufacturing conditions of around or above 
room temperature are best suited for using a thermoelectric module as it 
controls both cooling and heating by simply switching the current direction. 
In addition, by placing the thermoelectric temperature control system close 
to the manufacturing equipment, feedback control can be made without time 
delays in response to temperature fluctuations, resulting in improved control 
accuracy. 
2) Energy-saving 
Due to its location close to the equipment, there is less heat loss and 
pressure drop in the piping, resulting in energy savings. Also, conventional 
systems use a compressor for cooling and a combined heater, resulting in 
wasted energy, while the thermoelectric temperature control systems save 
energy. 

Application of the Thermoelectrics; Past, Present and Future     241 
 
3) No vibration and dust 
Since there are no moving parts, no dust or vibration can harm the 
process, even if the system is installed near the equipment in a cleanroom. 
4) Compact and space-saving 
The product is compact and can be installed in a dead space inside the 
equipment, reducing the installation area to almost zero. 
5) CFC-free 
The thermoelectrics make it environmentally friendly and CFC-free. 
9.6. TEG application 
So far, the application of TEG, thermoelectric power generation, is 
limited to extraordinary usage. One example is an RTG or radioisotope 
thermoelectric generator, which uses the decay heat of radioactive material 
as a heat source. Another is the anticorrosive protection of pipelines, which 
use gas or oil for fuel. Both applications are used in an extremely remote 
area, far away from the power infrastructure. Therefore, reliability is the 
most important, and the cost is not a big issue.  
In order to use TEG not only for special applications, but also for more 
general use, their cost performance needs to be improved; during the oil 
crisis of the 1970s and 1980s, industry, government and academia actively 
conducted research and development of TEG. However, as the energy cost 
decreased, the activity slowed down, and the practical application was not 
realized. In recent years, the potential of TEG has been attracting renewed 
attention due to the improvement of peripheral technologies such as power 
management technology and low power consumption technology, as well as 
the growing interest in global warming and carbon neutrality. 
Practical application projects of TEG have been successively carried out 
in Japan, the USA and Europe since around 2000. The recovery of industrial 
waste heat was the central issue of the project in Japan, and automobile 
waste heat recovery was the central issue in the USA and Europe. Though it 
is not practical yet, the TEG development project has been developed more 
widely and deeply. Several examples are shown below. 

242     Thermoelectric Micro/Nano Generators 2 
 
TEG can be primarily divided into three categories, as shown in  
Figure 9.15, according to the heat source scale and electric power purpose. 
(1) Energy harvesting applications for sensors, actuators and wireless 
communications that operate with micropower by capturing minute heat 
flows that exist in the environment and converting them into mW class 
electric power. (2) Independent power supply applications that convert the 
heat of few kW such as open fires and stoves into W class electric power for 
local use or charging portable equipment. (3) Waste heat recovery 
application over kW class from industrial waste heat for energy saving. 
There are existing power sources in each category, and thermoelectric power 
generation is considered to replace them with added value. 
 
Figure 9.15. Three categories of TEG 
9.6.1. TEG for energy harvesting (EH) 
With the development of energy-saving technologies in recent years, EH 
is regarded as a technology to monitor machines without a power supply. 
The application best matches the thermoelectric features, “small”.  
The thermoelectric module for EH, which is about 5 mm the size, can 
produce 100 μW only by adding a temperature difference of 2–3 degrees. 
There are many places where this level of temperature difference appears 
temporarily. The machine in operation is where heat flows continuously, and 
enough temperature differences appear. Therefore, thermoelectricity is the 
most promising technology around machines among several EH 
technologies. 

Application of the Thermoelectrics; Past, Present and Future     243 
 
In general, after the period of initial failure, mechanical components enter 
a period of accidental failure and eventually reach the end of their life.  
Time-based maintenance (TBM), which is currently the mainstream method, 
is sufficient to a certain extent for preventive maintenance. Still, it is 
impossible to set an appropriate maintenance period to prevent accidental 
failures that occur randomly for each piece of equipment. Therefore, 
condition-based maintenance (CBM) is becoming increasingly important in 
recent factory management as competition intensifies. In CBM, sensors for 
temperature, pressure, vibration, etc., need to be installed at the monitoring 
location and data needs to be acquired continuously. However, the operation 
of CBM has been limited to large-scale plants such as steel mills due to the 
high cost of sensors, their wiring, data collection/decision systems, operation 
and maintenance.  
The “thermoelectric EH wireless sensor device” shown in Figure 9.16 is 
expected to solve this problem for any machine. Moreover, since it is 
wireless and easy to attach and remove, it is possible and suitable to install 
on the existing machines.  
 
 
                           a) Vibration sensor 
                           b) Bolt type sensor 
Figure 9.16. Examples of TEG EH wireless sensor device 
The transmission interval of the EH wireless sensor device depends on 
the power generation quantity of the micro-TEG. The interval is several 
seconds to several minutes if the power generation is of a few mW to tens of 
μW, which is available in the TEG with a temperature difference of  
30–40 degrees to 7–8 degrees between the machine surface and ambient air. 
Since the voltage of the thermoelectric module is low at such a small 

244     Thermoelectric Micro/Nano Generators 2 
 
temperature difference, a booster circuit is necessary, and its characteristic 
matching with TEG is an essential point of the electric design. 
Since a machine generates stable heat during operation, the heat flux 
through the TEG is also steady, and the power generation quantity is 
constant, even if the ambient changes. Temperature difference on the device 
is kept unchanging, even when the temperature fluctuates almost 10 degrees, 
or suddenly drops due to the rain. The data are transmitted at almost 
consistent intervals.  
Figure 9.17 shows PoC examples of vibration monitoring for a motor 
outside the factory and a construction machine. TEG EH devices’ power-less 
and wireless features are valuable in places where wiring is complicated 
because of moving machines, and where it is difficult to replace batteries 
such as in high places or remote areas. 
 
 
Figure 9.17. PoCs of TEG EH sensors  
9.6.2. TEG for stand-alone power source 
The TEG module works almost permanently as a stand-alone power 
source without any special wiring if there is a heat source. A small amount 
of flame level thermal energy can substitute several to tens of W batteries. 
Not only does it has a value of no wiring and no battery, but it is also 
cheaper than batteries in terms of energy cost. If the flame can produce 
electric power while performing functions such as heating and cooking by 
designing well, the power generation will be a pure added value. The applied 
products like cartridge gas fan heaters, stoves, outdoor goods and so on are 
already commercially available. 

Application of the Thermoelectrics; Past, Present and Future     245 
 
The “stand-alone power unit with TEG” shown in Figure 9.18 is a 
product that assembles a TEG module with a heat receiving plate, a DC–DC 
converter, a fin and a fan. The heat receiving side is heated to about 220°C. 
The fan cools the heat-dissipating side to maintain the temperature 
difference, and a DC output of several W is possible. 
 
Figure 9.18. Stand-alone power unit 
9.6.3. TEG for waste heat recovery 
The industrial field uses more than 1/3 of the primary energy, and the 
waste heat is large in quantity and too good in quality as the temperature is 
high. Energy saving in the industrial field has been pursued from economic 
motivation for efficiency improvement. Still, the recovery of waste heat is 
not done enough. Industrial furnaces, which generate a large amount of 
waste heat, usually operate continuously for 24 hours to prevent heat loss 
due to starting and stopping, with high efficiency. For the power generation 
equipment of waste heat recovery, it is a field with the possibility of high 
operation rate and large power generation. 
Figure 9.19 shows the verification test of a “TEG waste heat recovery 
unit” on the exhaust heat from the afterburner of a carburizing furnace. The 
power output is connected to the electric utility’s distribution system. The 
system was certified as a power generation facility, on authorization from 
METI, for the first time in Japan as a TEG. The heat amount of a general 
carburizing furnace’s afterburner is about several tens of kW. The TEG 
produces several hundred W when the total power conversion rate is a few 
%. Of course, it is a small output, but as the waste heat is scattered, TEG 
seems effective for such an application. 

246     Thermoelectric Micro/Nano Generators 2 
 
 
Figure 9.19. Waste heat recovery from the afterburner of a furnace 
In the heat treatment process, the flame of the carburizing furnace 
afterburner is not constant. There are fluctuations in its thermal quantity. It 
would cause fatigue degradation from thermal stress. In addition, there is 
temperature distribution on the heat receiving plate, and local degradation is 
a risk. Though the life equivalent to 10 years has been confirmed in the TEG 
module specification temperature, the durability for the whole system is a 
problem in actual use. 
Figure 9.20 shows a verification test using radiant heat from a continuous 
casting facility in steel works. The iron and steel industry is a high energy-
consuming industry that occupies about 10% of the energy consumption of 
the whole of Japan. About 1/3 of its energy is unused and wasted as heat. 
Although the steel industry in Japan overwhelms other countries in energy 
efficiency, a huge amount of waste heat is still not used. Since radiant heat is 
not easy to collect as it diffuses from the site, efficient waste heat recovery is 
difficult for the conventional turbine generator.  
On the other hand, the TEG waste heat recovery unit is advantageous in 
layout because it can directly generate electricity by receiving radiation heat 
on the heat receiving plate. In this verification test, 56 units are set in an area 
of 2 m width and 4 m length, and a power generation of 10 kW is realized. 
Even in the steel industry, where energy saving and waste heat recovery are 
completely done, thermoelectric technology could be applied for the small 
amount of wasted heat remaining.

9.7. Conclusion 
Thermoelectric technology has a long history. For TEC applications, it 
has become a niche but indispensable technology that has been industrialized 
and growing for decades. People now understand how to design products 
that capture the features of thermoelectricity. The applications of TEG are 
still in the PoC stage. But if you learn and make good use of the 
characteristics of thermoelectricity, it will be an indispensable technology 
and a steadily growing industry, as is TEC.
