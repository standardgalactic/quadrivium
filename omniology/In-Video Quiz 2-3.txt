Nervous system – Action potentials
1. If the voltage-gated Na+ channel is modiﬁed so it inactivates more rapidly, 
how will the action potential change?
 
A. the depolarization peak will reach a higher voltage
 
B. the depolarization peak will remain the same
 
C. the depolarization peak will reach a lower voltage
2. Would an increase in the number of open K+ channels near the initial 
segment of a neuron affect the size of the stimulus required to initiate an 
action potential?
 
A. yes, the stimulus required would be greater
 
B. yes, the stimulus required would be smaller
C. no
Answer 1: C. the depolarization peak will reach a lower voltage
Answer 2: A. yes, the stimulus required would be greater
