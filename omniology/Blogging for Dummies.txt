Author’s Acknowledgments
Every book is a partnership of author and editor. Susan Pink is the editor 
of this book and a collaborator in others projects as well. She had to read
every page of this thing, and deserves commiseration. I depend on her care-
ful reading, incisive comments, and dog stories. Susan has an uncanny gift for
remaining calm during the most intense deadline crises. I have tried to break
her unearthly serenity, to no result.
Colin Banfield had an unusually difficult job as technical editor of this book,
with its coverage of many blog services and programs. His insights were
invaluable. 
Many thanks to Melody Layne at Wiley Publishing for launching this project
and to Steve Hayes for cultivating its first seeds.
Continued thanks to Mary Corder.
Many thanks to all the copy editors and production experts who pored over
every page of the manuscript — except for page 239, which somehow got
printed in the original Portuguese.

Blogging For Dummies

Introduction
T
hink back to the Internet circa 1994. (Or just watch while I trip down
Memory Lane.) In those heady days, Web pages consisted mostly of per-
sonal collections of favorite links. Not many people recognized it, but the Web
was a revolutionary force of self-expression and global connection. Yahoo!
emerged to catalog all those personal pages and was itself pretty revolution-
ary. More upheavals followed: e-commerce, instant messaging, MP3, Google.
And now, blogging.
Blogging is throwing the Internet forward and backward at the same time.
Forward into a new era of consumer empowerment, and backward to the
grass-roots spirit of the early Web. The popularity and influence of Weblogs
have stolen the spotlight from established media powerhouses. Blogging has
taken back the Web.
One of the most influential online research organizations estimated in mid-
2005 that a new blog was created every 5.8 seconds. Fortunately, there’s no
such thing as missing the boat (or the rocket), so if you haven’t yet created
your first blog, now is the perfect time. Blogging is the perfect antidote to
highly commercialized, blandly consolidated Web sites. You can have a great
site, be part of an amazingly dynamic global community, and, if you play your
cards right, attract a devoted audience.
About This Book
My intent in these pages is to reveal the total world of blogging. That total
world includes the following:
 Understanding exactly what a blog is
 Knowing how to get a blog
 Being aware of the potential pitfalls
 Finding an effective blogging style
 Smoothly joining the blogging community
 Searching for blog content and tracking topics
 Detailing specific blog programs and services
 Trying fancy blogging techniques such as moblogging and podcasting
 Using RSS to be a master blog reader
 Possibly making a few dollars with a blog

Many people, even those who think they know all about blogging, are aston-
ished to learn what a wide-ranging subject it is, laden with possibilities.
New bloggers have innumerable choices. No single book can illuminate all the
blogging programs, Weblog services, and feed aggregators, as well as the
wide assortment of related technologies. In narrowing the choices offered in
this book, my criteria were quality and popularity, with an emphasis (perhaps
surprisingly) on the latter. Most new bloggers get their feet wet in one of the
popular social networks or one of the big-name hosting services. People
follow the advice of friends and acquaintances, so to some extent I follow
along those paths. Naturally, the popular services are usually popular for
good reasons. Regretfully, I could not find space to describe some great
resources, programs, and services that have not yet gained widespread
usage. I left out one blog program that I use and love, because I concluded
that its features would not serve readers enough to justify many pages of
description. But you will find an introduction to blogging at any level, from
the most simple to the brain-teasingly complex, in these chapters.
Conventions Used in This Book
I wanted to include the Basel Convention on hazardous waste minimization in
this book, but my inability to find Basel on a map brought that idea to a dead
end. So, instead, I have settled for the following simple conventions that you
find in these pages:
 When I use an important term for the first time, I italicize it. Of course,
slanty letters aren’t really very helpful, which is why there’s a glossary
at the back of the book.
 Web addresses, also called URLs, look like this: www.typepad.com.
 A few chapters discuss code (HTML, CSS, and PHP) that underlies Web
pages. When I must cite an example of such code, it looks like this:
# ObjectDriver DBI::postgres
# Database <database-name>
# DBUser <database-username>
# DBPassword <database-password>
# DBHost localhost
How to Use This Book
Literacy is required, plus the ability to turn pages.

Blogging For Dummies 

What You’re Not to Read
I forbid you to read trashy novels from the supermarket. And although I’m
less adamant about this, I prefer you stay away from Portuguese limericks.
I’m just trying to protect you.
Nothing in this book will cause you harm (except for the carpet nails attached
to page 129 — good luck with them), but some sections might not scratch
your itch. This isn’t one of those books where, if you skip something, you’ll
never understand the subject. Although there is a very important paragraph
somewhere in the middle of the book . . . I don’t remember which one, unfortu-
nately. Good luck with that, too.
Read contents; the chapter titles map out the subject matter of this book.
Stick to the subjects you need. Parts I, II, and III are progressively more chal-
lenging. Part IV is interesting, with Chapter 13 being the one I would least
advise you to skip. Part V is useful for everyone, but is definitely optional. 
If you intend to read Part VI, I feel so sorry for you. Really; get help.
Foolish Assumptions
First, I assume you appreciate self-indulgent banter and silly asides. Attempted
witticisms do nothing but distract you from the useful stuff in this book, and 
I assume you’re okay with that. If you’re not, talk to my editor. She probably
doesn’t rein me in enough.
Beyond assuming your tolerance of the occasional funny, I do assume a basic
facility with computers, Web browsers, and the Internet. Being a creative act,
blogging requires a lot of clicking and typing. You should be familiar with 
Web forms and their inevitable check boxes and radio buttons. You must
know how to position the mouse cursor in a Web form before typing in it.
Familiarity with e-mail should put you at the right level. If you are shy about
operating a browser or viewing Web pages, you might want to get a begin-
ner’s Internet book under your belt or take some quick tutoring from a friend
before launching into blogging.
That warning delivered, let me say that my mother, with basic Internet experi-
ence and no e-mail, got up and blogging in less than a day and loves it.
How This Book Is Organized
Words. Sentences. Paragraphs. Pages. Chapters. Parts. It’s a thing of beauty.

Introduction

Part I: The What, Where, Why, 
and How of Weblogs
The three chapters in Part I present a bird’s-eye view of the entire blogging
landscape. Here you glean not only what a blog is (it’s amazing how many
people don’t really know, even if they read blogs) but also what elements 
typically go into a blog, from entries to archives, from comments to RSS
feeds. The information in this part summarizes, illuminates, and points you 
to later chapters that explain more completely how it all works.
Also in this part (Chapter 2, specifically), I identify the four types of blog 
services covered in this book and begin to compare them in a way that 
helps you decide which level contains your comfort zone.
It might seem presumptuous to consider blogging a lifestyle, but this part
gladly presumes just that, and outlines the perks and pitfalls of that lifestyle.
You don’t have to be a full-time blogger to gain insight into the blogging 
mindset from Chapter 3.
Part II: Starting a Blog Today
Part II gets right to it, helping the eager first-time blogger find the quickest
path to publishing a blog. Chapter 4 explores MSN Spaces, a social network
that includes an attractive blogging platform. Chapter 5 focuses on another
social network — Yahoo! 360, which provides one of the simplest starting
points for the beginning blogger. Blogger.com, the subject of Chapter 6, is by
some measurements the world’s most popular blogging service and is popu-
lated by many newcomers trying out their first blogs. Chapter 7 details
TypePad, a full-featured blog service subscribed to by many serious bloggers.
Part III: Installing Your Own 
Blog Program
The chapters in Part III are the most challenging of the book, but I don’t
assume any special knowledge. Any ambitious reader can reach an advanced
power-blogging state by taking these chapters one step at a time.
Of the five chapters in this part, Chapter 8 is the most important for any
reader curious about using a self-installed blogging program. The self-installed
programs, which get installed on a server (not on your PC), offer unmatched
power and features, along with a steeper learning curve than the hosted blog
services. Installation is the hardest part, and Chapter 8 covers the principles
encountered when installing any of the big blog programs.

Blogging For Dummies 

Movable Type and WordPress are the two server-installed programs covered
in this book, and each gets a chapter that clarifies how they work after instal-
lation. Then I move on to Radio UserLand, a blog program and service that is
installed on your PC and connects to a server where your blog actually lives.
That setup is unique, and Chapter 11 explains it completely.
Finally, Chapter 12 covers the best of both worlds: power-blogging software
that somebody else installs for you, in specialized Web hosts whose accounts
come equipped with Movable Type or WordPress ready to go.
Part IV: Total Blog Immersion
My hope is that you become profoundly hooked on blogging in Parts I, II, and
III, and then thirst for more information and cooler things to do with your
blog. Part IV explores blog culture, blog revenue, podcasting, photos, video,
music, and — most importantly — syndicated feeds. Ah, the feeds. Please
don’t neglect Chapter 13, the first chapter of this part. Feeds are important
not only because they make it easy for a global audience to read your blog,
but also because fluency with feeds makes it possible for you to follow a
global network of blogs and other news sites. Feeds tie together the two sides
of blogging: creating blogs and consuming blogs.
Podcasting is a hot topic as I prepare this manuscript, and it will no doubt 
be hotter as you read it. Thousands of podcasts exist, but millions of people
don’t know how to get started. Chapter 16 advises you on a handful of ser-
vices that can get you started.
Part V: The Part of Tens
This part carries on the For Dummies tradition by providing selections of
blog search engines and directories as well as blogging resources for your
browsing pleasure. The Part of Tens is always a fun portion of the book to
write and, I hope, fun to read.
Icons Used in This Book
Britney Spears is my icon. I would do anything to see her, meet her, touch 
her . . . I’m sorry, I slipped into a bizarre alternate reality in which I was a 15-
year-old girl with eyeliner. I hope to revisit that reality some day. In the mean-
time, let’s discuss more meaningful cultural artifacts, such as the little
pictures in the margins of this book.
5
Introduction

Tips are particularly useful nuggets of information.
This icon represents paragraphs that embody a fear of being forgotten. They
seem to be crying “Remember me! Remember me!” It’s pathetic.
I don’t use this icon much because, honestly, I don’t know much technical
stuff. When I do think of something technical, I’m hideously proud of myself
and rattle off gibberish tediously. Don’t indulge me when I get like that. 
These paragraphs can safely and beneficially be skipped.
This icon pops up when your computer is about to explode. It doesn’t
happen often — every few chapters, maybe. To prevent computer shards
flying about the room, read the marked paragraph slowly and carefully, and
then drink a cup of prune juice. The efficacy of prune juice in settling down
an explosive computer is unproven, but I’m a great believer in the calming
effects of squished fruit.
Where to Go from Here
Only one in a hundred readers will read this book straight through, cover 
to cover. Oddly, that is the exact percentage of the book-buying public that
spontaneously bursts into flames. Coincidence? If self-immolation isn’t on
your agenda for the next week, take the safe route and skip a chapter here
and there. Your selection of content in these pages will be determined by
your blogging experience level, your ambition, and your curiosity. Beginners
probably should read the first three chapters. Then, to get blogging quickly,
focus on Chapters 4–7. Chapters 8–12 are for aspiring power bloggers with a
hunger for the big, Humvee-type programs. Those chapters could be starting
points for readers with the most experience.
A more theoretical reading plan starts with Chapters 1–3, and then skips to
Chapters 13–17; that body of material packs a lot of understanding without
diving much into the plain mechanics of blogging. And “The Part of Tens,” is
excellent reading while on the phone with an in-law, in the bathroom, or when
sitting in a plane avoiding conversation with your seatmate.

of Weblogs

In this part . . .
M
any people have heard of Weblogs (blogs), but not
many people can say what they are. The three chap-
ters in this part define blogs at length and with crystal-
clear illumination. Peruse these chapters, and you’ll know
more than most teenagers — and that’s really saying
something. Chapter 1 describes exactly what a blog is and
isn’t, and familiarizes you with essential blogging terms
and concepts. Chapter 2 sketches the options available to
you as a future blogger looking for a first home. The
understanding gained from this chapter will serve you
well throughout the book. Chapter 3 is about the blogging
lifestyle. Perhaps you didn’t know there was a blogging
lifestyle. Wait until you start blogging. Specifically, this
chapter deals with the daily rhythms of writing a blog,
self-promotion, and maintaining a tidy blog.
By the end of Part I you will be primed to choose a blog-
ging platform or service and to immerse yourself in the
encompassing pleasure of daily blogging.

C
onsider some amazing measurements. (I’m talking about measurements
of blogging, not the size of Donald Trump’s hair.) According to some
sources, about 70 million Weblogs existed in mid-2005. One respected research
company reported that 6 percent of the U.S. population had created a Weblog
and that 16 percent of the population read blogs. Another study in the
summer of 2005 put the number of blog readers somewhat lower, but discov-
ered something amazing about those people who did read blogs: about two-
thirds of them didn’t know what a blog was.
Ever since the lead-up to the 2004 U.S. presidential election, Weblogs have
been in the news. Many articles reporting on the blog phenomenon take a
stab at defining them, but these halfhearted attempts don’t go far in educat-
ing the masses of people who are a bit puzzled by the whole “blog thing.” Are
blogs 21st-century news outlets? Fund-raising gimmicks? Online diaries? Self-
expression for teenagers? Are they Web sites or something different? Are
bloggers journalists, columnists, or celebrities, or can anyone be a blogger?
Is there money in it? Many people have heard of blogs and even read them
but don’t really know what they are.
As for creating a blog, despite the millions who have already started one, mil-
lions more don’t know where to begin. They hear that it’s easy, but nothing is
easy without a nudge in the right direction. This book provides that produc-
tive push toward the easy answers and also explains more challenging solu-
tions for ambitious readers who want greater control over how their blogs
look and operate. This chapter sets the stage by defining Weblogs and blogging
from every angle, and then touching down on all aspects of the blogosphere,
from new ways to read other people’s blogs to terms you should know (such as
blogosphere, which simply means the universe of blogs and bloggers).

There’s a refreshing piece of news in all this: Kids don’t necessarily know more
than you do about blogs and blogging. The subject is fairly new, even to them.
Many kids do blog, but starting a blog in one of the easy services doesn’t, by
itself, give anyone an overview of the whole scene. So this book — and even
this chapter — might give you enough knowledge to teach the nearest
teenager a thing or two about the Internet.
Let’s get to it.
The Truth about Blogs
With a provocative headline like that, you might expect a scandalous revela-
tion, such as, “Weblogs Slept with American Idol Contestant.” But no, this
section just answers the question: “What the heck is a blog, anyway?”
First and foremost, don’t be confused by my interchangeable use of Weblog
and blog. Blog is simply a contraction of Weblog. However, people who write
blogs are called bloggers — never Webloggers. Blogging is a verb; Weblogging
is the utterance of an ill-informed person. (Also, don’t buy into the clueless
two-word extraction Web log.)
Glad we straightened out those basic terms. Moving on to understanding
what a blog is, the answer is best divided into a technical part (don’t worry,
it’s easy to grasp) and a practical answer. The first illuminates some nuts-and-
bolts facts about blogs; the second reveals how you can use that information.
The technical answer
First of all, a blog is a Web site. Don’t let anybody tell you that Web sites and
Weblogs are different creatures. To be clear, though, a Weblog is a type of Web
site. It follows, then, that all Weblogs are Web sites, but not all Web sites are
Weblogs.
Note that a blog is a Web site, not an entry on that Web site. Some new 
bloggers say, “I wrote five blogs today.” Actually they wrote five entries in
their blog.
So, what distinguishes a Weblog from other sites?
Weblogs have a certain type of software running in the background. This
answer might seem obscure, but that software is the hidden key to blogs. In
fact, blog software is so useful that it has spawned the blogging revolution
with its millions of new sites. So what is this powerhouse that lies behind
blogs, and how does it make blogs different from other sites?
10
Part I: The What, Where, Why, and How of Weblogs 

Here is the crucial power of blogs: They make it easy to frequently add con-
tent to a Web site. Blog programs and ready-to-use blogging services cut out
the laborious and technical traditional process of building a Web site and
adding pages to it. Consider what a site owner needed to do before blogs
were available:
1. To create a single Web page, a site owner had to gain some familiarity
with HTML (hypertext markup language, the underlying code of all Web
sites). The choice was to write out the code by hand (fairly difficult) or
use software that made page-creation a little more intuitive. Design skills
were needed and the software could be expensive. Ready-made tem-
plates eased the pain somewhat, but building a single page the old way
was never as easy as blogging.
2. After creating a single-page, old-style site, the owner had to get it up on
the Web. Usually, this meant using an internet system called FTP (file
transfer protocol), which is somewhat like the My Computer program in
Windows but operates across the space between two computers. (See
Figure 1-1.) Using FTP, the owner could upload newly created or altered
pages to his or her site, which resided on an Internet computer. After the
transfer, the new page became “live” and could be viewed by visitors to
the site.
Figure 1-1:

11
Chapter 1: Understanding Blogging at Last

Note: I use the past tense in the preceding steps, but the fact remains that
most sites today are not blogs, and their owners still go through the old page-
creation and FTP processes to update them. I don’t want to imply that those
methods are obsolete. But I do want to emphasize that the HTML and FTP
system is like lifting weights compared to the ease of blogging, which can be
likened to lying in a hammock. Escaping the arduous manual update system
is one major reason blogging has taken off.
To summarize: Creating a nonblog Web site is hard, and the difficulties dis-
courage frequent updates. Blogging is easy, and blogging software encour-
ages frequent site updates. Creating a blog page doesn’t need to be any
harder than writing and sending an e-mail or posting a message to an online
discussion forum. In fact, these three tasks — blogging, e-mailing, and posting
a message — follow the same basic three steps:
1. Go to a Compose screen.
2. Type something brilliant (or not).
3. Click a Send (or Post) button.
Figure 1-2 illustrates the My Blog Compose Entry screen in Yahoo! 360, one of
the simplest blog services. As easily as sending an e-mail, bloggers add con-
tent to their sites. More than that, the new content is neatly organized within
the Web site, and it contains all the design elements and navigational features
that occur throughout the site. In most cases, the user didn’t have to lift a
finger to create those design features. Beautiful, informative, fun, up-to-date,
personal Web sites are created with no more technical know-how than is
required to chat with the grandkids in e-mail.
The practical answer
The preceding section reveals what blogs are technically: Web sites powered
by certain software that makes it easy to add stuff to the site. A more specific
understanding of that software (how it works and what forms it takes) awaits
in the next section of this chapter. Here in this section, I want to discuss the
practical definition of a Weblog. How do people use a blog? This is where you
find a definition of blogs and blogging that you can talk about with friends or
at a party, without appearing geekish. Of course, if you are a geek, there’s
nothing wrong with appearing so.
12
Part I: The What, Where, Why, and How of Weblogs 

Blogging software encourages frequent updating of the Web site. And fre-
quent, easy updates result in the following typical blog characteristics:
 Fresh content on the site: Many bloggers update their content every
day or several times during the day. Even weekly updates result in a
fresher Web site than most nonblog personal sites.
 Personal content: When given the opportunity to self-publish on a daily
basis, most people reach into their own lives for content. Many blogs are
like personal, public diaries.
 Newsy content: Other bloggers take a less personal approach, keying
their updated content to news items or pages on other sites. These
blogs can still have a personal slant, especially if the blogger offers com-
ments on the news or outside pages. These commentary blogs typically
use lots of links to those other pages so visitors can see the source
material as well as the commentary.

Chapter 1: Understanding Blogging at Last

One aspect of blog software that influences the practical definition of blogs is
that new content is usually dated. (See Figure 1-3.) Every new page created
by the blogger is stamped with the date and time that it’s added, supporting
the idea that Weblogs are online diaries. (The dating feature can be disabled
or altered in some cases, but most people don’t bother.) In fact, many news
stories about Weblogs define them exactly that way, as online diaries or
online journals.
Purely personal blogs usually are online diaries, intended to be read by a few
friends and family. Less personal examples of the blogging genre, such as
those written by journalists, might be called professional diaries. A connec-
tion exists between journaling and journalism. Professional blog journalism
has a personal quality, and personal blog journaling sometimes has a profes-
sional quality.
You might think that blogs are always solo efforts. They usually are, but there
are notable group blogs, such as the famous BoingBoing (www.boing
boing.net) and The Huffington Post (www.huffingtonpost.com).
Teamwork can ease the grind of frequently updating the blog. But blogging
lends itself to individual publication and self-expression. Most blogs are run
by individuals and, to some extent, are about their owners.
Figure 1-3:

14
Part I: The What, Where, Why, and How of Weblogs 

Many types of blogs have been created, with many unimagined types to come.
Following is a list of blog types an active reader can easily find. Weblogs have no
official categories or designations, so I use the following names descriptively:
 Personal diaries: This is probably the most common blog type. Many
individuals start blogs without knowing exactly what they’ll do with
them; the pleasure of self-publishing is enough by itself. Visitors to these
blogs are often greeted with content along the lines of “Here’s what I did
today.” (See Figure 1-4.) Some celebrities reveal themselves in personal
blogs; Rosie O’Donnell has achieved post-TV fame with her idiosyncratic
stream-of-consciousness blog entries (www.rosie.com).
 Professional diaries: These sites are better known than personal diaries,
but scarcer. More and more professionals are choosing to maintain blogs
alongside their actual jobs. These include journalists, who get lots of pub-
licity for softening their objectivity in the more opinionated blog space —
when their publishers allow them to do so. Blogging can turn a journalist
into a columnist, and some newspapers and magazines forbid their writ-
ers doing so. Professionals in other fields blog to the great edification of
wide readerships. John Battelle, a technology expert who helped start
Wired magazine, has a blog at www.battellemedia.com. Alex Ross, the
classical music critic of The New Yorker, keeps a blog called The Rest Is
Noise (www.therestisnoise.com) in which he writes informally about
his concert adventures. Movie producer Peter Jackson kept a detailed
blog diary with film clips during his making of King Kong (www.kongis
king.net). In these and many other cases, the blogs humanize their
writers and offer a glimpse into their professional lives.

Chapter 1: Understanding Blogging at Last

 Institutional blogs: Companies are jumping on the bandwagon with mixed
results. Blogging, though versatile, is a fragile genre of online publication.
Inauthentic voices, or any bogus attempt to be cool, reveal themselves
immediately in the blog format. But many examples are invaluable; one
corporate blog I check all the time is the Yahoo! Search blog (www.
ysearchblog.com), written by the engineers who create the Yahoo!
search engines. Yogurt maker Stonyfield Farm tentatively started with
one corporate blog and now operates four of them (www.stonyfield.
com/weblog), making the corporate site a destination for parents,
women, and kids. Corporate blogs are written sometimes by company
executives (one of the Stonyfield blogs is written by the owner) and
sometimes by employees hired as bloggers.
 Topical blogs: Blogs exist on nearly every subject under the sun, includ-
ing politics, technology, Starbucks (see Figure 1-5), sports teams, music,
cars, and all manner of current events. Topical blogs range from hobby
sites to full-fledged professional ventures supported by advertising.
Political blogs hit the mainstream in 2004, leading up to the American
presidential election. Some of those bloggers, such as Markos Moulitsas
of The Daily Kos (www.dailykos.com), became media stars. Celebrity
has descended also on a few gossip bloggers, notably Ana Marie Cox of
Wonkette (www.wonkette.com). Many topical blogs deal with the day’s
news in a general way, linking to Web articles and commenting on them.
The best and most active of these publications have become alternate
news sources.

Part I: The What, Where, Why, and How of Weblogs 

 MP3 blogs: These musical journals include actual music in the form of
downloadable MP3 songs. In many cases, the recordings are sent to the
blogs by independent musicians hungry for exposure.
 Fiction blogs: Not many blogs are complete fabrications, but I’ve run
across some entertaining examples. One beauty was the fictional blog of
Darth Vader (darthside.blogspot.com), which revealed a previously
unimagined sensitive side of the great dark lord. That blog was discontin-
ued, leaving many mourning readers in its wake, and the author started a
serialized blognovel called Simon of Space (simonofspace.blogspot.
com). Another ongoing literary blog, not exactly fictional but reading like a
novel in daily installments, is the diary of Samuel Pepys. The actual diary
was written and published in the 1600s and is faithfully reproduced as if
Pepys was blogging it now (www.pepysdiary.com). Toymaker Mattel has
durable doll Barbie writing her own blog (see Figure 1-6). Caesar started a
blog (www.sankey.ca/caesar/index.html), but the great Governor of
Gaul let it peter out.
This list doesn’t consider multimedia blog efforts such as podcasts (see
Chapter 16), vlogs (video blogs), audioblogging (see Chapter 17), and blogs
devoted mostly to photos. Written blogs can be anything from sparse link
blogs (many links to outside sources, little commentary) to provocative think
blogs (fewer links, tons of opinion), from occasional hobbies to obsessive
avocations. If you have something original to say, blogging can possibly be
your rare ticket to fame. For most people, it’s a ticket to fun and the satisfac-
tion of self-expression.

Chapter 1: Understanding Blogging at Last

Understanding Blog Mechanics
Now you know that a Weblog is different from other Web sites because of spe-
cialized software running in the background. You know many of the uses of
blogs, from online diaries to amateur news sites, from professional diaries to
fiction. In this section, I talk about how the software works in the back-
ground, and the tools it puts on your screen. I won’t get too technical; the
purpose of this section is to describe the mechanics and terminology of basic
blogging so every reader understands the layout of a typical blog.
The many blog programs and services (see Chapter 2) sport similar features.
At the heart of all blogging, from the ready-to-go platforms requiring no work
on your part to the self-installed monsters described in Part III, is content
management. The phrase sounds corporate and boring and daunting, but it’s
just a concise way of describing how blogging makes updating your site easy.
Content management is the heavy lifting performed by blog software. You
write something; the software puts it on the site in the correct place.
Entries, posts, indexes, and archives
In the context of blogging, content management almost always means orga-
nizing the site by backwards chronology. In this way, your most recent writ-
ing appears first. As visitors continue reading your updates, they work
backwards in time. Each piece of content is called an entry. When you write a
blog, you post entries, and those posted entries are sometimes called posts.
(The word post derives from Internet message boards, where online commu-
nities chat by means of publicly posted messages.) Each posted entry is
stamped with a date and (usually) time. The front page of the blog contains
recent entries, with the most recent at the top. Many blogs are organized with
big daily headers that group each day’s posts.
Blog software makes easy business of posting entries. The interface is usually
similar to the Compose screen you use for e-mail. You write in that screen,
and then click a button marked Post or Post Entry. The software uploads the
entry to the blog, putting it above previous entries on the home page, and
assigning it a date and time stamp. The software also assigns the entry its
own page, so that each entry has a dedicated URL (Web address).
In some instances, bloggers make the software put short entry excerpts on
the home page (called the index page), saving the entire entry for the dedi-
cated page. With that arrangement, readers can skim short bits of many
entries on the index page, clicking through to a dedicated entry page when
they want to read an entire post.
Even in blogs where the entire entry is published on the index page, a dedicated
page is created — that unique URL enables bloggers to promote individual
18
Part I: The What, Where, Why, and How of Weblogs 

entries by sharing links to those entries. Creating a series of dedicated pages
is how the blog software maintains an archive of everything written.
Whew. This little section packs a lot of information, and all of it is important.
Here is a summary of the general process of blogging:
1. The blogger writes a blog entry.
2. The blogger posts the new entry.
3. The blog software uploads the new entry and fits it into the Weblog
chronologically. Part or all of the entry is placed on the blog’s index
page (the home page of the site), and the entire entry is also archived on
its own page with a unique URL.
4. Visitors see the index page first, where they can skim recent entries in
reverse chronological order. They can click through to individual entries
on individual pages.
More about archives
The preceding section explains that blog programs create a unique page for
each entry. The two reasons for this are linkability (when you want to point
to a specific entry) and continuity — the unique pages are an archive of the
entire blog. Archiving is important. You might think that the immediacy of
blogs makes past entries obsolete, but the opposite is true. Blogs represent a
history of a person’s writing.
It can be fascinating to dive into a blog’s past, and most software encourages
visitors to do that by linking to archived posts in a variety of ways:
 On the index page, at least a few days’ worth of entries are presented.
 A “recent entries” column is often displayed on the index page’s sidebar,
listing recent posts that aren’t on the index page.
 Deep archives are often listed by month, by year, or by both, somewhere
on the index page. A calendar format is sometimes used.
Figure 1-7 shows one blog’s archives listed both by category and by date.
Archived entries are particularly useful in professional diaries and topical
blogs, where you might want to research article links and commentary opin-
ion from months or years ago. This brings up a question: If blogging is so
new, how can archives stretch back for years? The fact is, blogging has been
around for many years; it has only recently hit a tipping point of popularity. I
started my first blog in 2002 and considered myself a newbie among experi-
enced hands who had been blogging for a few years already. As you surf from
blog to blog, you’ll encounter some impressive archives.
19
Chapter 1: Understanding Blogging at Last

Common blog elements
Chronological entries and archives would be enough for a basic blog, and
indeed, a few blogs eliminate all other elements from their pages. (See the
Russell Beattie Notebook at www.russellbeattie.com.) Most blogs,
though, incorporate these standard features:
 Author byline: A byline above (or below) each entry is less important if
you’re the blog’s only writer than in group blogs. Still, many blogs carry
that byline as a default setting in the blog software.
 Permalink: Short for “permanent link,” this link takes the visitor from
the index page to the entry’s unique page. Figure 1-8 illustrates a perma-
link below a blog entry.
 Blogroll: The blogroll is not a requirement, but it is a tradition to list the
blogger’s favorite blogs in a sidebar. The blogroll is usually common to
every page of the blog, so visitors can see your favorite blog destina-
tions no matter where they enter your blog. Blogrolls make the blogos-
phere somewhat incestuous, with many topical blogs all linking to each
other. Having one’s blog included in a high-profile blogroll is an honor
and can deliver lots of traffic to a previously little-known blog.

20
Part I: The What, Where, Why, and How of Weblogs 

 Categories: Some blog programs allow the blogger to assign categories
to blog entries. These categories are listed in a sidebar, so that visitors
can restrict their reading to a category of interest. It’s not unusual for
one entry to be tagged in multiple categories.
 Comments: Comments are written by visitors to your blog and are pre-
sented below your entry on that entry’s unique page. On the index page,
a Comments link sends visitors to that unique page, scrolled down to
the first comment (see Figure 1-9). Many blog programs allow the com-
ments function to be turned off, so visitors cannot talk back. Some blog
experts believe that the presence of comments is a defining feature of 
a Weblog. I disagree with this restrictive view; I have operated no-
comment blogs, and I visit some wonderful blog products in which read-
ers can only read, not talk. But it is true that the blogosphere would be
fundamentally altered if there were no comments anywhere. Comments
are a crucial part of what I call the macrologue — far-flung group discus-
sions across many blogs. Chapters 3 and 14 explore the macrologue in
more detail.
 TrackBacks: TrackBacks are related to comments but are trickier to
understand. Chapter 3 makes TrackBacks absolutely clear. For now,
know that TrackBacks offer a way to put a link to your blog entry on
someone else’s blog. TrackBacks link blogs together in the macrologue.

A final element common to most blogs is the syndication link, which can take
several forms and is worthy of a thorough discussion. That discussion occurs
in Chapter 13, which dives into the important topics of RSS (really simple
syndication) and newsreaders. The take-away point for now is that many
people read blogs in newsreaders, not by visiting the blog sites. Newsreaders
pull the content of many blogs into one window. Within a newsreader, each
blog is called a feed. These newsreaders are mostly free and can be stand-
alone programs that you download to your computer or Web-based services
that you visit from any computer.
Making your blog’s content available as a feed is crucial. Fortunately, this
fairly technical method of distributing blog entries is effortlessly handled for
you by nearly all blog software. Using RSS and other syndication formats has
become so simple that this book doesn’t spend any space explaining how to
create syndication links from scratch. (For the technical stuff, see Syndicating
Web Sites with RSS Feeds For Dummies, published by Wiley.)

Part I: The What, Where, Why, and How of Weblogs 

The Design and Appearance of Blogs
Veteran blog readers notice that Weblogs have a characteristic appearance,
beginning with the date headers, which indicate the blog’s chronology. Also,
blog services provide a few templates used by thousands of sites, so many of
those blogs resemble each other. These templates are page designs that
make the site attractive with no work on your part. Without templates, Web
site designers spend hours, days, and weeks creating the content spaces and
navigation sidebars that make up a typical Web page. With prebuilt tem-
plates, you just select a site design and start blogging.
Templates not only define the colors of your pages but sometimes also deter-
mine how your archives are presented, the format of your date and time
stamp, and other details that affect your visitors’ experience. These details
are sometimes configurable, and personalizing them is a worthwhile effort.
The existence of templates doesn’t mean that you can’t tweak, or even com-
pletely reimagine, the design of your blog. Some blog platforms allow total
personalization, but starting from scratch is challenging. Most beginners
(and, really, all those who prefer creating content to creating design) prefer
preconfigured design choices. And because many users of popular blog ser-
vices don’t even bother exploring all the available template choices, the top
designs are commonly used. As a result, most blogs created with Movable
Type (Chapter 9), TypePad (Chapter 7), Blogger.com (Chapter 6), and other
services are instantly recognizable.
If you care about your site looking different from thousands of others, dig
deep into the menu of templates. In many cases, the template can be changed
in midstream; when you do that, every page of your blog is changed over to
the new design.

C
hapter 1 defines Weblogs and illuminates the basic elements of a blog:
entries, the index page, comments, TrackBacks, archives, blogrolls, and
categories. That chapter was all about the question, “What is a blog.” This
chapter asks the question, “Where will you blog?”
I don’t get into evaluating specific blog services and programs in this chap-
ter; those comparisons occur in Parts II and III. This chapter uncovers cate-
gories. You can operate a blog in a multitude of online places, using four main
methods, or platforms. This chapter identifies those platforms and spells out
their strong and weak points. Well, no point beating around the bush; here
they are:
 Social networks
 Blog services
 Self-installed blog software
 Web hosts with preinstalled blog software
Your main choice is whether to host the blog yourself or have a blog company
do it. By “host,” I don’t mean “write.” You’ll be the one writing your blog no
matter where it lives. The hosting decision is about whether you install the
blog software or use a service with the software already running. Most people
choose the latter because it’s easier. Adventurous and technically inclined
people choose the self-installed options because they are more powerful.
By the end of this chapter, every reader should have an idea of which direc-
tion to go. Many people start blogging impulsively, with the first solution they
come across. That’s fine, but a little thought at this stage can set you up for a
more satisfying experience in the long run.

Blogging in Social Networks
Chapter 5 details three social networks that contain blog services. But the
question arises: What is a social network, anyway? That brings up a further
question: Why does the author of this book keep asking questions? Which
leads to a final question: Are we stuck with this guy? Yes. Yes, you are.
Social networks are online community sites that link people together. Some
amount of personal information is usually shared in an effort to present a
profile that other members can get to know. This profile can be nudged along
by questionnaires, or by making it easy to create lists of favorite things, or
just by providing space to type and upload stuff. Various community features
are offered, such as photo sharing, instant messaging, and invitation-only cir-
cles of friends. Figure 2-1 shows my page on Yahoo! 360, covered in Chapter 5.
If you squint, you can see pictures of my dog, the start of one blog entry, my
shared feeds, and a quote that I “blasted” to my friends.
Blogging at these sites fits in with the overall tone of instant chumminess.
Nearly always, blog content in social networking services is personal, like a
diary. You see a lot of chit-chat blogging in these clubs. But the truth is that you
can use any blog space for any purpose whatsoever. It is my informal observa-
tion that serious topical blogging usually occurs in the pure-blog services that
don’t offer all the communal, meet-and-greet features. Pure-blog services fre-
quently offer a more sober, uncluttered, professional presentation of the blog.
Joining a social network is profoundly easy. Usually, you just fill in a Web
form to establish a username and password combination. This registration
form might gather some personal information for your profile or give you a
chance to invite online friends to join you in membership. (See Figure 2-2.)
Fill it in, click a link, and it’s off to blogdom.

Itching to blog
Want to get started quickly? Of course you do.
You’ve got a lot to blog about. Just keep in mind
that with blog services, the quickest start usu-
ally delivers the fewest features. I suggest read-
ing through the following sections to decide
how steep a learning curve you’re willing to
climb.
You can be blogging minutes from now. When
my mother wanted to start a blog, I set her up in
one of friendliest environments because I knew
she didn’t want any hassle. If you’re the same
way, and don’t even want to know about alter-
natives, skip to Chapters 4 and 5. The social net-
working platforms described in those chapters
(MSN Spaces and Yahoo! 360, respectively)
include blogging and blaze a quick path to your
first entry.
If you think a pure-blog service might better
serve your blogging mission, read through this
chapter. These pages survey the social net-
works in a general way, as well as more sophis-
ticated platforms and programs.

Chapter 2: Blogging Options

Taken as a group, social networks are the easiest and the cheapest (often
free) platform on which to blog for the first time. So what’s the issue? Why
not recommend them and be done with it? When will I stop asking questions?
Social networks are primarily about socializing and secondarily about blog-
ging. The blogs included in these services tend to be merely one of many
devices used to connect personally with friends and make new friends. You
can make the blog the centerpiece of your social network presence, but if
you’re more interested in blogging than in sharing photos and chatting, a
pure-blog service might be more appropriate.
To be specific, social networks sometimes lack standard blogging features
found on more serious Weblog platforms, such as entry categories and config-
urable archives. Just these two examples are important enough, if you’re writ-
ing for the ages, to seek outside the social networks. At the time of this writing,
podcasting is out of the question in the social networks. (See Chapter 16 for
more on podcasting.) Owning your own domain (www.my-immortal-blog.
com) is generally not possible. Mobile blogging (called moblogging) might not
be available. You cannot run ads to make a few bucks on a social network page
(although the service might run its own ads on your page).

Part I: The What, Where, Why, and How of Weblogs 
Social networking and blogging for kids
Teens have taken to blogging and social net-
working in a big way. Like many Internet ser-
vices adopted by the youth market, blogging has
come under the gun of concerned parents
decrying the dangers of posting personal infor-
mation online. True; there are risks in revealing
addresses, phone numbers, and even real
names (not fictional screen names) in any
public online environment. But this issue is
hardly new and not unique to blogging. Parents
should administer all aspects of a child’s online
citizenry.
Some social networking services attract huge
numbers of kids. These sites become hangout
spots where kids feel they must be seen. They
put up pages, write blog entries, post photos,
instant message each other, and in other ways
have a fine time frolicking in the Internet play-
ground. Xanga and MySpace.com are two such
destinations. Xanga requires users to be at least
13 years old; in MySpace the age barrier is set
at 16. Young kids routinely and successfully lie
about their ages; that’s one fact of life parents
should know. Kids of all ages should certainly
be counseled about remaining unlocatable in
public online communities. Addresses and
phone numbers should never be posted. Full
names (first and last) should be avoided, espe-
cially if the user’s home town is mentioned.
Many kids upload photos and can be recog-
nized by their friends that way; screen identities
can also be shared privately. Underlying these
details should be a general parental awareness
of social networks, how they work, which ones
are being used, and how they are being used.
Alarmism and panic, though, as you sometimes
read about in newspaper stories, is uncalled for.
Actual harm resulting from online stalking is
exceptionally rare. Harm to a child is always
tragic, but the very few instances resulting from
millions of teen blogs and social networking
pages make it clear that blogging is safer than
walking down the street. It’s probably safer than
eating cafeteria food.

None of these detriments matter to casual bloggers who are in it for the fun of
self-expression in an online community. But they do matter to those who are
more ambitious about presenting content in an organized and undistracted
manner and who might eventually want access to sophisticated features.
It is usually impossible to transfer a blog from a social network to another
platform. So if you start blogging in a social network and later move up to a
full-featured blogging platform, you will most likely lose your old entries.
Blogging and Nothing but Blogging
For the determined blogger, one step up from social networks leads to a blog
service without the cozy community games such as friend lists and member-
only e-mails. In this book, I cover two such services: Blogger.com (Chapter 6)
and TypePad (Chapter 7).
The fanciest of the blog hosts have evolved into fairly powerful and sophisti-
cated vehicles for mounting and maintaining a determined blog. The free 
services tend to be a little stripped-down compared to those that charge a
modest monthly fee. Both Blogger and TypePad have become rampantly pop-
ular. My observation is that Blogger.com has more personal-diary blogs (see
Figure 2-3), and TypePad attracts topical bloggers with a specific agenda 
(see Figure 2-4). But you can find plenty of crossover.

Chapter 2: Blogging Options

Blog hosts provide the specialized blogging software and the server space
that holds your blog entries. You don’t need to bring anything except a desire
to blog and (in some cases) a little money. The Web address (URL) of your
blog usually includes the name of the hosting company, like this: mylife.
bloghost.com. Blogger and TypePad also both offer an option for owners 
of their own domains, such as www.my-blog.com.
The High Road: Self-Installed 
Blogging Programs
Installing sophisticated blog software in your own server space (leased from
a Web hosting company) is the most cost-effective way to get full-throated
blogging power over a long period. This method is also the most challenging
way to start blogging. I don’t mean scratch-your-head challenging, I mean
tear-your-hair-out challenging. Grown-men-weeping sort of challenge. Self-
installation of a blog is like building an SUV.

Part I: The What, Where, Why, and How of Weblogs 

Technical sorts who are accustomed to installing programs across computers
think nothing of setting up blog software. And there is definitely satisfaction
in mastering the hardships and driving that SUV down the blogging highway. 
I created my first blog in Greymatter, which presented a thorny installation
and setup challenge to my feebly technical brain. (Greymatter isn’t used
much anymore.) I poured hours into mastering a basic understand of server
databases and hand-coding design templates (see Figure 2-5). If you do it
once, it will never be so difficult again, even if you switch from one blogging
program to another.
Chapter 8 explains the principles and basic routine of installing blog software
on a server. It doesn’t make sense to document the exact installation process
of the programs covered in this book, because each is similar to the others
but different in the details. So, Chapter 8 sets you up for any installation you
might attempt by explaining how these programs work and what you need to
find out about your Web host. Then the chapters devoted to individual pro-
grams cover a post-installation rundown of features. These chapters also
point you to online installation help.

Chapter 2: Blogging Options

Web Hosts with Blogging
In Chapter 12, I identify Web hosts that offer preinstalled blog programs —
either Movable Type (described in Chapter 9) or WordPress (described in
Chapter 10). Web hosts normally specialize in serving Web sites at registered
domains owned by the Webmasters of those sites. For example, you might
register and purchase the www.sleepyzzzz.com domain, and then build a
Web site located at that URL. A Web host would store the site pages on its
computer and display them to people who visit www.sleepyzzzz.com.
Some Web hosts attract blogging customers by preinstalling powerful blog
programs such as Movable Type and WordPress, so the users don’t have to
wrestle with difficult installations. These packages, paid by the month or
year, represent the most expensive way to blog, but you get a lot for your
money: powerful blog software perfectly installed and ready to use.
A blog program called Radio UserLand is a different and, in this book, unique
type of blogging solution. Described in Chapter 11, Radio UserLand does
require installation by the user, but it’s a desktop installation, not a Web-
server installation. Installing Radio UserLand is on the same technical level as
installing a new instant messaging program, a new browser, or a new produc-
tivity application on your computer. Once installed, you blog by typing entries
into the program, which then uploads them to Radio UserLand’s server and
provides the usual content management functions of blog software.

A couple of notes:
 Storage: This category refers to the amount of server space reserved for
your blog. If you’re paying for your blog service, you can sometimes get
more storage by paying more money. For text-only blogs (no photos,
videos, audio clips, or podcasts), 100 megabytes (the low end) can go a
fairly long way. But start piling in photos — and more videos or audio —
and you’ll hit that ceiling before long.
 Ads for income: Chapter 15 explores the revenue possibilities of blog-
ging. For the most part, those possibilities consist of running ads on
your blog site. You can do this in several ways, from Google’s contextual
ad service to banner-ad brokering.
33
Chapter 2: Blogging Options

 Photos: Most blog services allow the inclusion of a photo in a blog entry,
but some platforms make it surprisingly difficult. Another issue is
whether the service provides photo albums for showcasing your photos
in a special page design. See the individual chapters in Parts II and III for
more information. Also take a look at Chapter 17, which includes a com-
parative chart detailing photo services.
 Traffic reporting: Most Web hosts allow their users to monitor the
number of visitors to the site. Those statistics usually include page-by-
page accounting of visitor hits (visits to that page) and other metrics,
such as the number of unique visitors to the site. Blog traffic measure-
ment can operate the same way and is almost never available in social
network sites. Blog measurement is tricky because many readers are not
visitors but receivers of the blog’s syndication feed (see Chapter 13).
The traffic of those feeds is notoriously difficult to measure, and most
hosts (blog hosts and hybrid hosts) don’t even try.

Living the Blogging Lifestyle
In This Chapter
 Avoiding burnout while staying productive
 Deciding on your blogging style
 Setting a conversational tone with blog comments
 Finally understanding TrackBacks, really
 Looking for yourself in blog search engines
 Promoting your blog
T
o be honest, the title of this chapter notwithstanding, blogging needn’t be
a lifestyle. Casual hobby, fun escape from the offline world, convenient
method of connecting with friends and family — many types of blogging
never threaten to disrupt the basic patterns of daily life.
But something about blogging, like keeping a diary, becomes important and
seems to become alive. Some people know they want to blog seriously even
before they start. Others are surprised by how much they love it as they get
involved. This chapter is about some of the issues that arise in daily, deter-
mined blogging.
Also in this chapter is (I hope) the most detailed, complete, and understand-
able explanation of TrackBacks. TrackBacks are an important part of the
daily blogosphere macrologue (see Chapter 1) and an important part of self-
promotion. TrackBacks are notoriously difficult for newcomers (and even
old-timers) to understand. If you have heard of the term and experience the
white noise it can stimulate in the brain, your dark days are nearly over. This
chapter will set you free.
Read on for a discussion of blog stress and how to avoid it, comments,
TrackBacks, following the ripples of your blog in the blogosphere, and pro-
moting your blog in specialized sites.

The Rhythms of Blogging
Here’s the truth: Blogging is a grind. A joy, to be sure, but difficult to sustain
over the long haul. Creating frequent entries can seem like a chore. Of course,
nobody is putting a gun to your head. At least, I don’t suppose so; if some-
body is putting a gun to your head, you have bigger troubles than deciding
what to write about.
The pressure in blogging is the need to blog often and to keep the blog going
over weeks and months. It’s easy enough to blog often for a short while (usu-
ally at the start), and it’s easy enough to blog infrequently for a long period.
But putting the two together is harder than most people realize when they
are contemplating their first blog. There’s the imaginary gun to your head
again: Nobody can force you to post entries every day or continue your blog
for the rest of your life. But because the definition of a blog is a Web site that
makes it easy for the owner to make frequent updates (see Chapter 1), the
underlying point of most blogs is to write in them often. And to accumulate
an historical archive of those writings. That’s two points. Oh, and to get read-
ers; that’s three. Oh! And to keep those readers. Lots of points, all related in a
way this section makes clear.
Different paces for different cases
Coping with blog stress is a matter of pacing. As with any other endeavor,
diving in too fast at the start invites burnout. The tendency is to believe that
you must keep up whatever pace you start with, which might be ten entries 
a day. That pace would be loads of fun for the first three days, then a bit of
pressure for the next three days. After two weeks you’d wish you had never
picked up this book, and after a month you’d be on a ledge threatening to
jump.
First, switch to decaf if you’re attracted to ledges. Second, you don’t have 
to maintain a manic posting tempo if you went overboard in the first week.
Third, don’t go overboard in the first week. Fourth, spend a bit of time con-
templating what you want to accomplish with your blog and how much 
effort it will take.
“Accomplish?” you might be thinking. “I’m not into accomplishing. I just want
to have an easy Web site and put up pictures of my kids.” Well, there you go.
You’ve contemplated your blog’s purpose and formulated a mission statement.
This particular mission is fairly relaxed and should not inspire dramatic leaps.
36
Part I: The What, Where, Why, and How of Weblogs 

Personal journals are the most easygoing sort of blog. More ambitious are
topical blogs in which the link-and-comment style takes its pacing cues from
daily news. If your topic is Loch Ness monster sightings, you might not have
much to say on a daily basis. But hordes of technology blogs, political blogs,
current events blogs, and many other newsy blogs compete with each other
to stay up to date. Forget up to date; they compete to stay up to the minute.
That’s where the pressure comes in: covering all the news and covering it
without much lag.
Another reason to be speedy with a topical blog goes beyond sheer competi-
tiveness. Several blogs chattering about the same subject, with comments and
links flying back and forth, form a big, multisite conversation on the topic —
what I call the macrologue (see Chapter 1). Participating in the macrologue
requires reading it and writing into it every day, more or less.
The rhythms of readership
The quest for readership, like the quest for topical currency, differs from one
type of blog to another. Here again, personal diaries often don’t have reader-
ship ambitions equal to topical blogs. If you are writing for close friends and
family, you can rely on your audience to check your space from time to time
and delight in the occasional new entry. But if you’re writing for a broader
readership of strangers who also follow other blogs in the same subject area,
leaving holes in your posting schedule might cause your blog to drop off your
audience’s radar. Devoted blog readers like frequently updated content.
As a general rule, if more than one weekday passes with no new entries, the
blog risks losing momentum. If that seems harsh or exaggerated, you might
be underestimating the voracious content appetite of blog addicts.
Fortunately, some exceptions apply:
 Most bloggers dial back on the weekends, which are exempt from the
news cycle. Conversely, casual personal interest bloggers might swing
into high gear on the weekends after slacking during the week.
 Respected blogs have more leeway; their readers are willing to wait for
posts because the content is worthwhile and influential.
 Customs be blasted, you can do whatever you want.
Volume equals traffic
To understand the fickle nature of blog readers, you must understand their
information-soaked lifestyle. The most active blogosphere participants 
37
Chapter 3: Living the Blogging Lifestyle

make a daily (or more frequent) circuit of their favored sources by one of
three means:
 They visit and read blogs.
 They view blog feeds in newsreaders, looking at each feed separately.
(See Chapter 13 for more on feeds and newsreaders, and see Figure 3-1
in this chapter.)
 They use newsreaders that merge their feeds into one big feed that,
when refreshed, shows the most recent posts from all the feeds.
The first option is the most prevalent. Even though feeds are becoming more
popular, and I believe they will eventually be used by nearly everyone who
reads online, most people at the time of this writing have no idea what they
are. The third option, using a specialized newsreader that can merge feeds on
command (such as Rojo), is rare indeed. It is my favorite option, and I dis-
cuss it in Chapter 13.
Figure 3-1:

38
Part I: The What, Where, Why, and How of Weblogs 

The point here is about ebbing and flowing readership. When readers take
the trouble to visit your site, which consumes more time than receiving a
feed of your site in a newsreader, they get discouraged if you haven’t posted
any new entries since their last visit. Naturally, after coming up empty a few
times, they might stop visiting. I don’t mean to imply that quantity is more
important than quality, but a decent blog with few posts will have a smaller
readership than a decent blog with many posts. Volume brings in traffic.
Keeping that traffic requires good quality and a steady pace.
I know this principle — volume encouraging steady readership — is true from
my own experience both as a blogger and as a consumer of blogs. In the
latter case, my daily routine is all about slogging through more content than I
can possibly absorb. I use two main newsreaders, each containing more than
200 feeds divided into more than a dozen folders. One folder contains the
essentials: feeds from blogs and other information sources that I must read
every day. The feeds that make it into the elite group are the ones that I’ve
learned, over time, always deliver fresh content. Those feeds also offer high-
quality content, but the constant flow of entries is essential.
Posting to the rhythm of your readers
Posting at least one entry each weekday is a good benchmark for attracting
and holding a readership. Composing five blog entries per week is a manage-
able minimum for most serious bloggers covering a newsy topic. Many topi-
cal blogs post content more prolifically, and many personal blogs are more
relaxed about it all.
If you do post once or more a day, you might want to consider the rhythm of
blog readership. Many people hit their newsreaders first thing in the morn-
ing, either at home or at work. I like to get some topical content up and live
by 8:00 a.m. eastern standard time. Obviously, this early-morning writing
schedule isn’t practical for everyone, especially those who live in earlier time
zones such as on the West Coast of the United States. Those folks can effec-
tively practice an evening schedule, posting entries that go live after the East
Coast has gone to bed; that writing will enjoy rush-hour readership the next
morning. I like to post at night for European readers, who live five to eight
hours ahead of my time zone.
Spacing can be as important as pacing for those who post a lot. If you write
several entries each day, all composed before you head for work, it can be
advantageous to spread out those entries. If you can’t sit at the computer all
day blogging, you can use a blogging platform that allows post-dating entries.
This feature allows you to write an entry at 8:45 a.m. and set it to appear to
readers at 2:00 in the afternoon or even the next day. When writing a multi-
part daily series, I have sometimes composed the entire thing at one sitting
and then post-dated the entries to appear at the same time for several con-
secutive days. Spreading out your entries encourages readers to keep check-
ing your site or feed, lest they miss your latest gem.
39
Chapter 3: Living the Blogging Lifestyle

Finding a Voice
The Weblog medium is a personal medium. Nearly all bloggers — even pro-
fessional bloggers and corporate bloggers — write with some kind of a per-
sonal voice. Of course, diary-style blogs are all personality; their purpose is
not to deliver news or comment on it. But even newsy blogs are often written
in the first person when delivering commentary (“Greenspan’s predictions
might turn out to be justified, but I think it’s more likely that somebody
spiked his drink.”). Those that maintain a more objective formality (no “I”)
still offer opinion. Blogs are rarely purely journalistic efforts. Even stiff blogs
publish entries that read more like opinion columns than newspaper articles.
So, in the wide range of editorial attitudes from intimate to professionally
opinionated, you must decide what your voice will be. This isn’t a time for
angst; your best bet is to write naturally. Your blog should showcase the real
you. That could mean writing in sentence fragments, stream-of-consciousness
rhapsodies, polished prose, verse, chatspeak, or whatever writing style you’d
use in an e-mail to your best friend. (Figure 3-2 shows Rosie O’Donnell’s idio-
syncratic blog style.)

40
Part I: The What, Where, Why, and How of Weblogs 

If you’re launching a topical blog, your selection of voice is also an editorial
decision. Will you balance your entries toward objective filtering of news or
your personal commentary? Will you link to stories about which you can be
critical? Is unabashed enthusiasm your style? Do you want to project an acer-
bic persona or a gentler voice that readers trust to recommend items of inter-
est around the Web? Serious or funny? Deep or superficial?
One editorial attitude that particularly characterizes blogs is called snark.
Snark can be sarcasm, ill temper, scathing criticism, cynicism, or any combi-
nation of grouchy attributes. Snarky writing is like a badge of honor for many
bloggers, but more than that it represents a certain know-it-all informality of
the genre. An unrelentingly snarky voice can be tiresome, but you should feel
that snark is always available when you feel strongly about something —
especially when you feel strongly critical.
The entire idea of “finding a voice” might not appeal to some readers. It’s a
bit nebulous. If defining a personal style isn’t important to you, it’s not impor-
tant, period. Your blog might develop a distinct tone over time, or you might
start out effortlessly being exactly yourself (not the easiest trick in writing)
and stay that way. Nothing in this section is a requirement.
Using Comments in Your Blog
You might not realize it until you get deeper into your blogging lifestyle, but
bloggers spend an amazing amount of time tracking the influence of their
blogging. That means attempting to locate other blogs citing their work and
figuring out who is talking about them. Blogging isn’t only about writing; it’s
about inducing other people to respond, either on one’s own blog or in
another blog. The macrologue, the big blogging conversation I describe in
Chapter 1, encourages bloggers not only to participate but to hope for an
influential role in that conversation and compete for it.
Let me be clear. It is mostly topical blogs that join the influence race. Their
owners are serious about blogging, and they track their ripples on the blogos-
phere. Casual bloggers — diarists, families blogging together, teens blogging
in social networks, and many other bloggers — don’t bother with techniques
of self-infatuation. Later in the chapter, I cover self-promotion, which is
closely related to self-tracking. It’s all about attracting attention, for those
with a taste for attention.
If your blog accepts comments (most blogs do), the comments you receive
are the most direct indications that people are reading and responding to
your stuff. Tending to your comments — reading them, responding to them
41
Chapter 3: Living the Blogging Lifestyle

as you feel moved to, and clearing out the irrelevant ones — occupies some
time in the blogging lifestyle. The degree to which you’re willing to attend to
your comments can determine the extent to which your blog becomes a con-
versation forum and the style with which you write entries.
To a large degree, comments are solicited by bloggers who write in a conver-
sational style or even directly request comments. The old “What do you
think?” directed to the readership at large is a request (a somewhat desper-
ate invitation, at that) for feedback. Some bloggers run polls and surveys to
get some traffic flowing in the comments section. Well-known bloggers attract
comments simply because people want to talk to them or because a com-
ment that contains a link to the commentor’s blog is a promotional gambit
(see Chapter 14). Figure 3-3 shows the start of a long comment discussion on
the blog of well-known blogger Jeremy Zawodny. Note that Jeremy partici-
pates in the conversation, which contained 19 comments one day after the
entry was posted.

tional forums,

42
Part I: The What, Where, Why, and How of Weblogs 

The degree to which you respond to comments can also set the tone. Bloggers
who quickly answer comments and lead discussions usually get more com-
ments than bloggers who essentially lecture to their audiences and leave com-
ments unanswered. But there should be no judgment of that approach; some
bloggers prefer to let readers talk among themselves. It’s a matter of personal-
ity, really. If you’re a conversational type who enjoys group discussions, you’ll
find a way to encourage participation from your readers. If you are quieter,
your writing style will probably encourage reading but not responding. If com-
ments make you uncomfortable, simply turn them off. (Some blogging ser-
vices do not allow you to disable comments.)
Beyond comments, I want to cover two other, more elaborate, ways that blog-
gers track their influence in the blogosphere: TrackBacks and blog search
engines.
Understanding TrackBacks
TrackBacks offer a unique way for you to know that other bloggers are aware
of your work and are responding to it on their own blogs. The TrackBack is
also one of the trickiest concepts for new bloggers to understand. Heck, even
veteran bloggers haven’t necessarily untangled what a TrackBack is, thanks
to overly technical and indecipherable explanations on the Web. The subject
is a bit loopy (literally, as you’ll see), but I mean to illuminate TrackBacks
with crystal clarity to every reader.
TrackBack basics
The meaning of TrackBacks can be encapsulated a few ways, because they
mean different things to different people. I am listing a few descriptions here
in case they prove useful to remember as you read through this section. If
they don’t juice your brain right now, it’s not a problem. If you read steadily
through the next few pages, you will understand TrackBacks perfectly.
So, TrackBacks are
 A way for two sites, each running a blog, to communicate with each
other
 A form of remote commenting, allowing multiple bloggers to have a con-
versation spread out among their sites
 A way for one blogger to insert a link to his or her blog on another blog
43
Chapter 3: Living the Blogging Lifestyle

Each of the preceding statements is true. You might get the drift, from the
name TrackBack, that something is . . . well, being tracked back, like following
bread crumbs to a starting location. That is exactly right. TrackBacks put
bread crumbs (a link, actually) from a second blog back to a first blog.
At this point, it’s useful to imagine two blogs. Actually, more than two blogs
can participate in a TrackBack conversation, but each single TrackBack
occurs between just two blogs. So, we have Blog A and Blog B. These two
blogs are similar, in that their entries are about the same subjects and their
authors each read the other blog daily. As you examine how TrackBacks work
in this section, you will alternately place yourself in the role of Blogger A and
Blogger B. TrackBacks represent a two-way street, and bloggers who use
them travel in both directions.
In our scenario, Blogger A posts first; Blogger B posts second. Here is what
happens without explaining all the details (details are coming soon):
1. Blogger A posts a really good entry on Blog A. The entry is titled “How
to save the world.”
2. Blogger B reads Blogger A’s post and is impressed. Blogger B wants to
spread the word about Blogger A’s great entry, and at the same time he

The availability of TrackBacks
If you are already blogging, you might be looking
at your software or blog provider while reading
this section, saying “What the heck is he talking
about? I don’t see any option for TrackBacks.”
Perhaps your language is even stronger. Perhaps
instead of “option” you are saying “danged
option.” Curb your temper and let me explain.
TrackBacks were invented by SixApart, one of
the major blog software and hosting providers.
(SixApart operates Movable Type, TypePad, and
LiveJournal, which are all covered in this book.)
TrackBack was introduced in August, 2002.
SixApart intended, and still would prefer, that 
its TrackBack feature become standard equip-
ment in all blog platforms and services.
TrackBack is an open standard and costs no
money to implement. It attains greater useful-
ness as more blogs have it available. But many
blog platforms do not use the feature, and there-
fore many blogs do not display TrackBacks and
cannot track back to other sites.
Currently, none of the social networks covered
in this book (including SixApart’s LiveJournal)
allow TrackBacks; neither does Greymatter and
Blogger.com. Among the platforms covered in
this book, Movable Type, TypePad, WordPress,
and Radio UserLand all include TrackBack as an
option.
Keep in mind that a TrackBack is a communica-
tion between two sites, so both sites must be
empowered with the TrackBack feature for it to
work.

has some thoughts of his own about how to save the world. Blogger B
could leave a comment on Blog A, but instead . . .
3. Blogger B goes to his own blog and writes his commentary as a blog
entry on Blog B. This new entry is called “Does the world need saving?”
Blogger B cites Blogger A’s entry (“How to save the world”) by embed-
ding a link to it in the text of “Does the world need saving?” and also
plants a TrackBack to Blog A. The TrackBack is invisible to Blog B’s 
readers, but . . .
4. A TrackBack listing appears on Blog A, below the “How to save the
world” entry on that entry’s unique page. The TrackBack listing contains
Blogger B’s entry title (“Does the world need saving?”), a snippet from
the posted text of Blogger B’s entry, and a link to that entry.
The TrackBack is complete. (See Figure 3-4.) The two blogs are linked: Blog
A’s readers can follow the TrackBack link to Blog B’s entry (“Does the world
need saving?”), and Blog B’s readers can follow the embedded link to Blog A’s
entry (“How to save the world”) if Blogger B embedded that link (which he
did in the preceding series of steps).
Figure 3-4:

45
Chapter 3: Living the Blogging Lifestyle

TrackBacks are circular and benefit both blogs only if the second blogger
puts in a link to the first blog. The TrackBack planted by Blogger B is not 
visible to readers of Blog B and does not function as a link to Blog A. The
TrackBack listing on Blog A is visible and offers an automatic link to Blog B.
As you can see, the TrackBack mechanism is partly invisible and automated.
When Blogger B plants the TrackBack to Blog A, the two blogs (the software
running the two blog sites) communicate with each other behind the scenes.
It’s as if this conversation was happening:
Blog B: Hey, Blog A! My blogger just planted a TrackBack in me, pointing
to your guy’s entry. Something about saving the world — I don’t know.
These messianic types are too heavy for me.
Blog A: Yeah, I’ve been taking a lot of TrackBacks on this one. All right, let
me have it.
Blog B: Here’s the information, including my entry that my blogger is cou-
pling with the TrackBack. You’ll put the TrackBack in the right place, as
always?
Blog A: What am I, a newcomer? Yeah, it’ll go right under his blather about
saving the world, and I’ll link it back to your entry. What is that, anyway?
The world wouldn’t need saving if everyone watched more cartoons.
Blog B: Don’t ask me; I don’t read this stuff anymore. Just put in the
TrackBack and let me go back to my archives, would you?
Blog A: Not a problem. Oh geez, here come some more. He had to save
the world at 8:00 in the morning.
Blog B: Yeah, well, good luck with that.
Visitors to Blog A see the “How to save the world” post and, below it on the
page, TrackBacks and comments. The page, taken as a whole, is both a state-
ment from the blogger and a discussion among the readers. The blogger
might and might not be posting comments in response to readers. Several
TrackBacks might be listed, each from a different blog. Each TrackBack dis-
plays a line or two of comment, taken from that blog’s entry, and a link to 
the full entry.
Visitors to Blog B see the “Does the world need saving?” post that contains
an embedded link to Blog A’s “How to save the world” post. For some visitors,
Blog B’s citation of Blog A’s entry is their first encounter with Blogger A’s
statement. These visitors, entering the macrologue at Blog B, might think of
Blogger B’s entry (“Does the world need saving?”) as the primary jumping-off
point of their own participation in the big discussion; they might and might
not visit Blog A. They could leave comments on Blog B or return to their own
blogs to write entries inspired by the work of Blogger B. The TrackBacks
associated with those comments (if the bloggers choose to plant TrackBacks)
are placed on Blog B, linking to new entries on Blogs C, D, E, and so on. So the
networked conversation expands into a complex web of discourse.
This is the blogosphere.
46
Part I: The What, Where, Why, and How of Weblogs 

TrackBack specifics
Let’s return to Blogger A and Blogger B, shortly after Blogger A posted his
“How to save the world” entry. We know about the conversation spawned
from that entry, but we haven’t seen exactly how it was accomplished. The
specific actions of the two bloggers are the final pieces of the TrackBack
puzzle that clarify how it works.
In the sidebar titled “The availability of TrackBacks,” I mention that both
bloggers must be using a blog program or blog service that supports the
TrackBack feature. By this I mean each program or service must enable the
display of TrackBacks (that would be Blog A in our example) and the planting
of TrackBacks (that would be Blog B). Blog B takes the step of planting the
TrackBack, which then appears on Blog A; both blogs must be TrackBack-
enabled. Any blog in which you can plant a TrackBack can also display them,
and vice versa; there is no such thing as a blog program or service that can
travel only one direction of the TrackBack street.
Now, here’s what happens with the details filled in:
1. Blogger A posts a remarkable entry called “How to save the world.” 
His blog automatically posts the entry, establishes space below it for
incoming TrackBack listings and comments, and posts a TrackBack 
URL. (A URL is a Web page address.)
47
Chapter 3: Living the Blogging Lifestyle
The tricky task of following 
your own conversations
Between comments and TrackBacks, many blog-
gers become deeply and happily enmeshed in
far-flung blog conversations. Because every blog
is a click or typed URL away from every other
blog, geography doesn’t matter; only shared
interests are important. Involved blogosphere
jockeys can spend as much time commenting
and backtracking as posting original entries. The
problem is keeping notes on it all. Comments are
more ephemeral than TrackBacks. One of the
great values of the TrackBack is that it brings the
conversation (or portions of it) to your blog,
where you can more easily follow it.
When you leave a comment on another blog,
you must remember to visit that entry page
(where the comments are listed below the
entry) again if you are to follow the conversa-
tion. A few blog programs offer RSS feeds for
comments, distinct from the RSS feed that dis-
tributes entries. (See Chapter 13 for a full dis-
cussion of RSS and feeds.) With a comment
feed added to your newsreader (a program that
brings entry streams from many blogs to one
window), you can check for responses to your
comment quite easily, as part of your daily read-
ing. But comment feeds are rare. WordPress,
covered in Chapter 10, offers them. But using
WordPress doesn’t help you; other bloggers
must be using software that offers comment
feeds, and not many do.

2. Blogger B sees Blogger A’s excellent entry and wants to promote it on
his blog, while also commenting on it and notifying Blogger A that he has
done so. Blogger B decides to write an entry on Blog B and plant a
TrackBack.
3. Blogger B copies the TrackBack URL from the entry page on Blog A. He
could jot it down on a piece of paper, but instead he sensibly highlights
it and uses Ctrl+C to copy the address into the Windows clipboard.
4. On Blog B, Blogger B brings up the Compose Entry screen of his blog
program or service. Before writing his entry, Blogger B pastes the
TrackBack URL into a special field (a box into which something can be
typed or pasted) for TrackBack URLs. He uses the Windows keyboard
command Ctrl+V to paste the TrackBack URL.
5. Next, Blogger B writes his entry and titles it “Does the world need
saving?” In this entry, Blogger B embeds a link citation to the “How to
save the world” entry page in Blog A. Blogger B copies and pastes the
page URL in the same way that he did the TrackBack URL. The
TrackBack URL and page URL are different. It is important to realize and
remember this last fact.
6. Blogger B posts the “Does the world need saving?” entry. Immediately
and invisibly, Blog B uses the TrackBack URL to ping (communicate
with) Blog A.
7. Blogger B’s TrackBack is listed on Blog A, below the “How to save the
world” entry. The TrackBack contains a line or two of the “Does the
world need saving?” entry, plus a link to that entry.
Many people are confused by the fact that the TrackBack URL is not the
address of the entry page on Blog A. When that confusion exists, bloggers
attempting to plant a TrackBack make one of two mistakes:
 Using the TrackBack URL as a live link in their entry text
 Using the page URL in the TrackBack field
Oops. The TrackBack URL must be placed in the special TrackBack field, and
the page address (of Blog A) displayed in the browser’s destination bar
should be used for the link inside Blog B’s entry.
Remember, none of this is possible in blogs that do not have the TrackBack
feature. This, too, is a common confusion. New bloggers spend hours trying
to make a TrackBack happen by copying and pasting the TrackBack URL
everywhere they can. TrackBack is a specific software protocol, and if your
blog platform doesn’t use it, you can neither create nor display TrackBacks.
48
Part I: The What, Where, Why, and How of Weblogs 

Obsessing with Blog Search Engines
TrackBacks serve a few purposes. First, they assist the blogosphere’s macro-
logue, or blog-to-blog dialogue. Second, they offer a promotional tool for the
blogger who places a TrackBack link on another blog (it’s Blogger B in the
preceding example who benefits promotionally). Third, they furnish content
to the blog upon which they appear (Blog A in the preceding examples) and
let all visitors know that the blog entry is important and discussion-worthy.
Like ripples on a pond, TrackBacks spread the macrologue outward.
Whether or not they have TrackBacks enabled on their blogs, many bloggers
track their influence on the blogosphere in another way, by checking Weblog
search engines. Did I say checking? I should have said obsessing over — in
some cases, anyway. Bloggers caught up in the quest for influence and repu-
tation spend altogether too much of their time tracking their words in blog-
specific engines. What makes these engines so beguiling is their dedicated
focus on blog entries and their ability to unearth who is talking about whom.
In this regard, blog-specific engines are like giant TrackBack machines, allow-
ing users to find citations to their blog entries.
Generic search engines such as Google and Yahoo! also index blog entries,
which turn up mixed into their search results. In fact, one might argue that
Google and Yahoo! do a better job finding blog content than the blog-specific
engines do. That’s not exactly true, but it is true that the big engines do a

Chapter 3: Living the Blogging Lifestyle
The blight of spam
If you use e-mail, you know about spam, or junk
mail. Actually, spam is more than just unwanted
advertisements for sex-enhancing drugs in your
Inbox. Spam is a broad term for any intrusive
and irrelevant commercial placed anywhere
online. In blogs, spam rears its hideous head
mostly in comments and in TrackBacks.
As with e-mail spam, comment spammers and
TrackBack spammers are amazingly sophisti-
cated. The best and most prolific of them use
automated software that rips through blogs pol-
luting their pages with irrelevant and sometimes
disgusting notices. Fighting spam is a significant
part of any blogger’s lifestyle, if that person’s blog
exists outside a social network. (Social networks
can protect their members from spam to a certain
extent.) The problem reaches desperate propor-
tions at major blogs, where substantial resources
are deployed mounting technology to thwart
spambots — and those solutions almost never
work perfectly. Many high-profile blogs hope-
lessly switch off their comments and TrackBack
fields, which is a loss to the blogosphere.
Extreme pessimists say that TrackBack has
been killed by spam and comments have been
assassinated too. But average folks engaging in
casual, avocational blogging are not nearly as
troubled by what is often a minor and occa-
sional nuisance.

better job organizing and ranking search results, eliminating poor results or
shoving them out of sight. The problem with using Google or Yahoo! to find
blog citations is that blog results are mixed in with all the other Web results,
and there is no way to break them out onto their own results page. Many a
blogger has called for Google or Yahoo! to set up a blog-specific engine that
would benefit from the excellent algorithms and ranking systems that govern
their general search results.
The easiest and most common way to examine one’s own influence in the blo-
gosphere as reflected in a blog search engine is to enter the URL of an entry
page into the engine. It’s a simple process, and here are the steps using the
BlogPulse engine as an example:
1. Bring up an entry page in your blog.
Ideally, this entry should be an important one and perhaps one that has
received some comments.
2. Copy the page URL.
The page URL appears in your browser’s destination bar. Highlight it and
use Ctrl+C.
3. Go to BlogPulse.
The address is www.blogpulse.com. (See Figure 3-5.)
Figure 3-5:
The home
page of
BlogPulse, a

50
Part I: The What, Where, Why, and How of Weblogs 

4. Click once in the keyword box below the Search the Blogosphere
banner.
Clicking once in that box clears it; then it is ready to receive your 
page URL.
5. Paste your page URL in the keyword box.
Use Ctrl+V to paste.
6. Click the Go button.
The most disappointing result of this search is no results. That means that no
other blog has cited your blog entry — at least, no other blog searched by
BlogPulse during the time since you posted the entry. Although most blog
search engines claim lightning-quick search cycles, it doesn’t always seem
that way. Allow a full day since your post before assuming the engine has
crawled the blogosphere. Remember, too, that although bloggers move fast
to stay current, many citations are two, three, or more days behind the post
they are citing. So if your search results are unsatisfying, try again tomorrow.
Next up are a few of the most-used blog search engines. Quality of results
varies hugely from engine to engine and from search to search. For a long
time, Technorati ruled the blog-search business; it still enjoys loyalty, but
many bloggers have become frustrated by chaotic search results and have
moved on. Most blog search engines are portals of blog information that offer
more than just pure search. Poke around BlogPulse for some interesting and
innovative presentations of blogosphere activity. And when you are purely
searching, remember that you can enter plain keywords into the search box;
you don’t have to enter a URL.
Following are four major blog engines:
 Technorati (www.technorati.com): The godfather of blog searching,
Technorati indexes a database of about 16 million blogs, as of this writ-
ing. Older entries are harder to find than newer ones; if an entry no
longer resides on the blog’s index page (because newer entries have
pushed it off), that entry’s status is reduced in Technorati’s index rank-
ing. (Figure 3-6 shows Technorati search results.)
 Feedster (www.feedster.com): With the tagline, “Who’s linking to
whom,” Feedster is perfect for blogosphere addicts. Fast, with extremely
useful results, Feedster enjoys a loyal following. Click Links for a dedi-
cated URL-citation lookup.
 BlogPulse (www.blogpulse.com): BlogPulse is spectacularly imagina-
tive when measuring the blog universe and is worth visiting even if you
are not searching. When you are searching, keep in mind that the index
contains nothing older than six months.
51
Chapter 3: Living the Blogging Lifestyle

 Bloglines (www.bloglines.com): One of the foremost Web-based RSS
newsreaders (see Chapter 13), Bloglines also functions as a major
searching destination. Owning perhaps the deepest archive of any blog
engine, Bloglines never throws anything out. However, it crawls only
blogs whose RSS feeds are subscribed to by at least one Bloglines user.
That means that if a quality blog, read devotedly by many people, does
not happen to have an RSS subscriber using the Bloglines newsreader,
that blog is not crawled or indexed by the Bloglines search engine.
Promoting Your Content
Participating in the blogosphere’s macrologue, by writing comments and
planting TrackBacks, is the most organic way to promote your blog. These
techniques do not promote gratuitously or purely for selfish gain. Instead,
promotion is garnered by virtue of worthy discourse. If you have things of
value to say, people start visiting and subscribing to your feeds. Continued
participation in the blogosphere discussion is important to maintaining a
high profile.

Part I: The What, Where, Why, and How of Weblogs 

You can promote individual blog entries also in more direct ways. As I men-
tion in Chapter 14, flagrantly promoting your entries on other blogs, either
with comments or irrelevant TrackBacks, is inadvisable. Doing so merely
ruins reputations and repels visitors. Don’t put a link to your blog entry in a
comment on somebody else’s blog, unless you’ve written a whopping, bril-
liant comment that justifies citing your own work. Even if you are whopping
and brilliant, the tactic is off-putting.
The next two sections describe sites at which entry-specific promotions are
appropriate.
Digging for traffic
Digg (www.digg.com) is an experiment in collaboratively filtering Web con-
tent. Stop rolling your eyes; I’ll explain. Collaborative filtering is a way of find-
ing high quality through group intelligence. The theory is that mobs are
smart even if the taste and intelligence of individuals vary. Get enough people
to vote Yes or No about something, and the cream rises to the top.
(Unsatisfied election voters disagree, of course.)
Digg invites users to submit Web pages, which get categorized and put on
long lists. Those lists continually have new pages added to them. When sub-
mitting, you can add a short comment or summary of the page. New items
stay on the first page of the list until they get pushed to later pages by the
continual influx of newer items. Once pushed off, an item’s visibility dimin-
ishes. At any time during this marching process, Digg visitors can click
through to the item’s page (or not), and “digg” the item by clicking a special
link. A tally is kept of the number of times the item is “dugg.” After a certain
threshold is reached, that item is moved to Digg’s home page (see Figure 3-7),
where it receives tremendously more visibility. Front-page Digg items gener-
ate tons of traffic to their pages.
Some bloggers submit every single one of their entries to Digg, hoping for 
the one that clicks hard and delivers throngs of visitors. (Remember from
Chapter 1 that each blog entry resides on a separate page with its own 
URL.) Even a modestly dugg item can generate substantial traffic. There is
not a one-to-one correspondence of diggs (votes for the item) and visits to
the item’s page; to the contrary, it is nearly inevitable that the item’s page
receives much more traffic than reflected in the “dugg” number.
Here again, in Digg as on a blog, some discretion is advisable. Digg users can
comment on any submitted item, and if the item is lame by the Digg standard
of cool, the submitter is likely to get flamed. Because everyone’s submissions
are collected onto a single page, it’s quite possible to ruin your reputation by
making trivial submissions that waste time and Digg space. Digg’s purpose is
to showcase the best of the best; it is everyone’s responsibility to focus on
quality whether voting or submitting.
53
Chapter 3: Living the Blogging Lifestyle

Del.icio.us links
Del.icio.us (the URL is del.icio.us) is not only the most difficult-to-type
Web address in history but also a popular social tagging site. Tagging is a way
of organizing many items into categories such that each item can inhabit
many categories. Instead of creating categories like boxes, and dumping
items into those boxes, tagging starts with the item and assigns it several 
(or just one) descriptive tags. Visitors to a tagging site can click any descrip-
tive tag to see all items that have been assigned that tag.
As a voting system, Del.icio.us is not as organized as Digg (described in the
preceding section). But Del.icio.us preceded Digg and has a strong following.
Instead of submitting items (Web pages or blog entries) for group voting, in
del.icio.us, you keep a personal store of favorite pages (actually links to
pages), each of which is tagged. Del.icio.us provides a bookmarklet (a button
for your browser) that lets you save any page you visit with a single click.
Once saved and tagged, a page becomes publicly viewable in the del.icio.us
site. Others might click through to your saved page and save it themselves in
their own del.icio.us cubbyholes. Each saved page displays the number of
times it has been saved by the entire community (see Figure 3-8). As in Digg,
success breeds success; most people are more curious about popular pages
than unpopular pages. The result of a popularly saved page is lots of traffic to
that page.

With no comment system to discourage poor submissions, as in Digg, nothing
stops bloggers from saving their entries — perhaps even all their entries. I
don’t encourage obsessive promotion of this sort, though; you’d end up
spending more time promoting entries than writing them.

his collection of chapters puts you on the fast track to
your new blog. That’s not to say the fast track is the
best track. You must decide if the quick-and-easy services
represented in these pages are right for you, or if the more
elaborate, powerful, and difficult blog programs described
in Part III are in your destiny. 
Chapters 4 and 5 cover two social networks (MSN Spaces
and Yahoo! 360, respectively), which combine blogging
with other community features. Chapter 6 moves on to
Blogger.com, a popular service for first-timers. The blogs
offered there are easy to set up but lack some features
found elsewhere. Chapter 7 examines TypePad, a paid ser-
vice that provides a generous suite of blogging tools.
It makes sense to look at the chapters of Part II before
signing up anywhere. But if you do sign up quickly at one
of these services, the corresponding chapter will help you
make the most of it.

S
ocial networks are fun and communal and easy, and the full-tilt develop-
ment of these sites has improved them tremendously since the old days
of laborious site-building. Personality and sharing are the foundation stones
of social networks. These free services are not exclusively about blogging, or
even primarily about blogging in some cases, but the services covered in this
chapter and the next do include fairly robust blogs. For casual bloggers who
have no interest in speed bumps or learning curves, fairly robust blogs are
plenty robust enough.
Perhaps I’m underselling the blog experience here. MSN Spaces, described in
this chapter, and Yahoo! 360 (Chapter 5), each delivers the basic tools you
need to put up a blog, update it as frequently as you like, show it to your
friends everywhere, syndicate your entries with feeds (see Chapter 13 for
more on feeds), and include photographs. In addition to the blogs, social net-
works encourage sharing details about yourself, your interests, your experi-
ences, and your life. Social networks love lists, and they want you to love
them, too: lists of your favorite music, favorite books, favorite Web sites.
Through lists we shall become a big family; that’s the idea here.
Because of their intense personal quality, social network blogging is all about
you. Of course, you can write an online personal diary on any blog platform,
but social networks tromp on more impersonal services when it comes to
presenting a high-personality site. As a result, most social network bloggers
are casual and informal about blogging — unlike the dead-serious and high-
powered topical bloggers that tend to gather at TypePad, WordPress, Movable
Type, and Radio UserLand. (But as I repeat throughout this book: You can
create any type of blog with any type of blog service. No restrictions.)

In exchange for ease, social networks trade power. Every one of them sacri-
fices some feature that a loyal user of the fancier programs takes for granted.
In this chapter and the next, I touch on four important areas:
 Customization: How easy is it to personalize the social network space
with custom colors, layouts, lists, and other content? How much variety
and distinctiveness are possible?
 Blogging: How complete are the blogging tools? How effortless is it to
write and post an entry?
 Features: What distinguishes one social network from the other, and
from other blogging alternatives? Whether in the blog section or in other
tools, every social network provides features that set it apart.
 Ease: Perhaps most importantly, how simple is it to sign up, launch your
site, and play with your site every day?
These four considerations are brought to two of the most popular blog-
oriented social networks: MSN Spaces and Yahoo! 360.
MSN Spaces Overview
MSN Spaces is Microsoft’s contribution to social networking and blogging.
MSN (which stands for Microsoft Network) contains the company’s extensive
suite of interactive Web sites and its dial-up home Internet service. The home
page of MSN Spaces is located here:
spaces.msn.com
Starting on that page, click the Sign Up button and follow the instructions for
establishing your own space. Figure 4-1 illustrates a newly created space
before it is touched by eager hands ready to customize and post blog entries.
Note the ad at the top; that advertisement (or others like it) is there to stay.
MSN Spaces is free to you; the price you pay is to display ads for Microsoft.
MSN Spaces has an international flavor thanks to Microsoft’s global market-
ing. There’s lots of youth in Spaces, but this is not a kids’ service or a teen
hangout. Spaces is also a colorful service, thanks to the many bold themes
available. (An MSN Spaces theme is a color design.)
After a more-tedious-than-average sign-up process, MSN Spaces becomes
easy to use and extremely gratifying. Some aspects of the service — espe-
cially uploading and displaying pictures — are impressively well designed
and blessedly easy to use.

The best and most innovative features of MSN Spaces kick in for users of the
Internet Explorer (IE) browser, version 6. (Click the Help menu and select
About Internet Explorer to determine which version you have. Upgrading the
browser is free.) Firefox is the browser of choice in this book; nearly all the
screen illustrations show Firefox. In many cases, when reviewing online ser-
vices, I react harshly when the user is pushed into using IE. In this case, I rec-
ommend IE for the incredible ease and usability it brings to MSN Spaces. MSN
Spaces doesn’t stop you from using another browser, but the experience is
not remotely as pleasurable. Therefore, Internet Explorer is the default
browser for this section of the book; all the examples and instructions
assume that you are using IE.
Customizing Your MSN Space
Before blogging, you might want to customize your space. If you’re like me,
you’ll have trouble keeping your hands off the slick drop-down and click-and-
drag goodness of the customization tools. Don’t even think about looking at
page code, seeking hidden menus, or jumping through exotic hoops as in
some other blog services. MSN’s customization tools are things of beauty and
a delight to use.

Chapter 4: MSN Spaces

Designing your page
In MSN Spaces, you customize your space in three basic ways:
 Choosing modules: Modules contain your blog roll and other lists, links
to your photo albums, blog archives, your profile summary, the blog
itself, and other chunks of content that can be arranged on your page.
You choose not only which modules to display on your page, but also
where they are located on the page.
 Choosing a layout: MSN Spaces offers six page layouts using one, two,
or three columns. Your modules go in those columns.
 Choosing a theme: Themes are color schemes. At the time of this writ-
ing, MSN Spaces offered 81 interchangeable themes.
MSN Spaces is built to be played with; you can change your modules, layout,
theme, and module positions whenever you want, as often as you want.
Flexible and fun customization is one of the strong points in MSN Spaces.
The following steps walk you through building a personalized MSN space:
1. Go to your MSN space site. Your new MSN space is located at a URL like
this: spaces.msn.com/members/your-space-name.
2. If you are not in Edit mode, click the Edit Your Space link.
Your MSN space has two modes: Edit and Preview. A link just above
Customize lets you toggle between them. When in Edit mode, the link
reads Preview My Space. When Previewing, the link reads Edit Your
Space. In Preview mode, you see the site just as visitors see it, with no
editing controls, except for the Edit Your Space link, which gives you
back your blogging and customizing controls. This easy switch is power-
fully convenient — and should be imitated by other services.
3. Click Customize.
4. Click the Layout tab, and then click a layout to select it.
A drop-down menu (see Figure 4-2) displays the available column lay-
outs available for your space.
5. Click the Modules tab, and then click a module to add or remove it.
Your space is equipped with default modules, but you can remove them
or add others.
6. Click the Themes tab, and then click any theme to select it.
Figure 4-3 illustrates the drop-down menu of Themes. Remember that
there are two pages of themes — maybe more by the time you read this.
To see the second page, click 2.

7. Click the Save button.
Nothing is locked in until you click that Save button.
8. Click the Preview My Space link to see what your page looks like with-
out any editing controls visible.
This view is how your space looks to visitors.
Now that you’ve added some modules to your page, you should try reposi-
tioning them. You can put your blog module in the middle of the page or in a
sidebar. You can drag your archives module to the top or bottom of its
column. You can, in fact, arrange your modules any way that suits your fancy.
No other blog service covered in this book comes close to the ease of page
building provided by MSN Spaces. You simply must try it.
To move a module around on the page (see Figure 4-4), simply grab the top of
it with your mouse cursor (click with the mouse and hold down the button)
and drag it (move the mouse). Throw it across the page from one sidebar to
another. Bury it at the bottom of a stack of modules or highlight it near the top.
Figure 4-4:
The Profile
module

dragged

page.
64
Part II: Starting a Blog Today 

You must click the Save button to lock in the new positions of your moved
modules. Also, you must use the Internet Explorer browser to drag modules.
Module placement is tied to your layout choice. If you’re unsatisfied with
how your modules look no matter how much you drag them around, try
starting fresh with a new layout.
Making other space settings
Click Settings (next to Customize) to see several groups of settings that affect
your space and your blog:
 Space Settings is the page where you set your space’s title and description.
 Blog Settings is where you decide how many entries appear on the first
page (every entry also gets its own page) and whether comments are
allowed on entry pages.
 Permissions is where you make the blog public or private.
 E-mail publishing is where you determine settings that enable you to post
a blog entry from any e-mail account. Many more sophisticated blog ser-
vices allow this type of remote posting; bravo to MSN for putting it in.
 Storage keeps track of how much of your allotted memory your pictures
are taking up. More on pictures later in this chapter. Each MSN space
gets 30 megabytes of storage.
 Statistics reveals measurements to your space and shows which pages
have been visited.
Blogging in MSN Spaces
Writing blog entries in MSN Spaces is straightforward and painless.
1. In your blog module, click Add entry.
2. In the Title box, enter an entry title.
3. Compose your entry, adding any formatting you want.
The formatting controls resemble those in many e-mail services, some
instant message programs, and Word and other writing programs. (See
Figure 4-5.) Click the Paragraph, Font Style, and Font Size menus to see
those choices. Run your mouse cursor over the icons to see their func-
tions. The Insert Search Link feature creates a link to MSN Search, using
the highlighted word (or words) as the search query.
65
Chapter 4: MSN Spaces

4. Assign a category to the post.
This step is optional. Either choose from the drop-down menu of preset
categories or use the Add a category link to create one. Categories help
sort your blog entries and become useful when you have many posts.
It’s a good idea to start using categories early if you are going to use
them eventually.
5. Click the Publish Entry button.
You can save entries in progress for later completion with the Save as
Draft button.
Note that TrackBacks are allowed in MSN Spaces. See my detailed description
of TrackBacks in Chapter 3. The short explanation is this: TrackBacks let you
refer to somebody else’s blog entry and leave a link to your post on the other
person’s blog. To use the feature here, click the small button next to
TrackBacks (Optional) and then enter the TrackBack URL from the other
person’s blog.
As you compose your entry, use the Preview Blog Entry tab to see what your
formatting choices look like. On the other hand, if you don’t use the format-
ting icons, there’s not much point is previewing the post.
Figure 4-5:

66
Part II: Starting a Blog Today 

Note: Unlike some other blog services, you cannot pre-date or post-date
entries. Manipulating the date is a feature not often found in social networks.
Editing and deleting blog entries are common tasks, and MSN makes them
more accessible than many competing networks. Click the X corresponding
to any blog entry in your blog module (when in Edit mode) to delete the
entry. Click any entry title to edit that entry. Your blog module must be posi-
tioned in a wide column (as in Figure 4-6) to see entry titles and the corre-
sponding deletion Xs.
Sharing Photos in MSN Spaces
You can probably tell that I like MSN Spaces. But the best is yet to come. MSN
has fabulous photo features. Fast, friendly, fabulous photo features. This ser-
vice makes it unusually easy to upload, display, and even touch up your digi-
tal photos. Pictures are automatically compressed — which would be a “so
what?” fact except that the compression helps you fit more pictures in your
allotted space. You can create as many photo albums as you like. The Photo
Upload Control tool streamlines the addition of multiple photos like you
wouldn’t believe. And in the end, your photos are presented on your Spaces
page as a slide show.
Figure 4-6:

Chapter 4: MSN Spaces

The individual features I rave over are not unique to MSN Spaces; other ser-
vices allow photo albums, provide upload tools, and display slide shows. But
total packages as delightful as this one are rare. If photo sharing is a priority
for you, you’re going to like this.
You don’t have to use the MSN Photo Upload Control uploading tool, but I
recommend it. The following steps walk you through installing it (could
hardly be easier) and starting to use it for all uploading to MSN Spaces:
1. In the Photo album module, click Create.
2. Enter an album title.
The default title is the date. Highlight that title and type over it. Unless,
of course, you want the photo album’s title to be the date it was created.
3. Click the Add photos link.
A window pops open, offering something called MSN Photo Upload
Control. Could no one think of a less intimidating name for this thing?
Sheesh. Still, it’s a great little program.
4. Click the Install Now button.
5. If a verification pop-up appears, click its Install button.
The installation is fully automatic and takes less than ten seconds over a
high-speed connection. Figure 4-7 shows the Photo Upload Control
immediately after installation, awaiting your instructions.

6. In the Photo Upload Control window, select a photo album from the
left sidebar.
The left pane of the uploading window shows your computer’s folders.
The interface is the same as in Windows Explorer. Click your way to a
folder containing pictures that you’d like to include in your Spaces photo
album. The pictures in that folder display in the main upload pane.
7. Run your mouse cursor over any picture to see the option icons.
Photo Upload Control lets you perform basic editing tasks on a picture,
such as brightening it, increasing the contrast, and rotating it. (See Figure
4-8.) Clicking the center icon brings up the editing controls, as shown in
Figure 4-9. Click the View Thumbnails button to return to the folder view.

Chapter 4: MSN Spaces

8. Click the pictures you want included in the photo album.
Click Select All to tag all pictures in the folder for upload. Selected pic-
tures are checked in the upper-left corner. Click again to deselect any
picture.
9. Click the Upload Now button.
MSN Spaces automatically compresses your photos (leaving them
unchanged in your computer) and uploads them to your new album. The
Photo Upload Control window disappears and your browser reappears,
displaying the newly created album in edit mode. (See Figure 4-10.)
10. If you want to retitle any photo, click its caption and type a new title.
You can also rename the album.
Renaming a picture in the Add Photos window does not rename the
photo’s file name in your computer. You can have two names for any
photo: one in your computer, and one in your MSN Space photo album.
11. Click the Save and Close button.

70
Part II: Starting a Blog Today 

After creating a photo album, you might want to rearrange your modules or
even choose a new layout style. The reason for this consideration is that the
photo album module contains a fancy and effective slide-show control that
invites your visitors to browse through your photos right on your main page.
They can click through to a full-page presentation of the photo album, but a
large, prominent photo album module is a convenience to your visitors and is
great to look at. Try using a layout with wide sidebars and putting the album
in one of them. Just a thought. Figure 4-11 shows a page design that puts the
Photo album module in a wide main column and shoves the blog into a side-
bar. That’s a dramatic example of showcasing the photo module. As you can
see, narrow blog modules show not full entries but links to entries.

It’s a look.

Chapter 4: MSN Spaces

MSN Spaces Recap
MSN Spaces is a mix of careful, thought-out design and restrictive demands
on the user and visitor. Well, one restrictive demand, which is the required
use of Internet Explorer to access and view the best parts of the Spaces ser-
vice. Not only are module dragging and the Photo Upload Control tool
unavailable in other browsers, but your visitors do not see photo slide shows
in other browsers. So for Spaces to come alive, you and your visitors need to
use IE. You might prefer IE anyway, but the results you get with it are not nec-
essarily visible to your viewers. This dichotomy reveals the underside of
Internet site design: What you think you’re showing people might not be what
they’re seeing.
Leaving aside that complaint, I must say that MSN Spaces offers an effortless
and fun site-building and blogging experience. MSN has hit a sweet spot com-
bining serious tools and entertainment value. The results are attractive in
any browser, and anybody can create a personal statement in Spaces that can
be shown off proudly.

Yahoo! 360
In This Chapter
 Signing up for Yahoo! 360
 Understanding the me-centricity of Yahoo! 360
 Putting your stuff (and your friends) on your 360 page
 Blogging in 360: the simplest blog around
 Sharing photos in your 360 sidebar
 Recapping the 360 experience
 Blogging, old school, at LiveJournal
Yahoo! 360 was started in March 2005 as a blog and community site with a
few unusual and interesting innovations. Yahoo! is a gigantic suite of Web
sites, online communities, and services. It’s hard to imagine anyone being
online for one year (or one month) and not touching the Yahoo! empire, even
inadvertently. Yahoo! publishes news, hosts Web sites, runs auctions and per-
sonal-ad services, stores photos, was the Web’s first major directory and is
still one of the three most important search engines, operates music services
enjoyed by millions, hosts a gigantic online chatting platform, is one of the
world’s largest e-mail providers, and has the world’s most popular personal-
ized home page service. The Yahoo! domain (yahoo.com) is consistently —
month after month, year after year — the first or second most-visited Internet
destination.
There’s a reason I’m promoting Yahoo!’s resumé. The beauty of Yahoo! 360 
is that it ties together some parts of the Yahoo! platform and throws them
onto your page with little effort on your part. That means if you have ever
uploaded pictures to Yahoo! Photos (photos.yahoo.com) or to Flickr (a
photo-sharing site owned by Yahoo!), you can put those photos on your
Yahoo! 360 page with a click or two — no further uploading. If you have 
ever written a review of a restaurant in Yahoo! Local (local.yahoo.com),
you can easily have that review displayed on your 360 page.

This type of integration, or bundling — easily making your Yahoo! stuff appear
on your 360 page — is just beginning, and will get more developed, with 
more options, over time. Yahoo! 360 is already nicely integrated with Yahoo!
Messenger, the instant messaging program. That means you can see which of
your 360 friends is online at any moment. If you use Yahoo! Groups — another
social network that does not include blogging — you can post messages to
your groups from your 360 page.
Yahoo! 360 is neither pretty nor ugly. It is plain; the focus is more on smooth
functionality than on dazzling appearance. Just before this book was finished,
Yahoo! added color schemes called Themes to 360, but I didn’t see many
people using them. Perhaps too much time had gone by without theme
choices, and inertia had set in. Anyway, you can change colors but not the
layout style, so Yahoo! 360 pages look similar, one to another, except for the
content loaded into those spaces. That content is a mix of what you write 
and your photos.
Getting Started in 360
Yahoo! 360 is a free service available to anybody with a Yahoo! ID. If you don’t
have a Yahoo! ID, stand in the corner. Then, abashed, return to the computer
and get yourself a Yahoo! ID. Simply go to the Yahoo! 360 home page:
360.yahoo.com
There, click the Sign Up link, fill in the boxes on the next page, and click the 
I Agree button.
Me-centric, Not We-centric
That is how one observer described Yahoo! 360 soon after it opened. All
social networks give you your own space, but they are about the whole mem-
bership. Yahoo! 360 is more about you, and it gives you ways of reaching ten-
tacles into the membership. The best example of the me-centric approach is
the navigation bar that stretches across the top-right of your 360 space. No
matter how many times you click away from your own page — to a friend,
then to that friend’s friend, then onward to the pages of strangers and their
friends — that navigation bar remains in place, keeping you one click away
from your own space. When you click away you’re not really traveling out-
ward in a straight line; you’re traveling in a tight circle around your home
base. That is me-centric.

75
Chapter 5: Yahoo! 360
Home page and My Page
I joined Yahoo! 360 when it first opened and was
immediately confused by one little point. I hope to
spare you the same confusion by straightening it
out here. The potential confusion exists between
two pages in your 360 space: Home and My Page.
Home is a page that only you can see. It gives
you quick links for adding photos, composing a
blog entry, and inviting a new friend. More impor-
tant, Home is the page upon which your friends’
additions appear. New stuff from your friends
gets pushed to your Home page. Your new stuff
gets pushed to the Home pages of your friends.
My Page is how other people see you in Yahoo!
360. Other people can also see your blog page
and friends page and other pages, but My Page
is your summary of yourself to the public. My
Page contains everything you have created and
want to share: photos, lists, and the start of your
most recent blog entry.
Here’s a tip. Use the drop-down menu on My
Page labeled Preview as Seen By to display My
Page as it is seen by different groups: everyone,
friends, friends of friends, certain categories of
friends, and so on. Because you can assign
content blocks as visible or invisible to different
groups and categories, My Page alters depend-
ing on who is looking at it. The Preview menu is
a great way to see you as others see you. Click
the Go back to Edit My Page link (on the left side
of My Page) to return to edit mode.

There is more to the me-centricity of Yahoo! 360. The service specializes in
keeping you in touch with your circle of friends. When you put a new piece 
of content in your space — a blog entry, let’s say — Yahoo! 360 can push that
new piece onto the pages of your friends. This feature might seem pushy . . .
well, it is pushy, but pushy in a good way. Everyone involved has agreed to
this, and it’s an enjoyable, essential part of the 360 experience. This pushy
system provides effortless contact among circles of friends. You can even
fine-tune who sees what by categorizing your friends and restricting certain
contributions to specific categories. Conversely, you can broaden your reach
by assigning new blog entries to the pages of friends and their friends.
Because circles of friends, with you in the center, are so important, Yahoo!
360 relies on an invitation system. Yahoo! is less concerned with mashing
strangers together than with making connections easier for already existing
friendships. Click the Invite link in the navigation bar to view the invitation
page (see Figure 5-1), where Yahoo! makes it easy to bulk-invite your existing
friends from the Yahoo! Address book and Yahoo! Messenger.
Friends exist in 360 as overlapping public circles. Everyone can see anyone
else’s friends and the pictures they have (optionally) uploaded to represent
themselves. (See Figure 5-2.) A portion of large friend circles appears in the
right sidebar of any member’s page. You can focus on any member from a
friend list, seeing that person’s page and issuing an invitation to join each
other’s circles.

The Yahoo! 360 Page
The main page elements of Yahoo! 360, like those in MSN Spaces (see Chapter
4), are customized content modules (though they aren’t called that in 360 and
can’t be dragged around the page as in Spaces). There are five main chunks
of content, and a few others that dedicated users enjoy discovering. The five
big items are these:
 Blog: Naturally, your 360 blog is a major portion of your 360 space.
 Blast: This fun feature is a short bit of text, perhaps an announcement 
or a famous quote, that gets “blasted” to your friends’ pages. The blast
is meant to be the briefest and most transient of your sharings. (See
Figure 5-3.) When I get into the mood, I offer an inspirational short quote
in the blast and change it daily. I lose my momentum after a while, then
later start it up again.
 Photos: You can add a photo to a blog entry, though the formatting of
photos in entries is not flexible. You can also share photos uploaded 
to Yahoo! Photos or Flickr. Both those services are free to use (Flickr
offers a premium account that cost $25 a year at this writing).

Chapter 5: Yahoo! 360

 Friends: It might seem silly or insulting to think of your friends as “con-
tent,” but because everybody’s list is public, checking on the friends of
friends is part of 360’s appeal.
 Lists: Like most social networks, Yahoo! 360 encourages the creation of
lists, such as lists of books, movies, and music. List items are linked to
everyone else who shares that item. For example, I put kayaking and dogs
as two of my interests (even though my dog won’t get into my kayak,
making it hard to blend those interests). Each item links to a grand list of
other Yahoo! 360 members interested in that item (see Figure 5-4). That
list is a search result, and the page includes tools for narrowing the search
by member age and proximity to your location. You can determine who
sees each of your lists: friends, friends plus their friends, friends plus their
friends plus their friends, or just you. It’s kind of like mingling at a party.
Blogging in 360
Writing a blog entry in Yahoo! 360 benefits from one of the simplest and most reas-
suring interfaces around. (See Figure 5-5.) The title box is filled in for you with the
current date, but you can change that by highlighting it and typing over it.
Figure 5-3:

Part II: Starting a Blog Today 

Use the Browse button to upload a picture to include in your entry. Only one
picture is allowed per entry, and you have no control over its position, which
is atop the written portion of the entry. (See Figure 5-6.) The photo uploaded
to your entry is also compressed and might come out smaller than the origi-
nal in your computer. Nothing you can do about that, either. Before posting,
click the Preview button to see what your entry will look like.
Blogging in Yahoo! 360 is ridiculously easy. Casting my mind over the range
of programs and services profiled in this book, I think Yahoo! 360 would
get the award for easiest blog tool or perhaps share that distinction with
Blogger.com. Yahoo! 360 doesn’t offer the range of features that Blogger does,
which makes 360 either undesirable or preferable, depending on your need
for simplicity.
When my mother surprised me by expressing her interest in starting a blog, I
nudged her toward Yahoo! 360, thinking it would provide the most hassle-free
on-ramp to the blogosphere. I’m happy to report that she is still at it, writing
a gem of a nature blog called “Out There,” shown in Figure 5-7.

Photos in 360
Yahoo! 360 is a photo-oriented community, yet there is no direct uploading of
pictures to your page except for blog entries. Peculiar, isn’t it? The reason for
this omission in the photo department is Yahoo!’s desire to utilize Yahoo!
Photos and Flickr, the company’s two photo-sharing services. If you have
photos already uploaded in either place, simply click Add Photos on your
Home page in 360, and follow the easy-click instructions for displaying those
uploads in Yahoo! 360.
If you don’t have any pictures stored in Yahoo! Photos or Flickr, you need to
upload your photos at one of those locations. Yahoo! Photos is here:
photos.yahoo.com
Flickr is here:
www.flickr.com
Yahoo! Photos is a plain photo repository service without any community
features. Flickr is a photo-sharing community, where pictures are located by
means of a tagging system and shared rampantly. Flickr is ragingly popular;
people who use it, love it. I use both, and Figure 5-8 shows my 360 page with
albums from both sites appearing in the sidebar.

Chapter 5: Yahoo! 360

The Yahoo! 360 Upshot
Yahoo! 360 strikes an attractive balance of community features and blogging
features. The blogging is simple to the extreme, which is a solid advantage 
to newcomers. More ambitious bloggers with a knack for designing pages
might be bored with the sameness of 360’s spaces. Yahoo! 360 is a great place
to establish yourself and then drag in all your friends. The service is easy
enough for everybody, and its keep-in-touch nature, with new items being
pushed onto friends’ screens, encourages lots of communication. Blogging 
is definitely just an item on the buffet here; you could have a good 360 experi-
ence without ever writing a blog entry. For more serious (yet still easy) blog-
ging without the social perks, I would head for Chapter 6 and Blogger.com.

LiveJournal: A classic social network
LiveJournal (or LJ as its devotees call it) is an
open-source social site operated by SixApart,
the company behind TypePad and Movable
Type. What does open source mean? Simply
that the underlying software can be developed
by anybody. As a result, some third-party pro-
grams have been developed that enhance the
LiveJournal experience.
The big question for new LJ users is: Should I get
the free or paid version? At the time of this writ-
ing, a paid LiveJournal account costs $19.99 for
a year or $3 a month. A free version is also avail-
able. I recommend starting with a free account;
you can upgrade at any time. Advertisements are
not displayed in either type of account. Free
accounts give you most of the basic LiveJournal
tools, including blogging, a profile, and limited
uploading of pictures. You can customize the
appearance of your LJ page to some extent, but
a paid account gives you more control and better
tools, including remote posting and a photo-
organizing tool called ScrapBook.
LiveJournal is full of features meant to empha-
size who you are and what you like. Each blog
post can be tagged with your mood and what
music you’re currently listening to, for example.
Every member can upload small pictures that
can be selectively attached to blog posts for an
extra dash of personality. Another excellent fea-
ture that enhances community is the threaded
commenting in LiveJournal. Unlike most other
blog systems, which list comments in strictly
chronological order, LiveJournal comments are
displayed by discussion, so you can see who is
responding to whom.
The blog entry-writing page in LiveJournal is
stark, neither getting in the way nor enhancing
the blogging experience. In its default mode, this
page offers a bare subject box and entry box. You
can manipulate the date and time to place the
page before or after the present time in your blog
chronology. The rich text option adds standard
formatting controls above the entry box.
LiveJournal stumbles badly in the customizing
and page-design departments. The complex,
obscure, unexplained series of options is a
nightmare. Previewing design changes does not
always work, and in those instances you must
choose new designs blindly, and then choose
again if you don’t like the result. Comparing this
tangle of frustration with newer tools in MSN
Spaces, TypePad, Blogger.com, and WordPress
is, frankly (and with apologies to the LJ commu-
nity), laughable.
Millions of people use LiveJournal and feel
great loyalty to the network. Give LiveJournal a
whirl if you’re curious and enjoy tinkering. Or,
join up if you have a friend in LJ. Otherwise, If
you’re new to blogging and new to social net-
working, LiveJournal could easily thwart your
enthusiasm. The service doesn’t do a good job
of holding newcomers’ hands and walking them
through to a satisfying product. In the contem-
porary blogging scene, easier, prettier, better
options exist for the newcomer.

In This Chapter
 Recognizing the Blogger look
 Creating a free Blogger account
 Reviewing three important options
 Writing and posting your first entry
 Making your blog your own
 Talking in your blog — really talking
 E-mailing your Blogger entries
 Connecting to your blog from the road
A
ll roads lead to Blogger, it sometimes seems. Blogger.com is the first
stop on the blogging highway for innumerable newcomers. Here are
three good reasons for Blogger’s popularity:
 Blogger is free.
 Blogger is unlimited; there is no restriction on the number of blogs you
can have or the number of pictures you can upload.
 Blogger is easy. Advertising “push-button publishing,” Blogger gets you
up and posting faster than any other service.
You might think that I am making a whole-hearted recommendation of Blogger.
There is much to recommend it, but Blogger has drawbacks, too. Despite its
user-friendliness, Blogger has the soul of a geek and sometimes makes simple
tasks unnecessarily complicated. One complaint: the difficulty of adding sidebar
content such as a blogroll. Blogger makes you stick your hands into your site’s
code to do that, which is why so many Blogger sites don’t display blogrolls.
Blogger stands somewhere between social networks (see Chapters 4 and 5)
and TypePad (see Chapter 7). Blogger offers some of the community tools
that are characteristic of social sites such as Yahoo! 360 and MSN Spaces. For
example, each listed interest in your Blogger profile links to search results
showing everyone else in Blogger with that interest — one of the bedrock 
features of social networks. But Blogger lives up to its name and is a more
blog-intensive, blog-centric service than the social networks. Blogger is pri-
marily about blogging, not primarily about meeting people.

This chapter makes a detailed survey of Blogger’s most important features. 
If you haven’t yet chosen a blogging service and are drawn to Blogger by its
friendly reputation and no-charge service, you might want to read through
this chapter to make sure it’s the right choice for you.
The Blogger Look
Because Blogger offers relatively few (but fairly attractive) templates, many
blogs are instantly recognizable as belonging to Blogger. One example is
“Blogging For Dummies” — hey, wait a minute! That’s not my blog. (See Figure
6-1.) It belongs to Jeff Sievers, who started the blog as a how-to about blog-
ging. It has more recently evolved into a general diary about everything from
politics to the repeated breakdowns of Jeff’s car. I thought it would be fun to
put his site in the book, and Jeff agreed. See it live, here:
drumacrat.blogspot.com
Jeff’s blog has the typical Blogger look; that template and similar ones with
different colors are much in use. If you scroll down the page, you might
notice that there is no visible feed link. (See Chapter 13 to find out everything
about RSS and feed links.)
The lack of a visible feed is another drawback to Blogger. However, Blogger
uses a common feed link that you can simply add to the end of any blog’s
home-page URL:
/atom.xml
Using Jeff Siever’s Blogger site as an example, the feed link is this:
drumacrat.blogspot.com/atom.xml
Blogger uses an alternative to the RSS feed format called Atom. Atom feeds
work just like RSS feeds in the important ways. Atom feeds display blog
entries just like RSS feeds in a feed newsreader. Blogger’s choice of Atom has
nothing to do with the lack of a feed link on Blogger blogs. The missing feed
link is simply a design choice at Blogger — inexplicable, perhaps, but there 
it is. If you use a feed-enabled Web browser (such as Firefox), Blogger feeds
appear in the browser just as reliably as on pages that do contain feed links.
Firefox finds the feed link in the page’s code, where it lurks invisibly.
A site that deviates from the typical Blogger look is the one that belongs to
guitarist and recording artist Ottmar Liebert. (See Figure 6-2.) His site is
located here:
www.ottmarliebert.com/blog/

87
Chapter 6: Finding a Home in Blogger

Notice that Ottmar Liebert hosts his blog at his own domain, ottmar
liebert.com, not at Blogger’s free hosting domain, blogspot.com. Liebert
takes advantage of Blogger’s free FTP service, which enables Webmasters 
to use Blogger templates and tools while keeping the blog on their own
domain. In this chapter, I assume that most readers want to host their blog
on blogspot.com. If you prefer the FTP option, choose it during sign-up, or
choose it after sign-up on the Settings, Publishing page of the control panel.
(You’ll know much more about the control panel by the end of this chapter.)
Note that Ottmar Liebert streams photos from Flickr, which is a photo-sharing
site that allows members to tie their photo collections to their blogs. Read
Chapter 17 for more about Flickr. Read also Chapter 5, which describes how
Yahoo! 360 makes the Flickr tie-in especially easy. While you’re at it, read
Huckleberry Finn. It’s good for you.
As a final example, check out the This Is Not Art 05 Moblog located here:
tina05.blogspot.com
A moblog is a mobile blog, where entries are posted remotely using portable
computers, PDAs, or cell phones. Many moblogs are rich in photos, and pic-
tures are the point here. Notice in Figure 6-3 that the blog’s template is simi-
lar to Jeff Siever’s (see Figure 6-1), but with a different color scheme. It is
instantly recognizable as a Blogger blog.

Getting Started with Blogger
You must start an account with Blogger to begin blogging, but your account is
completely free. Furthermore, one account gives you a theoretically unlimited
number of blogs. Each blog has a theoretically unlimited amount of space for
entries and photos. I say “theoretically” because I have heard of restrictions
being placed on accounts that are overused. No published restrictions exist,
and with normal use even active bloggers should be able to expand their sites
without constraint.
Starting up is easy. This section walks you through the path of least resis-
tance: the easiest way to start posting entries in Blogger. You can make
changes to your account, and to your blog, later. In later chapters (covering
TypePad, Movable Type, WordPress, and Radio UserLand), I recommend
doing some blog setup before starting to write. With Blogger, which is
designed as “pushbutton publishing,” I advise pushing those buttons and 
getting your blog published without delay (except for a few small settings).
Then, later in this chapter, I describe how you can customize, personalize,
and otherwise exercise other blog settings.
Here we go. Go to the Blogger site:
www.blogger.com
Then, follow along with these steps:
1. On the Blogger home page, click the Create Your Blog Now button.
2. Fill in the username, password, display name, and e-mail address;
select the Terms of Service acceptance box; and then click the
Continue button.
The username and password log you into your Blogger account when
you want to post entries or change blog settings. The display name,
which can be changed later, appears on your blog. The e-mail address
does not necessarily appear on the blog but is used for communication
between Blogger and you.
3. Fill in a name and address for your blog.
You can give your blog any title at all, and you can always change it. 
The blog’s address is partly determined by the Blogger host, which is
located at blogspot.com. This means that your blog address will be
yourblog.blogspot.com. Simply type what you want that first word
of the address to be; it doesn’t need to be the same as your blog title 
89
Chapter 6: Finding a Home in Blogger

or display name. So, if your blog is titled Random Deep Thoughts, your
address could be joesmith.blogspot.com (which would make sense
only if your name is Joe Smith).
Note the Advanced Setup option; I am ignoring that option for now. Use
it if you have your own domain that resides on a Web host. You can use
Blogger tools to operate the blog on your Web host.
4. Fill in the Word Verification, and then click the Continue button. The
word verification step ensures that you are a real person, and not a soft-
ware robot. Because, yes, software robots do try to create Blogger
accounts.
5. Select a template by clicking the radio button below one of the
designs.
The template determines the color theme and design layout of your site.
Click the preview template link below any template to see a pop-up
window illustrating a sample blog in that design.
6. Click the Continue button.
You might have to wait a few seconds at this point, as Blogger creates
your blog template and plugs in your information. Before you can recite
the complete poems of Robert Frost, a page jubilantly declaims, “Your
blog has been created!” You’d think Blogger had cured the common cold.
Anyway, click the Start Posting button to . . . well, start posting.
After following these steps, you will have created a blog. It’s that painless.
Perhaps that’s enough for one day. If you put aside this project for now, you
can return to it at any time by visiting the Blogger.com site and logging in
using the Username and Password boxes in the upper-right corner. Doing so
presents the Dashboard page (see Figure 6-4); here, Blogger displays news
about the service and hints for using it better. On this page, also, are direct
links to editing your profile, changing your password, adding a photo to your
profile, and — most important to daily blogging — creating a new post and
accessing your other Blogger controls.
Drill this into your brain and thank me later: The Dashboard is where you
access your profile information. Don’t ask me why Blogger does not put your
profile settings inside the control panel along with all the other settings. I
have no idea why not. If you do ask me, my eyes will become glassy and I’ll
start humming “Desperado.” To get to the Dashboard, click the Back to
Dashboard link near the upper-right corner of the control panel. In the
Dashboard screen, click the Edit Profile link to see your profile settings.
90
Part II: Starting a Blog Today 

Three Crucial Settings
I’ll get to posting in a bit. First, you should address three default settings in
your new blog. I don’t mean that you must change the settings, but you
should be aware of them before you start writing entries into your blog.
Follow these steps to review these crucial settings:
1. Go to Blogger.com and sign in to your account.
2. Click the Change Settings icon.
Blogger displays the Basic page of your Settings tab (see Figure 6-5).
3. Use the Add Your Blog to Our Listings drop-down menu to make your
blog public or private.
The default setting is Yes; this means that your blog is included in the
Blogger directory and might be included in Blogger’s list of highlighted
blogs. Select No if you prefer keeping the blog private, either temporar-
ily while you build up some entries and practice your Blogger skills or
permanently.
4. Click the Save Settings button.
You might have to scroll down the page to see this button. You must
save changes you make to any page in the Settings tab before moving to
another page; otherwise, your changes will revert to previous settings.
Figure 6-4:

news and

91
Chapter 6: Finding a Home in Blogger

5. Still in the Settings tab, click the Formatting link.
6. On the Formatting page, use the Show Title drop-down menu to deter-
mine whether your entries are individually titled.
Curiously, this setting is defaulted in the No position, meaning that there
is no Title box available when you write an entry. Consequently, when
this option is set to No, your blog contains no message titles. Such a
design might be to your taste, but I find it odd and recommend changing
this setting to Yes. When you do so, the Title box appears on the page on
which you compose entries. Then, you have a choice with each entry:
create a title or not.
7. Click the Save Settings button.
8. Still in the Settings tab, click the Comments link.
9. On the Comments page, use the Comments radio buttons to choose
whether your entries will allow comments.
The default here is Show, which allows visitors to leave comments on
your entry pages.
10. Click the Save Settings button.
Now you are ready to blog!

Part II: Starting a Blog Today 

Writing and Posting Entries in Blogger
With your basic settings ready to go (see the preceding section), you might
want to write and post an entry. That’s what it’s all about. If you’re in your
Blogger control panel (where the Settings tab is), a single click gets you to the
page where you compose an entry. If you’re entering Blogger after being away
from it, go to Blogger.com and sign in, and then click the name of your blog on
your Dashboard page. Clicking your blog name takes you to the control panel.
Composing an entry and publishing it
However you get there, follow these steps to write and post your first blog
entry. Doing so is just about as easy as sending an e-mail:
1. Click the Posting tab.
You are delivered to the Create page within the Posting tab — just where
you want to be. (See Figure 6-6.)
2. Enter a title for your blog post.
As noted in the preceding section, you must select an option that puts a
title field on the Create page. If you don’t, you can’t title your entries.
Figure 6-6:
This is
where you
write and
publish new
blog entries.
93
Chapter 6: Finding a Home in Blogger

3. In the large box, type your entry.
Don’t worry about being brilliant, profound, or even interesting. You can
delete or edit the post later.
4. Click the Publish Post button.
That is all there is to writing and posting a blog entry in Blogger. Well, those
are the basics. Other features are available. Note the icons and drop-down
menus just above the entry-writing box. You might be familiar with similar
controls if you use e-mail in AOL, Gmail, or another system where you can
select fonts, colors, and other formatting options. Run your mouse cursor
over the icons to see their labels. Here is a rundown of Blogger formatting
choices:
 Use the Font and Normal Size drop-down menus to select a typeface and
type size, respectively. If you’re uncertain what this means, experiment!
Remember, nothing gets published on the blog until you click the
Publish Post button.
 Use the b icon to make bold text. Simply select any text you’ve already
typed, and then click the icon. Alternatively, click the icon, start typing
(even in the middle of a sentence), and then click the icon again to end
the bold formatting.
 Use the i icon to make italicized text.
 Use the T icon to change the color of your text. Again, this control may
be used on words within sentences. The truth is, most people don’t
insert colored text into blog posts. Blogs are more about the writing
than fancy and useless formatting. Bold and italic text makes a point;
colored text rarely does.
 That little chain icon next to the T icon is the link icon; use it to insert a
link to an outside Web page. Highlight any word or group of words, and
then click the link icon and type (or paste) a copied link into the pop-up
box. (See Figure 6-7.)
 The alignment icons line up your text as follows: on the left (with a
ragged right edge), in the middle (ragged on both sides), on the right
(with a ragged left edge), or with full justification (even on both sides).
The default setting is left alignment (the icon shown in the margin of this
book), and there is little reason to change it.
 Use the numbered list and bulleted list options to create indented lists
in your entry. The list you’re reading right now is a bullet list. The list
before this is a numbered list.
 The blockquote option creates an indented portion of the entry that
many people use when quoting material from another site. Figure 6-8
illustrates a blockquote.

Chapter 6: Finding a Home in Blogger

 The ABC icon represents a spell-check feature.
 The small picture is for adding images; I get to that later in the section
called “Inserting a photo in an entry.”
 The rightmost icon, which looks like an eraser, removes formatting from
any portion of highlighted text.
That’s it for the formatting. Tempting though these one-click options are, try
not to gunk up your blog too much. I mean, it’s your blog; do what you want.
But most people don’t like having their eyes savaged by colored text, weirdly
sized characters, bizarre fonts, or willy-nilly bolding and italicizing. Sorry to
be a sourpuss, but use formatting with discretion.
You might notice a second tab above the entry-writing box, labeled Edit 
Html. Use this tab if you prefer to manually code your formats with HTML
tags. HTML specialists can also use HTML tags that are not represented by
the format icons just described. When you want to check your hand-coding
efforts, click back to the Compose tab. You can toggle between the two, 
editing your code and checking it.
The Preview link invites you to see what your entry will look like.
Unfortunately, it does no such thing. That link displays a composed and 
formatted version of your entry, but it does not display it in your blog’s 
template design. Because the page on which you compose your entry 
shows all the formatting choices you make, the Preview link seems point-
less to me. So my tip is: Ignore it (the Preview feature, not the tip).
Note two final features on the Create page. First, use the Yes and No options
to determine whether comments will be allowed on the entry you’re writing.
You can use this setting to override the global setting you made in the pre-
ceding section. Second, use the Time & Date menus to alter the accurate time
of the post. You can place the entry in the past or the future (more on why
you might want to do this in a moment), and the blog will sort it accordingly
in your archives and index page.
Editing your entries
Blogger makes it easy to edit or delete entries. To edit an entry, you use the
same basic tools as those for writing a new entry. Proceed like this:
1. In the Posting tab, click the Edit posts link.
96
Part II: Starting a Blog Today 

2. On the Edit posts page, click the Edit button corresponding to any
entry.
(See Figure 6-9.) Use the drop-down menu to select how many published
entries appear on this page. You see only the titles, not the full entries.
3. Alter your entry using the familiar writing and formatting tools.
See the preceding section for details on these tools.
4. Click the Publish Post button.
You have an opportunity to change the date and time of the changed entry.
The default setting of the Time & Date menus is the original moment of the
entry’s publication. If you’re updating previous information, you can bring
the time and date up to the present. If you’re merely correcting a mistake,
standard blogging protocol calls for leaving the entry in its original chrono-
logical placement.
To delete an entry, go to the Edit Posts page and click the Delete link corre-
sponding to any entry. Blogger displays the post and asks whether you 
really want to delete it. Click the Delete It button. A deleted post cannot 
be recovered.
Figure 6-9:

page to

97
Chapter 6: Finding a Home in Blogger

Inserting a photo in an entry
Including a photo in a blog entry is not a problem in Blogger. The photo can
come from your computer or from a Web location, the former being more
common. Blogger can upload the photo from your machine, store it on its
computer, and resize it for display in the blog entry (a big picture could
stretch out the entry grotesquely). Visitors who click the resized picture see
the full-sized photo on another page.
Follow these steps to insert a picture in a Blogger entry:
1. In your control panel, click the Posting tab.
2. On the Create page, type an entry title and begin writing your entry.
It doesn’t matter when you insert the photo in the entry-writing process.
The photo can come first, or the writing, or a portion of the writing.
3. Click the Add Image icon.
To find the Add Image control, run your mouse over the formatting
icons. A pop-up window appears to handle your picture selection and
upload. (See Figure 6-10.)
Figure 6-10:
Use this
pop-up
window to

98
Part II: Starting a Blog Today 

4. Click the Browse button to select a picture from your computer.
If you’re inserting a picture found on the Web, copy that picture’s loca-
tion (Web address) in the URL box.
5. In the File Upload window, click the image file you want to insert and
then click the Open button.
6. Back in the Blogger pop-up window, choose a layout by clicking a
radio button.
The layout selections let you determine whether the picture is positioned
to the left of the entry’s text, to the right of the text, or centered above
the text.
7. Select an image size.
The size selections are vague: Small, Medium, or Large. I always use the
Small setting, so the picture doesn’t dominate the entry. Readers who
click the picture see it in full size on a new page.
8. Click the Upload Image button.
9. In the confirmation window, click the Done button.
Back on the Create page, you can see your uploaded photo in the 
entry box. Now is a good time to complete your writing of the entry, 
if necessary.
10. Click the Publish Post button.
You can use this process to insert multiple pictures in a blog entry.
Personalizing Your Blogger Blog
You’ve made basic settings and you’ve posted at least one entry. Your blog 
is launched. However, you can do more to make it unmistakably your blog.
Blogger personalization consists of choosing a site design (which you already
did but can change at any time), creating a personal profile that’s displayed
on a unique page, and setting a few formats. You can also change the title and
description of the blog at any time. Let’s get started finding these features.
Switching Blogger templates
Blogger templates determine the color scheme and layout design of your
blog. Templates are interchangeable. You can switch from one to another
with a few clicks, and the changes ripple out through every page (except 
the Profile page) of your blog.
99
Chapter 6: Finding a Home in Blogger

Blogger offers a modest selection of templates — about thirty at the time of
this writing, and certainly more than Blogger showed you during sign-up.
Follow these steps to see how your blog looks with a whole new design:
1. In your Blogger control panel, click the Template tab.
2. In the Template tab, click the Pick new link.
3. On the Pick New page (see Figure 6-11), click any template picture to
see a full-size sample of that template.
The sample opens in a new browser window and illustrates what an
active blog looks like.
4. Close the sample browser window.
You don’t want it hanging around your screen forever. Leaving it open
doesn’t affect the template selection process, but closing it reveals the
original browser window that you use to select a template.
5. Click the Use This Template button below your selected template.
Your selected template can be the one you just previewed or any 
other one.
Figure 6-11:
Choose
from a few
dozen
design
templates.
You can
change
templates at
any time.
100
Part II: Starting a Blog Today 

6. In the pop-up verification window, click OK.
This pop-up window warns that if you switch templates, you will lose
any customizations to your old (current) template. These customiza-
tions are not the settings in the control panel that I have discussed to
this point, or those I discuss later in this section. Blogger is referring to
customized code inserted into the template’s CSS stylesheets. Don’t
know what I’m talking about? Good; the warning doesn’t apply to you.
7. Click the Republish button.
Republishing the blog forces the template change to propagate through
the entire site. If you were to view your Blogger site before republishing,
it would show the old template. If your blog has many entries, republish-
ing could take a minute or two. New blogs republish in a few seconds.
8. Click the View Blog link to see your newly designed site.
The question is, how often should you change your template? Frequent
changes are disconcerting to regular visitors. But occasional changes keep
the site fresh for you, who must look at it more often than anyone else. Every
few months, at the most, is an appropriate guide. It doesn’t hurt to ask your
readers for feedback before and after the change.
101
Chapter 6: Finding a Home in Blogger
Republish, republish, republish
This sidebar is about republishing — could you
tell? I am hammering on this point because it is
a frequent source of confusion among Blogger
users, and I forget about republishing myself
sometimes.
Here is the point: In Blogger (as in many other
blog services), saving changes is not the same
as publishing changes. I’m not talking about
posting entries here. The changes I’m talking
about are in the Settings and Template tabs of
the control panel. Those pages allow you to
make global changes that affect many, or all,
pages of your blog. A three-stage process
effects those changes:
1. Make the changes.
2. Save the changes.
3. Republish the blog.
Even though a Republish button is displayed on
your screen after step 2, it is not particularly big
and people overlook it. If you don’t do step 3, the
changes don’t appear in your blog and you
might rip your hair out wondering why Blogger
isn’t showing your changed settings. If your hair
is ripped out already (from long experience with
computers), you might gnash your teeth. If your
teeth are ground down (from even longer expe-
rience with computers), you might start lashing
out at family and friends. If everyone already
hates you — oh, never mind. Just don’t forget
to republish your blog!

Building your Blogger profile
Perhaps the most important personalization work you can do on your
Blogger blog is creating a profile. The Blogger profile is a page dedicated to
who you are and what you like. The profile page is attached to your blog but
resides outside the chronological organization of the blog. Your profile never
appears on the blog’s index page. Visitors view your profile by clicking the
View my complete profile link in the blog’s sidebar. Figure 6-12 shows my
Blogger profile.
The profile can be as complete or sketchy as you want, within the options
provided by Blogger. A profile setup page is where you determine what infor-
mation about you appears. You can make it easy, or not so easy, for people to
contact you. Specific and direct contact information, such as your address or
phone number, are not profile options.
Profile options are not part of the main control panel; perhaps you have
already noticed that there is no Profile tab in the control panel. This confus-
ing wrinkle might be why many bloggers in the system have blank profiles.
You access your profile setup page through the Blogger Dashboard.
Remember the Dashboard from earlier in the chapter? No? Were you too busy
shredding your brain with caffeine to notice? Wait — that was me. Anyway,
here’s the step-by-step for finding and setting your profile choices, starting
from scratch:
1. Go to Blogger.com and sign in to your blog account.
2. On the Dashboard page, click the Edit Profile link.
The link is in the right sidebar.
3. On the Edit User Profile page, fill in the options you’d like to appear
on your profile page.
Figure 6-13 shows the Edit User Profile page. You need to scroll down to
see some options.
4. Click the Save Profile button.
It’s at the bottom of the page.
5. Click the View Updated Profile link to see your profile page.
You can amend and alter your profile as much as you like, whenever you
like.
An interesting option on the Edit User Profile page might give you pause. It
also might give you indigestion, because Blogger does not make the feature
particularly easy. I’m talking about the feature that lets you add a picture to
your profile. The next section clarifies how to do that.

Chapter 6: Finding a Home in Blogger

Adding a photo to your Blogger profile
Blogger lets you put a photo in your profile, but makes it outrageously com-
plicated. Most blogging services provide a Browse button for finding a photo
in your computer and adding it to your profile. Perhaps you’ve seen those
buttons in certain sites. Blogger puts that button in other places. Yet Blogger
persists in tormenting its users with a convoluted method of adding a profile
photo.
Here is the problem. Notice, on the Edit User Profile page (refer to Figure 6-13),
that Blogger offers to include a photo — if it is already on the Web. The option
asks for a “Photo URL.” That means Blogger wants the Web address of a photo
that has already been posted online. Quite likely, you have a photo of yourself
on your hard drive and have never before uploaded that photo to a Web site.
(If you have posted the photo on another Web site, plug the URL into this
option and be done with it.) This is where Blogger should put the Browse
button, enabling you to locate the photo in your computer and upload it to
your Blogger profile. But noooo.
Enough complaining. There is a way around Blogger’s cumbersome and user-
hostile insufficiency. I intend to make the profile-photo process crystal clear.
If you are familiar with HTML tags, you’ll have no trouble with this. If not,
don’t back away. Take this process one step at a time, and you’ll complete it
with surprising ease. Here we go:
1. On the Edit User Profile page, click the Dashboard link.
You need to back out of the Edit User Profile page and return to the
Dashboard — your starting point when first signing in to your Blogger
account. You can get there also by clicking the Home link at the bottom
of the Edit User Profile page.
2. On the Dashboard page, click the New Post icon.
As you can see, adding a profile photo has something to do with creating
a blog entry. We are going to use the Create page to upload a photo from
your computer to Blogger. This tactic is roundabout, but effective.
3. On the Create page (in the Posting tab), click the Add Image icon.
Clicking causes a pop-up window to appear; the same window you used
to insert a picture in a blog entry (see the preceding section).
4. Using the Browse button, select an image from your computer.
At last, there is the Browse button. Better here than nowhere. At this
point you are following the same steps as those when choosing a picture
to insert in a blog entry. The difference this time is that you are not going
to actually post the blog entry. We are going through this charade to
upload the picture and get it into your profile.
104
Part II: Starting a Blog Today 

5. After selecting your photo and layout, click the Upload Image button.
It doesn’t matter which photo display size you select — small, medium, or
large. Remember, you are not going to actually post this entry. Whichever
setting you choose, the full-size photo is uploaded from your computer to
Blogger.
One important note: The Blogger profile does not accept photo files larger
than 50 kilobytes. That is a small file and an inexplicable limitation. Photo
files in blog entries can be any size, but not so with the profile photo.
Using Windows Explorer, right-click your photo file and select Properties
to check the file size. This size has nothing to do with the size selections
(small, medium, or large) in the uploading window. Blogger always
uploads the full file size, even when altering the display size (small,
medium, or large).
6. In the confirmation window, click the Done button.
7. Back on the Create page, click the Edit Html tab.
Before clicking this tab, you can see your uploaded photo in the entry-
writing box. When you click the Edit Html tab, that photo disappears
and is replaced by a few lines of code.
8. Highlight the URL address of your photo.
This step is the trickiest part, so put down your potato chips and read
carefully. In most cases, the photo URL appears twice, on the second
and fourth lines of code — but different screens show the code in differ-
ent ways. You are looking for a Web address that begins with http://
and is entirely enclosed in quotation marks. If your photo is in the
common JPG format, the final part of the address is .jpg. Highlight 
the entire address but don’t highlight the quotation marks. Figure 6-14
illustrates the HTML code and the highlighting.
9. Use the Ctrl+C keyboard command to copy the highlighted address to
the Windows clipboard.
10. Click the Back to Dashboard link near the upper-right corner of the
page.
You are finished with the Create page; you have what you came for —
namely, an uploaded photo and its address. Now you can abandon the
entry like a sack of rotting potatoes. (The entry, not you.)
11. On the Dashboard page, click the Edit Profile link.
12. On the Edit User Profile page, use the Ctrl+V keyboard combination to
paste the photo URL into the Photo URL box.
13. Scroll down and click the Save Profile button.
14. Click the View Updated Profile link to see your newly photo-enhanced
Blogger profile.
105
Chapter 6: Finding a Home in Blogger

The photo appears in your blog sidebar under the About Me heading, in addi-
tion to appearing on your profile page. Blogger automatically sizes the photo
to fit in the sidebar. A small version is displayed on the profile page, too;
when a visitor clicks that picture, a fill-sized version is displayed on a new
page.
Audioblogging in Blogger
Believe it or not, you can put your actual voice right into a Blogger entry.
Doing so is free to all Blogger users and fairly easy. Blogging in audio is called
audioblogging, and Blogger uses a service called Audioblogger (located at
www.audioblogger.com). Once you get the hang of putting an audio mes-
sage in a blog entry, you can also place one in your profile page.
How does it all work? First you establish an account with Audioblogger
(again, it’s free). Then you call a phone number to record your voice entry.
Your recording, up to five minutes in length, is automatically posted to your
blog within seconds after you hang up. The entry consists of an audioblog-
ging icon; visitors click the icon to hear your recording. The audio file is
recorded in MP3 format; to hear it, a visitor must have MP3-playing software
Figure 6-14:
Highlight the
URL of your
photo, and
then paste it
into the Edit
User Profile
page.
106
Part II: Starting a Blog Today 

on his or her computer. (Such software is installed on nearly all computers
built in the last several years.) When someone clicks the audio file icon in
your blog entry, that software opens and plays your voice entry.
Some people use audioblogging as their main, or sole, type of blog post.
Others use it occasionally and support each audio entry with written text.
You are free to experiment. You might use it only once, or you might fall in
love with blogging in this manner. Follow these steps to set up a free
Audioblogger account:
1. Go to Audioblogger.
2. Click the Start Audioblogging Now button.
3. Log in with your Blogger username and password, and then click the
Continue button.
4. Select the blog in which you want to audioblog from the drop-down
menu, and then click the Continue button.
If you have just one Blogger blog, the selection is obvious.
5. Enter your phone number, type a four-digit identification number,
and then click the Finish Setup button.
Entering a phone number does not restrict you to that number when
audioblogging. But you must remember that number as an identifier,
even though you also create a four-digit ID number. Consider the user-
name plus password combination required in most Web site registra-
tions. In Audioblogger, you can think of your phone number as your
username and the four-digit number as your password. You might have
to wait a few minutes while Audioblogger completes your setup.
At the end of this setup, you might see a confirmation screen, and you might
see a page of incomprehensible gibberish. No fooling. But even if you see gib-
berish, chances are good that your Audioblogger account was set up satisfac-
torily. Try an audio post before you repeat the setup process.
To make an audio entry, call up the Audioblogger dial-in number:
1-415-856-0205
Use any phone, and have your entered phone number handy. Audioblogger’s
robotic assistant asks for that phone number as a kind of username, and then
asks for your PIN as a kind of password. In both cases, you use the phone’s
keypad to enter the numbers. When robot-guy cues you, speak your blog
entry, and then press the phone’s pound key (#) to end the message.
If you have a cell phone, put the Audioblogger phone number in your phone’s
memory. Then you can post an audio entry from anywhere, at any time, with-
out having to recall the number.
107
Chapter 6: Finding a Home in Blogger

Your audio entries (see Figure 6-15) are editable just as your written entries
are. The audio entries appear on the Edit Posts page along with text entries.
You cannot edit the audio, however. You can add a title — I try to do this as
soon as possible, because audio entries get posted without titles. And you
can add text that explains or enhances the audio.
You can add an audio file to your Blogger profile page. Doing so is no easier
than jumping through hoops to add a photo — as I describe in the preceding
section. In fact, the process is pretty much the same:
1. Create an audio entry using Audioblogger.
Your recording should be appropriate for the profile page — perhaps a
brief welcoming message divulging a bit about you or the blog.
2. In your Blogger control panel, click the Posting tab.
3. Click the Edit posts link.
4. Click the Edit button corresponding to your newly created audio
entry.
5. Click the Edit Html tab.
6. Highlight the audio file’s URL.
The URL address ends in .mp3 and is enclosed in quotation marks.

7. Press Ctrl+C to copy the address.
8. Click the Back to Dashboard link near the upper-right corner of 
the page.
9. Click the Edit Profile link.
10. Press Ctrl+V to paste the address into the Audio Clip URL box.
11. Scroll down and click the Save Profile button.
Your audio clip is now featured as a playable link and icon on your profile
page. It does not play automatically when a visitor lands on your profile page;
the visitor must click it, just as with an audio blog entry.
E-mailing Entries to Blogger
Blogger has developed a beautifully simple method of posting entries by e-mail.
Using this feature means you can avoid logging into your Blogger account to
write a post. This feature is convenient for people who keep their e-mail run-
ning on the computer screen all the time. Because e-mail is always handy, post-
ing through that program or Web interface is quicker than signing in to Blogger.
The service is called Mail-to-Blogger, and it works only with text messages —
no pictures. You simply create your own personalized e-mail address on
Blogger’s computer, and Blogger assigns all mail received at that address to
your blog. When you send an e-mail, Blogger makes the e-mail title a blog
entry title, and the body of the e-mail becomes the entry text.
109
Chapter 6: Finding a Home in Blogger
Audioblogger and Audioblog
Two audio blogging services are named similarly,
and operate similarly, so they are sometimes con-
fused. Audioblogger is paired with Blogger.com,
and is free to Blogger users. Audioblog is an inde-
pendent service that charges a monthly fee for
phone-in recording and posting to blogs on any
platform. You can use Audioblog with Blogger, but
you must pay that monthly fee ($4.95 at the time
of this writing).
One advantage of Audioblog over Audioblogger
is that it creates MOV files instead of MP3 files,
and posts the MOV files in a miniature player
right in the blog entry. Most browsers have no
trouble playing these audio entries without the
need for another program to open. That seam-
less performance is a convenience to your
readers. If you intend to audioblog seriously, the
somewhat more sophisticated service offered
by Audioblog is worth considering.

Follow these steps to set it up:
1. In your Blogger control panel, click the Settings tab.
2. In the Settings tab, click the Email link.
3. On the Email page, create your special address in the Mail-to-Blogger
Address box.
You need to think of just one word, because most of the address is set
and unchanging. The first part of the address is your account username;
the last part of the address is the blogger.com domain. You need to
put a word in between, as shown on the page, and it’s best to use a word
that you easily remember — perhaps blog. Or entry. Or pickadilly. Notice
the BlogSend Address box. Put an e-mail address in there if you want to
be notified of your mailed entry being posted.
4. Click the Save Settings button.
You do not need to republish the blog.
5. In your e-mail program or interface, address an e-mail to your special
e-mail address, title and compose the e-mail, and send it.
The body of your e-mail becomes that text of your blog entry.
6. Check your blog for the entry’s appearance.
It can take up to a minute for the mailed entry to be posted.
You can use the Mail-to-Blogger feature from any connected computer and
e-mail program in the world. It doesn’t even have to be your e-mail; Blogger
doesn’t know or care who owns the e-mail account sending the entry to your
special address. That’s why it’s important to keep your special address
secret. Anyone who knows it can post to your blog. If that happens, change
the secret word on the Settings, Email page.
On the Road with Blogger
Mobile blogging, or moblogging (the generalities of which I discuss in Chapter
17), is supported nicely in Blogger Mobile. Blogger Mobile is a free service
included in a standard free Blogger account; you don’t have to sign up for it
separately. You must, however, go through a set of steps to get it working for
you; once through those steps, moblogging to Blogger is easy. You can take a
cell phone that has a built-in camera (a camera phone) and Internet connec-
tivity, snap a picture, send the picture to Blogger, and have it posted to your
blog — all in seconds. You can send text, too, or a mix of text and a picture.
Blogger Mobile uses an unusual but effective method of starting a mobile
blog path for each user. You can start a new blog in your account for mobile
posts, or you can assign mobile posts to an existing blog. (I step you through
110
Part II: Starting a Blog Today 

the exact process here.) First, you send a picture from your cell phone to a
generic, public e-mail address:
go@blogger.com
This e-mail address rejects incoming pictures from non-cell locations. In other
words, you can’t use your normal computer e-mail address (such as an AOL,
Hotmail, Yahoo! Mail, Gmail, Comcast, or Earthlink address) to remotely post
pictures through go@blogger.com. Blogger Mobile works with entries sent
from Verizon, AT&T, Cingular, Sprint, or T-Mobile accounts.
When go@blogger.com receives your first mobile post, it instantly creates a
blog for it. That’s right — Blogger builds an entire blog around one entry and
assigns it a blogspot.com Web address.
At this point, the new blog doesn’t belong to anybody, even though it displays
your entry. You have to claim the new blog to your account, either keeping it as
a separate blog or assigning the entry (and future mobile entries) to an existing
blog in your account. Blogger Mobile sends a claim token to the cell phone that
sent the entry — that would be your cell phone. You enter the claim token on a
special Blogger Mobile page and take control of the new blog. At that moment,
you can make the new blog disappear and put the first entry into an existing
blog or keep the new blog and rename it.
That’s the general process; here are the specific steps:
1. Send a text message or picture to go@blogger.com.
Check your camera phone’s user manual to find out how to send 
pictures to e-mail addresses. Within a minute (at most) of sending,
Blogger Mobile sends back a text message containing a claim token.
That message is sent to your cell phone, not to your computer e-mail.
2. Read the text message sent to your cell phone by Blogger, and write
down the claim token.
The claim token is a short string of letters and numbers. Blogger also
sends the Web address of the new blog created around your first entry;
you can visit the blog but can’t access its controls until you claim it 
as yours.
3. In your computer browser, go to go.blogger.com.
4. Type your token in the Claim Token box, type the correct word in the
Verification box, and then click the Continue button.
The Mobile Blog Found page appears, showing your Blogger sign-in 
username.
5. Click the Continue as this user link.
6. On the Claim Mobile Blog page, choose to keep the new blog or switch
to your existing blog, and then click the Continue button.
111
Chapter 6: Finding a Home in Blogger

In this example, I am keeping the new blog, not switching. If you do
switch, your mobile post is transferred to the existing blog, and future
mobile posts go to the existing blog. Of course, you have access to that
blog’s controls. Keeping the new blog (not switching) separates mobile
posts from regular posts, for better or worse.
7. On the Name Your Blog page, select a blog title and domain address,
and then click the Continue button.
Naming and addressing the blog should remind you of how you first
started in Blogger. Name the blog whatever you want. The address will
be something like mymobilepics.blogspot.com. You type only the
first part of that address; blogspot.com is the default and unchange-
able domain.
8. On the Choose a Template page, click the radio button below your
selected template design, and then click the Continue button.
9. On the You’re Done page, click the View Blog Now button.
You’re off and running with a new mobile blog. (See Figure 6-16.)
Now that your mobile blogging setup is complete, you can continue sending
pictures, text, and pictures-plus-text entries from your camera phone to go@
blogger.com. Blogger Mobile knows that incoming entries from your phone
belong to your Blogger account, and directs them to the blog you selected.

T
ypePad is a commercial blog service with fairly powerful site-building and
entry-writing tools and no installation hassle. Your blog, and the control
screens through which you operate the blog, all reside on TypePad comput-
ers, not your computer. You pay a monthly or annual fee for a chunk of server
space and access to the administrative controls. Three levels of service offer
three levels of power and flexibility.
TypePad is operated by the same company that created Movable Type (see
Chapter 9) and the social network LiveJournal (see Chapter 5). TypePad holds
down the middle ground between the other two, with Movable Type being the
most advanced product. Movable Type is a powerful Web-publishing applica-
tion, and TypePad bears the unmistakable resemblance of a younger sibling.
TypePad blogs look somewhat like Movable Type blogs and share many fea-
tures. TypePad is enormously easier to manage, from start to finish.
Easier, but not necessarily easy. If TypePad is a stripped-down version of
Movable Type, you can also think of it as a bulked-up alternative to Blogger.
com (see Chapter 6). I think most people would regard Blogger.com as the
easier blogging platform, but the two services — TypePad and Blogger —
stand at roughly the same place in the blog-service hierarchy. If you’re look-
ing for a dedicated hosted blogging platform, you should read both this 
chapter and the Blogger chapter before deciding which to use.

Signing Up with TypePad
Although I am putting sign-up information near the beginning of this chapter,
you might want to look through the chapter first to see whether you like 
the look of TypePad. By this I mean not only the look of TypePad’s control
screens but the look of TypePad blogs currently in publication. The descrip-
tions and screen shots in these pages give you a good idea of the blogging
experience through TypePad. Here are three sites that show off a few results:
 Ed in Europe (http://edineurope.typepad.com): A travel blog, Ed
in Europe combines written entries with plenty of photos, thereby
making good use of TypePad’s integration of text and images. (See Figure
7-1.)
 The Cathrows (www.thecathrows.com): This family blog is all about
the pictures. The Cathrows use what’s called a mixed media layout to
emphasize their photo albums; the blog contains no written entries at 
all except a welcome message on the home page. (See Figure 7-2.)
 The 80/20 Rule (willsheward.typepad.com): Will Sheward writes a 
serious current events and opinion blog from Germany (in English). His
thoughtful and articulate work is all text, no photos. (See Figure 7-3.)

Chapter 7: Creating a TypePad Blog

To see more representative TypePad blogs, go to the TypePad site and
browse through the list of recently updated sites.
Starting your TypePad account
TypePad usually offers a free 30-day trial. To get started, go to the main site:
www.typepad.com
Click the big Start Free Trial button, and begin working your way through the
sign-up forms. You do need to provide credit card information in these forms,
but you’ll be glad to know that — unlike some online services — it is easy to
cancel the service before the trial period is over.
The one section of the sign-in forms that should give you pause is the part in
which you choose a domain name (see Figure 7-4). At this point, you are not
registering a new domain name that can be hosted at any Web hosting com-
pany (see Chapter 8). In fact, you are really choosing a subdomain name that
gets attached to one of TypePad’s domains.
Figure 7-4:
Choose a
subdomain
word, which
becomes
part of your
blog’s Web
address,
or URL.
116
Part II: Starting a Blog Today 

TypePad’s two domains are
 typepad.com; your domain would be yourdomain.typepad.com
 blogs.com; your domain would be yourdomain.blogs.com
Use the drop-down menu to choose typepad.com or blogs.com, and then
choose a subdomain name. This choice is irrevocable, so don’t be capricious.
The only way to change your subdomain is to cancel the account (discarding
any blogging you had done) and start over.
The subdomain that you choose when signing up serves as an anchor name
for all your blogs if you have two or more (see the service levels in the 
next section). Imagine that John and Alice Smith want to blog together and
also blog individually. They start three TypePad blogs, called Our Family
Blog, John Smith, and Alice Smith. The account holding these three blogs 
is assigned just one subdomain, selected by Alice. Each blog is located in a
folder attached to the main domain that includes their subdomain. Here is
what the three Web addresses look like:
subdomain.typepad.com/ourfamilyblog
subdomain.typepad.com/johnsmith
subdomain.typepad.com/alicesmith
As you can see, the subdomain is not yet chosen. When signing up for an
account, Alice should keep in mind that the subdomain is part of the Web
address for each of the three blogs, so it shouldn’t be too individual or
unique to her. If, for example, she were to choose alicemom as the sub-
domain, the Web address of John’s blog would be:
alicemom.typepad.com/johnsmith
A better subdomain would be smithfamily, or some other choice that would
apply well to each blog.
Although you cannot change your subdomain after signing up, you can change
the names of the folders assigned to each new blog. When you start a second
blog, the default folder-naming process makes the choice for you. What might
escape your attention is that you can change the default folder name (identi-
cal to your subdomain name). Going back to Alice and John, let’s imagine that
Alice chose smithfamily as the subdomain during sign-up. Alice and John
intend to call their joint blog Our Family Blog, but the default Web address 
of that blog would now be:
smithfamily.typepad.com/smithfamily
117
Chapter 7: Creating a TypePad Blog

There’s nothing terribly wrong with that, and the Smiths might even prefer to
leave it for simplicity’s sake. But if they want the folder name to match the
blog name (Our Family Blog, which is displayed on the site’s banner), that
folder name should be changed to ourfamilyblog.
If you want to change the default folder name of the first blog (that’s the
default blog TypePad sets up immediately after sign-up), you should do so
before you start blogging. If you change any folder name after posting entries
to that blog, you mess up any existing links to archives and photo albums.
You don’t actually lose anything you’ve written, but the functionality of
everything posted before the change is compromised. See the “Setting Up
Your Blog” section, later in this chapter.
Choosing a service level
TypePad offers three service levels: Basic, Plus, and Pro. They are essentially
the same product, with varying amounts of storage space on the server and
certain features withheld from the Basic and Plus levels. You must choose a
subscription level when signing up, but that doesn’t prevent you from cancel-
ing during the free trial or changing your subscription level at any time.
Price is perhaps the most obvious differentiator among the plans, along 
with storage space, the number of permitted blogs, and the number of per-
mitted authors. Currently, the plans break down as follows in these important
categories:
 Basic: $4.95 per month for a single Weblog, 100 megabytes of space, and
one author. No other name but yours can be associated with a blog post.
 Plus: $8.95 per month for three Weblogs, 500 megabytes of space, and
three authors.
 Pro: $14.95 for an unlimited number of blogs and authors, squeezing
into one gigabyte of space.
Note: These terms are fluid. By the time you read this, the storage limits
might have been raised; they have been raised before.
On the face of it, the Basic plan would seem to be best for a single blogger
whose family or friends don’t want to participate. The Plus plan, with three
permitted authors, is an effective family arrangement. Plus also works for an
ambitious solo blogger with a lot to write about. Another application of the
three blogs allowed by Plus would be a written blog for one, a photo blog for
another, and a moblog (mobile blog) for the third. As long as I’m brainstorm-
ing, how about this: A couple makes one joint blog, and each also gets a solo
blog. Or a family takes one blog for day-to-day entries and uses the other two
as a vacation blog and a special events blog.
118
Part II: Starting a Blog Today 

Believe it or not, the Pro package can be appropriate for single bloggers who
care about Pro’s design features. (I’ll get to them in a bit.) When you consider
that hosting a Web site can easily cost $12 to $20 a month, TypePad’s cost is
reasonable for a single blog allowance of blogs and authors in many ways.
Five features, that may or may not be important to you, are withheld from the
Basic service:
 Custom design: TypePad is capable of three types of custom page design.
At the most basic level, Plus and Pro users can choose from a selection of
preset color themes and design templates. Changing from one to another
is simple, and the entire blog is transformed after the change. At a higher
level, Pro users can rewrite the HTML and CSS code that underlies the
blog pages. This feature is for advanced page builders only; for them, it 
is perhaps essential.
 Scheduled posts: Plus and Pro customers can back-date and forward-
date their entries. This might seem trivial, but forward-dating, in part-
icular, enables the blogger to store up entries in advance during free
time, and then let them fall into the blog in a measured fashion.
 Domain mapping: This technique enables users to blog at TypePad 
using a purchased domain (www.yourdomain.com). Chapter 8 discusses
domains and hosting. If you have a domain and have parked it at a regis-
trar that allows advanced DNS management, you can arrange for browsers
seeking your domain to be taken directly to your TypePad blog. TypePad
provides a sample e-mail for inquiring at your registrar about this service.
Using Plus, you can map three domains to three blogs; Pro users can map
an unlimited number of domains to an equal number of blogs.
 Search and replace: This feature enables Pro users to search through 
the entire blog for specified words or phrases, and automatically replace
them with other text. Not, perhaps, the most essential feature. But if you
misspelled your wife’s name throughout your blog, you’d want to replace
each instance with the correct spelling before checking the classifieds for
bachelor apartments.
 Text ads: TypePad offers a packaged service of Google text ads, turning
the blog into an AdSense publisher and perhaps making a few bucks. (See
Chapter 15 for more on blogging revenue and Google AdSense.) TypePad
doesn’t advertise it too loudly, but Basic and Plus users can work Google
ads into their blog sidebars, customizing the ad placement more than the
packaged service allows; doing so is complicated and difficult.
This chapter is written in the viewpoint of a Plus user, partly because it’s
important to cover custom design available in Plus (and Pro) accounts.
Additionally, TypePad handles shared elements among multiple Plus blogs 
in unexpected ways, and this chapter untangles those idiosyncrasies.

Chapter 7: Creating a TypePad Blog

Setting Up Your Blog
After completing the sign-up process, you have a TypePad account, and for
the remainder of the chapter I’m going to blithely assume it’s a Plus account,
and that you plan to operate two or three blogs. Immediately after signing up
and starting your trial, TypePad shows you an overview of your blog’s con-
trol panel. (See Figure 7-5.) This is the last time you’ll see this particular page;
from this point onward, you’ll be working with a system of control pages
within tabs. There, you do everything described in the remainder of this
chapter.
The basic method of posting to a TypePad blog is through the TypePad site.
(You can also use a bookmarklet, as described later in this chapter.) If you
are surfing the Web and blogging at the same time, it’s a good idea to keep
one browser window or tab anchored at your TypePad control panel. That
way, your administrative tools are always available to you, and you don’t
have to repeatedly visit the TypePad site to post entries.
Before posting any entries, tempting though it is to blast your way into the
blogosphere, you should take the time to configure your blog. The settings
described in this section can be revisited at any time, but these basic config-
urations are meant to be selected sooner rather than later.

Three Tip icons in a row? I am nothing if not tipful. Or maybe tipsy. Anyway, I
advise perseverance at this stage; you’re going to need it. TypePad’s adminis-
trative layout is not without logic, but the logic isn’t immediately apparent. 
At first, it might seem as if you have to hunt through tabs within tabs for
every little thing. This chapter directs you to the important functions, but 
the layout won’t feel truly comfortable until you can toss me aside and work
on your own. A few days of poking around are required before the layout of
TypePad’s features coheres in your mind.
As you can see in Figure 7-5, the TypePad administrative area has four main
tabs: Weblogs, Photo Albums, TypeLists, and Control Panel. To configure
your blog, follow these steps:
1. Click the Weblogs tab.
Four tabs are revealed within the Weblogs tab.
2. Click the Configure tab.
Five more tabs!
3. Click the Weblog Basics tab.
4. Make your selections on this page (see Figure 7-6 and the description
after this list), and click the Save Changes button.

Chapter 7: Creating a TypePad Blog

5. When the page reloads, click the Publish My Site button.
This is your first encounter with an important distinction between
saving changes and publishing changes. Publishing your saved changes
re-creates every page of the blog affected by the changes. As your blog
grows bigger, publishing changes takes longer. As I describe later, your
blog entries don’t have to go through this two-layered save/publish
process, thank goodness. Likewise, you can change themes and layouts
(also described later) with a single click.
6. In the pop-up window, click the Publish button.
This extra step is, by any measure, ridiculous.
7. When the pop-up window says your files have been published, click
the Close button.
I like TypePad, but this unnecessary clicking is foolish.
Fortunately, TypePad keeps navigation pretty clear at all times, so you 
can always see where you are in the box-within-a-box system of nested 
tabs. I would prefer a list or drop-down menu so you could go directly to 
an inner tab, but for some reason the TypePad people are not calling me 
up for suggestions.
Anyway, let’s look at the settings on the Weblogs, Configure, Weblog Basics
page, which is also shown in Figure 7-6:
 Weblog name: Type the name that you want to appear in the banner
atop your pages.
 Weblog description/catchphrase: This tagline goes below your Weblog
name on the page. (See Figure 7-7.)
 Weblog folder name: I discussed blog folders earlier in this chapter.
TypePad assigns a folder name that matches your subdomain, but you
are free to change it. Your default blog (which starts out being the first
blog you create but can be changed if you create more blogs) always
appears to visitors who type the domain without a folder in the address:
yourdomain.typepad.com. The site also appears to anyone who types
the domain with the folder after a slash, like this: yourdomain.type
pad.com/yourdomain. (Second and third blogs need the folder in the
address.) There is no need to change the default folder name; but if you
want to change it, do so now, before you start posting entries.
After publishing your changes, you might be tempted to click the View
Weblog link to see how your newborn site is coming along. The link is there,
but TypePad won’t let you see anything until you write and post an entry.
Skip ahead if you like, or follow me through the next short section about 
personalizing your profile.
122
Part II: Starting a Blog Today 

Personalizing Your Blog Profile
Your blog might divulge a lot about you, and you also might want to give 
visitors an easy way to quickly know who you are. Like many blog services,
TypePad offers a Profile section for filling in personal information. A link 
to the Author Profile appears (if you want it to) in the blog’s sidebar as an
About link. You can provide a picture of yourself (or somebody else, if that
gives you a kick) under the About header.
Create your profile like this:
1. Click the Control Panel tab.
2. Click the Profile tab.
3. If you want to assign a photo to your profile, click the Browse button,
select a photo, and then click the Open button.
4. Scroll down to fill in Your Interests, Your Extended Biography, and
Your One-Line Biography.
All of these fields are optional. Fill in as complete or sketchy a profile as
you want.
Figure 7-7:
The blog
title and
description
appear at
the top of
every page.
123
Chapter 7: Creating a TypePad Blog

Figure 7-8 illustrates a profile page that displays when a visitor clicks the
About link in a TypePad blog. This particular About page shows all the avail-
able information fields from the Profile page, but it’s not unusual to see far
sketchier information.
The profile information you enter is attached to your entire account, not to a
specific blog. This means that Plus and Pro users who maintain two or more
blogs should write a profile that applies equally to all the blogs — if you
intend to use an About link in your sidebar. (See the section later in this chap-
ter called “Filling Your Sidebars.”)
Blogging Entries in TypePad
Having set up your blog with basic configuration settings, you’re ready to
post your first TypePad entry. Follow these steps:
1. From anywhere in your TypePad account, click the Weblogs tab.
2. In the Weblogs tab, click the Post tab.
There are tabs in this tab, too, but the one you want — the New Post 
tab — is selected by default. Figure 7-9 shows this page.
Figure 7-8:

124
Part II: Starting a Blog Today 

3. In the Title field, type a title for your entry.
4. In the Category drop-down menu, select a category.
You can assign any entry to one or more categories. TypePad comes
loaded with about a dozen preset categories that are too broad to be
useful; effective categories are narrow subdivisions of broader subjects.
You can manage your blog categories (though you don’t have to use
them at all) on the Weblogs, Configure, Categories page. For now, you
can get started with the Category drop-down menu on the New Post
page by either selecting a preset or choosing the Add a New Category
selection. Doing the latter displays a pop-up window in which you can
create a category for the current post; that category remains available
for future posts.
5. In the Post Body form, write your entry.
Like many e-mail services, TypePad gives you one-click control of basic
formatting such as bold, italic, underline, bullets, numbered lists, and
font colors. It’s generally best to keep formatting to a minimum in blog
entries and remember that underlined words look like links. When you
want to embed a link, highlight a word or group of words, and then use
the Insert Link button (roll your mouse over the buttons to find it).
Figure 7-9:
This is
where you

125
Chapter 7: Creating a TypePad Blog

6. Click the Save button.
The Preview button shows what the entry will look like in the blog, but
there is little reason to use this button unless you’ve inserted lots of for-
matting. As long as the Posting Status menu shows Publish Now, your
entry appears in your live blog as soon as the New Post page reloads.
If you write long posts, consider breaking them into two parts. Many bloggers
split up posts to keep their index pages from stretching to accommodate
many lengthy entries. Breaking the post gives the reader the option of seeing
the entire thing; TypePad makes it easy for the reader by automatically pro-
viding a link to the full entry.
To break your entry, you need two message-writing forms, called Post
Introduction and Post Continuation. Click the Customize the display of 
this page link to place these two fields on your New Post page. A pop-up
window appears (see Figure 7-10). Scroll down the window to the Post 
Screen Configuration section and click the Custom radio button.
You have several screen items available:
 Extended Post: This is the one we’re after. Check Extended Post to place
the second message-writing form on the New Post screen.
 Excerpt: This selection puts another text box on the New Post page, 
in which you can compose an excerpt for partial-entry RSS feed and
TrackBack excerpts. If you do not use the Excerpt box, TypePad clips
the first 40 words of the entry for both purposes.
Figure 7-10:
Use this
pop-up to
determine
which
options
appear on
the New
Post page.
126
Part II: Starting a Blog Today 

 Keywords: The Keywords text box, when placed on the New Post page,
gives you a chance to assign searchable words to your entries. Keywords
are not visible in the blog, but they are associated with the entry to make
it easier to find when searching. The search box is located at the upper-
right of the New Post page.
 Text Formatting: A little-used feature, text formatting prevents the use
of bold type, italics, colored fonts, bullets, and numbered lists. If you use
text formatting, you must create links by writing out the HTML code.
 TrackBack URLs to Ping: You need this field on the New Post page if you
want to place a TrackBack on another blog’s entry page. (See Chapter 3
for more about TrackBacks.) Enter the TrackBack URL (not the other
blog’s entry-page URL) in this box.
Click the Save button after making your selections. The pop-up window dis-
appears and the New Post reloads to show your selections.
Near the bottom of the New Post page is a drop-down Comments menu that
enables you to turn comments on (Open) or off (None) on a per-entry basis.
The Closed selection pertains to already posted entries and serves to pre-
vent further commenting.
You can schedule a post for the future or even date it in the past. TypePad
makes no judgments about the here and now; all dates are equal in its eyes.
TypePad’s job is to file entries in chronological order. Use the Posting Status
drop-down menu and select Publish On to pop up a calendar and clock (see
Figure 7-11). Set your time and date, and then click the Set Time button. You
still must click the Save button on the New Post page to publish your entry.

Chapter 7: Creating a TypePad Blog

TypePad Themes and Layouts
Some people don’t care a whit about site design; others obsess about the
colors and layout of their blogs. I lean to the latter camp, but I recognize the
time-wasting danger in spending too many hours playing with the design of
every little page element. TypePad supports your need to tweak at whatever
level.
After signing in, your default blog is set up with a default theme (colors) and
default layout (number of sidebars and position of page elements). You don’t
need to do a thing; TypePad will present a decent looking blog. Many people
use those defaults, and their blogs are instantly recognizable as TypePad
blogs.
128
Part II: Starting a Blog Today 
Posting to TypePad from any site
The default method of posting to a TypePad blog
is through the TypePad site, which furnishes the
extensive administrative area that this chapter
describes. But the truth is, it’s a hassle to log in to
TypePad every time you want to post. You can
keep a browser window or tab anchored at
TypePad, as I suggested earlier in the chapter, but
that, too, is an extra step and clutters your screen.
The solution to browser clutter is a bookmarklet.
Bookmarklets are tiny programs that reside on
your browser’s toolbar. They are simple buttons
with a little built-in functionality. The TypePad
bookmarklet generates a pop-up posting window
with a ready-made link to the site currently dis-
played in your browser. This function is handy
when you want to key a blog entry to a page of
news or another blog post. You can post an entry
from any Web page, circumventing the TypePad
site entirely.
Follow these steps to set up the bookmarklet,
which TypePad calls QuickPost:
1. In your TypePad administrative area, Click
the Weblogs tab.
2. Click the Set up QuickPost bookmarklet
link.
3. Select options that will appear in the
QuickPost pop-up window.
4. Click the Create button.
5. Using your mouse, drag the TypePad
QuickPost link to your browser’s toolbar. In
Firefox, you must have the Bookmarks tool-
bar visible.
The bookmarklet is now active, living on the
toolbar, as shown in the figure. Click it on it
when visiting any page to write a blog entry that
contains a link to that page. Note that pop-up
blockers, which are built into many browser
toolbars (such as Google Toolbar) and browsers
themselves (such as Firefox), can prevent
TypePad QuickPost from popping open its post-
ing window. You might have to disable pop-up
blocking on any page from which you want to
write a blog entry.

A little individuality can easily be gained by choosing among several preset
themes and layouts, combining them to you heart’s content. It’s fun. You can
change your site’s appearance at any stage; all themes are compatible. Layouts
come in two groups, and all the designs within each group are compatible. A
great deal more individuality is obtained by creating your own theme, which is
then imposed upon your chosen layout. Having built a custom theme, you can
change layouts beneath that theme.
Creating a custom theme does not require any knowledge of HTML or CSS
coding. TypePad supplies a fun and easy tool for altering all background
colors, typefaces, borders, and border widths. If you want ultimate control, 
a Pro account is required to get your hands directly on the HTML.
Choosing TypePad themes and layouts
To be clear, TypePad’s two basic design templates are
 Themes: Themes involve color more than structure. Minor structural
elements such as the size of the top banner and the width of sidebar
borders are part of themes. But mainly, when you choose a theme, you
are choosing a color scheme.
 Layouts: Layouts involve structure, not color. Your layout choice deter-
mines whether you have one sidebar next to your blog entries or two
sidebars surrounding your entries. Or no sidebars.
You can choose from two types of layout: classic layouts and mixed media
layouts. Classic layouts are for text-oriented blogs where the main content 
is written. These blogs do take uploaded photos, but the layout puts photos
around the edges. Mixed media layouts are more photocentric. Some of these
layouts take standard written entries, but three of them do not feature an
index page of recently posted entries.
To experiment with different preset themes and layouts, follow this path:
1. Click the Weblogs tab.
2. Click the Design tab.
You are on the Edit Current page.
3. Click the Change Theme link.
The next page defaults to Pre-defined Theme, not Custom Theme. 
Leave it that way. At this point, you can see five possible themes (see
Figure 7-12). Use the pull-down menu to see categories of themes.
4. In any theme category, select the radio button below a theme.
129
Chapter 7: Creating a TypePad Blog

5. Click the Save Changes button.
The newly selected theme is saved but not yet applied to your blog.
6. Click the Preview button or the Republish Weblog button.
The Preview button displays a pop-up window showing what your site
will look like with the new theme. The Republish Weblog button applies
the theme to the blog. You can change themes as often and frequently 
as you like. When testing many themes, save time by previewing before
republishing.
Now move on to selecting a layout. Follow the same process as changing your
theme, but start by selecting Change Layout on the Edit Current page. Again,
use the Preview button to audition multiple layouts. (See Figure 7-13.)
Creating a TypePad template
A template is a theme/layout combination with additional content selections.
These content selections determine what gets placed in your site’s sidebars.
In TypePad terminology, content does not mean blog entries; it means photos,
lists, archive links, blogrolls, and other information modules that get placed
on sidebars. You choose among the available content groups, and then deter-
mine the order in which they appear on your sidebar(s).
Figure 7-12:

a theme

130
Part II: Starting a Blog Today 

Creating an entire template takes more time than merely changing the theme
or layout. At some point, you probably want to take the time to make those
content selections, and then create the actual content that goes in the mod-
ules. The following steps walk you through the basic process:
1. Click the Weblogs tab.
2. Click the Design tab.
3. Click the Create New tab.
4. Select a layout, and then click the Step 2: Select the Content for Your
Weblog button.
These layouts are identical to the selection in Change Layout.
5. Select your content modules, and then click the Step 3: Order Your
Weblog Content button.
This is an important page, one that I return to in the “Filling Your
Sidebars” section. Keep reading after this walkthrough for notes about
the content choices. Also, look at Figure 7-14 to see a portion of this page.
6. Drag the content bars with your mouse to order them on your sidebar,
and then click the Step 4: Customize Your Weblog’s Style button.
Only the modules selected in Step 5 appear here. See Figure 7-15.

7. Select a theme, and then click the Step 5: Save Your Template button.
8. Fill in the Name and Description fields for this template, and then
click the Save This Design button or the Apply This Design button.
The second button republishes the blog with your new template.
Let’s examine the screen in which you choose content for your sidebars. 
The Content Selections page is a long page. Some items are self-explanatory
or well explained by the accompanying notes. Here are my suggestions:
 Weblog Date Header: For some reason, this box is deselected by
default, even though most blogs use daily date headers on the index
page. Even if you use the date in the footer (see that check box and pull-
down menu to select a footer format for each entry), you might want to
use the date header.
 Categories: When you get a couple dozen posts, I recommend displaying
your categories in the sidebar. They appear as links, making it easy for
visitors to read entries of particular interest.
 Recent Comments: If you are creating a discussion forum, you probably
want to highlight recent comments. I have found those links quite useful
when visiting TypePad blogs.
 About Page Link: This link displays your author profile, and its box is
checked by default. That’s why you see so many TypePad blogs with
blank About pages; the bloggers haven’t filled in their profile information
and don’t realize that the About link is turned on. Fill in your profile on
the Profile tab (which you get to by clicking the Control Panel tab).
 Online Status: This feature also connects with the blogger’s profile, in
which you can identify the instant messaging system you use. If you list
an IM program and if you select this box, TypePad alerts visitors when
you are available through your chosen IM service.
 Email Link: I keep this turned off, preferring communication in the form
of comments.
 Subscribe Link: This feature makes it easy for other bloggers to add
your blog to their blogroll, which in TypePad lingo is a kind of TypeList.
(I get to TypeLists later.)
 Syndicate Link: This link is for your RSS feed and should definitely be
turned on.
 Podcast Link: If you are not creating podcasts, you should ignore this
setting and leave it deselected.
 Recent Updates: Select this box if you want links to other people’s blogs,
as chosen by TypePad, appearing in your sidebar. That’s a bit too com-
munal for me; I like to choose my own sidebar content.
133
Chapter 7: Creating a TypePad Blog

 Powered by TypePad Link: You are paying for this service, so you
shouldn’t feel that you must assist the advertising efforts of your service
provider. The box is selected by default.
 Feeds: Great feature, this. If you want to include content from other
sources in your sidebar, copy the RSS feed address here. Just click the
Add a new feed link and paste the feed address into the pop-up window;
entire blog entries from that feed appear in your sidebar. This feature
works best with headline-only feeds, but I’ve seen blogs running full-
entry feeds from other sources in their sidebars. (See Figure 7-16.) It
gives the appearance of an info-packed site. (By the way, see Chapter 13
for a full discussion of feeds.)
 Your Photo Albums: When you create photo albums, this feature lists
them, each with a check box for inclusion in your sidebar. Each album
that you include displays the most recently added photo in the side-
bar — not the entire album. See the “Putting Photos in Your TypePad
Blog” section, later in this chapter.

Creating a custom theme
If you want to get in up to your elbows with page design, use the Custom
Theme tools. Here’s how:
1. Click the Weblogs tab.
2. Click the Design tab.
3. Click the Change Theme link.
4. Click the radio button next to Custom Theme.
Now you see four groups of page elements waiting to be customized, as
shown in Figure 7-17.
5. Click one of the four Edit This Element buttons.
A pop-up window displays your customization tools. Use the color selec-
tors and drop-down menus to alter each page element. The thumbnail
diagrams illustrate the changes you make as you go along.

6. Click the Save Changes button.
7. Click another Edit This Element button, as in Step 5, and repeat.
8. Click the Preview button each time you save your changes to see how
your design is coming along.
Creating a custom theme is trickier than it might appear, but it’s a lot of fun.
Your custom design is always saved as a work in progress, as long as you use
the Save Changes button. Click the Manage Your Designs tab to switch from
one saved design to another.
Putting Photos in Your TypePad Blog
TypePad is photo-friendly. You get photos into your blog in two ways:
 Create a photo album and upload photos into it.
 Insert a photo into a blog post.
Photo albums generate separate pages specially designed for viewing photos.
Your normal blog design does not carry over to photo album pages. You can
link from your sidebar to your photo albums, and you can put several photos
in your sidebar in a couple of ways (neither of them particularly convenient,
unfortunately).
Creating a photo album
You can create as many photo albums as you want and have an unlimited
number of photos in each. Your TypePad account does have memory limita-
tions, though, which might restrict voluminous photo uploading. If you are
using a classic layout, you presumably want to leave room for blog posts. It’s
important to remember, though, that written posts take much less memory
than photos, so you can safely use a healthy portion of your allotment on
photos. You can see how much account space you are consuming in the
Overview section of the Control Panel tab.
Creating a TypePad photo album with your digital photos requires several
steps, but they are not difficult:
1. Click the Photo Albums tab.
2. Under Create a New Photo Album, on the right (see Figure 7-18), fill in
the album name and folder name, and select whether it will be public.
The folder name needn’t be the same as the album name, but confusion
will probably beset you if they are different.
136
Part II: Starting a Blog Today 

3. Click the Create button.
4. Click the Add photos to this album link.
5. Click a Browse button.
This page assumes you want to upload more than one photo. It doesn’t
matter which Browse button you click first. Each Browse button locates
a single photo on your hard drive.
6. Select a photo from your hard drive, and click the Open button.
7. Click the Upload button.
Wait for a pop-up window to pop up, as pop-up windows are wont to do.
Then wait a little longer as the photo is uploaded. Turns out, the only
purpose of the pop-up window is to notify you of the uploading progress.
The pop-up window closes (pops down?) when the upload is complete.
8. Click a photo to name it and caption it.
TypePad displays the filename of each uploaded photo. When photos
are transferred from a digital camera to a computer, the resulting file-
names are often numbers (see Figure 7-19). Whatever the case, you can
leave that original name or rename the picture. On the renaming page,
use the Photo Cloning section to copy the picture to other, already exist-
ing photo albums in your account. Unfortunately, cloning literally makes
a copy of the photo, using more memory. Far better would be a tagging
system whereby a single photo could virtually reside in multiple albums.
Figure 7-18:
This page
lists your
existing
photo
albums and

137
Chapter 7: Creating a TypePad Blog

9. Click the Save button.
You could click the Save and Publish button, but publishing takes time.
You might as well wait until you’ve finished naming and captioning the
last uploaded photo, and then use the Save and Publish button to pub-
lish the whole lot. Publishing makes your photo album live, online. If you
made the photo album public, TypePad.com places the album on its
recently updated album list for all to see.
10. If you want to upload another photo, go back to Step 5.
11. When you’ve finished uploading photos, click the Save and Publish
button.
Publishing makes your photo album live, online. If you made the photo
album public, TypePad places the album on its recently updated album
list for all to see.
Photos albums are directly accessible on the Web by using your domain and
album folder name. The following example illustrates how the direct address
works, using a fictional album folder called Vacation:
subdomain.typepad.com/photos/vacation
Figure 7-19:
TypePad

name is a

138
Part II: Starting a Blog Today 

Note that you must insert /photos/directory between the domain name
and after your TypePad domain name. In the preceding example, subdomain
would be replaced by the name of your subdomain.
You can adjust the presentation of each photo album. Click the Design tab
within the Photo Albums tab to adjust the layout, style, and content of the
album. Making these choices is not unlike choosing a layout and theme for
your blog, as described earlier. Each album can have different design charac-
teristics. Here’s what goes into your three design sets:
 Click the Layout link. There, as you see in Figure 7-20, you select a 
structural layout for the album’s cover page and another layout for the
album’s photo page. The cover page displays an overview of the album,
showing either a collection of album thumbnails or one big picture used
as a teaser. The photo pages result when a photo is clicked; a caption and
descriptive material can be displayed with a large view of that photo —
plus thumbnails of the other album photos, if you like. The layout of each
photo page within an album is identical.
 Click the Style link. There, as shown in Figure 7-21, you select from a
range of colorful themes. The structure of the photo album pages, deter-
mined by your layout choice, is not altered here. Use the pull-down
menu to audition the styles; the sample screen shots change every time
you click a style from the list.
139
Chapter 7: Creating a TypePad Blog
Shared photo albums
Your photo albums belong to your TypePad
account and can be accessed by all the blogs in
that (Plus or Pro) account. This arrangement has
good points and bad. On the good side, your var-
ious blogs can share photos without having to
upload them more than once, taking up valuable
memory. That consideration is the major reason
for arranging photo albums in this manner. On the
bad side, the shared-album configuration pre-
vents TypePad from allowing the automatic dis-
play of photos from albums in a blog’s sidebar.
TypePad does not have a command or setting
that puts an uploaded album photo into the side-
bar with no effort on your part. That’s because
TypePad wouldn’t know which blog you wanted
the photo in and which blog you didn’t want the
photo in.
I hope TypePad devises an easy way to correct
this inconvenience. In the meantime, there is a
somewhat awkward way to manually place
album photos in the sidebar: You must create a
TypeList of links to individual photos in your
albums. I cover TypeLists in this chapter. An
easier but not necessarily desirable way to auto-
matically place a photo in the sidebar is to insert
the photo in a blog entry. This strategy works if
you choose a mixed media layout, not a classic
layout. Recently posted photos appear in mixed
media layouts with no effort on your part. In mixed
media blogs, you often see entries with many
photos embedded in them; it’s the quickest way
to get those photos in the sidebar of every page in
the blog. At this writing, you can’t automatically
stream photos from a photo album or from blog
posts into the sidebar of classic layouts.

 Click the Content link. On this page you determine which types of con-
tent accompany the displays of your photos. For example, you might
want to show photo captions but not photo descriptions. Or you might
prefer captions and descriptions, but no locations (where the photos
were taken). In each case, you should be prepared to fill in whatever
information blocks you choose, whenever you upload new photos. Note
that, on this page, you make one set of decisions for the album cover
page and another set of overlapping decisions for the photo pages.
You might think, after all this design manipulation of your photo album, that
no other configurations would be necessary. Indeed, none are . . . but more
fine-tuning of how your album works is possible. Click the Configure tab
(within the Photo Albums tab) to see what awaits finicky perfectionists:
 In Photo Album Basics, you have a chance to change the basic photo
album settings that you created when first making the album: name,
description, and whether the album is public. You can also upload a
photo that isn’t in your album to act as a cover-page image.
 In Advanced Configuration, you can set the size of your thumbnail dis-
plays, how many columns of thumbnails will be shown for large albums,
and whether to square off rectangular images (most people do square
them off). You can choose a date format for the cover and photo pages
and decide on the size of large photo displays. (On that last point, sur-
prisingly, TypePad does not offer a size larger than 640 pixels in width.)
When you save any photo album design or configuration settings, TypePad
assumes you want the album republished and takes the initiative to republish
it live on the Web. Unlike with many other blog changes, which require saving
and then a separate republishing step, tinkering with your photo albums is a
streamlined, change-and-publish process.
Figure 7-22 shows a designed photo page of an album.
Inserting a photo into a blog entry
Photo albums offer the most formal method of presenting pictures. You can
share your albums by linking directly to them as destinations distinct from
your blog. You can place album references and descriptions in your sidebar
using the Content Selection page of the Weblogs, Design tab (see the follow-
ing section, “Filling Your Sidebars”).
A quicker, more down-and-dirty way of sharing photos is to simply toss them
into a blog entry, as follows:
1. Create a blog entry in the normal fashion.
2. Click the Insert Image button.
141
Chapter 7: Creating a TypePad Blog

Roll your mouse cursor over the buttons to find it. Wait for the pop-up
window.
3. Click the Browse button, select a picture from your hard drive, and
then click the Open button.
4. Click the Use Custom Settings radio button and choose the custom set-
tings. (See Figure 7-23.)
These settings allow you to determine how your entry text wraps around
your photo, the size of the thumbnail displayed in the entry (full-size
photos are likely to be bigger than the entry space in your blog), and
whether you’d like a pop-up to display the full-sized image when visitors
click the thumbnail. These settings do not persist; the next picture you
insert will revert to the default settings unless you customize them again.
5. Click the Insert Image button.
The picture now appears in your post as you continue to write or edit it.
6. Repeat these steps to insert additional pictures.
As I mentioned before, posted pictures automatically appear in the sidebar of
mixed media layouts, under the Most Recent Photos banner.

Filling Your Sidebars
Aside from blog entries, your site’s content is presented in sidebars. TypePad
offers layout designs with one, two, or three sidebars. In those spaces, you
can stuff photos, links, and lists that stretch vertically down the page along-
side your entries. Sidebars replicate throughout the blog; they appear identi-
cally on all pages except photo album pages.
Choosing your sidebar content
In TypePad, the stuff that goes into sidebars is assigned using a modular
system. That is to say, you select certain categories of content, and TypePad
automatically puts that category into a sidebar with a header. In some cases,
you must create special sidebar content before a module shows anything
below its header. In other cases (such as Most Recent Photos, Recent Posts,
and Recent Comments), TypePad takes the content from entry pages and
spools it automatically in the sidebar.
Figure 7-23:
This pop-up
assists in

143
Chapter 7: Creating a TypePad Blog

We have seen the sidebar content selection page before (look back at 
Figure 7-16). But that was many pages ago, so here’s a reminder:
1. Click the Weblogs tab.
2. Click the Design tab.
3. Click the Change Content Selections link.
On that page, scroll down to Your Sidebar Content, and select the boxes next
to modules you want to see in your sidebars. If you have created photo
albums, notice that they are listed under Your Photo Albums, and the album,
too, can be placed in the sidebar.
When selected, an album is represented in the sidebar by a single photo, not
by every photo in the album. It’s important to really hear this because it can
be confusing. Selecting an album does not spool its photos onto the sidebar
(though I wish there were such a choice).
One curious content selection group is called Your TypeLists. Keep reading,
dude.
Creating TypeLists
TypePad uses a flexible list system for adding a blogroll, favorite books,
favorite music, and favorite links to your sidebar. Each one of these lists is
called a TypeList, and the TypeList feature makes it easy to create them. Each
TypeList that you create is available to your entire (Plus or Pro) account, just
as photo albums are. This means that if you operate more than one TypePad
blog, each TypeList you create can be used (or ignored) by each blog.
TypeLists are easy to create, and TypePad makes the process even easier by
preconfiguring a few list types and pulling content from Amazon.com to add
pictures of book covers and CD album covers. To illustrate, the following
steps walk you through creating a reading TypeList:
1. Click the TypeLists tab.
2. Under Create a New TypeList (see Figure 7-24), use the pull-down
menu to select Reading.
3. In the List Name field, name your list.
4. Click the Create New List button.
5. Under Add a New Book, enter book information.
Notice that you can use an ISBN number, if you have one. Otherwise,
enter the book title and author.
144
Part II: Starting a Blog Today 

6. Click the Add button.
TypePad finds the book at Amazon and pulls a thumbnail image of the
book’s cover. Figure 7-25 shows this process in midstream; one book has
been added and the page awaits information about the second item of
the list. Each time you click the Add button, the new item is displayed
on the page. Use the drop-down menu to add a rating if you want; I
always leave it set at “None,” because the book wouldn’t be in my list if
it wasn’t top-flight.
7. Repeat the previous two steps for each additional book in the list.
That’s it; you don’t need to save the TypeList after adding each item. The list
is created. Go to the Change Content Selections page, where the list now
appears, and select it for placement on your sidebar.
When you put books in a reading list, TypePad links from each book to its
page at Amazon.com. Furthermore TypePad inserts the Amazon Associate
code of TypePad’s parent company, SixApart, in the link code. If visitors click
these links and buy books during that visit to Amazon, SixApart receives a
small commission. From your traffic! This unseemly tactic reflects badly on
TypePad and SixApart. There is no simple way to strip out SixApart’s associ-
ate code, but you can replace it with your own affiliate code. To do so, you

first must be an Amazon Associate. If you don’t know what that is, or you
want to join Amazon’s Associates program, visit this site:
associates.amazon.com
To insert your Amazon Associates name in place of the SixApart identifier, go
to the Profile tab under the Control Panel tab. Scroll down to Miscellaneous
Information and enter your Amazon Associates ID there.
To create a blogroll, which is traditionally found in blog sidebars, do this:
1. Click the TypeLists tab.
2. Use the drop-down menu to select Link, and then name your list.
If you want your link list to be called “Blogroll” on the sidebar, name it
such here.
3. Enter a URL, and then click the Add button.
4. Add or edit the link title.
TypePad attempts to title your link based on the site name of the URL,
but it doesn’t always succeed. You can name each link as you see fit.
5. Click the Save and Update button.
Your blogroll is ready to be added to the sidebar.

Moblogging in TypePad
Mobile blogging (moblogging) is handily accomplished in TypePad. You can
post an entry from e-mail or from a portable device equipped with e-mail,
such as a cell phone or PDA (personal digital assistant). Chapter 17 explains
the basics of moblogging.
In TypePad, a moblogged entry is assumed to be either text or a photo, and
you can send each type to a different blog (in Plus and Pro accounts). You
need to specify between one and five addresses you will be using to send
messages. These addresses can be standard e-mail addresses or cell-phone
e-mail addresses. A secret, cryptic address is provided to your account —
this is the address to which you send moblogged posts. If you don’t like the
secret address, you may use a generic TypePad address, and then specify
your account using confirmation messages (this process takes longer).
All the settings described in the previous paragraph are located on the
Control Panel, Profile, Mobile Settings page. Use that page to route your text
messages and photo posts to one blog, or each to a separate blog in your
account. Enter the e-mail address(es) from which you will moblog. Scroll
down to see your account’s secret e-mail address. For cell-phone moblogging,
you need to get that address into your phone.
The exact procedure for posting a moblog entry through a cell phone
depends on the phone and its carrier (your cell-phone company), but the
basic procedure for posting a photo is simple:
1. Take a picture with your cell phone.
2. Using your phone’s e-mail function, send the photo to your TypePad’s
secret address.
You must have previously listed your phone’s e-mail address on the
Mobile Settings page.
That’s it. If you elected to receive a confirmation e-mail on the Mobile
Settings page, you will soon get one affirming that your photo was posted to
the blog you specified for photo entries. That entry contains no text.
Moblogging photos is a more common use of mobile blogging than sending
text entries, mainly because it is so difficult to compose a text message of any
length on a cell phone. Snapping a picture, however, is (I hesitate to type
this) a snap (darn, I actually typed it). So, the more crucial of your two desti-
nation choices is where to send photos. TypePad lists all your blogs and
photo albums as potential destinations on the Mobile Settings page (in the
147
Chapter 7: Creating a TypePad Blog

Control Panel, Profiles tab). If you select a blog, your moblogged photos are
posted as regular entries, without any accompanying text. If you choose a
photo album, moblogged photos are simply added to that album. Remember
that if you use a mixed media blog layout, photos inserted in entries are auto-
matically placed in the sidebar. This system is great for moblogging. Your
mobile photo appears simultaneously in a blog entry and in a sidebar. In
most cases, it’s a better choice than aiming moblogged photos at a photo
album.
Your mobile settings apply to the entire TypePad account, not to a single
blog.
A Final Note
I can’t cover every TypePad feature in this chapter. It’s not much of an exagger-
ation to say that TypePad could fill a book. A small book, but a book nonethe-
less. Fortunately, TypePad provides a fairly complete reference of its features,
which you can access with the small Help link atop every page of your account
area. There you can find customer support contact information (personal help
is provided through e-mail), but you might never have to use it. The User
Manual is searchable, and the Frequently Asked Questions area is helpful.
When you want to take time out from actually blogging, I recommend poking
around this documentation to discover features you’d never find otherwise.

Installing Your
Own Blog Program

In this part . . .
T
his part contains the book’s most ambitious chapters.
In these pages, you can explore three of the most pow-
erful and flexible blog programs: Movable Type, WordPress,
and Radio UserLand. These programs are not for every-
one, not least because they require more installation than
the hosted blog services described in Part II. That’s where
Chapter 8 comes in — it’s a rundown of how to install a
blog program on a server. Reading that chapter can give
you an idea of whether or not such an installation is some-
thing you’d like to try. 
Chapters 9, 10, and 11 illustrate and explain details of
three blog programs and can also play into your decision.
Finally, Chapter 12 offers a compromise; in that chapter
you’ll find pointers to Web-hosting services that install
Movable Type or WordPress for you. It’s the best of both
worlds, power and ease . . . for a price.

Chapter 8
The Ins and Outs of DIY Blogging
In This Chapter
 Buying your blog’s domain and starting a Web hosting account
 Understanding the basics of installing a blog program
 Initializing a newly installed blog
T
his is the most challenging chapter in the book and certainly the most tech-
nical. These pages are also pure gold for anyone contemplating running a
self-installed blog program. For those readers going down the do-it-yourself
path, this must-read chapter helps get you over the installation hump of using
Movable Type (see Chapter 9) or WordPress (see Chapter 10). For more cau-
tious readers who are uncertain of what self-installed blogging entails, this
chapter pins down the basics common to all such installations. If you are unde-
cided about your blogging platform, this chapter will help you make a choice.
The decision at hand is not between Movable Type and WordPress, the two
blog programs I cover in this book that the user installs on a server. Reading
through Chapters 9 and 10, and viewing the screen shots, will help you clarify
that personal decision. The choice faced by this chapter is whether to install
your own blog program or use a hosted service such as Blogger, TypePad, or
a social network.
I want to be clear about two phrases that I’m throwing around: self-installed
blogging and hosting your own blog. It might sound as if these phrases refer to
installing blog software on your personal computer and allowing readers to
access your PC to view the blog entries. Not true. Self-installed blogging
refers to putting the blog software on a remote computer, called a server. It is
your blog, and it is called hosting your own blog because you lease space on
that remote server and operate the files in that space as if they were on your
computer.
Hosting your own blog is a much larger project than starting a blog on a
ready-to-go platform, and it implies a long-term commitment. Most DIYers
own their Web domains (www.yourdomain.com) and have shopped for and
selected a generic Web host. (When I say generic Web host, I mean one that
doesn’t specialize in Weblogs or offer preinstalled Weblogs.) In the context
of Internet real estate, hosting a blog yourself at your domain is like owning
your house instead of renting a virtual home in a blog service.

There is great satisfaction to be had in hosting your own blog. Doing so is not
necessarily less expensive than the hybrid solutions described in Chapter 12,
but it needn’t be more expensive. Like someone who repairs his or her own
car, you have the pleasure of knowing that the blog would not be on the road at
all if it weren’t for your efforts. Finally, working with the elements of blog and
hosting software gives you a better understanding of how the Internet works.
This chapter blazes the general path to self-installed blogging from step one.
I say “general” path because the details of installing blog programs differ
among the programs. Even so, the major points are similar, and it’s those
major points that confound most people. From registering a domain to writ-
ing your first self-hosted blog entry, this chapter provides the reference map.
Master of Your Domain
Owning your site has two major aspects:
 Owning your domain
 Leasing server space from a Web hosting company
Owning the domain name of your site is like owning a brand name, and buying
the server space on which the site is hosted is like owning virtual real estate.
Traditionally, owning a catchy or memorable domain helps attract visitors
and keeps them coming back — a truism that loses a little traction in an RSS
world. I do nearly all my blog reading by calling up feeds in my newsreader
(see Chapter 13), like a lot of people. I don’t know about, care about, or ever
see the domain names of blogs I read every day. But I still believe in the power
of a good domain name, which can help the site get a high ranking in search
engines (see Chapter 15 for more on search engine marketing).
Buying a domain
Domains are administered and sold by domain registrars, which are compa-
nies certified by the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers
(ICANN). The first domain registrar was Network Solutions (www.network
solutions.com), and that company is still doing business. Another popular
one is Register.com (www.register.com), which benefits from a great domain
name. I have used both those registrars as well as Go Daddy (www.godaddy.
com). Dozens of others exist.
152
Part III: Installing Your Own Blog Program 

A domain is just a name paired with a top-level domain extension (such as
.com, .net, .biz, or .org, or one of many other approved extensions). When a
name is available (not owned by anyone), it never costs more than $35 a year
to own it. Ownership must be renewed every year or less frequently if you
buy a longer term. Unrenewed domain names fall into the public market.
Many registrars sell domains at a lower annual cost and offer discounts for
long-term purchases or bulk purchases of multiple domains. Domains may be
purchased in the private market and transferred from one owner to another
at a negotiated price.
When you buy a domain, you own only the specific Web address, not the
name generally. For example, if your domain is www.greatdomain.com,
you own greatdomain.com, but do not own greatdomain.net or the
term greatdomain paired with any other extension. If you want to lock
down the domain term to prevent copycat site names, you must buy all the
extensions individually (if they are available).
You don’t need a Web host to buy a domain name, but you may get your Web
hosting deal in place before shopping for a domain if you want. In other words,
it doesn’t matter which you get first.
When it comes to buying the domain, here’s the drill:
1. Select a name.
This first step might take some brainstorming. Take the time to think of
a domain you really like, because changing a blog-in-progress from one
domain to another is a headache.
2. Check the domain’s availability.
Obvious domain names are not generally available in their .com versions.
I always check availability as I brainstorm; you can do so at any registrar.
Many registrars allow multiple simultaneous checks, which saves time.
(See Figure 8-1.)
3. Buy the domain.
Have a credit card at the ready. Most registrars attempt to sell you addi-
tional domain-related products and services, such as Web hosting and
e-mail service. The checkout process for a domain name can be among
the most obnoxious on the Web.
If you do not yet have a hosting account, that’s your next step. In the mean-
time, you need do nothing with your domain. It’s yours, even though you’re
not yet using it.
153
Chapter 8: The Ins and Outs of DIY Blogging

Starting a hosting account
Web sites of all sorts, including independently hosted Weblogs, exist on
Internet computers called servers. When you visit a Web site, your computer
communicates over the Internet with that site’s server. The server sends
pages to your computer for viewing. Servers are specialized for this kind of
activity in volume; various types of servers can serve hundreds, thousands,
or even millions of simultaneous users.
Internet servers are available for public use through leasing arrangements.
Customers rent portions of the server by the month or by the year. The portion
is defined by storage capacity, which is to say, amount of memory. Capacity
is measured in megabytes (MB) in most cases. Typical hosting limits are
100MB, 500MB, or 1000MB (a thousand megabytes is one gigabyte, or 1GB).
A text-only blog can run for a long time in 100MB, but a larger space is neces-
sary if you plan to add many pictures or a little audio or video.
In addition to capacity limits, hosting companies put a ceiling on transfers,
sometimes called bandwidth. Allowable monthly transfer is always measured in
gigabytes; count on getting between 10GB and 50GB. Again, the more pictures,
audio, and video you have on your site that visitors can download (transfer),
the more bandwidth you need.

154
Part III: Installing Your Own Blog Program 

Most hosting accounts suitable for blogging cost between $4 and $15 a month.
When shopping for a host, five considerations apply specifically to self-hosting
a Weblog, and particularly to hosting Movable Type or WordPress, the two
self-hosted blogs covered in this book:
 Unix server: Unix servers are easier to deal with than Windows servers.
Both Movable Type and WordPress have created installation documents
geared to Unix. Most hosting accounts state up front whether they are
Unix or Windows, or both (your choice). Among Unix hosts, the Apache
operating system is not uncommon, but you might have to write or call
the hosting company to determine whether it is in use.
 Perl: Perl (Practical Extraction and Report Language) is a programming
language developed to process text. Perl is often used in blog programs
to write CGI scripts, which are automated functions commonly found in
Weblogs. CGI scripts written in Perl process the creation of entries, com-
ments, archives, and other blog elements. Different blog programs require
more or less current versions of Perl. Movable Type requires version
5.004_04 and recommends version 5.6. WordPress does not require Perl.
 MySQL: MySQL is a type of server database. A database organizes blocks
of information — in this case, blog entries, comments, and other elements.
MySQL is not the only database type that works with some programs
(Movable Type works with several others), but it is the most common
database used by Web hosts. Good Web hosts offer one MySQL database
per customer as a standard feature. You activate the database in the host’s
control panel by assigning it a name and giving yourself a username and
password for that database. When blogging, you don’t directly access
the database; the blog software uses it behind the scenes.
 FTP access: This feature is almost a given with a Unix host, but make
sure you have FTP access to your server space and the files in it. FTP
(file transfer protocol) is the native method of moving files around
the Internet, and good, easy-to-use, programs are available that make
uploading files to your server almost as easy as moving files around
your own computer with Windows Explorer. One of these programs is
WS_FTP (see Figure 8-2); another is CuteFTP.
 CGI control: Finally, your Web host should give you control over your own
CGI installations. Most Web hosts offer an assortment of CGI scripts —
little programs such as newsletter sign-up forms. Blog programs are far
more complex and require uploading component files into a CGI directory
(usually called the cgi-bin by default). You need a Web host that provides
you with a CGI directory in your server space.
When you’ve selected your hosting account, proceed through the sign-up
and payment process provided at the site. You will be given a username and
password, plus an FTP address that you plug into your FTP program when
you’re ready to upload the files of your blog program (see later sections of
this chapter).
155
Chapter 8: The Ins and Outs of DIY Blogging

Basic Blog Installation
Here we go. It’s time to get hard core. This section details the elements of a
typical blog installation on a server, after you’ve acquired a domain and
established an FTP path through which files get uploaded. At this point, you
should own your domain (www.yourdomain.com), own an account with a
company that is hosting your domain (a Web host), and have gained some
experience uploading files through FTP to the host’s server — all described
in the previous sections. If you haven’t done these things, imagine that you
have and read along.
Acquiring and installing blog software is accomplished in three basic steps.
Many smaller steps transpire along the way, and I’ll get to those soon. The
three basic steps are
 Downloading: Blogging programs such as Movable Type and WordPress
are usually acquired by download, not by store purchase.
 Configuring: After the program is in your computer and unpacked, you
usually need to tweak a few component files.
 Uploading: After making whatever configuration changes are necessary,
you upload the files to your server. Doing so installs the blog program
on your server.
Figure 8-2:

156
Part III: Installing Your Own Blog Program 

The following sections expand these three basic steps.
Downloading the blog program
In all likelihood, you will download your blog software, not take it home from a
store. For download locations of Movable Type and WordPress, see Chapters 9
and 10, respectively. If the software you choose is commercial, you pay for the
download with an online payment.
Like other large software packages, blog programs are compressed for faster
downloading and must be uncompressed, or unpacked, in your computer.
The compression not only makes the delivery quicker, but also bundles the
many component files of blog programs so you can download just one file.
Unpacking that compressed file spills out the component files so you can see
them and configure them (in the next step). Two types of compression are in
common use: Zip and Tar.gz. Both Movable Type and WordPress (and others
as well) offer a choice; most readers should select the Zip file, which unpacks
easily on Windows computers.
At this stage, downloading the program does not differ from any other down-
load-and-unpack process you’ve followed with other types of software.
You might download the Zipped package to your computer desktop (or to
a download folder you have specified). On most Windows XP computers,
double-clicking the Zipped file brings up the default decompressing utility
program. In this program, select the Extract feature and choose a location for
the unpacked files.
Immediately after unpacking the program, things diverge from the standard
install-and-use routine you’re accustomed to with new software. Your hard
drive is not the final destination of your blog program; the software is resting
there temporarily. You will always retain the files in your computer, but the pro-
gram will run on your server, not on your PC. Before you upload the program
to the server, you need to alter at least one (in most cases) and sometimes
several of the component files. So, when unpacking the files, put them in a
location on your hard drive that is easy to find and access. You might need to
find the files several times during the configuration stage and possibly later
when troubleshooting any problems that arise. But I advise against unpack-
ing the program directly to the desktop, as the dozens of resulting files would
clutter it terribly.
After extracting the program files, look them over. In most cases (certainly with
Movable Type and WordPress), the program uncompresses into a structure
of folders within folders. Such a structure is called a folder hierarchy consisting
of nested folders. You don’t need to do anything just yet, but acquaint yourself
briefly with the folders holding the component files and especially with the
files in the root folder — that’s the outermost folder that holds other folders
as well as a group of individual files. Figure 8-3 shows the directory structure
157
Chapter 8: The Ins and Outs of DIY Blogging

of Movable Type. Note that in this case (and the structure is typical), the root
folder is nested within another folder (called MT). The MT folder exists only
to hold all the folders nested within it; I created the MT folder when I extracted
the program files from the Zip package. It is not necessary to upload such
container folders to your server, although you might create a container folder
there to hold nested folders. I’ll get to that later. In this directory structure,
the MT folder is the root folder, because it is the top folder that contains pro-
gram files outside folders.
Configuring the files
At this point you’ve downloaded and unpacked the blog program, and glanced
over the directory structure and component files in the root folder. In nearly
all cases (and certainly with Movable Type and WordPress), at least one file
must be altered before you can proceed. This alteration inserts a few details
of your personal Web host and domain setup.
The installation instructions of your blog program explain exactly what must be
changed in each file. In most programs, two kinds of alterations are necessary:
 Some information must be plugged into a configuration file.
 An address path to your server’s Perl location must be specified in sev-
eral program files.
The first of these two is almost always required. The necessity of the second
round of alterations depends on whether there is a default match of your
Figure 8-3:

unpacking
your blog
program,

the files in
Windows
Explorer.
158
Part III: Installing Your Own Blog Program 

server’s path to Perl and the path specified in the program files. If there is
a match, no alteration is necessary. Some blog programs don’t use Perl, in
which case an address path is unnecessary. WordPress does not require a
Perl address path.
The following sections examine these two configurations more closely.
Altering the config file
Most blog programs contain a component file known as the configuration, or
config, file. In many cases, the original config file that gets unpacked after
downloading also contains the word sample or original in its name, to distin-
guish it from the altered config file that you will create. The original config file
serves as a reference original that you can always go back to.
 In Movable Type, the original configuration file is called mt-config.cgi-
original. Note that the word original is appended to the file extension
(.cgi), which prevents the file from operating when uploaded — the
server’s CGI functionality cannot recognize the file as a .cgi file. The file
extension is sabotaged in this manner to prevent you from accidentally
attempting to use the original config file as the working config file. You
must alter the file and rename it with an unencumbered file extension;
more on that later. It doesn’t matter whether you upload the original
config file, but you must upload a correctly altered and renamed file.
 In WordPress, the original configuration file is called wp-config-sample.php.
The file extension in this case (.php) is not sabotaged, but the word sample
alerts you that this is the original file and you should rename it after you
alter it.
Configuration files are text files readable in any text editor (such as Notepad
in Windows computers), despite the use of non-.txt file extensions. For the
remainder of this chapter and in later chapters, I assume that Notepad is
the chosen program; it is what I use. Heaven forbid anyone do things differ-
ently from me. You edit the original config files the same way you’d edit any
other piece of text. Save and rename the file using the Save As selection on
the File menu.
When saving and renaming the original config file, do not change the default
location presented to you by Notepad! I put an exclamation point there to
emphasize how important this is! There’s another one! I can’t stop! If you
change the location, saving the file outside the root directory from which you
opened it, it won’t be included in the big server upload that you do later and
you’ll never find the darn thing again. You will gnash your teeth, rend your
garments, and scare the kids. Just rename the file by getting rid of the sample
or original portion of the filename, and save it.

Chapter 8: The Ins and Outs of DIY Blogging

So, what gets plugged into the config file? Each program has its own require-
ments. Some original config files contain multiple settings, at least one of
which must be altered and some of which are optional. The role of the config
file is to provide basic operational settings to the blog program. In a typical
installation, two of those settings are crucial:
 Program path: This is the server address that locates the main blog pro-
gram file. This setting is sometimes called the cgi path because it is often
located in a server folder dedicated to holding CGI scripts. Not every
blog program requires this setting in the config file; WordPress, for
example, does not. WordPress uses a simpler server folder structure
than Movable Type and some other programs, so it doesn’t need this
particular direction.
 Database configuration: This setting is required in the config file by
Movable Type, WordPress, and most other blog programs. Your data-
base (MySQL in most cases) is located on your server and is protected
by a username and password. Additionally, the database has a name and
an address path. You must plug all this information into the config file so
the blog program can get its hands on the database, which contains all
your entries and archives.
I imagine you’re plenty sick of the config file by now, but I’m not going to stop
talking about it until you’re actually in bed with a fever.
Figure 8-4 shows an original config file (the one that comes with Movable Type).
Notice all the pound signs (#)? They (and sometimes other ASCII symbols)
are used to provide instructions; any line of text preceded by a pound sign is
ineffectual as program code — the blog program ignores that line. Because
these disabled lines are used for comments, such lines are called comment
lines. Removing the pound sign is called uncommenting the line. You must
know this because uncommenting is part of altering most config files. Not
only do you need to plug in correct information, you must also uncomment
the lines holding that information if they are comment lines in the original
config file. (Configurable lines are not always commented in the original file;
those lines do not need to be uncommented.)
Let’s zoom in on an example of plugging in database information. Remember,
as I described earlier in this chapter, you created a MySQL database on your
server using your Web host’s control panel, and you established three pieces
of information: the database name, your username, and a password. A fourth
piece of information is now required: the address path of the database. This
address is called the database host. Typically, the database host is your Web
hosting company, and that address is mysql.webhostname.com. You must be
certain of the address, an annoying bit of crucial information for which you
might have to dig around. Check your control panel settings and your Web
host’s help files; if necessary, call the hosting company and ask for the address.
160
Part III: Installing Your Own Blog Program 

Armed with the four pieces of information, you are ready to alter the original
config file. Here is an example portion of an original config file; this example
mimics the Movable Type file:
### MySQL Configuration - Add the name of your database,
# username, password, and, optionally, database host given 
# to you by your web hosting provider.
#
# Database <database-name>
# DBUser <database-username>
# DBPassword <database-password>
# DBHost localhost
All these lines are commented, so you would need to fill in the information
and uncomment the information lines. But you would leave the first three
lines commented, because they contain instructions to you, not to the blog
program. Note that the instructions claim that the database host address is
optional. That is because localhost is a command that works with many
database host addresses. I always plug in the exact address, but you can try
uploading the altered config file with localhost in place and see whether it
works.

Chapter 8: The Ins and Outs of DIY Blogging

Here is an altered version of the preceding file portion:
### MySQL Configuration - Add the name of your database,
# username, password, and, optionally, database host given 
# to you by your web hosting provider.
#
Database blog
DBUser myusername
DBPassword mypassword
DBHost mysql.webhost.com
The information is plugged in and the lines are uncommented. I italicized the
information that I added to make it distinct, but do not italicize anything in
your config file. Note, also, that I removed the caret brackets surrounding the
information portions of the original file. Installation documents generally
neglect to tell you that part.
For comparison’s sake, here is the same portion of the original config file in
WordPress:
// ** MySQL settings ** //
define(‘DB_NAME’, ‘wordpress’);     // The name of the
database
define(‘DB_USER’, ‘username’);     // Your MySQL username
define(‘DB_PASSWORD’, ‘password’); // ...and password
define(‘DB_HOST’, ‘localhost’);     // 99% chance you
won’t need to change this value
As you can see, WordPress uses double slashes (//) to create comment lines,
and this config file puts comments and working code on the same line. When
you plug in your information, you can leave the comments as they are, because
the double slashes do not begin any line. In this program, you do not need to
remove the single quotation marks around the information pieces, whereas
in Movable Type you must remove the caret brackets. Both providers fail to
address this point — so, as you can see, some trial and error is involved in
self-installed blogs.
Setting the Perl location
I spent so much time discussing the config file that you might have forgotten the
second part of the configuration process: plugging in your server’s directory
path to its Perl program. A directory path is a server address that specifies
where in the server’s directory structure the Perl program is located. Your Web
host provides Perl; you must find where it’s located in your server space.
This information gets plugged into several blog program files, as indicated
in the installation instructions.
If you’re lucky, you won’t have to do this step. That’s because many blog 
programs (such as Movable Type) assume that Perl is located in the most
common directory path, which is this:
162
Part III: Installing Your Own Blog Program 

/user/bin/perl
The user is you — or, more accurately, your server space on the host 
company’s computer. But you really don’t need to know that or any other
technical details of the directory path.
You do need to know what that directory path is, and you probably need to
dig your hands into your hosting company’s help files to find it. If you run
into a wall, send an e-mail to customer service or make a phone call. Ask this:
“What is my directory path to Perl?” or “Where is Perl located in my account?”
Make them spell it out for you slowly. To ensure that your blog files are cor-
rectly configured, you need two pieces of information:
 Your Web host’s directory path to Perl.
 Your blog program’s default directory path to Perl, as spelled out in one
or more program files. Usually, the directory path is the first line of those
files.
The two directory paths must match in every file listed by your program’s
installation documents.
If alteration is necessary, edit the files using Notepad and save them with
the same name to the same location. Notice how I italicized that instruction.
That’s because if you change the name or saved location, I will personally
come to your house and eat your muffins. I’m not sure what that means, but
it won’t be pleasant. If you move the files or rename them, your blog program
is screwed. A great wailing would be heard across the land, and that would
be you, regretting your error. The undead would rise and converge upon you,
seeking to enjoin you to their unholy mob. Sweet nectars would turn bitter
on your tongue and life’s joy would sour. I hope I’ve made myself clear.
Uploading the program
After making whatever configuration changes are necessary to match the
component files with your domain and hosting setup, you must upload the
files to your server. Doing so installs the blog program on your server.
You should, of course, refer to your installation instructions before uploading
the files. Your program might require that the unpacked directory structure
remain intact (as with WordPress); conversely, the program might require
that you separate certain folders or files from their companions (as with
Movable Type). Some programs (Movable Type) need to be installed in a CGI
directory, most commonly the cgi-bin directory. Other programs (WordPress)
do not require cgi-bin placement.
163
Chapter 8: The Ins and Outs of DIY Blogging

ASCII and binary uploading
When uploading files, always remember that they can be transferred as ASCII
files or binary files. Your FTP program probably provides a radio button for
each selection. The difference is important. If just one component file of your
blog program is uploaded in the wrong way, it will foul up your blog at some
point; usually sooner than later. Many are the cases of installed blog programs
that seem absolutely broken: They simply don’t work at all, and the hidden
problem is that a binary file was uploaded in ASCII, or an ASCII file as binary.
Unaccountably, online installation manuals are often murky on this point, fail-
ing to clarify exactly which files need to be uploaded in each mode.
Some FTP programs can discern how a file should be uploaded — in ASCII or
binary mode. This automatic setting is valuable, and takes the pressure off of
you, who would otherwise have to constantly keep the setting in mind while
uploading many dozens of files. In those FTP programs that offer this auto-
matic feature, the Auto setting must be manually enabled. Remember that if
you close the FTP program and reopen it, you have to reset the Auto feature
if it defaults to the unselected state. If your FTP program has the Auto feature,
use it!
A final note about the ASCII/binary uploading issue. If your FTP program does
not offer an Auto selection, or if you prefer making the correct uploads man-
ually, or if you don’t trust your FTP program because it once insulted your
sister, or if for some other reason beyond my imagination you must make the
ASCII/binary distinction yourself, then Table 8-1 covers most file types in blog
programs. When deciding whether to upload a file as ASCII or binary, note the
file extension (the part after the dot, such as .cgi in filename.cgi) and then look
at this table.

Part III: Installing Your Own Blog Program 

Setting permissions
After uploading your program files, you must complete an obscure but cru-
cial task that trips up people. That task is setting the permission level of the
uploaded files. The permission level determines what the file is allowed to
do, and for whom, on Unix servers. Three functions are involved here: read,
write, and execute. And three levels of access are available: owner, group,
and other. You are the owner. Groups are defined by a server command that
you will probably never need to know. Other refers to any visitor to your
blog. The intersection of these three types of users and the three functions
creates a matrix that looks like this:
Owner
Group
Other
Read
x
x
x
Write
x
Execute
x
x
x
Notice that I have checked off some but not others. These settings give full
privileges to the owner, while Group and Other users cannot use the Write
function of any file. That means other people cannot, for example, alter your
pages or configuration files (only a hacker would be able to get into your
server space in the first place). However, the pages of your blog can be seen
(Read) by everyone, and the scripts on those pages (such as leaving a com-
ment or searching the archive) can be set in motion by any visitor (that’s the
Execute function). The particular setting makes the blog fully functional for
all users and reserves executive control of its files for you.
The settings in Table 8-1 are typical for blog program files and represent the
required file permission setup for Movable Type and WordPress. It is called
the 755 setting, or chmod 755 — I kid you not. Each different permutation of
the preceding matrix is given a different number, based on a bizarre assign-
ment of values to the rows and columns. Chmod is the Unix command for
changing file permissions. It is absolutely unimportant for you to know any
of the other matrix numbers when dealing with Movable Type or WordPress.
Most FTP programs make it pretty easy to make chmod changes. Figure 8-5
shows the setting panel in one such program. If your Web host offers a file
management utility in your control panel, you might also be able to change
the permission settings there. You can alter the chmod of an individual file,
or a group of files at once, or an entire folder.
This is how you change a chmod setting in the WS_FTP program:
1. Select (highlight) the file, files, or folder whose permissions you want
to set.
2. Right-click the highlighted file and choose the chmod (UNIX) selection.
3. In the chmod panel, assign permissions for chmod 755.
4. Click the OK button.
165
Chapter 8: The Ins and Outs of DIY Blogging

Initializing the Blog
After everything I’ve described — downloading, configuring, and uploading
your blog software — another step is required before you start blogging.
This step can be considered the final step of installation or the first step
after installation. The blog software needs to undergo a brief initialization
process to ready the server database to receive entries. Each blog program
behaves a little differently at this point, so follow your installation instructions.
Another part of initialization happens within your blog’s administrative con-
trol area, in which you set the blog’s name, the blog’s descriptive tagline
(if you want one), your public name as author, and your customized user-
name and password.
When these final chores are finished, you’re ready to actually write your first
blog entry, and believe me, it’s a thrill to see your self-installed blog start to
unfold. You can still make plenty of design and function changes as you go
along, including changing the entire template (design theme) of the site.
Different programs make such changes variously easy or hard. Basically,
though, you are off and running. See Chapters 9 and 10, which pick up from
here in Movable Type and WordPress, respectively.

M
ovable Type is possibly the most powerful blogging option and per-
sonal Web publishing program you can find. Created by SixApart, the
same company that operates TypePad (see Chapter 7), Movable Type and
TypePad resemble each other. If you’ve read Chapter 7, or if you use TypePad
now, you’ll notice that this chapter illustrates and describe controls and
screens that look strikingly similar to TypePad.
Movable Type could be considered a premium version of TypePad. Or, if you
prefer, call TypePad a light version of Movable Type. The two products are
distinct, though, and are being developed independently, so it would be a
mistake to call TypePad a dumbed-down version of Movable Type. The truth
is that TypePad offers certain power features (such as custom template design,
photo albums, and mobile blogging) that Movable Type lacks. On the other
side of the coin, Movable Type provides greater flexibility and configurability
in the fine points of blog publishing.
Some people agonize over the choice between Movable Type and TypePad,
but I don’t think they should be compared that way. More realistically, I would
group TypePad with Blogger.com (see Chapter 6), and compare Movable Type
with WordPress (Chapter 10). Movable Type and WordPress are both stand-
alone programs that require server installation. (If you don’t know what that
means, prowl through Chapter 8.) Those two programs demand more of you,
and return more in blogging power. But Movable Type and WordPress don’t
make you more creative, so if your focus is determinedly on writing the blog,
TypePad and other hosted services might be your best bet.

If you want the power of Movable Type (or WordPress) without the installation
difficulties (and believe me, installing Movable Type can be difficult), look in
Chapter 12, which spotlights Web host companies that preinstall Movable Type
(or WordPress) for you. This chapter does not detail how to install Movable
Type. Chapter 8 gives you the basic understanding needed to install any blog
program on a server, and the Movable Type site (www.movabletype.org)
provides detailed instructions. Here, I pick up the story immediately after the
program has been installed.
This chapter cannot possibly deliver a complete tutorial on all Movable Type
features. Whole books have been written about how to blog with this sophis-
ticated program. One such book, Movable Type 3 Bible (Wiley), is 438 pages
long. That book, and others in bookstores at the time of this writing, are not
up to speed with version 3.2 of Movable Type, although they might be by the
time you read this. Version 3.2 is covered here, and the purpose of this chap-
ter is to give you a general feeling for Movable Type. Reading the descriptions
and looking at the screen shots should convey a sense of the program and
whether it’s for you.
Getting an Overview of Movable Type
I have said that Movable Type is powerful, and it is, but its power is skewed.
Movable Type is not a well-rounded blogging environment, and some func-
tions that are standard in other services are difficult to accomplish without
either advanced technical knowledge or a willingness to install additions to
the basic program.
Because of these difficulties, Movable Type can easily be considered a clunky,
obstinate program, and even a slightly obsolete one for modern bloggers who
expect click-and-publish photos, blogrolls, and new templates. Movable Type
was developed in a simpler blogging era (the fall of 2001), and it hasn’t caught
up with newer systems in certain ways. For all its publishing prowess, Movable
Type lags behind free services such as MSN Spaces and Yahoo! 360 in certain
ways that might be important to you.
To be specific, Movable Type’s strong points are these:
 Writing: The entry-writing interface is simple, without a lot of formatting
options to distract from the basic text presentation of the blog. The basics
are there — you can use bold, italic, and underlined text, embed links,
and put photos in the entries. Post-dating and pre-dating entries are no
problem. Editing is easy, as is bulk deletion of entries. Movable Type
blogs are primarily written blogs, as opposed to photo blogs, podcast
containers, or video blogs.
 Organizing: Multiple archive options allow past entries to be grouped
by month or by category. You can display a calendar in the sidebar or
rely on text links to archived groups.
168
Part III: Installing Your Own Blog Program 

 Networking: Movable Type is particularly strong in comment and
TrackBack options, letting you choose the level of authentication
needed for a visitor to leave feedback on your site.
On the down side, Movable Type should not be a newcomer’s first choice in
these departments:
 Designing: Changing templates is harder to accomplish in Movable Type
than in TypePad, Blogger, WordPress, MSN Spaces, Yahoo! 360 . . . shall I go
on? Movable Type bloggers must use a plugin to change the site design —
plugins are add-on software modules that fill in Movable Type’s missing
functionality. Without a template-changing plugin, you would have to be
capable of working in HTML and CSS, the two primary coding languages
underlying Movable Type pages, to change the page design.
 Personalizing: Not to be found is any sort of built-in profile, such as
users of other services have become accustomed to. You can create
your own profile page using traditional Web-page creation tools, but
blogging is supposed to free you from all that. The lack of a profile page
is a perfect example of functionality that has become standard in the
years since Movable Type was first launched.
 Photoblogging: There are ways to create a photo album on a Movable
Type site (and plugins that assist you), and I explain how to put photos
in the sidebar later in this chapter. But you’ll see that my explanation is
complex (if doable), and the other options might seem impossibly intim-
idating compared to standard click-and-display photo features in other
services.
Given these important negatives, you might be wondering how anybody (like
me, for example) can promote Movable Type as a powerful modern blogging
solution. Part of the answer lies in those plugins I just mentioned. People
have developed innumerable Movable Type plugins that add all kinds of
great features, and it is this expandable quality of Movable Type that makes it
so powerful and liberating. The happiest Movable Type users are inquisitive,
adventurous, experimental, willing to download and install many little pro-
grams, and insatiable tweakers. Those people are unhappy with the many
restrictions that constrain their blogs in the services offering contemporary
preset features.
You also might simply prefer Movable Type’s administrative look and feel —
the way the software handles on your screen — better than other options.
Nobody says you must install plugins and build a Movable Type palace. 
It is a beautiful program when used conservatively.

Movable Type users of all levels. It’s located here:

Naming Your Blog
Immediately after installation, Movable Type is a blank slate, ready to receive
your blog settings and entries. A template is provided, but no others are
offered to start. Movable Type, unlike many services, does not preset entry
categories. Your blog comes out of the box (so to speak) with the title First
Weblog. Figure 9-1 illustrates what your nascent blog looks like, and Figure 9-2
shows the first thing you see after logging into your Movable Type controls,
immediately after installation. That view in Figure 9-2 is of the Main Menu.
170
Part III: Installing Your Own Blog Program 
Help when you need it
Movable Type weaves Help files through the
program, so you can get assistance with fea-
tures when you need it most — while stumbling
over settings you don’t understand. Notice the
tiny question marks in Figure 9-3. If you can’t
see them clearly on the page, trust me that they
are sprinkled all over the place on all the con-
trol pages. (The question marks do not appear
in your published blog.) Click any question mark
to pop up an explanatory window. This type of
Help system is called context-sensitive help.
But who cares what it’s called? Forget I men-
tioned that. It is danged useful. Forget that I used
the word danged.
The figure illustrates one of the Help pop-ups
looming over the control page from which it
sprang.

Chapter 9: Running a Movable Type Blog

Your first task should probably be to rename the blog. Along with renaming,
you can add a description that appears as a tagline below the blog’s title.
Here’s how:
1. On the Main Menu, click the First Weblog link.
If your installation calls your blog something else, click that. You are
navigating to the control page for the blog, as opposed to the System
Shortcuts you see on the Main Menu in Figure 9-2.
2. On your blog’s control page, click Settings in the sidebar.
The sidebar contains shortcuts to the groups of controls that create your
blog. That sidebar remains in place as you navigate through the controls.
3. On the General Settings page (see Figure 9-3), change the Weblog
Name and Description.
The description is optional.
4. Scroll down and click the Save Changes button.
Along the way, you can alter any other setting on this page, but none of
them is important before posting your first entry. The page reloads after
you click the Save Changes button.

5. Click the Rebuild My Site button.
6. In the pop-up window, click the Rebuild button.
This extra step allows you to use the drop-down menu to select the
extent of rebuilding you want. The choice seems unnecessary now and
the extra step is annoying. But when the blog gets big, rebuilding takes
longer and you might sometimes want to limit the job to certain portions
of the site affected by the saved setting changes.
7. Close the pop-up window.
That’s right — Movable Type makes you close the window. Who knew
software could be so lazy?
8. Back on the General Settings page, click View Site in the sidebar.
This command brings up your blog, and you can see the renamed banner
and added description. (See Figure 9-4.) If you viewed your blog before,
you might have to replace your browser’s cache of the earlier version by
clicking the Reload (or Refresh) button on your browser’s toolbar.

Writing and Posting Entries
Posting an entry in Movable Type is straightforward. Figure 9-5 shows the
New Entry page.
Starting from scratch, follow these steps to write and post your first Movable
Type entry:
1. On any of your blog’s control pages, click New Entry in the sidebar.
If you start from the Main Menu shown in Figure 9-2, click your blog’s
title to reach its controls, and then click New Entry.
2. On the New Entry page, enter a title and write your entry.
Note that long entries can be broken into two parts by using the Extended
Entry box to hold the second part. In the published blog, only the first
part (typed in the Entry Body box) appears on the index page (the blog’s
home page). Movable Type automatically provides a link to the entry’s
unique page, which displays the complete, unbroken entry.
3. Select a category from the Primary Category drop-down menu.
This step is optional. At this point, you might not have created any cate-
gories. Not a problem. Pull down the menu and click the Add New Category
selection. A pop-up appears (see Figure 9-6); type a category and click the
Add button. After you have at least one category, the Parent Category
menu in that pop-up lists your categories, enabling you to create cate-
gories within categories.
Figure 9-5:

4. Scroll down the page and click the Save button.
Your entry is automatically published to the blog if the Post Status menu
is selected as Published (which it is by default). Choose Unpublished in
that menu to save the entry without making it appear on the blog. You
can also select Scheduled in that menu, and then create a date and
time at which the entry will automatically appear on the blog. Figure 9-7
shows these controls. Notice that you can also choose to allow com-
ments and TrackBacks for individual entries, and you can plant
TrackBacks on another site with the Outbound TrackBack URLs box.
(Please see Chapter 3 for a complete explanation of TrackBacks.)
Figure 9-8 illustrates our blog-in-progress with its first post. Notice that the
Recent Posts and Archives sidebar modules now have something in them,
and the two categories I created along with this first entry are showing.

Chapter 9: Running a Movable Type Blog

Creating categories and subcategories
Speaking of categories, it’s a good idea to plan your blog’s topic areas before
posting many entries and setting up your main categories. Movable Type
makes it easy to create categories and subcategories. Follow these steps:
1. Click Categories in the sidebar of your blog controls.
2. On the Categories page, click the Create new top level category link.
A fill-in box appears above your existing categories (see Figure 9-9).
3. Type a category name and click the Create Category button.
You can easily delete categories later, so don’t feel like you’re etching
categories in stone. As you create each category, it is saved but not pub-
lished to the blog. The Rebuild My Site button is available, but continue
creating categories until you’re out of ideas, and then click that button
to make all the categories appear on the blog at once.

4. Next to any category, click Create to establish a subcategory within
the selected category.
5. Type the subcategory name and click the Create Subcategory button.
6. When you have finished creating categories and subcategories, click
the Rebuild My Site button.
7. In the pop-up window, click the Rebuild button.
Figure 9-10 shows the blog with a list of categories and subcategories in the

You can create subcategories of subcategories. Click Create next to any sub-
category to bundle finely tuned categories within it.
You can delete any category or subcategory — or several at a time — by
selecting check boxes next to categories and then clicking the Delete button.
There is no verification box asking if you’re certain . . . so be certain.

Chapter 9: Running a Movable Type Blog

Posting with a Movable Type bookmarklet
As I discuss in other chapters, a bookmarklet is a clickable item that resides
on your browser’s toolbar. Blogging bookmarklets enable you to post an
entry without going to your program’s control panel. The bookmarklet is
like a portable control panel that travels around the Web with you. In this
way, when you get an urge to post something — perhaps inspired by another
blog or an article — you can do so without disrupting your surfing.
Follow these steps to place a Movable Type bookmarklet on your browser:
1. Click the Main Menu link at the top of any blog control page.
2. On the Main Menu page, click Set Up a Quick Post Bookmarklet link.
3. On the QuickPost page, configure the bookmarklet.
Figure 9-11 shows this page; as you can see, the check boxes allow you
to add or remove features from the bookmarklet. Leave all options
selected (as they are by default) for the most flexible bookmarklet.

4. Click the Create button.
5. On the next page, use your mouse to drag the QuickPost link to your
browser’s menu bar or toolbar.
Click the link and, while holding down the left-click button, drag the link
up to the toolbar. Note that in the Firefox browser you must use the
Bookmarks toolbar; the bookmarklet does not stick to the menu toolbar.
Simply click the QuickPost bookmarklet that now resides on your browser
toolbar whenever you want to write an entry. Figure 9-12 shows the QuickPost
pop-up window overlaid on the site that inspired a new post entry. You can
also see the QuickPost bookmarklet itself in the browser’s toolbar. The full-
featured version of the bookmarklet pop-up stretches down the screen; you
might have to scroll down to see the Post button.
The QuickPost pop-up is automatically configured with a link to the page 
currently displayed by your browser. If you’re not posting about that page,
simply highlight the text in the Entry Body box and press the Delete key on
your keyboard to get rid of that link.
Figure 9-11:

marklet on

Chapter 9: Running a Movable Type Blog

Note: Some browsers and toolbars attached to them implement pop-up 
blockers that prevent the QuickPost bookmarklet from working. In Firefox,
for example, you have to enable pop-ups for any site you happen to be
parked at when the urge to post an entry overcomes you — otherwise the
bookmarklet is thwarted.
Installing One Essential Plugin:
StyleCatcher
If you ever want to change blog templates — and who wants to be stuck with
a single default template? — you need a key Movable Type plugin that makes
switching styles reasonably easy. I’m not saying that Movable Type is espe-
cially template friendly; it is not. Immediately after installation, there is not
an alternate template to be found within the program. However, a suite of 
official Movable Type template designs exist, and with StyleCatcher — that’s
the plugin — you can switch among them with aplomb. If you can’t muster
aplomb, please keep your cursing in French.

Part III: Installing Your Own Blog Program 

What follows here is a fairly long series of steps that takes you outside the
program control pages. You must do the following:
1. Go to the StyleCatcher download page.
2. Download the plugin.
3. Unpack the plugin on your computer.
4. Upload the plugin files to your Web server.
5. Enable the plugin within the Movable Type control pages.
6. Use the plugin to switch templates.
Take it one step at a time and you’ll be fine. The plugin is worth the hassle of
getting and installing it. Here we go:
1. Go to the StyleCatcher download page here:
www.sixapart.com/pronet/plugins/plugin/stylecatcher.ht
ml
2. Click the Download button.
3. On the next page, click the StyleCatcher 1.01 link to start the 
download.
What happens next depends on your browser settings. I assume that
your browser downloads the compressed StyleCatcher file to your 
computer desktop. Continue these steps from wherever the file lands.
The version of the plugin, and therefore the appearance of the download
link, might have advanced by the time you see it.
4. Unpack the compressed file on your computer.
Chapter 8 discusses downloading compressed files and decompressing
them; if you installed Movable Type yourself, this is old hat to you. You
need to select a destination on your hard drive for the unpacked files;
I always put unpacked plugins in the plugins folder of my Movable Type
installation directory. Again, see Chapter 8 for more about this. Sorry to
jerk you around from chapter to chapter; it does work out for the best
this way.
5. Upload the unpacked files from your computer to the server installa-
tion of Movable Type.
On the server, as on the computer, the files go in the plugins folder.
Whereas I suggested you put them there on your computer, I must insist
you put them there on the server. Otherwise the plugin won’t work.
6. In Movable Type, click Settings in any blog control page (not the
Main Menu).
181
Chapter 9: Running a Movable Type Blog

7. On the General Settings page, click the Plugins link.
On the Plugin Settings page, StyleCatcher should appear as enabled.
(See Figure 9-13.)
8. Click the StyleCatcher link.
9. In the Theme or Repository URL box, enter the following address:
www.sixapart.com/movabletype/styles/library
10. Click the Find Style button.
The official Movable Type templates appear in the Movable Type —
Style Library box. (See Figure 9-14.)
11. Click any style.
12. Use the drop-down menu below the style library to select the blog
whose style you want to change.
If you’re following along with the examples in this chapter, there is only
one blog.
13. Click the Choose This Design button.
Figure 9-13:

Part III: Installing Your Own Blog Program 

14. In the pop-up verification box, click the OK button.
Visit your blog now to see the style change. (Figure 9-15 shows a trans-
formed blog.)
Every time you select a theme in StyleCatcher, it is saved in the Saved
Themes section (refer to Figure 9-14). You can put your favorites in there and
switch among them whenever you like.
All plugins are installed in the same basic fashion as just described. The 
company that owns Movable Type, SixApart, maintains a plugin resource
page here:
www.sixapart.com/pronet/plugins/
I suggest you look at it if your interest in Movable Type is wavering. The 
plugins reveal Movable Type as a muscular program, and browsing through
the extensive selection of functions that you can add to Movable Type is
inspiring.

Chapter 9: Running a Movable Type Blog

Adding Links and Photos to the 
Movable Type Sidebar
One significant advantage of TypePad (and some other services) over
Movable Type is the ease with which you can add sidebar content: a blogroll,
other lists, and photos. You can do these things in Movable Type, but you
have to get your hands into the template code. By that I mean you have to
alter the code that underlies the pages of your blog. This is not pushbutton
publishing, it’s more like using . . . well, like using real movable type, which
was invented in 1436.
You can use the plugin resource page listed a few paragraphs back to find
expansion plugins that give you sidebar support. Here, I show a down-and-
dirty way of creating a list in a sidebar and a nearly identical way of placing a
photo in the sidebar. In exchange for avoiding the plugin installation routine,
you must explore Movable Type’s template code. It is easier than you proba-
bly think. You can do this. Take each step carefully, and it’ll happen.

Part III: Installing Your Own Blog Program 

Adding a sidebar blogroll
A blogroll is a list of links to favorite blogs, and it traditionally resides in the
sidebar of the index page. To accomplish the steps in this section, you need
one or more (let’s say three) links. Think of three sites you like; they don’t
have to be blogs. Go to each and write down its URL (the site address that
appears near the top of your browser; it begins with http://). You have
three URLs written on a sheet of paper next to you. Follow these steps:
1. Click Templates in the sidebar.
You are delivered to the Templates page, which lists eight (more or
less, depending on the style in use) templates, each with a check box
next to it.
2. On the Templates page, click Main Index.
The list of templates is replaced by a large text box called Template
Body, displaying the page code of your index page. (See Figure 9-16).
Note that the text box has a right scroll bar; the page’s code is lengthy.
Figure 9-16:
The tem-
plate code
of the blog’s
main index
page.
185
Chapter 9: Running a Movable Type Blog

3. Scroll down the Template Body box until you see this line of code:
<div id=”beta”>
That line indicates the start of the index page’s sidebar. Below it are
code descriptions of sidebar modules such as Archives and Recent
Posts. You are almost where you want to be; scroll slowly from here.
4. Scroll down until you see this line:
<div class=”module-syndicate module”>
That is the first line of code that describes the blog’s syndication feed
link. In this example, we will put your blogroll in a module immediately
above that link. You are about to add some code above that line. After
you get the hang of this, you’ll be confident enough to arrange the mod-
ules differently in the sidebar.
5. Above that line, copy the following lines:
<div class=”module”>
<h2 class=”module-header”>Links</h2>
<div class=”module-content”>
First link<br>
Second link<br>
Third link<br>
</div>
</div>
That’s a lot to type. I have placed this code online; you can copy and
paste it from this Web page:
www.bradhill.com/mt-sidebar.txt
6. Replace the First link line with an HTML hyperlink to your first
Web site.
An HTML hyperlink is specially coded and looks like this:
<a href=”http://www.yourfirstlink.com”>Web Site</a>
Place the URL within the quotation marks, and leave the quotation marks
there. Instead of Web Site type the name of the Web site. Also replace
the yourfirstlink domain name with the actual address of the linked
site. When you perform this step, be sure to leave the <br> in place on
each line, immediately after the </a>.
7. Repeat Step 6 for the next two lines.
This is what your finished code might look like:
<div class=”module”>
<h2 class=”module-header”>Links</h2>
<div class=”module-content”>
<a href=”http://www.nytimes.com”>NY Times</a><br>
<a href=”http://www.cnn.com”>CNN</a><br>
<a href=”http://news.yahoo.com”>Yahoo! News</a><br>
</div>
</div>
186
Part III: Installing Your Own Blog Program 

In this example, I used the NY Times, CNN, and Yahoo! News as my three
sites, with links to their home pages. Figure 9-17 shows the Template
Body box with the added code.
8. Click the Save and Rebuild button.
Visit your blog to see the blogroll (see Figure 9-18).
You can add as many links to your list as you want; simply repeat Step 6.

187
Chapter 9: Running a Movable Type Blog

Adding a photo to the sidebar
You can add photos to your sidebar in its own module by replicating the pre-
ceding steps, but with the following variations:
 In Step 5, replace Links with another header, perhaps Photos.
 You need to upload the photos to your server.
 In place of the site URLs, type the URL of your uploaded photos in Step 6.
Use this HTML tag:
<img src=”http://www.yourdomain.com/photo-1.jpg”>
 The final added code should look like this:
<div class=”module”>
<h2 class=”module-header”>Photos</h2>
<div class=”module-content”>
<img src=”http://www.yourdomain.com/photo-1.jpg”>
<img src=”http://www.yourdomain.com/photo-2.jpg”>
<img src=”http://www.yourdomain.com/photo-3.jpg”>
</div>
</div>
Many digital photos are larger (wider, to be precise) than your blog’s sidebar.
You can make the photo display in smaller dimensions by specifying a number
of pixels in width. The other dimension — height — scales down proportion-
ally. An easy width to remember, and one that works with most Movable Type
sidebars, is 100 pixels. You add that constraining fact to your tag like this:
width=100px
So, the entire photo tag would look like this:
<img src=”http://www.yourdomain.com/photo-1.jpg”
width=100px>
Add that pixel constraint to each photo tag; they will all display with the
same dimensions in the sidebar.

W
ordPress has taken blogging geeks by storm. Both underrated and
overrated, WordPress should be better known by the hordes of
Blogger and TypePad users, but it needs important improvements before it’s
ready for primetime in the mass-market blogging arena. At the time of this
writing, I see many Movable Type users migrating their work to WordPress —
though I don’t know of any usage statistics to substantiate that apparent
trend.
Bloggers who are abandoning Movable Type for WordPress are attracted by
the latter’s general ease. WordPress friendliness starts with a relatively
simple and trouble-free installation; WordPress is the first big-name, self-
installed, blog program to come anywhere near the ease of setting up a blog
on a hosted service. You still have to deal with downloading, unpacking, con-
figuring, and uploading to a server, the four basic steps fleshed out in Chapter 8.
But as a veteran of many such installations, I can say for certain that WordPress
is the most painless blog installation program I’ve encountered.

Understanding the Ups and Downs 
of WordPress
Ease of use extends to the daily blogging grind in WordPress, whose adminis-
trative panels are models of clutter-free, intuitive navigation. Operating a
written blog in the WordPress environment is a breeze. Not least of its
refreshing attributes is the speed of blog updates, contrary to the cumber-
some save-then-publish system that acts like a ball and chain in nearly every
other blog program, including the popular hosted services TypePad and
Blogger. WordPress feels like a swift and streamlined sports car compared to
those sedans. Movable Type, in this analogy, is more like a luxury SUV: lots of
power and space but poor mileage.
WordPress is open-source software, and that fact is an important determinant
in its user experience. Open-source software is not owned by any person or
company in a traditional sense. Any programmer can add to its features and
functionality. Successful open-source projects are not as anarchic as you
might think; though not incorporated, they are highly organized. In this case,
the organizational hub is located at this Web site:
www.wordpress.org
WordPress.org (see Figure 10-1) furnishes user manuals, discussion boards
offering user support, and links to the work of developers all over the place.
The most visible products published by those developers are of two types:
 WordPress themes: WordPress themes are prebuilt site designs avail-
able to all users. Hundreds of themes exist, and they are fairly easy to
apply. WordPress themes differ from themes and templates provided by
hosting services TypePad and Blogger, in that each theme also carries a
certain set of features; in other words, different themes provide different
functions to the blog. This characteristic is unlike TypePad and Blogger
templates, designs, and layouts, all of which replicate an identical set of
blog features in varying design packages.
 WordPress plugins: WordPress plugins are all about functionality; they
add features to the program. The world of plugins is distinct from the
world of themes. For the most part, themes do not come with bundled
plugins. By the same token, plugins are independent of themes and work
equally well (or badly!) in all themes.
190
Part III: Installing Your Own Blog Program 

WordPress plugins provide a range of extensibility that hosted blog services
cannot match. The universe of plugins, matched by the global WordPress
community of development and support, is one crucial reason the program is
so popular with bloggers inclined toward technical experimentation.
Installing themes and plugins is not particularly difficult (I step you through
each process in this chapter), but in each case a process of downloading,
unpacking, and uploading is required — a miniature version of WordPress
installation. Many casual bloggers would rather pull their eyebrows out than
spend time tinkering with their blog software.
Now for the downsides. In the first sentence of this chapter, I refer to the pop-
ularity of WordPress among “blogging geeks.” And later I say that WordPress
is a breeze for “a written blog.” (I like quoting myself. Makes me feel impor-
tant. Then my dog throws up on the carpet and my true place in the universe
is reinforced.) These are WordPress’s two big problems:
Figure 10-1:

tional 
hub and

191
Chapter 10: Blogging with WordPress

 The program is geekish. The interface lacks WYSIWYG (What You See Is
What You Get) niceties that are commonplace elsewhere. The posting
screen, for example, does not show embedded links as links — instead, it
shows the link code. (See Figure 10-2.) Same thing with simple formatting
commands such as bold type and italics. You don’t see bold or italic;
you see <strong>bold</strong> and <em>italic</em>. Yech.
 WordPress is unfriendly to photo bloggers. The program is hostile to
photos generally, although it does not forbid them or prevent the inser-
tion of photos in a blog entry. But WordPress makes it damnably hard to
accomplish that insertion. See the section in this chapter called
“Uploading and Posting Photos in WordPress” for the grisly details.
Many users fall back on photo-related plugins, but that’s like buying a
car whose steering wheel is optional equipment.
The upshot of these pros and cons is this: WordPress is a beautiful environ-
ment in which to operate a fast-moving text blog with plenty of add-on power
and a minimum of technical hassle. You probably shouldn’t consider WordPress
for a photo-heavy blog or if you prefer your administrative controls to be as
consumer-friendly as an e-mail service. WordPress rewards technical acuity
and inquisitiveness.

The Look and Feel of WordPress
Before committing to the download and installation process, I recommend
looking through this chapter — and the chapters on Movable Type, TypePad,
Radio UserLand, and Blogger — to get a sense of the WordPress design. When
I refer to program design, I mean both ends of it: the administrative controls
on the back end and the live blog on the front end. You have to live with both
ends. The administrative screens create the environment in which you write
and post; the live blog provides the environment for your visitors.
This chapter shows many screen shots of the administrative panels. Before
getting started with the administrative features, I want to highlight a few live
blogs powered by WordPress. To a degree unmatched by many blog services,
WordPress offers a diversity of design thanks to its many theme developers.
But a lot of bloggers don’t care to spend much time exploring alternative
designs, and if you’re among that number, your blog will probably display the
open, clutter-free template characteristic of WordPress.
These examples show off the stunning range of theme designs offered by
WordPress:
 SystemFundraiser: This no-nonsense site (see Figure 10-3) is devoted to
fundraising relief funds for hurricane Katrina, and it appropriately
refuses to gunk up its core mission with fancy designs. This theme is the
default WordPress theme bundled with the program.
Figure 10-3:

ous and

Chapter 10: Blogging with WordPress

 San Diego Zoo Weblog: The San Diego Zoo (see Figure 10-4) uses
WordPress to create a straightforward, yet original and attractive, site
design for its Weblog.
 Beccary: The Beccary site is run by a young woman who sometimes
develops WordPress themes, and her gorgeous site bespeaks her skill.
This design (see Figure 10-5), and her others, are available to anyone.

You have a choice of compression formats: Zip and Tar.gz. Windows users
should take the Zip file.
Click the Installation link on the download page to see specific instructions
on configuring the program files and uploading them. Just as important, read
Chapter 8 of this book carefully. That chapter tells you everything you need
to know to understand the installation instructions. Chapter 8 is essential to
any WordPress (or Movable Type) user who has never installed a blog pro-
gram on a server.
If I were to fully step through the installation process in WordPress and
Movable Type, this book would contain many pages of repeated material,
because the installation routines are similar. So, Chapter 8 gives you essential
understanding of blog installation, and the on-site manual at the WordPress
site provides specific instructions. This chapter is mostly about how to use
WordPress after it is installed.

Chapter 10: Blogging with WordPress

One point not covered in the WordPress installation documents is whether to
upload the program files in ASCII or binary mode. (Chapter 8 explains this
distinction and its importance, plus how to accomplish the right setting in
FTP programs.) So here’s the deal: All program files and folders should be
uploaded in ASCII mode except the wp-images folder. If your FTP program has
an Auto feature, it will probably work correctly during the WordPress upload.
Essential WordPress Setup
The WordPress administrative controls are beautifully laid out. In the parlance
used by WordPress support documents, each main administrative area is called
a panel, and each section within a panel is called a subpanel. That’s a bit confus-
ing, I think, so in this chapter I call the subpanels tabs. Tabs are grouped within
panels. In Figure 10-6, you see the Categories tab within the Manage panel.
Figure 10-6:
WordPress
administra-
tive controls
are laid out
using tabs
within
panels.
196
Part III: Installing Your Own Blog Program 

Several tabs relate to setting up the blog to receive entries and comments.
It’s not essential to complete every possible bit of setup before posting. In
fact, it’s not essential to complete any of it. Skip down to the “Finally —
Writing a WordPress Entry” section if you’re irrepressibly eager to get
started. This section covers the setup functions that I consider essential to a
young blog. The next section covers less important blog setup.
Establishing your identity
The first piece of business is to establish your own identity in WordPress and
in your blog. If you skip this step, your entries will be “signed” by the blog’s
default identity: Administrator. Sounds like a bureaucratic version of a
Schwarzenegger character. (“I’ll be back . . . with office supplies.”) Follow
these steps to escape from your WordPress identity crisis:
1. Click Users.
The Your Profile tab opens by default. (See Figure 10-7.)
Figure 10-7:
Use this
page to
establish
your identity
as author of
the blog.
197
Chapter 10: Blogging with WordPress

2. Fill in your first name, last name, and a nickname.
3. Use the drop-down menu to choose how your entries will be signed.
WordPress mixes up your first name, last name, and nicknames in vari-
ous combinations. You can stop here if you like; the remaining steps fill
in details that don’t normally appear on your blog.
4. Fill in your contact information.
Contact information consists of e-mail, Web site, and instant message
screen names. None of these fields is particularly important. The e-mail
address is used for administrative purposes, for example, to notify you
of a new comment.
5. Fill in your profile.
Your profile information does not appear by default in your blog, and
you cannot make it appear using basic WordPress tools. Some plugins
use popups to display your profile information.
6. Change your password.
This step is optional, but most people want to change their password
from the random characters assigned by WordPress to something they
can remember.
7. Click the Update Profile button.
When you update your profile, the change of identity immediately ripples
through the entire site. If you had posted entries before establishing your
author name, the signatures of all those entries change to your new name.
Adding a registered user
You can add authors to your blog with varying levels of administrative con-
trol. These added individuals might post entries or perform other administra-
tive chores. I am an added author in one WordPress blog; though I can write
entries, I cannot edit the entries written by the blog owner. These levels of
control are determined on a scale of 0 to 10.
The process of adding a user to your blog is a little more complicated than it
should be. Follow these steps:
1. Click the Users panel.
2. Click the Authors & Users tab.
3. In the Add New User section, fill in the boxes.
You are filling in the user’s nickname, first name, and last name at least.
You must type an e-mail address; the Web site box is optional. Give the
198
Part III: Installing Your Own Blog Program 

user a password for accessing the administrative panels of your blog. At
this stage, perplexingly, you can’t set the user’s control level.
4. Click the Add User button.
The tab reloads with the new user added to the list of registered users.
5. Click the Promote link corresponding to the new user.
6. Click the plus and minus signs to raise or lower the user’s control
level.
New users start off at level 1. You can drop a user to level 0, which with-
draws all posting privileges. Astoundingly, WordPress does not offer a
drop-down selection menu for assigning the control level, so you must
laboriously click your way upward, with the tab reloading after each
click. (See Figure 10-8.) If you’re lifting somebody up to level 9 (only 
the site owner can be a 10), you might want to put on some good music.
You do not need to save level changes; they are saved the moment you
make them.
Click the Edit link corresponding to any registered user, at any time, to adjust
that user’s properties. But use the plus and minus signs to adjust the user’s
control level.

Chapter 10: Blogging with WordPress

So, what powers do the control levels confer? It would take a few pages to
fully describe each level. Following is a brief rundown of the administrative
panels and the lowest level required to control them. Some of these adminis-
trative features are covered later in this chapter, and you might not be famil-
iar with them now:
 Write: All users above level 0 can write entries, but level 1 users cannot
publish their entries. Writing pages (which exist outside the blog
chronology) requires a level 5 or higher.
 Manage: The Manage panel provides editing tools for posts, pages, com-
ments, and categories. Level 2 users can use these tools for editing
everything except pages, which requires level 6.
 Links: The Links panel creates and edits sidebar content such as the
blogroll. Level 5 is required.
 Presentation: This panel is where alternate themes are stored and acti-
vated, changing the appearance of the site. Level 8 is required.
 Plugins: This panel stores available plugins that have been downloaded
and added to the WordPress server space. Level 8 users can activate and
deactivate plugins.
 Users: Here, users modify their profiles and add new users. Any user,
even a level 0, can modify his or her own profile. Level 5 is required to
add a new user.
 Options: The Options panel is a power-packed set of tools that affect the
setup and function of the blog, including its title and tagline. Level 6 is
required.
 Upload: Uploading files to a specified directory within the WordPress
folder system on your server is accomplished in this panel. Level 1 is
required.
This rundown is general. In some tabs within the administrative panels, users
at the required level have partial, not full, control of certain features. For a
detailed explanation of control levels, go to this page:
codex.wordpress.org/User_Levels#User_Level_Capabilities
Control levels affect user access to the WordPress administrative controls
and have nothing to do with access to your Web server where the WordPress
program is stored. Conferring a high level to another person does not give
that person FTP access to your server files. The one exception is in the
Upload panel, where files can be sent from the computer to a specified
WordPress directory on the server. Level 1 control enables a registered user
to upload files.

Choosing a title and other basic settings
Before too many people see your new blog, you probably want to give it a title
and make a few other basic setting choices. You can revisit these settings at any
time, change them, and have those changes propagate throughout the blog:
1. Click the Options panel.
The General tab (see Figure 10-9) displays by default.
2. In the Weblog Title box, type a blog name.
Your blog name can be your name or any other general title that repre-
sents the site.
3. In the Tagline box, type a short description of the blog.
The tagline appears either under the blog title of each page-top banner
or in the sidebar under the About header, depending on the theme.
4. In the E-mail Address box, enter your e-mail address.
WordPress uses this address to communicate with you; the address is
not displayed in the blog.

5. Leave the Membership check boxes deselected.
Selecting the Anyone Can Register check box opens the door to visitors
gaining level-1 administrative control of your site. This setting should be
chosen only in the most open sort of group blogging effort. The second
box forces users to register before posting a comment, which is unusu-
ally strict.
6. Set your local time by entering the number of hours local time differs
from UTC time.
UTC time is accurately displayed whenever you view this tab; reload the
page to get an up-to-the-second reading.
7. Set your default date format.
This format determines how the date appears below each blog entry.
See the next section, “Setting the date format,” for details.
8. Set your default time format.
This format determines how the time appears below each blog entry.
See the “Setting the time format” section for more.
9. Set a starting week day for your archive calendar.
Note that only some themes use an archive calendar.
Note that in the preceding steps, I omitted mention of the WordPress Address
(URI) and Blog Address (URI) boxes. In most cases, those settings should be
left alone. The default setting has the same address (the Web address of your
blog’s index page) in both boxes. That setup changes only in specialized
installations where the blog is an embedded portion of a larger site.
Setting the date format
In Step 7, you are asked to set a format that determines how the date is dis-
played below blog entries. In the Default Date Format box (shown in Figure
10-10), a cryptic string of letters appears. These letters are part of a date
code used by WordPress and other programs.
Figure 10-10:
Use code
letters to 
set a date
format and
time format.
202
Part III: Installing Your Own Blog Program 

Here is the cracked code:
l = full name of the day
F = full name of the month
M = Three-letter abbreviation of the month
j = numerical day of the month (01 to 31)
Y = full numerical year (2005)
y = two-digit year (05)
m = numerical month (01 to 12)
Note that uppercase and lowercase affect the meaning.
Use these letters with commas and spaces to generate a display of the date
below your blog entries. For example:
l, M j, Y = Saturday, Feb 26, 2005
Of course, the actual day and date depend on the time of posting. The letters
just affect the format. Here’s another:
j F y = 14 July 05
Setting the time format
You set the format for displaying the time below your blog entries in the
same way you set the date format. Naturally, a different code applies:
g = hour in 12-hour format (1 to 12)
H = hour in 24-hour format (00 to 23)
i = minutes (00 to 59)
s = seconds (00 to 59)
e = time zone identifier
a = lowercase am and pm
A = uppercase AM and PM
Use the letters with commas, colons, and spaces to create a time format. For
example:
H:i e = 18:23 EST
Here’s another:
g:i:sa = 3:15:44pm
Don’t use AM and PM with the 24-hour format.
203

For a complete list of the date and time commands, which are part of the PHP
programming language, visit this PHP help page:

Setting your categories
Because WordPress doesn’t allow you to create new categories on the fly, it
makes sense while writing an entry to set up your categories in advance. You
can’t anticipate every category you will ever want to have available for a blog
entry. At this point, just come up with a few categories with which to tag entries.
1. Click the Manage panel.
2. Click the Categories tab (see Figure 10-11).
3. In the Add New Category section, type a category name in the 
Name box.
Whatever you type will appear in your blog’s sidebar (in most cases) in
the category list. The category will also appear with a check box on the
Write Post page.
Figure 10-11:
Add new
categories
with which
your entries

204
Part III: Installing Your Own Blog Program 

4. Use the drop-down menu to assign a category parent.
The Category Parent list is populated with categories you’ve already cre-
ated. Before creating your first, the list is empty. A parent category is
like a top-level folder that holds other folders on your hard drive. Use a
parent category such as Trips to hold categories such as Pocono, Shore,
and The Big Apple. Actually, few people use parent categories, and I
don’t think they’re useful to visitors. I would simply create independent
categories such as Pocono trips, Shore trips, and New York trips.
5. In the Description box, type a description.
As indicated on the page, this field is optional. I suggest leaving it blank.
Categories are neither novels nor rocket science. The category name
should convey the gist of the category.
6. Click the Add Category button.
Finally — Writing a WordPress Entry
At last, we get to writing. If you skipped ahead to this section, your eagerness
to create is admirable. If you are reading carefully through this chapter’s sec-
tions in order, your patience is admirable.
In WordPress, simple writing is easy. Formatted writing is not difficult, but it
is also not presented in a way that is instantly understood by all users. You
don’t see what a formatted post will look like until you publish it.
205
Chapter 10: Blogging with WordPress
Posts or articles?
WordPress can’t seem to make up its mind
about what blog entries are called. Most people
call entries, well, entries or posts. WordPress
uses those words, but in the administrative
pages, it also sometimes refers to entries as
articles. (Look at the Discussion tab under
Options.) Calling an entry an article is a curious
usage, reminiscent of Usenet newsgroups (the
native bulletin board system of the Internet), in
which posts are historically called articles.
There is a reason for that example, which is that
Usenet has been around for decades and in its
early days was mostly used for posting acade-
mic articles. With blogs, though, it’s a stretch to
think of most entries as articles by any reason-
able standard. So don’t be confused: In
WordPress, when you see article, it just means
a blog post.

Composing and publishing a post
Follow these simple steps to create a blog entry:
1. Click the Write panel.
The Write Post tab appears by default. (See Figure 10-12.)
2. In the Title box, type an entry title.
3. In the Post box, type your entry.
4. Click the Publish button.
Posting is as easy as that. Your entry is posted and archived on the blog
speedily. You can also opt to Save as Draft (which doesn’t publish the entry),
or Save as Private (other registered users cannot see the saved entry, and it
is not published).
If you leave the Write Post page before saving or publishing the entry,
WordPress saves that entry as a draft and shows you a link to that draft when
you return to the Write Post page. Figure 10-12 shows two drafts available for
editing.
Figure 10-12:

Post page,

206
Part III: Installing Your Own Blog Program 

Notice the Quicktags — little buttons above the Post box. Quicktags are for-
matting buttons. Use Quicktags by selecting text in the Post box, and then
clicking a Quicktag button. Tags are inserted around the selected text; those
tags get translated to formatting in the published entry.
Here is what the fourteen Quicktags in version 1.5.2 of WordPress do:
 b: This tag creates bold text.
 i: This tag creates italic text.
 link: Use this tag to embed a link in your entry. The selected text
becomes the link.
 b-quote: This tag stands for blockquote, which is a format style that jus-
tifies text on the left (and usually on the right also), and indents the
blockquoted portion of the entry. Blockquoting is an attractive way to
set off quoted text. Each WordPress theme displays blockquoted text
uniquely. (Figure 10-13 illustrates a blockquote. Note that the WordPress
theme used in that figure uses left justification instead of right justifica-
tion for its blockquotes.)

(b-quote)

207
Chapter 10: Blogging with WordPress

 del: This tag looks like delete, but it actually puts a strikethrough line
through selected text. Bloggers traditionally use strikethroughs to
retract words and sentences while leaving them visible.
 ins: Rarely used, this tag underlines text but does not hyperlink it.
 img: Use this tag to include a digital photo in your entry.
 ul: This tag creates an indented, unnumbered list when a series of items
is selected. Keep each item on a separate line (press the Enter key after
typing each item), and then select all items and click the ul Quicktag.
 ol: This tag operates identically to the ul Quicktag, but it creates a num-
bered list.
 li: Use this tag on individual items in a list; it places a bullet next to each
tagged item without indenting it.
 code: This tag turns highlighted text into Courier font.
 more: This important tag splits a post into two parts. The index page dis-
plays the first part, and a link is provided to read the entire post on the
entry page. When composing a long entry, click this Quicktag at the point
where you want the post to be divided. Some bloggers never divide
posts; some bloggers always do. I use discretion, splitting long posts.
 lookup: This interesting tag functions on the Write Post page, not on the
blog. It selects any word of an entry-in-progress, and a browser window
pops open at the Answers.com dictionary page that defines your
selected word. Using the lookup tag does not change the appearance of
your entry.
 Close Tags: This is a clean-up tag that closes any open tags that resulted
from manually adding tags (without using Quicktags). All Quicktags
follow the HTML syntax of one open and one closed tag, like this:
<strong>bold</strong>. If the closing tag is left out when tagging
manually, the tag’s function doesn’t work. Use Close Tags to ensure good
closure of any hand-typed tags.
Configuring the Write Post page
Oh, brother. More configuring. Well, this set of options can be disregarded as
long as you want because the default appearance of the Write Post page is
perfectly adequate. But if you’d like to tinker with the page’s appearance,
click the Options panel, then the Writing tab. These are the options at your
command:
 Simple controls or Advanced controls: By default, WordPress shows
simple controls on the Write Post page — nothing more than the average
blogger needs. The most important advanced control is an Edit Time fea-
ture that allows post-dating and pre-dating entries. (See Figure 10-14.)
208
Part III: Installing Your Own Blog Program 

 Size of the writing box: The default size is nine lines; set this to any size
you want.
 Formatting: Two formatting controls are available. The first translates
an emoticon into a symbol — for example, a : ) into a smiley. The second
and more obscure formatting option corrects any mistaken XHTML code
you include in the post.
 Default post category: This drop-down list contains your existing cate-
gories and allows you to assign one as a default posting category. You
can always change the category when composing the entry on the Write
Post screen.
 Newly registered members: This option sets the posting power of blog
visitors who register themselves. Obviously, this setting is valid only
when you allow visitors to become registered users of the blog, which is
an unusual setting.
Editing Entries
Posted entries can be edited. Just do this:
1. Click the Manage panel.
The Posts tab is displayed by default. (See Figure 10-15.) Your fifteen
most recent posts are summarized on this page.

2. If the entry you want to edit is not on the list, use the pull-down menu
to select the month in which the entry was posted.
Click the Show Month button to see that month’s posts.
3. Click the Edit link corresponding to the entry you want to edit.
The entry appears on the Write Post page.
4. Edit the entry and then click the Save button.
Clicking the Save button saves and republishes the entry.
You can also use the Save and Continue Editing button, which locks down
changes you’ve made but doesn’t republish the entry. Keep making changes
and use the Save button when you’re ready to publish all your changes.
Updates to a factual post are often marked as such, with the word UPDATE
(sometimes in attention-getting caps) in the body of the entry or the entry
title or both.

Chapter 10: Blogging with WordPress
Using the WordPress sidebar and bookmarklet
Some blog services use a bookmarklet, which
attaches to the browser and makes it easy to
post an entry from any Web site. WordPress
offers such a quick-post gadget, aptly named
the WordPress bookmarklet. Look at the bottom
of the Write Post page. There, you see a Press
It — Your Name link. (Your Name should actu-
ally display your name.) Drag that link to your
browser’s toolbar. When you click the book-
marklet, a browser window pops open to a
small version of the Write Post screen, and a
link to the current page awaits in the Post box.
(See the figure in this sidebar.)
WordPress also has something called the
WordPress Sidebar, and it fills the same pur-
pose. The name is a bit confusing because the
sidebar of a blog, or any Web site, is the vertical
panel that typically contains navigational links.
In a blog, the sidebar contains the blog roll, links
to archived posts, links to recent comments,
photos, and all kinds of other blog elements.
The WordPress Sidebar is a browser feature
that attaches to the Bookmark list in Firefox and
the Favorites list in Internet Explorer. When the
bookmark is clicked, a browser sidebar opens
with an abbreviated posting form. Unlike most
bookmarklets, the posting form does not place
a link to the currently displayed Web page in the
entry. Nor does it include any Quicktags, so links
must be hand-coded. The form is so spartan, in
fact, that it’s nearly useless for most productive
blogging.

Uploading and Posting Photos
in WordPress
As I mentioned at the top of this chapter, WordPress does not handle photos
with impressive fluency. That’s being gracious; it has no fluency at all com-
pared to many hosted blog services. There is no such thing as a photo gallery
created with native WordPress tools. (By native, I mean the administrative
pages built into the WordPress program.) Inserting a photo in a blog entry?
It’s not easy, but it can be done. This section explains how.
WordPress is not a good program choice for casual or low-effort photo blog-
ging. Because of the program’s deficiencies in this regard, several developers
have written plugins that supposedly make selecting and including photos a
little easier. (See the preceding section for information about plugins.) Alas,
all the plugins I have tried require specialized knowledge, demand too much
work to configure, or simply don’t function well. I could not find one that
merited inclusion in this chapter. If you want to try them yourself, go to the
following, which is one of the best directories of WordPress plugins of all
kinds, not just photo plugins:
www.wp-plugins.net
Look under the Media category for photo plugins (see Figure 10-16).

Part III: Installing Your Own Blog Program 

In any blog program, putting a photo on a blog must be preceded by putting
the photo on the same server as the blog. The server is the Internet com-
puter where your blog resides as well as all the blog components and pieces
of content. In hosted blog services, the blog program, the blog itself, and the
blog components all reside on the service’s computer. If you use a self-
installed program such as WordPress or Movable Type, the program, the
blog, and the components reside on the computer of your Web host.
In all these scenarios, putting a photo on a blog requires two basic steps:
 Upload the photo to the server
 Assign the photo from the server to the blog
The exact process differs among programs, but the result is the same: A
photo residing on a server is displayed in a blog residing on the same server.
(Actually, it is possible to display a photo residing on a different server from
the blog, but disregard that fact for now.)
In WordPress, you can upload files of all sorts, including photos, to a direc-
tory on your server that is preset to receive files, and then assign those
photos to blog entries. It is possible to make uploads go to a different direc-
tory from the preset one, but because this entire photo process is so compli-
cated, we’ll avoid the extra complexity of changing the directory.
This first set of steps examines how to upload photos. The next set of steps
describes how to display them in a blog entry. Follow these steps to upload a
photo:
1. Click Options.
2. Click the Miscellaneous tab.
3. Select the Allow File Uploads check box.
Clicking this option adds a new panel to WordPress called Uploads.
While you’re on the Options, Miscellaneous page, note the default
upload directory in the box marked URI of This Directory. Below that
box is a recommended Web address. The address in the box might be
abbreviated.
4. Place the entire recommended Web address inside the URI of This
Directory box.
You may copy and paste it using the Ctrl+C and Ctrl+V keyboard com-
mands. This step might seem finicky, but it is crucial. The address in the
box must match the recommended address (as shown in Figure 10-17),
or this entire process will result in frustration and a sudden desire to
blame me for all your troubles, including those of your childhood. I don’t
need that, so match the addresses.
213
Chapter 10: Blogging with WordPress

5. Click the Update Options button.
6. Click Upload (see Figure 10-18).
7. Click the Browse button.
8. In the File Upload window, select a photo from your computer’s hard
drive and then click the Open button.
9. Enter a description in the Description box.
This step is optional.
10. Click the radio button next to your desired thumbnail size.
WordPress can make a thumbnail version of your uploaded photo. If you
do select a thumbnail size, WordPress creates two files: the original photo
and the smaller, thumbnail version. Many digital photos are too large to
effectively fit in a blog entry, so I recommend creating the thumbnail.
11. Click the Upload File button.
When the file has completed uploading, the page reloads saying File
uploaded! The page presents a single line of code below “Here’s the code
to display it.” (See Figure 10-19.) Note that if you created a thumbnail in
addition to uploading the full-sized file, only one line of code is presented,
and that code represents the full-sized file. WordPress does not (as of this
writing) give you display code for the thumbnail, even though that is quite
likely the file you want to insert in a blog entry.

Take a breather. Uploading a photo is the first part of getting it into your blog.
The second part is inserting the photo in an entry.
The first three steps in the preceding list apply only to the first time you
upload a file. WordPress installs with uploading capability disabled, and
those three steps enable it. Once enabled, uploading stays enabled unless
you disable it. So, starting with your second photo upload, begin the process
with the fourth step.
All right, enough sitting around. Let’s move on to inserting a photo in a blog
entry. The problem with WordPress in this department is that it doesn’t provide

Chapter 10: Blogging with WordPress

a photo-browsing tool on the Write Post page. You need to manually place the
address of the uploaded photo in the post, surrounded by the proper display
tags. We left off on Step 9 on the File uploaded! page, showing a line of code
for displaying the uploaded photo. For now, ignore the lack of code for the
thumbnail; we’ll work with the full-sized file.
1. Select and copy the display code.
Use Ctrl+C to copy the line to the Windows clipboard.
2. Click Write.
3. On the Write Post page, paste the line of code into the Post box.
Figure 10-20 shows text preceding the line of code in a composed entry,
but you needn’t add any text for this example. In real blogging life, if you
want the photo to be accompanied by some words, you would type the
words above the line of code if you wanted the picture below the text,
and vice versa.
4. In the Title box, enter a title.
5. Click the Publish button.
6. Click the View site link to see your blog with the new entry displaying
your photo.

That’s it. It took only seventeen steps to jam a photo into a WordPress blog
entry, and it was carefree fun from start to finish. (Figure 10-21 shows the
result. In this entry I used the thumbnail version of an uploaded photo, as
explained next.) If you have several hundred photos you’d like to share, you
have a lot of work ahead of you. However, if you post photos rarely, the
WordPress process isn’t much of a hindrance. WordPress doesn’t invite
photo blogging, but neither does it prevent you from showing images.
If you want to insert the thumbnail instead of the full-sized file in your entry,
simply adhere to the file-naming routine used by WordPress. The program
places the word thumb and a hyphen in front of the filename in the Web
address of the uploaded photo. Here’s how it breaks down. When you see
your display code on the File uploaded! page, it looks something like this:
<img src=’http://www.yoursite.com/wp/wp-content/
20050921097.jpg’ alt=’Pocono’ />
Your domain is different, of course, and the directory in which your blog
resides (wp in this example) might also be different. The directory holding
your uploads (wp-content) is the WordPress default directory for uploads.
The alt part contains your description of the photo, and appears when visi-
tors hover the mouse over the photo in your blog. Disregard that part. It is
the following part that concerns us:
20050921097.jpg
Figure 10-21:
A blog entry
with a

one uses a
thumbnail
created 
by the
WordPress

process.
217
Chapter 10: Blogging with WordPress

That is the filename of your uploaded photo. From that name, you can derive
the filename of the thumbnail:
thumb-20050921097.jpg
The entire display code for the thumbnail picture is this:
<img src=’http://www.yoursite.com/wp/wp-content/
thumb-20050921097.jpg’ alt=’Pocono’ />
To put a thumbnail in your blog entry, you must type that addition (thumb-)
after pasting the original display code in your post.
Finding and Changing Themes
WordPress themes are powerful packages that do two things:
 Change the color scheme of your blog
 Change some of the features of your blog
That second point is unusual among blog programs. Themes (or templates or
styles or whatever the program calls them) usually change only the graphic
design, leaving features the same. In WordPress, one theme might implement
a calendar interface to archived posts, for example, while another theme
does not.
Hundreds of WordPress themes exist, most of them stored off the WordPress
site. WordPress officially endorses all compatible themes and helps users
find them to some extent. Locating themes is an informal business. You can
search for them in Google, Yahoo!, or any other Web engine. One of the best
repositories of themes, and one of the most effective galleries, is Alex King’s
WordPress Theme Browser, located here:
www.alexking.org/software/wordpress/theme_browser.php
This excellent interface (shown in Figure 10-22) displays any of dozens of
themes listed in a drop-down menu and provides one-click downloading of
most themes. In the next two sections, I walk you through visiting Alex King’s
gallery, auditioning the themes, and downloading, unpacking, uploading, and
activating one theme in WordPress.
218
Part III: Installing Your Own Blog Program 

Downloading a WordPress theme
It doesn’t matter where you find a theme or from where you download it. This
example uses Alex King’s WordPress Theme Browser.
1. Go to Alex King’s site.
In your browser, enter the Web address listed in the preceding section.
2. At the WordPress Theme Browser, use the drop-down menu to select a
theme.
Selecting a theme displays it in your browser; you might have to wait a
few seconds.
3. Click the Download link next to the drop-down menu.
Find a theme you like before downloading it, but also be aware that no
theme change is necessarily forever. Part of the fun is acquiring many
themes, and then applying them all to your blog (one at a time) before
deciding on the best. Follow your browser’s normal download process.
In most cases, you will acquire a file in Zip compression format, which
needs to be unpacked on your computer.
Figure 10-22:

4. Double-click the downloaded file to open your computer’s default
decompression program.
Computers using Windows XP should have no trouble with this. If your
computer doesn’t have a default decompression program, open WinZip
or whatever program you used to unpack the WordPress program.
5. Save the extracted files where your FTP program can easily find them;
you’ll be using the FTP program to upload the theme.
I place unpacked themes in the WordPress directory, which mimics the
directory structure on my server. That means they go into the Themes
folder, which lies within the wp-content folder. But where you put them in
your computer isn’t important, as long as you can find them.
The unpacked files are usually nested in a folder named for the theme. For
example, the Flex theme unpacks to a Flex folder, within which are the theme
files and another folder with a few necessary image files.
Next, you must upload the theme to your server into a certain WordPress
folder, and then activate the theme in WordPress.
Uploading and activating a theme
Picking up where we left off in the preceding section, you have downloaded
and unpacked a theme. Continue:
1. Open your FTP program.
2. In your FTP program, locate your unpacked folder.
3. Upload the theme files to the Themes folder, which is nested in the
wp-content folder on your server.
Upload the container folder holding the theme files. Include any nested
folders located with the theme files. Throw the whole mess into that
Themes folder.
4. In WordPress, click the Presentation panel.
The Themes tab appears by default (see Figure 10-23).
5. Click the Select link corresponding to your newly uploaded theme.
Wait for the tab to reload before checking your blog.
When the theme is activated, every page of your blog changes over to it.
Themes often contain an image folder that should be uploaded in binary
mode. The other theme files should be uploaded in ASCII mode. If your FTP
program has an Auto feature that selects the correct mode, use it. See
Chapter 8 for more about file uploading.

Part III: Installing Your Own Blog Program 

Side Content
The sidebar in WordPress is used mostly to list things. The most common list
contains links and functions as a blogroll. However, you don’t have to call
such a list a blogroll, and it can be more descriptive to call it exactly what it
is, such as My friends, or Sites of interest, or News sites. WordPress encour-
ages users to create so-called link categories, which are distinct lists.
The following steps walk you through the process of creating a sidebar list.
The list category will be called Daily Visitation, and it will contain the core
sites of your daily routine.
1. Click the Links panel.
2. Click the Link Categories tab.
3. In the Name box under Add a Link Category (see Figure 10-24), type
Daily Visitation.
Leave all the other settings unchanged — which is to say, blank.
4. Click the Add Category button.
The Link Categories tab reloads showing the Daily Visitation category
along with the default Blogroll category.

5. Click the Add Link tab.
6. In the Basics section, type the URI (Web address) of your first list 
destination.
You might want to copy and paste it from the Destination bar of your
browser, when the browser is viewing that page.
7. In the Link Name box, type the item name.
This is the name that will appear in the blog sidebar. Typically, it is the
name of the destination site. I always leave the Short description box
empty because I don’t want the list gunked up with extra words.
8. Use the pull-down Category menu to select Daily Visitation.
9. Click the Add Link button.
10. Repeat Steps 6 through 9 for each new item.
After you add the first item of a new list, the list appears in your blog with
that one item. Each added item republishes the entire blog (fast!) with the
newly augmented list in the sidebar of every page.
Use the Manage Links tab in the Links panel to organize displays of your vari-
ous link categories and to edit any item on any list.

Part III: Installing Your Own Blog Program 

WordPress comes with a default blogroll consisting of links to WordPress-
related destinations. The preset list is an inconvenience because you will
almost certainly want to get rid of it. The quickest way would be to delete the
Blogroll category and start fresh if you want to use that category name.
Unfortunately, WordPress doesn’t let you do that, because Blogroll is the
default category. I don’t know why that should make it inviolable, but there
you have it.
Unable to delete the Blogroll link category, the next best step is to make it
invisible. WordPress magnanimously allows this operation. Here’s how:
1. In the Links panel, click the Manage Links tab.
2. In the pull-down Show Links in Category menu, select Blogroll.
3. Click the Show button.
4. Select the boxes corresponding to each Blogroll item (as shown in
Figure 10-25).

5. Under Manage Multiple Links, click the Toggle Visibility button.
This action turns off the Blogroll list, and it disappears from your sidebar.
If you want to use the Blogroll category for your own blogroll destinations in
the future, use the Edit link next to each item in the original list and change
its destination link.

R
adio UserLand is an old-school blogging program that remains relevant.
Back in the day (about six years ago), Radio UserLand made big waves
by providing what might have been the easiest way to start blogging — and
power-blogging, at that. Now, you don’t hear people talking about launching
Radio UserLand blogs as much as you hear about TypePad, Blogger,
WordPress, and the social networks.
But Radio UserLand is still unique among the top blogging platforms; it offers
power without the hassle of a server installation. The program gets installed
on your computer like any other program (a new version of a browser, for
example, or a downloaded music player such as iTunes). That program con-
nects with the Radio UserLand online server and feeds what you create up to
that server.
Radio UserLand started in 2000 as a program for building and sharing music
playlists. The program did not share actual music, as the original Napster did —
just lists of favorite music drawn from music-file collections in the users’
computers. There was nothing illegal about Radio UserLand in those days,
but lawsuits were banging away on other companies (such as the original
Napster), and its owners grew weary of paying lawyers to keep the program
on the right side of the law. So Radio UserLand kept its name and switched to
blogging.

This chapter works with version 8.2 of Radio UserLand. Version 8.0 was intro-
duced in 2001, so it might not be a surprise to learn that the program has a
rather old look and feel. Like LiveJournal (see Chapter 5), which also hosts a
community several years old, Radio UserLand has not kept pace with the
pushbutton advances of hosted blogging. The program is on the clunky side
of the elegance divide, its design themes are not inspiring, and the people
who get the most out of it are technically oriented folks who can get their
hands into the page code.
At the same time, Radio UserLand explains itself better than most advanced
blog programs and does have that tantalizing advantage of power without the
installation hassle. Read on to see whether Radio UserLand is right for you.
Understanding Radio UserLand’s 
Unique Operation
Radio UserLand operates differently from every other blog service and pro-
gram in this book. Here are a few clarifying points:
 Radio UserLand is a program that resides on your computer, just like
Word or iTunes.
 Radio UserLand does not operate in its own window, like Word or
iTunes. Instead, the program operates through your Web browser.
 Although Radio UserLand remains on your computer, your blog is stored
on an Internet server.
 Radio UserLand uploads your entries to the server. At the same time,
the program keeps copies of all your entries on your computer.
 Upstreaming (the process of updating your live blog on the Internet)
occurs automatically according to preset time intervals. You can also
force upstreaming to occur.
From these main points, you can see how Radio UserLand operates. You work
on your blog in your browser, creating entries that are placed on your com-
puter’s hard drive. Radio UserLand upstreams everything you create to your
blog, published live on the Internet. The program is a liaison between your
computer and the server storing your blog. After you download and install
Radio UserLand, it operates similarly to the other programs in this book: You
make changes to your blog in a browser window. The difference is that you
are keeping a copy of your entire blog on your computer.
226
Part III: Installing Your Own Blog Program 

Note: Radio UserLand’s upstreaming process replaces the publish and repub-
lish functions in other programs such as TypePad, Movable Type, and
Blogger. Publishing and republishing a blog, which push changes through the
entire site, add an extra step to the blogging process that is unwelcome and
sometimes accidentally neglected. The advantage of Radio UserLand’s
system is that the program looks for changes and pushes them through to
the site behind the scenes, with no effort from you. New entries are detected
and published within ten seconds, which is certainly fast enough for any
blog. This auto-maintenance leaves you free to write and adjust settings with-
out worrying about forgetting to click a Publish button.
Downloading and Installing 
Radio UserLand
Like WordPress and Movable Type, Radio UserLand is a program that must
be acquired and installed on your computer. Unlike WordPress and Movable
Type, a boxed version of Radio UserLand is available, so you can install from
a CD if that’s your preference. The faster route is to download a trial version
of the program, which remains full-featured for 30 days, after which period
you must buy a one-year subscription to continue using the program. That
subscription pays for the server space in which your blog is stored and
served to online visitors. Radio UserLand is a hosted blog platform like
TypePad and Blogger, but differs from those two platforms by the fact that
you must install a program on your computer to access the server space.
Go here to download the version of Radio UserLand made for your 
computer type:
radio.userland.com/download
When the downloaded file is on your computer, install the program as you
would any other application. At the end of the installation process, a page
called It Worked! appears in your browser (see Figure 11-1). If your default
browser is not already open, Radio UserLand asks for your browser and
opens it.
On the It Worked! page, fill in your name, e-mail address, and a password. All
the other forms on the page are unnecessary in most cases. Click the Submit
button and you’re on your way to blogging in Radio UserLand.
227
Chapter 11: Power Plus Ease in Radio UserLand

Now, about that browser. With most blogging services (a notable exception
being MSN Spaces, profiled in Chapter 4), your choice of browser doesn’t
matter to the appearance and functions of the blog service and your blog
controls. But Radio UserLand is tailored for Internet Explorer (IE). The differ-
ences are important. So again, as I did when describing MSN Spaces, I must
depart from this book’s default browser choice, Firefox, and write from an IE
perspective. When Radio UserLand asks for your default browser during
installation, I suggest naming Internet Explorer even if you normally use
Firefox. Your default setting for all browser uses except Radio UserLand will
not be changed.
To start Radio UserLand and work on your blog, simply double-click the
Radio UserLand desktop icon as with any other program. (You can open the
program also in the All Programs menu from the Windows Start button.)
When Radio UserLand opens, it displays your blog’s control panel in Internet
Explorer. Figure 11-2 shows the Home screen of the control panel — that’s the
default screen where you write entries.

Setting Up Your Blog
Radio UserLand is a powerful, highly configurable blog program containing
more settings and options than this chapter can describe. A few of these set-
tings are crucial and should be visited before posting entries. All settings are
selected on the Prefs page, the link to which is in the menu bar atop every
control panel page (refer to Figure 11-2). Figure 11-3 shows just a portion of
the Prefs page.
To get these few important settings out of the way, follow these steps:
1. On the Home page, click the Prefs link.
2. On the Prefs page, click the Title and Description link.
This link is the first one in the Weblog group.

4. Click the Submit button.
5. Still on the Title and Description page, click the Prefs link in the 
menu bar.
For some reason, the program fails to return you to the Prefs page after
you have submitted a title and description. Programs can be so dumb.
6. On the Prefs page, click the Enable the WYSIWYG editing tool link,
and select the check box on the next page.
This is an important feature that should be set by default, but isn’t. The
setting makes it easy to include pictures in blog entries. You can activate
this feature only when using the Internet Explorer browser.
7. Click the Submit button, and then return to the Prefs page.
Dumb program.
8. On the Prefs page, click the Upstreaming link in the Basic Preferences
group.
This setting enables automatic publishing of your settings and blog
entries.
9. Select the check box next to Check This Box to Enable Upstreaming.
This page informs you of the upstream schedule for different parts of
the blog. Don’t worry if you don’t understand all the scheduled items.
Radio UserLand upstreams timely items, such as entries, every ten sec-
onds. Less immediate changes, such as to monthly archive lists, get
upstreamed less frequently.
10. Scroll down and click the Submit button.
These settings prepare your blog for writing and posting entries. So . . . let’s
start doing that!
Writing and Posting Entries
Composing an entry in Radio UserLand, as in many programs, is about as
easy as writing an e-mail message. Figure 11-5 illustrates the process, show-
ing an entry in progress.
231
Chapter 11: Power Plus Ease in Radio UserLand

A few things about this page to note:
 The title entry box is below the text entry box. Don’t forget to type a
title for your blog entry.
 In most cases, you want to select the WYSIWYG radio button below the
text box. That acronym stands for What You See Is What You Get, and
clicking that choice shows everything in the text box (such as an embed-
ded link) as it will appear in your published entry. Use the Source radio
button for writing HTML tags.
 Use the drop-down menus to select paragraph choices (such as bold
headers), font type, font size, and font color. Using multiple font colors
is usually a poor stylistic choice in a blog.
 The Link box turns your entry title into a link, and the URL (Web address)
you type in that box determines the link destination. If you leave the box
empty, the title link leads to the permalink, or unique entry page, for
that entry. I always prefer the permalink option, because I think it’s nat-
ural for an entry title to connect the reader with the entry page. So I
leave the Link box blank.

 Categories must be enabled to appear on the Home page. Click the Prefs
link, and on the Prefs page click the Categories link. On the Categories
page, select the box enabling categories — and don’t forget to click the
Submit button. Click the New Category page link on the Categories page
to create your own categories; there is no need to use Radio UserLand’s
dorky presets.
 Click the Post to Weblog button to save your entry and prepare it for
upstreaming, which will occur within ten seconds.
 In the right sidebar, click the Home link to see your published blog. (See
Figure 11-6.) This is a bit confusing, because you are already on the
Home page of the Radio UserLand controls. You just have to get your
mind around the fact that Radio UserLand uses the same word for two
very different things.
 Scroll down the Home page to see the ten most recently posted entries
(Figure 11-7). Click the Edit icon next to any entry to alter it. Select the
check box next to any entry or entries and then click the Delete button
to wipe them off your blog.

When you have finished composing your entry, click the Post to Weblog
button.
Including a Photo in a Blog Entry
Posting a photo in Radio UserLand is so arcane as to be nearly Gothic. This is
not the program to use if you seek point-and-click photo publishing. Still,
there are systems in Radio UserLand for getting it done. I am going to step
you through one of those systems in detail. Before I do, I want to describe
more generally how the program deals with images, upstreams them, and
makes them available to you for including in an entry.
Radio UserLand maintains a duplicate of your blog site on your computer.
The duplicate site is housed in a series of folders on your computer. From
those folders, the program upstreams everything you create (such as a blog
entry) or copy into a folder (such as a digital photo). To include a photo in a
post, that photo must reside online — that means, in Radio UserLand lingo, it
must be upstreamed. To get upstreamed, a photo must be placed into a
folder that Radio UserLand routinely checks for upstreamable material.
Figure 11-7:
The Home
page of
Radio
UserLand’s
controls
shows the
ten most
recently
posted
entries.
234
Part III: Installing Your Own Blog Program 

Given all that, here are the general steps that must happen to post a picture
(I’ll get to the specific steps next):
 You copy a photo from its spot on your hard drive to the Images folder
in Radio UserLand’s directories, which are also on your hard drive. You can
view the Images folder by clicking it on the Folders page. (See Figure 11-8.)
 Radio UserLand upstreams that photo (or photos) to your space on
Radio UserLand’s online server.
 You determine the exact address on Radio UserLand’s server to which
your photo was upstreamed.
 You copy that address into an HTML tag when composing the entry in
which the photo will be embedded.
 You publish the entry and your photo appears in it.
A far cry from clicking a button on the entry-writing page and choosing a
photo, eh? If this exercise puts you off of Radio UserLand as a photo-friendly
blogging tool, I understand. The program (version 8.2) includes a tool called
My Pictures, which you can read about on the Tools page (click the Tools link
in the menu bar). If you activate My Pictures, you can use it by copying your
pictures to a special folder set up by Radio UserLand; the program then
copies them again to the Images folder; from there the pics get upstreamed
and are available for entries as in the method just shown.
Figure 11-8:
The Folders
page shows
the Radio
UserLand
directory 
on your 
hard drive.
235
Chapter 11: Power Plus Ease in Radio UserLand

The idea behind My Pictures is that you routinely put digital photos in that
special folder, and they all get upstreamed to their available spots online.
That part of it is slightly easier than manually copying pictures to the Images
folder, but you still have to code the photo’s location into an entry box in
Source mode, which is unfriendly no matter how you get there.
Radio UserLand is primarily about blogging information, presented as text. The
next section describes one of its strongest features: the built-in newsreader.
Using the Built-In Newsreader
Many bloggers, especially those writing topical blogs about current events,
rely on newsreaders to provide a full range of articles and commentary from
around the Web. If you don’t use a newsreader or don’t understand how
newsreaders fit into blogging, Chapter 13 can help. Radio UserLand was
founded by the same person who helped invent RSS (again, see Chapter 13),
so it’s natural that the program includes some kind of RSS functionality.
Indeed, Radio UserLand shows off one of the most powerful combinations of
newsreading functions and blogging features.
Blending news with a blog platform isn’t unique to Radio UserLand. Sites
such as Bloglines, Technorati, and Digg encourage some level of blog cre-
ation, but the blogging features are sometimes rudimentary at sites whose
primary function is searching for or displaying news. Radio UserLand
reverses that formula by matching strong blogging with a newsreader that is,
to be frank, a little primitive compared to dedicated newsreaders.
The newsreader in Radio UserLand has three basic functions:
 Subscribe to any RSS feed
 Display a list of stories from your subscribed feeds
 Create an entry directly from a news story
Manipulating your feeds, mixing them to create unique news feeds, and auto-
tracking what you’ve read — these basic features of dedicated newsreaders
are lacking in Radio UserLand. But I find the built-in newsreader convenient
for tracking a few important feeds — especially feeds whose items often form
the basis of a blog post — while another newsreader performs the heavy lift-
ing of handling dozens or hundreds of feeds.
The newsreader is located on the News page; click the News link in the menu
bar to see it. (See Figure 11-9.) Radio UserLand starts you off with a bunch of
feed subscriptions, which can be kept, deleted, or added to.
236
Part III: Installing Your Own Blog Program 

On the News page, click the Subscribed link to manage your feeds.
Subscribing to a feed requires knowing the URL of a page containing an RSS
feed — you don’t need to type the actual feed address. (See Figure 11-10.) For
example, typing www.nytimes.com results in subscribing to the RSS feed for
the front page of the Web edition of The New York Times. You can get that
address on any Web page that offers a feed. Look for the orange XML chicklet
(once again, look in Chapter 13 for a good deal of elevating literature about
XML chicklets) on a page.
On the News page, click the Post button corresponding to any news story to
create a blog post based on that story. The Home page immediately appears,
with the entry box containing a link to the story and whatever text is
included in the feed. (See Figure 11-11.) You can post the story as is or link to
it as part of your own commentary on the story.
When composing an entry based on a news story, Radio UserLand does not
fill in the Title field. Be sure to add a title to your blog post.

Changing Themes
In Radio UserLand, a theme is a site design. The figures in this chapter show
off Radio UserLand’s default theme. Several other themes are available.
Switching among them is easy enough, but auditioning them is hard. No
graphics are provided on the Themes page, neither is a Preview button, so
the only way to find a theme you like is to switch and then load your site to
check what it looks like. The control pages in your browser also switch to 
the new theme, so you get some idea of its color scheme right away. Follow
these steps:
1. Click the Themes link in the menu bar.
2. Select the radio button next to any theme.
3. Scroll down and click the Apply Theme button.
4. On the confirmation page, click the Apply Theme button.
The Themes page reappears, displayed in the new theme.
Radio UserLand: The Upshot
Throughout this chapter I both praise and damn Radio UserLand: It’s power-
ful but primitive around the edges. You can produce an impressive text-
oriented blog with it, especially a newsy blog. But photos are a nightmare 
and the whole presentation could use more buttons to accomplish things
faster. Radio UserLand is getting upstaged by new blog services that cater to
newcomers and nontechnical bloggers of experience.
That’s one key to success with Radio UserLand — how technical you are. The
program doesn’t provide many themes but is highly configurable if you know
your way around template code. Look at Sexy Magick (see Figure 11-12), a
personal site built with Radio UserLand that looks strikingly different from
the basic templates. Crooks and Liars, a well-known political and current
events blog, bears traces of its Radio UserLand foundation (see Figure 11-13)
but has been seriously tweaked.
If you want a personal blog with occasional or frequent photos, I would turn
away from Radio UserLand and head for MSN Spaces or TypePad. If you want
a newsy blog integrated with unlimited news sources, and are adventurous
enough to configure your site from the code up, Radio UserLand could be a
lot of fun and can produce a terrific site.

Hybrid Blog Hosts: Power 
Without the Pain
In This Chapter
 Understanding the benefits of Web hosts with preinstalled blog programs
 Surveying Movable Type hosts
 Previewing WordPress hosts
C
hapters 9 and 10 might give you a hankering to get your hands on the
power-blogging tools Movable Type and WordPress. At the same time,
Chapter 8 might give you serious pause. For those who like tons of features,
heavy blog programs are fun to grapple with, but hoisting those programs to
a server and installing them correctly can be far removed from anything
resembling fun. Not every painter wants to construct his own canvas, and not
every blogger wants to install his or her own program.
Recognizing a need for installation services, some Web hosts offer domain-
hosting accounts with Movable Type and WordPress preinstalled. Chapter 8
covers domain ownership and Web hosts in detail. For this chapter, here’s
what you need to know:
 A domain is the last part of a Web address: www.domain.com. The most
popular domain type is .com, but others are available, such as .net, .org,
and .biz.
 Domains are bought and sold like virtual real estate. Most people buy
unclaimed domains at domain registrars, companies sanctioned by
ICANN (Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers).
 A domain name is the address of a Web site, which may or may not be 
a blog.
 Domains are hosted by Web hosting companies. If you own a domain
name, you can lease space on a Web host’s server and build your blog
on that server.

 Many Web hosts are also sanctioned registrars, or work with an official
registrar. In both cases, users can register their domains at the Web
host’s site, which streamlines the process of assigning the domain to the
Web host’s server.
This chapter highlights several Web hosts that offer preinstalled Movable
Type or WordPress programs.
The Unique Power of Hybrid Hosts
Great features combined with ease of use make a powerful mix. The services
profiled in this chapter offer easy startup with one of the most powerful and
popular blogging programs around — Movable Type (which I describe in
Chapter 9) or WordPress (see Chapter 10).
If you’re considering opening an account at one of these Web hosts, you
should definitely look through those chapters first to get a feel for which pro-
gram, if either, you prefer. This suggestion is more than the usual “Read my
words!” plea, though I am not above such pathetic bleating. At issue here is
time and money. Assigning a domain name to a Web host is a bit of a hassle,
and you can wait up to 48 hours for the assignment to take effect. Most of the
companies in these pages make smooth sailing of the domain registration and
first assignment. But yanking your domain out of one host and assigning it to
another is not a task you want to perform capriciously. So my point is this:
Don’t open one of these hosting accounts to get a first look at Movable Type
or WordPress. Make an educated choice the first time, and enjoy a stable rela-
tionship with your Web host.
The price of hybrid hosting
Now for an economic reality: Web hosting with preinstalled blog software
costs more than most other options described in this book. The cost is not
unreasonable, when you think about it — especially for Movable Type affili-
ates, which tend to cost more than hosts working with WordPress. First, the
preinstalled blog software is an added feature, and added features tend to
have charges associated with them. Second, in the case of Movable Type,
some hosts provide the Personal Basic or Personal Unlimited version of the
program, each of which charges a license fee to users — and to Web hosts
that supply the program to users.
The result of this economic reality is that hybrid hosting accounts can be a
bit pricey compared to standard Web hosting accounts without built-in blog
software. In some cases, the hosting plans break down the monthly charge
into two parts: regular hosting plus the blog software as an added feature.
242
Part III: Installing Your Own Blog Program 

However it is broken down, Movable Type hosting plans cost in the neighbor-
hood of $10 to $16 a month. WordPress plans tend to be cheaper —
WordPress itself is free software to all users and providers.
How does that price range compare to nonblog Web hosting? It is not difficult
to find traditional hosting plans in the range of $5 to $10 a month. So, with
blog hosting, you are paying each month for the convenience of not installing
the program at the start, plus customer service whenever you need it. Some
companies reduce the monthly rate for customers who pay in advance —
three months, six months, a year, or two years.
Part of the deal with blog-oriented Web hosting is the nonblog part of your
plan, which is substantial and adds to the cost. You get all the perks of tradi-
tional hosting, such as multiple e-mail addresses, FTP access to the account
for uploading nonblog material, scripts for adding functions to Web pages, 
e-commerce features such as an online shopping cart, and sophisticated traf-
fic measurement statistics. If your eyes are glazing over, that might be an indi-
cation that you would be paying for a lot of stuff you don’t want and would
never use.
Evaluating hybrid hosts
The short profiles in this chapter provide a sketch of basic features and
values, as of the writing of this book. Naturally, you should check the sites
listed for current details. My evaluations of the services are based on pub-
lished specifications such as cost, storage, and added features — not neces-
sarily on personal experience or any appraisal of customer service. Web
hosts of all sorts also differ on reliability, which is reflected in your site’s con-
tinuous uptime, or availability to visitors. That factor does not play into these
snapshots and, admittedly, is hard to determine in advance. All Web hosts
proclaim superb reliability.
Here’s the upshot. Web hosting accounts with preinstalled blog software are
great for enthusiastic domain owners, either new or experienced. There is
unique pleasure in owning a piece of Internet real estate. If you want to dive
into that rarified realm, go for it. And if you’ve hosted domains before, one of
these hybrid hosts might tempt you to switch or to start a blog with a new
domain.
Movable Type Hosts
Movable Type arguably has the most powerful set of blogging tools you can find
and is certainly a complex beast to install. The hosts spotlighted in this section
offer preinstalled Movable Type and, in some cases, interesting additions.

AQHost
www.aqhost.com
AQHost offers two blogging accounts: Blogger and Blogger Plus, the latter
providing more storage for the prolific blogger. Don’t confuse this Movable
Type account with Blogger.com! (Read about Blogger.com in Chapter 6.)
Monthly rates are $10 and $16 for Blogger and Blogger Plus, respectively.
Discounts apply for a quarterly or annual payment.
AQHost is seriously dedicated to top-flight Movable Type service. The
Unlimited Personal edition of the program is offered in both plans, allowing a
limitless number of blogs and authors. Future upgrades are included, and
video tutorials are provided.
Storage capacity is moderate: 350 megabytes and 600 megabytes for the two
plans. The smaller plan includes plenty of room for an ongoing text blog and
plenty of pictures. High-volume photobloggers can start with Blogger and
move up to Blogger Plus as needed.
LivingDot
www.livingdot.com
LivingDot covers many bases; the service offers preinstallations of both
Movable Type and WordPress. Plans start at $10.95 a month, which gets you a
substantial 750 megabytes of space. LivingDot owns about a dozen beautiful,
straightforward Movable Type templates (site designs) and makes them
available to customers. (See Figure 12-1.)
LivingDot offers two interesting features, the first of which is unique to my
knowledge:
 TypePad Booster: TypePad is a hosted blogging service I describe in
Chapter 7, and it uses special software based on, but different from,
Movable Type. TypePad and Movable Type were created by the same
company, SixApart. LivingDot has fashioned a special account that
merges TypePad blog hosting with LivingDot Web hosting, so you can
get multiple e-mail boxes and other Web-host perks while running a
TypePad blog.
 Photoblogging: LivingDot provides software (neither Movable Type nor
WordPress, but usable with either) dedicated to photoblogging. This ser-
vice empowers you to create photo albums and automatically makes
thumbnails of your full-size photos.

MediaTemple
www.mediatemple.net
MediaTemple advertises exceptional value in the storage department: $7.95
per month for 2 gigabytes (2000 megabytes) of memory, which should be
enough to keep you blogging with photos for the next 37 years. Maybe 38. You
can also put more than one Web site (in other words, more than one regis-
tered domain name) in all that space. However, Movable Type installation
adds $5.95 a month to the account. Even so, at about $14 a month, it’s a better
deal than TypePad Pro, which costs $1 more and offers only half the storage.
Nexcess.net
www.nexcess.net
The default Movable Type edition installed in Nexcess.net accounts is
Unlimited Personal, which places no limitation on the number of blogs or

authors and costs $2.95 a month. (Commercial editions of Movable Type are
also available at prices ranging up to $70 a month. Personal blogging does
not require a commercial version.) The beginners’ account is called Mini-Me,
and is priced at $6.95 without the Movable Type add-on. So, to blog at
Nexcess.net, count on paying a minimum of $9.90 a month; that account gives
you 500 megabytes. The next plan leaps up to $25, so if you intend to blog
voraciously, or with memory-hogging pictures, shop around.
Pair Networks
www.pair.com
Pair scares by listing high-priced plans first. Scroll down the Web Hosting
page to see more reasonable prices. The Basic plan allows for 500 megabytes
of space for $9.95; then add $5.95 for Movable Type. As with a few other com-
panies, Pair allows you to host multiple domain names, so a great value can
be had by squeezing a few modest blogs into the Basic plan.
2MHost
www.2mhost.com
The oddly named 2MHost started providing Movable Type in March 2005.
They offer one of the best value deals around for preinstallation: $6.95 a
month includes the blogging add-on and delivers 500 megabytes of storage.
2MHost gets into template design with several exclusive themes that are pic-
turesque and idiosyncratic — less sedate and businesslike than the themes
designed by LivingDot. (See Figure 12-2.)
WordPress Hosts
WordPress installation is not as daunting as Movable Type, but why do it if
you don’t have to? If you’re starting a new domain, and would just as soon
avoid server installations, each of the hosts profiled here offers good values
compared to traditional, nonblog Web hosting. In fact, you could make a good
case for these hosts even without the WordPress feature. Because WordPress
is free software, hosts have less justification for charging additionally for it
than with Movable Type.

Part III: Installing Your Own Blog Program 

BlueHost
www.bluehost.com
If you already own and host a domain name on another server, BlueHost
stands ready to provide whatever customer service is necessary to easily
transfer your business to its WordPress-enabled plan. The basic account
shows excellent value: For $6.95, you get 4 gigabytes (4000 megabytes) of
storage, and you can divide it among six domain names (six separate Web
sites or blogs).
PowWeb
www.powweb.com
At the time of this writing, PowWeb was offering various incentives: two free
months with a one-year sign-up or six free months with a two-year sign-up. In
a basic $7.77 per month account, 5 gigabytes (5000 megabytes) of storage are

included — the best storage value of the hosts in this section. (That rate was
based on annual payments.) There was no mention of multiple domain names
being allowed; without that feature, the 5 gigs is probably a waste of space.
DreamHost
www.dreamhost.com
Another outstanding package of values, DreamHost prices monthly plans at
$9.95 with WordPress included, or $7.95 per month when paid two years in
advance. You get a whopping 4.8 gigabytes (4800 megabytes), and you can
host an unlimited number of domains (each representing a different blog) in
that space. This value is better than the TypePad Plus or Pro account.
Laughing Squid
www.laughingsquid.net
Laughing Squid prides itself on community feeling and great customer ser-
vice. Interestingly and uniquely among the services in this chapter, the com-
pany discounts prices upon perceived need in some cases (the “starving
artist discount”). Published rates range from $7 to $12 per month for — this
is a disappointment — only 100 megabytes. WordPress is included.

T
his part has fun ideas and information. It also contains
a crucial, no-nonsense chapter on RSS feeds (Chapter
13). They are the growing distribution mechanism of
blogs, and every blogger must have a handle on using
them. Chapter 14 is an intriguing revelation of blogging
customs. The blog universe is like a distinct nation, com-
plete with unwritten but compelling rules of behavior.
This chapter spells out the do’s and don’ts, so you can
avoid embarrassment and, in some cases, more serious
repercussions.
Have you wondered about making a little money from
blogging? Perhaps you’ve read articles profiling a new
breed of professional blogger. Chapter 15 charts a path to
a bit of revenue from your blog. You probably shouldn’t
count on becoming rich and retiring early. But income
opportunities are quickly becoming more available even
to modest blogs with small audiences.
Chapters 16 and 17 explore the audio and video realms of
blogging. The first of these chapters covers podcasting,
the relatively new phenomenon of audio blogging that has
taken off tremendously. Chapter 17 investigates the role of
photos, videos, and music in blog content.

Chapter 13
Hooking into RSS Feeds
In This Chapter
 Illuminating the new world of syndicated information feeds
 Using RSS to distribute your blog entries beyond your site
 Understanding newsreaders and choosing the best feed service for you
S
yndication might not be a word you were hoping to grapple with on this
day, or on any other day. “Blogging is supposed to be easy,” you’re think-
ing. (Yes, I can hear your thoughts. Deal with it.) Does really simple syndication
sound friendlier? Because that’s what RSS stands for, and honestly, I kid you
not, RSS is simple and friendly for both bloggers and readers. Relatively pain-
less as it is to bring into your Internet life, RSS is hugely important. Predictions
about the Internet are risky, but I’m not going too far out on a limb to predict
that RSS will get much bigger than it is today, quickly. I expect nearly every
online citizen to be using RSS eventually, even though many people will be
unaware that they are using it.
As a blogger, you should have some awareness of RSS; it should not be a com-
pletely invisible feature for you. The truth is that some blog services, plat-
forms, and programs make RSS so easy that it does become invisible. But
knowing the basics opens the door to better use of RSS in your blog (if you
use a service that allows variable RSS settings). Furthermore, active partici-
pants in the blogosphere benefit from knowing about the opposite side of
RSS: As readers of other blogs and many information sources, they use RSS to
gather their favorite content into one window — doing so saves a ton of time.
In this chapter and throughout the book, when I refer to RSS, I usually mean
all types of syndication feeds, of which RSS is the foremost. Several versions
of RSS exist, as well as one main competing feed format called Atom. Atom
feeds are used by Blogger.com, a service profiled in Chapter 6. The compet-
ing feed types and different versions of those types make little difference to
most users. Most programs that translate feeds to actual readable stuff
understand all the variations. For all intents and purposes, a feed is a feed.
Many big publishers that provide feeds, such as Yahoo!, Microsoft, and
Google, make up a new name to erase the differences and to avoid calling
them RSS, Atom, or any other tech buzzword.

This chapter gives you a basic understanding of what feeds are, how they
can give your blog more exposure, and how they bring you deeper into the
blogosphere.
Understanding the Greatness of RSS
RSS feeds make the Internet easier to use, and they save time. They bring
more content to your screen and distribute your blogging work beyond the
boundaries of your site. Your first leg up in understanding RSS is a return to
the word syndication. Syndication means distributing a piece of work (such as
writing, photos, a TV show) to multiple places beyond the original outlet for
that work. TV shows go into syndication when local network affiliates pur-
chase the right to rerun episodes. Newspaper columns and comic strips are
syndicated by agencies to newspapers all over the world.
On the Web, any content on a Web site can be syndicated to another site or
to a program that understands syndication formats. The mechanism that
you, as a blogger, are mostly concerned with is blog entries being syndicated
to newsreaders. Newsreaders are Web sites or desktop programs that display
the contents of syndication feeds — RSS feeds in most cases, but also other
formats such as Atom. Even if you’re not a blogger, RSS represents a huge
advance in Internet usability.
The value of syndication feeds might seem technical and unimportant. Untrue.
To “get it” about RSS, look at the information sites you visit regularly — all of
them, including these likely candidates:
 Online versions of traditional news organizations such as CNN, TV net-
work news, and MSNBC
 Online-only news establishments like CNET, Topix.net, Slate Magazine,
and financial news sites
 Online editions of big-brand newspapers and magazines such as The
New York Times, Business Week, Wired, and Scientific American
 Online editions of local newspapers
 Nearly every Weblog in the world, from those written by Hillary Clinton
and Donald Trump to individuals writing primarily for themselves
 Information tracking sites such as a real-estate listing service or a shop-
ping portal for digital cameras
 News portals with search engines, such as Google News and Yahoo! News
252
Part IV: Total Blog Immersion 

I could continue, but that’s enough to start. Every example just cited offers
RSS (or some kind of equally easy feed). The value of RSS is as great as your
appetite for online information of nearly every type. Perhaps you bookmark
your favorite sites in your browser. Look at the bookmark list and imagine
that, instead of visiting each site individually in your daily circuit of informa-
tion grazing, you could pull all those sites into one window. In that window,
you could organize the information streams in several ways, looking at each
source separately or mixing them up in certain groupings. That’s what feeds
allow you to do.
The demand for RSS has reached a point at which blogs and information
sites must syndicate their content or risk being left behind as irrelevant
dinosaurs. Bloggers have furthered this revolution, because many thousands
of topical bloggers use the link-and-comment format in their blog entries.
These active bloggers feed their voracious appetites for information by using
newsreaders — believe it or not, no serious topical blogger surfs Web sites
anymore to read headlines or glean articles. There is simply no time for individ-
ual site visits, with their graphic-loading delays. Therefore, if an information
site does not offer an RSS feed, it will never get cited by the most important
bloggers, and it won’t receive traffic referred to it by those bloggers.
The upshot of the RSS/newsreader revolution catalyzed by bloggers is that
nearly everywhere you go to read articles or get information, you see buttons
and links offering syndication feeds. Later in this chapter, I explain how those
buttons and links work with newsreaders. The result for savvy information
consumers is a universe of information from almost every major provider
and millions of small publishers and bloggers, all swiftly streamed to a single
window — the newsreader of your choice.
Spreading Your Word
As a blogger, you are an information provider. This is true in a literal sense
even if you write a highly personal, diary-style blog. If you want to be a rele-
vant, up-to-date information provider, you must offer an RSS feed. Most ser-
vices at least allow you to turn the feed on or off, and others also allow a
setting with which you choose whether to syndicate full entries or partial
entries. Offering a feed plugs you into the blogosphere more completely than
if you operated a feedless site. Remember that the demand for feeds is grow-
ing. With every passing month, blogs that don’t provide syndication increas-
ingly risk being avoided as too much trouble to read.
253
Chapter 13: Hooking into RSS Feeds

Assuming you have the RSS feed of your blog turned on (or are using a ser-
vice in which it is always turned on), the software usually puts a link or
button on your index page. (Blogger.com is a notable exception.) Most pro-
grams and blog services create just one feed for your entire blog. Advanced
blog services and programs allow multiple feeds; each subject category of
the blog might have a separate feed or there might even be a distinct feed for
comments. Feeds for entries carry each posted entry (or an excerpt of the
entry, in some cases) to the newsreader of anyone who has subscribed to
your feed. Subscribing is free — it’s not like a magazine subscription. The
next section explains how to subscribe a feed to a newsreader.
So for most bloggers, RSS really is easy: You sign up with a blog provider and
start writing entries, and the software creates your feed and places a sub-
scription link on your pages. Figure 13-1 shows the subscription button
(labeled RSS 2.0) on one of my blogs. Most services have the RSS option
turned on by default. If it is not activated, the hardest thing you have to do is
turn it on.
254
Part IV: Total Blog Immersion 
But what about my site?
All this focus on RSS and reading blog entries in
newsreaders makes it sound as if Web sites are
becoming irrelevant. What is the fate of a lov-
ingly designed blog with a beautiful, colorful
atmosphere and careful navigational design?
What about the hundreds of design templates
offered by blog services and the hours you
spent combing through them to find the perfect
layout and color scheme for your blog? If every-
one is going to end up reading your blog off-site,
in a cold, black-and-white newsreader, what’s
the point of creating good pages?
Frankly, this gloomy perspective has some truth.
But not total truth. My newsreaders contain
hundreds of feeds, and I spend all day reading
and writing. It’s important to me to avoid visiting
sites as much as possible. But newsreaders do
let you click through to the page on which any
entry resides, and there are good reasons to do
so. First, you cannot write a comment on some-
body’s blog in a newsreader; you must go to the
blog. Likewise to just read comments. Second,
you cannot see all the typical blog elements that
surround each entry, such as the blogroll, the
archive directory, and entry categories. Third,
some bloggers and other information providers
put partial entries in the feed, so you must click
through to the entry page to read the full entry.
It is too soon to predict that RSS will completely
obliterate Web sites or just blog sites. It is pos-
sible, and if that day comes, perhaps RSS will
be far more dressed up than it is today, with
graphics and other elements that currently are
not syndicated with the feeds. Communication
elements, such as comments, would certainly
have to be included. (I have seen one experi-
mental version of a feed in which you could
enter a comment and send it back to the site.)
The days of templates and colorful navigation
sidebars might be numbered, but we are far
from that reality now.

Feeding on Feeds
Bloggers tend to be feed consumers as well as feed providers; the two sides of
RSS syndication thrive on each other. (I was going to say “feed” on each other,
but I was afraid my dazzling wit would actually injure people with laughter.)
The busiest bloggers tend to be the most dedicated newsreader users. But
RSS is an Internet tool for the masses — or it will be soon — so you should
probably try a newsreader whether you’re a light or heavy blogger.
Choosing a newsreader
Newsreaders come in four basic types:
 Web newsreaders: These newsreaders are Web sites whose purpose is
to offer newsreading functions. I recommend Web newsreaders for two
reasons. First, they require no installation. Second, because your sub-
scriptions reside on the Web and not on your computer, you can access
your feeds from any Internet-connected computer. Most Web newsread-
ers offer free service.
Figure 13-1:
Most blogs

feed for the
entire blog.
Here, it is
the RSS

button.
255
Chapter 13: Hooking into RSS Feeds

 Desktop newsreaders: These newsreaders are stand-alone programs
installed in your computer. Some people like the power of these dedi-
cated programs. Your feeds are not portable if they are tied to the com-
puter in which the program is installed (unless the computer is a laptop,
which can be carried around). Even if you install the program on all your
computers, each copy cannot track your reading in the other copies.
This is important because most newsreaders do not show you the same
entries more than once unless you deliberately backtrack to previously
viewed entries. (Or, if the newsreader shows you entries that you’ve
already seen, those entries are marked as having been read.) Some desk-
top newsreaders are commercial programs; others are shareware pro-
grams that you can try for free; still others are completely free.
 Portal newsreaders: Giant information platforms are building feed sub-
scription and reading into their home pages and other products. Yahoo!
is a good example; that popular online service allows users of the My
Yahoo! personalized home page feature to easily subscribe to feeds with-
out leaving Yahoo! Google also has a home page customization feature
that allows unlimited feed subscriptions; likewise, Google has put feed-
reading into the Google Sidebar (which is part of Google Desktop). Use
of these services is free.
 Browser and e-mail add-ons: RSS is worming its way into application
programs such as e-mail and Web browsers. NewsGator runs within
Microsoft’s Outlook e-mail program. The Firefox browser and its com-
panion e-mail reader, Thunderbird, both support RSS reading. Firefox
recognizes the presence of an RSS feed anywhere on a Web page and dis-
plays a small icon inviting you to subscribe. Clicking that icon creates a
“live bookmark” in the bookmark list; running the mouse over that live
bookmark expands it to reveal links to the current entries embedded in
the feed. (See Figure 13-2.) The “live bookmark” turns the Bookmarks
menu in Firefox into a small, yet functional, newsreader. Clicking an
entry takes you to the entry page. Firefox and Thunderbird are free;
NewsGator is shareware.
Newsreading within the browser (the last choice in the list) is regarded by
some as the future of RSS. Meanwhile, Yahoo! has quietly become one of the
foremost providers of newsreading services, thanks to its enormous customer
base of My Yahoo! users subscribing like crazy to feeds. The future will unfold
in its usual surprising manner, but for the present I am sticking primarily with
Web newsreaders, which give me plenty of power and flexibility, while keeping
my hunger for information satisfied on any connected computer.
256
Part IV: Total Blog Immersion 

The selection of a newsreader is getting both easier and harder as the choices
proliferate. On one hand, making the right choice requires an understanding
of the alternatives. On the other hand, RSS feeds are becoming so seamlessly
integrated into familiar services that eventually everyone will use them with-
out even knowing it. As a generality, the more you know about newsreaders,
the more your choice is likely to incline toward powerful Web or desktop
newsreaders. Of course, power comes with a learning curve, but newsreaders
are inherently easy to use.

Chapter 13: Hooking into RSS Feeds
Newsreaders and newsreaders
The term newsreader is a slippery one. Before
RSS became popular, newsreaders were (and
still are) programs or Web sites that facilitated
the access of Usenet newsgroups — the
Internet’s ancient bulletin board system.
Newsreader in that application was always a bit
of a misnomer, based on the name newsgroups,
which also doesn’t really describe the discus-
sion groups of Usenet. RSS newsreaders really
are newsreaders — and were even before
blogs became popular and widespread.
Because of this confusion of meanings, RSS
newsreaders are sometimes called RSS aggre-
gators, feed aggregators, or RSS readers.

The more feeds you subscribe to, the more you should gravitate toward a
Web reader or desktop reader. The portal newsreaders and browser-feed
bookmarking features do not place limits on the number of feeds you’re
allowed, but long lists of feeds don’t work as well in those environments as
they do in windows dedicated to feeds. Most Web and desktop readers allow
feed-handling conveniences such as folders and keyword searching. Figure
13-3 shows Bloglines, the most popular Web newsreader.
When it comes to choosing between a Web service and a stand-alone pro-
gram on your desktop, portability is a big issue. If you use more than one
computer, choose a Web newsreader. The Web services are also free, whereas
desktop products are often shareware, requiring a payment for continued use
beyond a trial period. But if you want all the power and flexibility you can get
in a program that acts as a surrogate browser, try a desktop program. Figure
13-4 illustrates a shareware program, Headline Viewer, in action.
If your RSS use will be of modest scale, you might prefer to integrate your
feeds into a broader service such as My Yahoo! or Google’s personalized
home page. My Yahoo! (see Figure 13-5) is one of the friendliest RSS environ-
ments; the service treats RSS feeds no differently than the news headline ser-
vice it has offered for years. Millions of people who have used My Yahoo! as
their home page now add RSS feeds to their pages with the same ease that
they add non-RSS news sources. Even though My Yahoo! does not use RSS as
a term, it has quickly become one of the most-used RSS services.

259
Chapter 13: Hooking into RSS Feeds

Google’s home page personalization is much younger and less evolved than
My Yahoo!, but offers an uncluttered page upon which to display feeds. (See
Figure 13-6.)
Whichever newsreader you use, there are important features to keep in mind:
 Folders: It is important to organize your feeds, and folders help keep
your topics straight.
 Tags: Tags are an alternative organizing feature. Tags and folders tend
to exclude each other; a service that uses one probably doesn’t use the
other. Tags are arguably more flexible because one feed can be assigned
more than one tag. So, a feed from your sister’s blog that contains many
pictures of dogs might be tagged family, pictures, and dogs. Those tags
put the feed in three virtual folders simultaneously.
 Search: Being allowed to perform keyword searches of your feeds is
essential. Along with that function, the search box should be able to also
prowl through the blogosphere for content that matches your keywords.
I prefer to find new feeds by searching the Web (in a general search
engine, or in a blog search engine, or by surfing around), not in the
newsreader. Still, the newsreader should supply a method of searching
for feeds from the information universe and even a directory of popular
feeds in which to browse.
 Tracking and backtracking: A good newsreader keeps track of which
items in a feed you have looked at and doesn’t show them to you twice —
or marks them as having been read. And if you want to see hidden,
already read entries, the newsreader should have a way to show them
to you. Bloglines, for example, lets you look back in time by increments 
of a day or a week.
 Feed display options: Feed providers (the Web sites whose feeds you
subscribe to) sometimes shorten their feed entries by allowing only
excerpted entries into the feed; readers must click the feed headline to
see the entire entry on its Web page. Most blogs furnish full entries in
the feed, so you don’t have to click through. Full entries are more conve-
nient than partial entries, but many people prefer to scan headlines only,
clicking through to see entries of interest. The newsreader should offer
this compression from full entry to headline only as a display option.
Ideally, it should be easy to switch back and forth. Ideal also is the abil-
ity to set this choice separately for each feed.
 Resorting and retagging: Whether the newsreader uses folders or tags
(don’t choose a newsreader that uses neither), you should be able to
revise your initial sorting choices. Moving feeds from folder to folder is
generally more cumbersome than retagging but worth it to users who
prefer the folder method of organizing (which closely resembles how
files are organized in the Windows operating system). Tagging systems
should allow you to add multiple tags at one time and erase previously
set tags.

Part IV: Total Blog Immersion 

Subscribing to feeds
You’ve decided to try a newsreader for some (or all) of your blog and news
reading. It will revolutionize your online lifestyle. Now you need to load it up
with feeds. The presence of an RSS feed on any page of any Web site is usu-
ally announced in some combination of four ways:
 XML chicklets on the page
 Subscription buttons on the page
 Subscription links on the page
 A bookmarklet on your browser
XML chicklets
I realize you think I’ve made a ridiculous typo, but it really is XML chicklet.
The name derives from the candy-coated appearance of a bright orange
button labeled XML. (See Figure 13-7.) Sometimes the button is labeled RSS.
Either way, this button contains a link to the RSS feed.
Figure 13-6:

261
Chapter 13: Hooking into RSS Feeds

XML (extensible markup language) is the computer language in which RSS is
written. Therefore, the XML initials on the chicklet button announce the pres-
ence of an RSS feed. If you look at the address to which these buttons link,
you’ll see that the file extension is .xml. But I don’t recommend looking at
that address or paying much attention to this entire technical explanation.
Here is what you must know about XML and RSS chicklets: Clicking them will
give you no joy. Clicking them might make you weep. Don’t click them. Figure
13-8 illustrates the sort of gibberish you see if you do click one; it is raw XML
code that needs to be cooked by an RSS reader (a newsreader) before it is
useful to you.
Therefore, follow these steps to grab an XML/RSS chicklet and add its feed to
your newsreader:
1. Right-click the chicklet.
When I was a little boy, I never dreamed I would type that sentence.
Anyway, a context menu drops down when you right-click.
2. Select Copy Link Location (or Copy Shortcut in Internet Explorer)
from the drop-down menu.
3. In your newsreader, click the Add (or Add a Feed) selection.

Part IV: Total Blog Immersion 

Your selected newsreader might word this feature a little differently. You
might not be using a newsreader yet, and I describe how they work and
how to get them later in this chapter. For now, imagine you have one.
4. In your newsreader, click Finish or OK to add the feed to your 
collection.
The newsreader might give you the opportunity to put the feed into a
folder if you divide your feeds into folders, or to tag the feed by keyword
if your newsreader uses tags.
The important point is to right-click that XML chicklet and copy and paste
the link into your newsreader.
Subscription buttons for specific newsreaders
In their eagerness to promote their feeds, some bloggers and other publishers
put newsreader-specific feed buttons on their pages. Contrary to XML/RSS
chicklets, these buttons want to be clicked — left-clicked in the normal fashion.
Doing so brings up the Web newsreader represented by the button and starts
the subscription process unique to that newsreader. In cases where the sub-
scription process is quite simple, the feed might simply be added with no more
action on your part. In newsreaders that always allow you to choose which
folder a new feed is placed in, or which tags are assigned to it, that assignment
page is displayed with the correct feed address already plugged in.

Chapter 13: Hooking into RSS Feeds

When you click a newsreader-specific subscription button, the newsreader’s
Add page displays in the same browser window or tab, wiping out the blog or
news page you were reading. Perhaps you were finished with that page
anyway. But if you want to keep that page in view, simply right-click the sub-
scription button and choose to open the link in a new window (Internet
Explorer, Firefox, or Netscape) or in a new tab (Firefox or Netscape).
Complete your subscription process, and then close that window or tab and
return to the original page.
When bloggers use newsreader-specific subscription buttons on their pages,
they generally choose buttons of the newsreaders they use and recommend,
plus whatever the currently popular newsreaders happen to be. (See Figure
13-9 to see a blog that offers several buttons.) The button is provided by the
newsreader, so any newsreader that doesn’t offer a subscription button to
information publishers is not going to appear on their pages. That doesn’t
mean you can’t add that publisher’s feeds to your newsreader, but you have to
do it manually as described in the series of steps in the preceding section.
One reason to use an RSS service such as My Yahoo! is that subscription but-
tons for widely used services appear fairly frequently on blogs and news sites.
Those service-specific buttons make subscribing to the site’s feed a breeze.

Subscription links
Some blogs (and a few news sites) use plain links instead of XML chicklets
or subscription buttons. These links don’t stand out on the page (see Figure
13-10), so you have to look for them. In fact, the difficulty of finding subscrip-
tion links (and even buttons on busy pages) is one good argument in favor of
RSS bookmarking in browsers such as Firefox. Firefox instantly identifies any
feed links on a page and displays the live bookmark icon on its status bar; if
you glance down to the lower-right corner, you know immediately whether a
page’s content is subscribable. (What you don’t know is whether subscribable
is a word.)
However, assuming that argument isn’t good enough to make you abandon
your full-featured newsreader, you must look for those text links and treat
them just the same as XML chicklets. Do not click the subscription links in
the normal fashion. Instead, right-click them, copy the link location, and
paste it into your newsreader’s Add function. (See the series of steps pre-
sented earlier.) Text subscription links usually say something like “XML feed,”
“Subscribe to this blog,” or “RSS feed for this page.”

Chapter 13: Hooking into RSS Feeds

Subscription bookmarklets
One final method of subscribing to an RSS feed is to use your newsreader’s
bookmarklet. Not all newsreaders provide these handy tools. A bookmarklet
is a small button that attaches to your browser’s toolbar — usually the
Bookmark toolbar if your browser has one. (See Figure 13-11.)
If your Web newsreader supplies a bookmarklet, it will provide instructions
for placing it on the toolbar. In nearly all cases, doing so is easy: You just use
your mouse to drag a link from the newsreader site up onto the browser tool-
bar. When you do that, the button miraculously appears on the toolbar and
stays there while your roam the Web. On any page that contains a feed that
you want to add, click the bookmarklet; your newsreader’s Add page appears
with the feed address plugged in.

 Using RSS to your advantage while keeping readers happy
I
n Chapter 1, I talked a lot about how a blog could be anything you wanted
it to be. Now, in this chapter, I’m laying down a bunch of rules. Well, call
them customs. The blogosphere is relatively new and even newer as a large
enough category of Web site to be considered a publishing genre. The cus-
toms that govern its expression as a publishing genre are still forming and
evolving. This chapter considers several items of accepted behavior that you
should know about, even if you decide to bend these nascent rules.
Some blogosphere “don’ts” have legal implications and can lead to serious
liability. People have lost their jobs by blogging with poor judgment. But
most of this chapter’s advice is intended to spare you from the angry reper-
cussions of other bloggers, and readers, that can befall the careless or
unaware blogger.
There is more to responsible blogging than just virtual safety. The blogos-
phere is, at the core, a cooperative network, if an informally connected one.
The most important customs regulating behavior in the blogosphere are
designed to honor the whole over the parts, diminishing competition in favor
of cooperation. It is the fastidiously responsible and somewhat selfless blogs
that (when they present great content) gain prominence and even fame.
There is also the future of blogging to consider. Nobody really knows what
will become of this new genre and what role it will eventually play in the
growing infrastructure of digital culture. It is up to individual bloggers to
maintain high standards of honesty, truth, credit, originality, and opinion.
Like most new technologies, blogging has a mixed reputation. Standards of
citizenship, whether they are called rules or customs, aim to further legit-
imize blogging as it matures.

The Truth about Truth
The words honesty and authenticity are often applied to Weblogs — by blog-
gers. Honest blog writing is universally cited as a requirement of the genre.
This ideal appears on nearly all how-to lists compiled by bloggers. I doubt
that the public at large considers blogs any more or less honest than other
types of Web sites. But because so many prominent blogs straddle the line
between objective news and personal opinion, all bloggers demand
attempted truthfulness at all times.
Speed and accuracy: A difficult match
The emphasis on truth applies mainly to topical blogs, of course, not the per-
sonal diaries. If you post about what you had for breakfast, chances are good
nobody will care if you lie about your cereal. Topical blogs typically follow a
link-and-comment format in which a news story (or other blog entry) is cited
with commentary. The commentary, or a summary of the linked article, might
introduce facts to the reader, and that is where mistakes can happen. Naturally,
mistakes do happen and are perfectly well accepted as long as they are
acknowledged.
The lightning reaction speed of the blogosphere creates errors. Topical blogs
are often on the cutting edge of news discovery, reporting, and commentary.
The quest for recognition and status can lead to carelessness — a fact known
all too well by the mainstream media, especially on election night. In fact,
acknowledging the inevitability of errors is a distinction of the blogosphere,
which has evolved customs and standards for dealing with mistakes.
Rules of correction
Along with truth, transparency is held in high regard by bloggers. That means
not only correcting mistakes but acknowledging them and, ideally, making
the correction in a way that reveals a before-and-after trail. This style, in
which an error is corrected but not eliminated from view, is considered far
preferable to simply rewriting the post. You leave yourself open to special
criticism if you receive a comment pointing out a mistake, and then erase the
mistake with no acknowledgment. And if you also fail to respond to the com-
ment, look out.
So, what’s the best way to recover from a mistake? Two primary rules hold
forth:
 Correct it quickly.
 Leave a trail.
268
Part IV: Total Blog Immersion 

Two methods exist for publicly and transparently correcting mistakes in
posted entries. Both involve using the Edit function in your blog software.
 Use the strikethrough. The strikethrough is a simple HTML tag. Some
blog programs give you one-click formatting of strikethroughs (no more
difficult than making a word bold or italicizing it). In other cases, you
need to put the tag in by hand, on an HTML screen. The opening and
closing strikethrough tags are: <s> and </s>, respectively. Good blog-
ging protocol would be striking through a mistake and typing the correc-
tion immediately afterward. (See Figure 14-1.)
 Correct the mistake and write out an explanation for your changed
entry. It’s perfectly fine to avoid strikethroughs if you divulge the error
and simply correct it.
In both cases, you might consider resurfacing the entry to the current date
and time, if your software allows time-shifting an entry. Doing so puts the
entry back on your index page, if it had fallen off over time, and back into the
RSS feed. Visitors and feed subscribers will see the entry again, with your
corrections. Resurfacing isn’t always necessary; I do it when I’ve made a
whopping blunder and I want to conspicuously correct myself. Of course,
that happens only once a year. Once a month. Every couple of days. Never
mind how often it happens.

269
Chapter 14: Rules of Blogosphere Citizenship

With the exception of resurfacing an entry to correct an error, it’s best not to
alter your archives. That means you should not change the date and time, not
alter the permalink (remember, some readers might have bookmarked the
permalink, so don’t move the page around), and not delete past entries. That
last bit of advice — don’t delete — can present tough decisions. If you really
get in a jam, perhaps by offending somebody, you might want to (or promise
to) eliminate the offending post. Do what you must, but remember that blog
archives are regarded as inviolable historical records of the blog. Leaving them
untouched is part of the ethos of transparency that governs blog culture.
On Competition and Cooperation
Competition and cooperation present a push-pull dynamic in the blogosphere.
If you’re a beginner, you might not feel competitive in the slightest. And if you
write an online-diary type of blog, you might never feel the quivers of competi-
tive blogging vibrating through the Web. But topical bloggers do compete —
for attention, traffic, influence, TrackBacks, prestigious citations in other
blogs, and scoops. At the same time, the Blogosphere organism has an under-
lying cooperative spirit. Competition is not particularly frowned upon, but vio-
lation of basic cooperative rules is.
Transgressions of the line dividing competition from cooperation can brand
a blog as inauthentic — perhaps the most damaging reputation. In theory,
blogs are authentic above all else, aspiring to an editorial purity that honors
strict topicality, careful crediting of sources, and avoidance of gratuitous
commercialism. In this context, commercialism refers to self-promotion,
especially by using other blogs to drive traffic to your blog. This cultural
breach can be committed in subtle or obvious ways; they are all scorned.
The following sections explore problems and solutions.
You didn’t do it alone
In a topical blog, few entries exist in isolation, unsupported by the work of
others. It does happen; if you write an essay on your topic containing original
thoughts (they needn’t be unique thoughts), there might be no need for attri-
butions. If an entry contains no links to outside sources (articles or blog
entries), it means you are not crediting any influences upon your thinking. As
a matter of style, topical blog entries are enhanced by links, but style is up to
you. As a matter of fairness, attributions for links and ideas are a blogosphere
mandate.
270
Part IV: Total Blog Immersion 

Attribution negligence usually occurs with bloggers who read many other
blogs. Most topical bloggers do, in fact, stay up to speed with other blogs in
their field, usually using a newsreader to check feeds. As part of the daily
survey of what’s being written where, bloggers link to news stories being dis-
cussed and cited in other blogs. Then, wishing to join the discussion with
some original commentary, a blogger might also link to the same news source
and build an entry around it. The proper attribution in that case is to give
credit to the blog in which you saw the linked article. You didn’t find the arti-
cle on your own, and failing to attribute credit makes it seem as if you did. In
the blogosphere, this is a big deal.
Naturally, as a topical blogger, you do find some articles on your own,
because you probably read feeds from online newspapers in addition to
blog feeds. But when one blogger takes the lead in linking to an article and
developing blog commentary around it, that blogger deserves credit for influ-
encing other bloggers in his or her readership. An attribution typically is
located at the bottom of the blog entry with a quick [via XYZblog] or [Thanks
XYZblog]. (See Figure 14-2.)

Blog spam
You’re probably familiar with spam; most people think of it as junk e-mail.
Actually, spam has a broader definition and refers to any unwanted, irrele-
vant, or inappropriately placed promotion. In the blogosphere, spam is not
quite as pestilent as in e-mail, but it is a major problem in high-profile blogs.
At Weblogs Inc., the blog publisher I work for, various technologies in the
background thwart the placement of commercial junk messages in our com-
ment fields. It doesn’t always work. Like e-mail spam, blog spam is persistent,
sometimes delivered by automated software bots that rip through blogs
depositing junk comments.
Most blogs present a smaller spam target than a big blog network. Even so,
spam can be an issue. Individuals with something to sell (often affiliate mar-
keters who receive commissions for driving traffic to commercial sites) visit
blogs of all sizes to leave semirelevant or completely irrelevant comments
that include links to their affiliate sites.
I won’t insult any reader by saying “Don’t do that” about these flagrant forms
of comment spam. The point of this chapter is to warn you away from inad-
vertently crossing a line in your eagerness to be seen and heard in the blo-
gosphere. The mistake some people make is to overparticipate in the
comment sections of other blogs, sprinkling comments around indiscrimi-
nately. Many blogs offer commenters the chance to embed a Web site (such
as their own blog) into the comment; the commenter’s name becomes the
link to that person’s blog. If you make too many lightweight comments with
that link in place, it conveys the impression that you’re more interested in
promoting your site than in contributing meaningfully to the blog discussion.
The same danger holds true for barely relevant comments, even if they are
few in number. Some of these are flagrantly promotional. It’s common to see
this type of comment: “I agree completely. See my write-up on this subject at
www.MyBlog.com.” Such a comment leaves a poor impression, and although I
cannot cite statistics, I believe that self-promotions like this do not attract
many clicks. Granted, sometimes the write-up being advertised is a fabulous
entry that should be read by everyone. In that case, a better tactic is to sum-
marize the entry as a comment in the other blog, and over the course of
many meaningful comments build your name’s reputation for high-quality 
discussion.
As a rule, never spell out a link to your own blog in a comment. If you build a
reputation for good blogging, readers in your topic will recognize you by name,
and you’ll get your traffic that way.
272
Part IV: Total Blog Immersion 

Another point to remember: Bloggers are a self-adoring bunch who relent-
lessly track down every reference made about them on other blogs, using
search engines described in Chapter 3. If you merely say something compli-
mentary (but keep it authentic) about another blogger, chances are good that
person will see it and put a link to you somewhere, perhaps in the blogroll.
(See Chapter 1 for more about blogrolls. They are not breakfast items.) A
blogroll link is arguably worth more than an isolated entry link, because the
blogroll remains on the index page even as the entries on that page change. It
fact, putting sites you admire in your blogroll is a de facto invitation to be rec-
iprocally linked. The recipient of your blogroll link will eventually discover
you if your blogroll sends a little traffic to the other blog.
Link, don’t quote
The flip side of spamming a blog with links to your site is reproducing another
blog’s content without linking to it. Any use of another site’s material, even if
you just paraphrase a single idea found on another blog, should be accompa-
nied by a link to the source. Two major errors to avoid:
 Excessive quoting: Wholesale lifting of another person’s content, even if
done with respect, is generally done with permission only. Some judg-
ment is required. If you are writing a long entry whose multiple points
key off another blogger’s entry, lots of quoting might be called for
(accompanied by a link). When a long quote makes up most of an entry,
whose only point is to quote someone else’s entry, you are basically
stealing that person’s traffic. That might seem like a harsh judgment, but
a more appropriate entry would offer a small quote and a link, so read-
ers can get the goods at the source, not from your blog.
 Mirroring: Some blogs are pure mirror sites that employ automated soft-
ware to crawl other blogs and reproduce entries. Then they compete
with their source blogs for traffic, while contributing nothing original to
the blogosphere. These sites might link back to their sources, but that
doesn’t make it any better; they are stealing traffic. To top it off, mirror
sites sometimes run ads, making money on the work of other bloggers.
Needless to say, don’t run a mirror blog.
Mastering the Link
You don’t have to use lots of links, but blog entries characteristically are rid-
dled with them. Good blog entries have a selfless quality that encourages
readers to click off the page to see source articles and other blogs.
273
Chapter 14: Rules of Blogosphere Citizenship

Blogs use embedded links freely. An embedded link turns a word or phrase in
the entry text into a link. All blog software and every blog service provides
easy, click-and-type creation of embedded links. Used liberally, a heavily
linked blog entry is bristling with opportunities to put the entry into wider
context by reading source and supporting material. As noted earlier in this
chapter, linking is de rigueur for tracing the blogger’s influences in writing the
entry and crediting its sources. Figure 14-3 illustrates a link-infused entry at
Techdirt, a blog that is consistently generous with providing credit to other
sources.
Choosing words to carry the links is a personal matter. Naturally, you should
choose a word or phrase that directly relates to the material you are sourc-
ing. Some people like to select long phrases to conspicuously carry the link;
some prefer to assign the link to single words. I like to choose verbs, because
the action of clicking somehow matches the action of the verb in my mind.
But it’s most important to choose a word that most directly tells the reader
what will be found at the other end of the link. Look at this example text from
a fictional blog entry:
Fredericks might have been speaking prematurely when he was quoted in
The Wall Street Journal saying that he guaranteed a five percent growth in
revenue next quarter. Sounds like 2003 all over again.
Figure 14-3:

274
Part IV: Total Blog Immersion 

At the very least, the article in which Fredericks is quoted must be credited
and linked, which I would do like this:
Fredericks might have been speaking prematurely when he was quoted in
The Wall Street Journal saying that he guaranteed a five percent growth in
revenue next quarter. Sounds like 2003 all over again.
The underlined word contains an embedded link. (Metaphorically speaking.
Stop clicking the book.) A more conspicuous attribution would be:
Fredericks might have been speaking prematurely when he was quoted in
The Wall Street Journal saying that he guaranteed a five percent growth in
revenue next quarter. Sounds like 2003 all over again.
Here is how a liberally linked entry might read:
Fredericks might have been speaking prematurely when he was quoted in
The Wall Street Journal saying that he guaranteed a five percent growth in
revenue next quarter. Sounds like 2003 all over again.
Those five links could lead to the following sources:
 Fredericks links to a short executive bio of Fredericks.
 quoted links to the article containing the quote.
 The Wall Street Journal links to the home page of The Wall Street Journal
site.
 revenue links to a revenue chart for Fredericks’s company.
 2003 links to an old article in which Fredericks made an unrealistic
promise.
Linking to your own entries is considered perfectly acceptable. It’s a good
way to promote your work and keep visitors in your site. Deceptive? Not at
all — just make sure the link is relevant and provides useful background. On
most computers, rolling the mouse cursor over a link displays the destination
in the browser’s status bar, so anyone curious enough to look realizes it’s an
in-house link.
You can never link too much. Infesting your entry with links is a sign of hard
work on your part and gives your readers many choices. I have never heard
anyone complain that a blog linked too much, but I have heard complaints of
too few links.
275
Chapter 14: Rules of Blogosphere Citizenship

Avoiding the “Blog Firing”
Believe it or not, unwise blogging has derailed lives. At some point, the preva-
lence of blogging hit a tipping point and started a rash of job firings because
of employee blogs. It’s not that blogging, per se, is illegal, but blogging is
legally regarded as a public utterance. Therefore, saying the wrong things in a
blog carries the same consequences as saying the wrong things in public or
broadcasting the wrong things on a radio wave.
Many companies have implicit or explicit agreements with their employees
that regulate how employees may talk publicly about the workplace. Company
secrets, for example, generally cannot be divulged in any medium. Libelous or
just offensive remarks about the boss or co-workers can be harshly punished.
In fact, merely writing a blog could be against company policy, especially if the
blog is about your job or your professional field.
For various combinations of the above offenses, several individuals have
achieved blogging fame, or sorts, by getting fired. Ellen Simonetti was a flight
attendant before getting sacked for writing behind-the-scenes blog entries
(her blog continues at www.queenofthesky.com). Heather Armstrong’s
blog, Dooce.com, won Web site awards before her confidential workplace
revelations earned her a pink slip (the blog lives on). Even Google, a techno-
logically hip company that is also one of the most secretive corporations,
fired a young engineer named Mark Jen, pronto, when Jen disclosed aspects
of his stock compensation in a blog.
The lessons in all this are several, and the course of action for bloggers with
day jobs is clear:
 If you plan to blog about anything remotely connected to your office or
your profession, find out what company policy has to say about it.
 No matter what your blog is about, ask at work whether employees are
permitted to have blogs. Few occupations actually forbid blogging, but
ask anyway.
 Don’t blog in secret. Tell your boss. Even a personal-diary blog, which
might seem to be none of your boss’s business, is bound to touch on
work. And that is your boss’s business.
 No matter how carefully you’ve prepared your supervisors and coworkers
for your blog, do not amuse yourself by ratting them out in any way. Don’t
voice your frustrations and dislikes in the blog. Any number of legal
angles can lead to an individual or the company shutting you down or
throwing you out.
276
Part IV: Total Blog Immersion 

I expect this problem to get worse as blogging becomes more mainstream
while its ramifications remain murky. Remember that no matter how cozy
you feel with your regular readers, a blog is a publication with worldwide dis-
tribution. Don’t say anything in a blog entry that you wouldn’t say in a TV
interview that you knew would be seen by everyone you work with.
RSS Strategies
Using RSS (or an alternate feed technology such as Atom) comes close to being
an etched-in-stone requirement of blogging. In fact, by 2004, even nonblog news
277
Chapter 14: Rules of Blogosphere Citizenship
Combining soapbox and discussion forum
Comments on or comments off? That’s a ques-
tion that can inspire sputtering passion in blog-
gers who believe that a dated-entry site is not a
blog (literally, not a blog) if readers cannot leave
comments. Bloggers of this opinion believe that
blogs are fundamentally community sites with
discussion tools built in.
My view is more moderate; therefore this page
(among others, no doubt) will get me flamed to
a crisp when the book comes out. It is simply
preposterous to state categorically that a blog
without comments is not a blog. Beyond hyper-
bole, I believe it is important to keep the defini-
tion of Weblogs slim and sparse. Loading the
definition with requirements restricts the
unknown potential of a new genre. Who knows
what imaginative forms future blogs will take?
As I write in Chapter 1, a Weblog is a site run by
software that makes frequent dated updates
easy and organizes the management of those
updates. That’s all it is. The technical, unglam-
orous, unnuanced definition serves the blogging
genre well because it doesn’t put roadblocks in
the path of its evolution.
Now let me equivocate. Also in Chapter 1 I
emphasize the importance of the macrologue —
the big conversation that flows continually
across the blogosphere. Comments are a 
vital driver of the macrologue, which probably
wouldn’t exist without them. I believe in the vital
role of comments in evolving blogs as we know
them today.
The practical truth about comments is that most
blogs use them but many high-profile blogs do
not. The tremendous volume of comments in a
blog trafficked by millions could stress the
bandwidth limitations of the server, not to men-
tion stressing the time and patience limitations
of the blogger(s). It’s ridiculous to say that Boing
Boing (www.boingboing.net), by some
measures the world’s most successful and pop-
ular blog, isn’t a blog. Yet you cannot leave a
comment there. Alex Ross’s The Rest Is Noise
(www.therestisnoise.com) is a terrific
work of blogging that fulfills every aspect of the
blogosphere’s cultural mandate. Except, no
comments. On the other hand, political blog The
Daily Kos (www.dailykos.com) so relies on
its readers for content that the owner regularly
posts blank entries just to provide more discus-
sion space.
Most people want comments and hope readers
will leave them. But the choice is yours. And if
you turn off your comments (which you can do
in self-installed programs and hybrid blog ser-
vices, but not necessarily in social networks or
hosted plans), you are still a blogger.

organizations felt pressure to package their stories in a feed format or risk irrel-
evance. It is a rare blog indeed that doesn’t offer a feed.
The truth is, use of newsreaders is still not mainstream — but it is getting
there fast and I’m comfortable predicting that eventually the newsreader will
be as popular and necessary as the Web browser. (In fact, the two functions —
browsing Web sites and browsing RSS feeds — are merging in programs such
as Firefox.) My newsreader has almost completely replaced my customized
page at My Yahoo!, which used to be my first stop every morning. Now I go
straight to the newsreader.
Note: Chapter 13 contains a detailed introduction of RSS and newsreaders.
Some chapters of this book are less important to every reader than others;
Chapter 13 is essential. For the remainder of this section, and in the book gen-
erally, when I say “RSS” I mean all feed technologies. The two main ones —
RSS and Atom — are indistinguishable to most feed consumers. RSS itself is
offered in three main versions, the differences between which are invisible to
most people.
At the more sophisticated end of blogging options (self-installed programs,
hybrid services, and some hosted blog platforms), you have control over how
much content goes into the RSS feed. Three choices are generally available:
 Headlines and entire entries
 Headlines and partial entries
 Headlines only
You might think it’s frustrating to read a feed containing only partial entries
or just headlines. Indeed, it can be frustrating. On the other hand, blog sites
and news sites that typically run long entries or articles do their feed sub-
scribers a favor by not stretching the feed to accommodate entire entries. In
this light, a feed is like the crawl that cable news networks put on the bottom
of the TV screen; it covers the highlights briefly. Readers of partial-entry
feeds can click through any headline to the source site, where they can read
the whole entry or article. (See Figure 14-4.)
Clicking through, in fact, is usually the strategy of incomplete feeds. Blogs
and online newspapers that withhold content are often trying to lure the
reader to the site. Imagine how RSS is affecting the online businesses of pub-
lishers that have spent years building their online editions into ad-supported
ventures. Suddenly RSS splashes on the scene, and readers start bundling all
their news into a single newsreader window, with all ads, promotions, regis-
trations pages, graphics, and other revenue generators stripped out. At the
time of this writing, advertising is starting to appear in RSS feeds (we use RSS
ads at Weblogs Inc.), and that trend will grow. But RSS readership is growing
much faster than RSS revenue. To combat this trend, publications such as
The New York Times use partial feeds and hope their headlines will bring
readers back to the site; The New York Times feeds contain headlines plus the
first sentence of its articles. (See Figure 14-5.)

The inevitability of ads in RSS
Like the question of allowing comments (see the
preceding sidebar), the subject of advertise-
ments in RSS feeds catalyzes extreme passion
and scalding opinion. RSS, a free technology, is
regarded as a pure information medium that
(according to purists) should never be polluted
with commercial intrusions. Think what they
may, the commercialization of RSS is coming. By
the time you read these words, it will have
become somewhat more accepted and more
common. As I write these words, RSS is still
overwhelmingly noncommercial, and resistance
to ads remains high in many quarters. A person-
age no other than Dave Winer, who developed
the original RSS standard, has loudly opposed
running ads in feeds. But what do inventors
know about how to use their inventions?
I say that tongue-in-cheek, but in all serious-
ness, RSS purists suffer the same short-
sightedness as purists in the early days of other
new media. The World Wide Web, also a free
technology, was absent of ads in its earliest
period. We all know how that turned out.
Television’s ad-based business model has
changed over the decades. Movies in theaters
didn’t have ads for a long time. Each of these
examples — the Web, RSS, television, movie
theaters — represents a content channel, and
all content channels are subject to commer-
cialization. Bloggers should be glad if their con-
tent is worthy of commercialization. The
association of advertising with RSS, insofar as
blogging is concerned, helps legitimize the
genre.
Purists of all degrees of clout will take me apart
for printing this. But to pretend that RSS is dif-
ferent from other public media is foolish, forest-
for-the-trees thinking. Bloggers who want to
experiment with blogging revenue (see Chap-
ter 15) should feel free to try RSS ads. We run
ads in our Weblogs Inc. feeds, as you can see
in the figure, which shows my Digital Music
Weblog RSS feed.

So, a full-fledged RSS strategy embodies two decisions:
 How much content to put in the feed
 Whether or not to run ads in the feed
The two decisions are synergistic; they depend on each other. If you make
money at your blog through advertising, or hope to, you probably want to
either withhold some of each entry from RSS or put ads in the feed. Putting
ads in partial feeds will likely get you torched and blacklisted. As it is, you’ll
likely get some angry response simply by introducing ads in a full feed; that’s
because some RSS purists (like some early adopters of any technology that
started out commercial-free) believe that RSS should forever remain unsullied
by advertising. (See the sidebar titled “The inevitability of ads in RSS.”)
If you are not out to make any bucks from your blog, there is no reason to
withhold content from the feed unless all your entries are very long. (If you
specialize in long-windedness, you limit your readership by that fact alone.) If
your site contains no ads, putting partial entries in the feed — thereby unnec-
essarily tormenting your readers — will bring a blogosphere thrashing down
upon you. And you’ll lose a lot of silent readers who won’t bother to complain.

T
his chapter is for the most ambitious bloggers who believe that their
entries are worth money. Well, why shouldn’t they be? Your blog is
Internet content, and Internet content has a value. How much value you real-
ize from your blog depends on several variables, the most important of which
is traffic. The more traffic there is passing through your site, the more chance
you have to turn those eyeballs into money.
Does this all sound too mercenary? That’s fine, too. Many people who write
personal blogs have less interest in making money from their online diaries
than they do in selling stale bread. I don’t mean to compare your blog entries
to stale bread. Perhaps that wasn’t the best analogy. My point is that blogging
started as a giving activity, and it still is for most individual bloggers. For
most people, trying to generate a revenue stream (as they say in the business
world) from their hobby blog is not worth the trouble.
But an equally valid point is that any site with even a handful of readers can
serve as a modest home business. Making money can be a hobby, too, even if
your ultimate goal is just to cover blogging expenses. In the case of a basic
TypePad account, as an example, that means earning a few dollars a month
from your blog. I know people who never imagined they would turn a blog
into money, tried it, and did indeed recoup those few bucks every month.
Chances are good that a few dollars per month is the high end of a blog’s
earning potential — let’s be realistic. But the attempt has the side benefits of
making the blog a little more professional in appearance and making the blog-
ger a little more professional, too. If you’re making 50 cents a month to start,
you might be motivated to reach one dollar, and move forward from there. In
the effort, you’re likely to make your site look better and explore the market-
ing tricks that bring more traffic. With more traffic comes more influence in

the blogosphere, and suddenly you’re on your way to the next level in the
blogging lifestyle.
So, again — this chapter isn’t for everyone. Skip it if the subject doesn’t
attract you. Or stick with the first two sections, which deal with the theory of
blog income and tips for making your blog more attractive and more visible.
The information in those sections is valuable even if money is of no interest.
Frontiers in the Business of Blogging
Now that blogging is famous, it has become commercial. Those of us who
were online when the World Wide Web was introduced saw the same trans-
formation. The Web started as a free, unexplored medium populated by the
primitive sites of early adopters. For the most part, those sites were lists of
links to other sites, with a bit of commentary — sound familiar? The first Web
sites were similar in spirit (if not in design) to today’s casual blogs. It didn’t
take long for the commercial potential of the new medium to explode into
reality. Likewise with blogs.
You can make money on the Internet in four basic ways:
 Sell a product (like Amazon)
 Provide a service (like Expedia)
 Sign up subscriptions to content (like the Wall Street Journal)
 Run ads (like millions of sites)
Some sites, such as eBay and Yahoo!, manage to conduct online business in
more than one of the four basic ways. Currently, commercial blogs are ad-
supported, for the most part. Just as many thousands of small Webmasters
have earned online income from running ads on their nonblog sites, bloggers
are doing the same thing. And with the emergence of some high-profile blogs
attracting millions of readers, a few bloggers are making very good money.
Blogging is a legitimate and maturing genre of publishing. Some companies
hire professional bloggers (or pro writers who have never blogged and learn
on the job) to produce corporate blogs in the same way that these compa-
nies hire copywriters to produce marketing brochures. That is one path for
writers who want to ply the blogging trade.
Then there are the blog networks, which are pushing the envelope of the blo-
gosphere as a publishing force. I write for Weblogs Inc. (www.weblogsinc.
com), by most measurements the most extensive blog network. The company
is somewhat like a large magazine, with a masthead of editors, writers, and
management. Just as independent magazines are sometimes acquired by
larger media companies, Weblogs Inc. was purchased by AOL in the fall of
284
Part IV: Total Blog Immersion 

2005. The entire venture (again, like a magazine) is supported by advertising.
Magazines also sell subscriptions; blogs don’t do that yet, but it’s not beyond
the imagination.
So, advertising is the business format of necessity if you are to make any
money from your blog. But before discussion of advertising options, you
need to know the other half of the blog marketing equation. Like two sides
of a coin, earning money from a blog requires two considerations:
 Visibility: Ad revenue depends on site traffic (lots of readers), and site
traffic depends on making the blog visible. Several skills and tools go
into site visibility, and having a general understanding of them can help
your site even if you never run a single ad.
 Monetization: I have a friend who laughs every time I utter the word
monetize. I don’t blame him for getting the chuckles over such a geek-
speak term, but that’s what everyone calls it when a site earns money.
Something that previously generated no income has been monetized.
Raising the Visibility of Your Blog
When you first put up a Web site of any kind — blog or nonblog — it’s like
putting up a billboard in the desert. A new site is invisible until somebody
links to it and looks at it. (Does an unvisited blog really exist? That’s the ques-
tion Einstein worked on at the Institute for Advanced Blogging at Princeton.)
I should note that new blogs in hosted services such as MSN Spaces, Yahoo!
360, Blogger.com, and TypePad suffer through shorter periods of invisibility
than blogs hosted on independent servers (WordPress and Movable Type
blogs). Hosted blogs get a push toward visibility by the host services, which
spotlight new sites and new entries and also by circles of friends that often sur-
round new blogs in Yahoo! 360. In these cases, a new blog can get an instant
toehold in the blogosphere. Even so, the principles of visibility described in
this section apply to, and can be practiced by, any blogger on any platform.
The quest for links
The key to visibility is links. People find online destinations through links.
Traffic is driven by links. Every ambitious blogger wants links leading to the
blog’s home page or its individual entries. In the quest for linkage, two impor-
tant arenas exist:
 Links on other blogs
 Links in search engines
285
Chapter 15: Blogging for Bucks (or Pennies)

Links on other blogs are powerful, and there are two kinds. First, gaining a
link in another blogger’s blogroll (the list of favorite sites in that blog’s side-
bar) means continuous promotions for your blog, in some cases repeated on
every page of the other blog. Blogroll links usually lead to a blog’s home page
(the index page). Second, getting linked in another blogger’s entry as a cita-
tion for that entry promotes something you said. These links are extremely
targeted and can bring bursts of traffic. Such a link can be an endorsement or
an argument against something you posted in your blog; either way, you gain
some degree of notoriety and visibility. Citation links usually go to one of
your entry pages.
You can gain visibility in the blogosphere and start getting linked on other
blogs in two ways:
 Ask for links.
 Write a good blog that naturally draws attention.
Sometimes those two tactics go together. If you know other bloggers writing
in your subject, it doesn’t hurt to ask for a place on their blogroll. Just ask in
private e-mail, not in a comment on their blog, and back up your request with
some good content on your blog. Wait until you’ve been blogging for a month
or so and can display at least a small archive of entries. Never place a link to
your site in another blog’s comment section, unless it’s part of a substantial
comment. Even then, you probably shouldn’t do it.
Practicing optimization habits
For several years, an Internet marketing field called search engine optimiza-
tion has been growing in influence. Abbreviated as SEO, search engine opti-
mization involves writing and design skills that make a Web site (blog or
nonblog) higher in search results listings than a nonoptimized site. Search
engines (such as Google, Yahoo!, or MSN Search) look for certain qualities
and site characteristics, and use these cues to determine how good a site is,
how closely it matches a searcher’s keywords, and how it should appear on
a result page for those keywords. Savvy Webmasters improve their search-
engine visibility by optimizing their pages according to principles that tend
to improve search ranking. There is no reason why bloggers should not do
the same thing.
Keep your pages short
Because blogs tend to feature short bursts of content, with each entry on its
own page, they are optimized for optimization, so to speak. Blogs are perfect
for SEO because one of the most important optimization principles is to keep
your pages short and highly topical. So, if you write a blog about folk music,
you might post an entry about the Celtic band Filska; as long as that entry
doesn’t veer off-topic, you end up with a naturally optimized Web page.
286
Part IV: Total Blog Immersion 

Keep your pages on-topic
It is important to stay on-topic with each entry. Posting a long entry about
Filska that also discusses other Celtic bands broadens the page’s focus and
dulls its optimization. Naturally, you want to feel free to write naturally in
your blog. Optimization principles shouldn’t inhibit your style. But for the
most part, good optimization is good for your visitors, not just good for your
traffic. People don’t have a lot of time, and they like to land on Web pages
that are clearly about one thing. That goes for blog entry pages as much as
for any other type of page.
Be mindful of keywords
Search engines match Web pages to keywords people search for. If you want
better visibility in search engines, use the keywords you think your readers
would be searching with. Don’t use them arbitrarily or indiscriminately;
doing so is called keyword stuffing or keyword spam and is easily detected by
search engines. Sites are penalized in search listings for trying to game the
system. The trick here is to write your entries to the point, so that they are
clearly topical to your readers and to the search engines.
Make your entry titles count
It is amazing how many entry titles have nothing to do with the entry. This
point is an optimization downfall for many bloggers. A scathing criticism of a
public figure might be titled “It’s an outrage!” and never mention the public
figure’s name. An entry about that Celtic band Filska might be titled “The
most beautiful fiddle music I ever heard,” without relating the band’s name.
Blogs are famously informal and personal, but you miss an important chance
to optimize your entry pages by not putting key topical words in your titles.
And your readers might thank you for being clearer in your headings, too.
Feed the nets
The page optimization tips of the preceding section are important. But it’s
likewise important to remember that many people — and the most influential
ones — read their blogs in newsreaders. Your most loyal and voracious read-
ers might never visit your site after their first visit, when they find and sub-
scribe to your RSS feed. (See Chapter 13 for everything you need to know
about RSS, subscription feeds, and newsreaders. Plus a delightful recipe for
peach cobbler.)
Because of the increasing importance of a blog’s feed in promoting and deliv-
ering a blog’s content, a relatively new set of practices that could be called
feed optimization has developed alongside search engine optimization. Feed
optimization is closely related to search engine optimization, thanks to the
presence and popularity of blog search engines (see Chapter 18), which get
their listings primarily from RSS feeds. Just as general Web search engines
287
Chapter 15: Blogging for Bucks (or Pennies)

crawl Web pages to build their searchable indexes, blog search engines crawl
RSS feeds (and sometimes pages also) to build their indexes.
Make your feed visible and easy to grab. Some blog services and programs
bury the feed link, making it hard for a visitor to find. In those cases, it’s diffi-
cult to copy the link into a newsreader, which is how many people subscribe
to blog feeds. Some WordPress templates bury the feed link in miniscule let-
ters at the bottom of the page. Blogger.com does not put the feed link on the
page at all, as a default page design.
Ideally, the feed link is positioned up on the page, in a sidebar, with letters or
an icon big enough to find easily. Chicklets and newsreader-specific subscrip-
tion buttons (see Chapter 13 for explanations of all this) make life easy for
your visitors. It might seem counterproductive to make it easy for your read-
ers to leave the site and never return, but obscuring your RSS feed is the
truly unproductive tactic, and a good way to lose readers forever.
Using FeedBurner
Bloggers who are serious about their feeds know about FeedBurner. A free
service (with an upgraded paid version) designed to optimize and monetize
content feeds, FeedBurner works with just about any blog program or ser-
vice. Almost every blog service generates a feed for your blog entries, but
FeedBurner doesn’t care about these native feeds. FeedBurner creates a new
feed for your blog, shows you how to put a new link on your blog, assists in
feed promotion, pings blog directories and newsreaders when you add an
entry, measures the readership of your feed, and can help make a little
money by putting ads in the feed if you want. That’s a lot of work for a feed
optimizer, and FeedBurner is deservedly popular.
I should mention that a bit of technical fluency is required to use FeedBurner.
The main requirement is a willingness to place new code in your blog’s tem-
plate. This is an issue that comes up in some of this book’s chapters, espe-
cially when working with WordPress, Movable Type, Blogger, and TypePad.
FeedBurner works only if you replace your blog’s native feed with a
FeedBurner feed, and to do that you must remove your old feed from your
pages and plug in the FeedBurner feed. Making that substitution requires
mucking around with your blog’s underlying code. FeedBurner provides the
new code, but only you can insert it into your blog template. FeedBurner
helps by providing instructions for each of the major blog platforms, but
some trial and error can be expected.
You can get started with FeedBurner without making any commitment and
without changing your blog in any way. Simply go to the FeedBurner home
288
Part IV: Total Blog Immersion 

page (www.feedburner.com) and enter your blog address. You don’t need
your RSS feed address; the URL of your blog’s home page works fine. Here’s
how it works:
1. FeedBurner finds your original feed from your blog’s URL.
2. You plant the new FeedBurner feed address in your blog’s template code.
After you create a username and password for FeedBurner, you can start
managing that feed. Figure 15-1 shows a FeedBurner account page. You can
set up multiple feeds in FeedBurner and manage them independently.
One of the most excellent changes FeedBurner makes to your feed can really
help your visitors who are unfamiliar with RSS get a handle on it. With normal
feeds, clicking the feed link displays a page of gibberish code. Feeds work
beautifully in newsreaders but are not meant to be displayed in browsers.
FeedBurner feeds, however, are designed to display in the browser and
convey a good deal of information about the selected feeds and about feeds
generally. When a visitor clicks a FeedBurner link that you’ve put on your
blog page, something like Figure 15-2 is displayed. Any visitor who clicks
unknowingly on your feed link is invited graciously into the world of feed 
subscriptions.

and

Chapter 15: Blogging for Bucks (or Pennies)

Experimenting with Ads
If you get truly ambitious about commercializing your blog, the final step is
putting advertisements on it. The three possible scenarios are
 Banner ads on your site
 Relevant text ads on your site
 Relevant text ads in your RSS feed
A banner ad is a picture ad of any size. (See Figure 15-3.) A relevant text ad is
a different sort of widget altogether. Supplied by Google, Yahoo!, or another
company that specializes in contextual ads, these no-picture ads are relevant
to the topic of the page upon which they appear. This feat is accomplished
using the same basic technology that produces relevant search results to
your keyword queries in Google or Yahoo! Nobody is entering keywords on
your blog page, but Google and Yahoo! crawl every page of your blog, deter-
mine the topicality of the pages, and deliver ads that match up. The theory is
that relevant ads are more interesting to your readers than irrelevant ads,
and therefore less disruptive of your blog’s mission.

Any blog service or program that allows the user access to its template
code can run ads. Of the platforms covered in this book, that would include
Blogger, TypePad (Plus and Pro accounts), WordPress, Movable Type, and
Radio UserLand. The two social networks — Yahoo! 360 and MSN Spaces —
do not support the placement of ads.
Three types of payout are associated with blog ads; they do not necessarily
correspond with the three types of ads just listed:
 Time: An ad placement is sold for a week or a month, and the blogger is
paid a flat fee. The price is based on the blog’s traffic; the greater the
number of readers, the more the ad placement is worth. The BlogAds
service (www.blogads.com) is a pioneer and leading advertising broker
for bloggers, and sells ad placements by the day, week, and month.
(Participation in BlogAds requires the sponsorship of a blogger already
in the system.)
 Impressions: On the Internet, an impression is one display of an adver-
tisement. Some ads are sold on this basis, with the cost usually mea-
sured by every thousand impressions. This method (among others) is
used by the CrispAds service (www.crispads.com) to help bloggers
monetize their sites.
Figure 15-3:

291
Chapter 15: Blogging for Bucks (or Pennies)

 Clickthroughs: Contextual ads placed by Google and Yahoo! are paid for
every time a visitor clicks one. Every month, Google and Yahoo! add up
all the clicks, collect the money from the advertisers, and divide it
among the bloggers on whose sites the ads appeared. See the next sec-
tion for a more detailed account of Google’s and Yahoo!’s services.
To top off the blog-ad landscape, you can also place ads in your RSS feed. In
the preceding section, I advise marketing and promoting your RSS feed with
as much care and enthusiasm as you promote your site. If you succeed, your
readers will leave your site behind and follow your blog work in a news-
reader, where your on-site ads do not appear. That’s a bummer. More than
that, the migration of the blog audience to newsreaders is a crisis for profes-
sional bloggers. You can handle this crisis in two ways:
 Provide partial-entry feeds, forcing readers to click onto your site to
finish reading the entries of interest
 Migrate your ads to the RSS feed
That second solution is controversial, with some influential voices speaking
out loudly against it. No matter; commercialization of feeds will happen as
surely as did the commercialization of the Web.
Self-Serve Ads from Google and Yahoo!
Google AdSense is a self-serve advertising syndication partnership. What? Let
me break that down. Google allows Webmasters and bloggers to run Google
ads on their sites. Google ads are contextual, which means that Google crawls
and indexes the pages on which the ads appear, determines the subject matter
of each page, and puts relevant ads on those pages. The Webmaster (blogger)
chooses from many layout and ad-design options and can tweak the colors to
make the ads stand out or blend in. (See Figures 15-4 and 15-5.)
Yahoo! is getting into the game of distributing its ads on blogs, following
Google’s lead, but at the time this book was completed, the Yahoo! Publisher
Network was in a beta testing phase and was not open to all bloggers. By the
time this book is published, the service might be more open. Go here to check:
publisher.yahoo.com
Google AdSense is for placing ads on Web pages. Google AdSense for Feeds is
for placing ads in RSS feeds. (Figure 15-6 shows an example of Google ads in
an RSS feed.) Both programs are self-service, meaning you open an account
and step through the process of placing the ads.

293
Chapter 15: Blogging for Bucks (or Pennies)

Here is how it works:
1. You open a Google AdSense account here:
www.google.com/adsense
2. You choose your ad design from a selection of horizontal and vertical
templates.
3. Google provides a snippet of HTML code.
4. You paste that code into your site page or blog template.
5. Google crawls your site to determine the subject of each page.
6. When a visitor hits your page, the code activates and retrieves relevant
ads from Google.
7. Google keeps track of visitors clicking through your ads, and pays you a
portion (an undisclosed percentage) of the resulting revenue each month.
This type of Internet earning is called passive revenue because once the
system is in place, you don’t do anything but collect the paychecks. In most
cases, those paychecks are too small to send every month. But for a blog
with some traffic, recouping hosting expenses is not out of the question.

In this chapter, I mention both Google and Yahoo! as suppliers of contextual
ads embedded in RSS feeds. Advertising in RSS is new stuff; both companies
are in the early stages of coming to grips with it. Google’s service is up and
running. Yahoo!’s service was in the planning stage as of October, 2005.
Google is a definite option for you, and other options will no doubt multiply
over the months and years.

Using Your Real Voice: Podcasting
In This Chapter
 Answering basic questions about podcasts
 Tuning in to the podcast universe
 Outlining the podcast creation and distribution process
I
f Weblogs are a little tricky for many people to understand, podcasts are
absolutely indecipherable. I have been approached by experienced Internet
marketers, long-time radio broadcasters, and all manner of other folks begging
me for an explanation. Podcasting has received a lot of press, and the word is
definitely getting around. But what the heck is it? And what does the strange
name mean?
This chapter answers those questions and points the interested reader
toward a couple of programs and services that help make personal podcasting
happen. Podcasting is closely linked to blogging, for reasons that I explain
here, but it is also very different from blogging. Despite its raging growth, pod-
casting is not a requirement for bloggers. Creating a podcast involves entirely
different motivations, skills, and equipment than creating a blog. It is more diffi-
cult than blogging and will remain so until the nascent services mature.
Stepping through the details of making and distributing a podcast would take
space that this book doesn’t have. But it is important to understand the gen-
eral steps, if not all the variations and details. Then you can know whether
podcasting is for you. That’s what this chapter is about.
Tuning In to the New Radio
Podcasts are audio programs distributed in RSS feeds. There. All your ques-
tions answered in eight words! It’s been a pleasure talking to you. Good night!
But seriously, those eight words do indeed define podcasts. Now let’s expand
them into a full understanding of why podcasting is a big deal.

In one sense, podcasts are not new at all. Podcasts are not a new technology;
they represent a new way of using existing technology. Podcasts are MP3 files
that can be downloaded and listened to on the computer or a portable MP3
player. MP3 is the same file type that helped turn the music industry on its
ear, made the original Napster possible, and continues to provide relatively
small audio files that can be uploaded and downloaded to and from the
Internet over high-speed connections.
So a podcast is just an MP3 file. What makes it special? Two things:
 Podcasts are repeating programs. Produced daily, weekly, or according
to some other schedule, podcasts resemble scheduled radio shows.
 Podcasts are distributed in RSS feeds. This fact connects them to blog-
ging, which is also widely spread in feeds. The standard for enclosing
podcasts in RSS feeds also makes it possible to organize podcast content
into directories for easy browsing and listening. The programs that do
that organizing are like blog newsreaders but are dedicated to podcasts.
298
Part IV: Total Blog Immersion 
My podcast adoption curve
I didn’t get podcasting at first, possibly because
I have a lot of experience with online music and
audio. To me, podcasting seemed like just more
MP3 files, and rather large, cumbersome ones
at that. Much of the podcasting I first encoun-
tered was little more than a reading of blog 
content — or if not literally a reading of
blog entries, an attempt to transfer the blog-
ging impulse into an audio format. I prefer to
read information, not hear it, so I remained
unimpressed.
Then I listened to The Dawn and Drew Show, one
of the first podcast success stories and still one
of the most popular podcasts. The Dawn and
Drew Show is 30 minutes long and consists
solely of a rambling conversation of a young mar-
ried couple living in a Wisconsin farmhouse.
They are the sort of people you want to hang out
with just for the great conversation and laughter.
Doesn’t sound like much of a show? Well,
remember that Seinfeld was called “the show
about nothing.” As I listened to my first Dawn
and Drew Show, doubled over with laughter and
exhilarated by their soaring freedom from
broadcast decency standards, it hit me: This
thing could replace radio. I didn’t mean the
Dawn and Drew Show
specifically, but 
podcasting.
Podcasting might and might not actually replace
radio. Working against podcasting is the diffi-
culty of licensing music for podcasts, and the
result of that difficulty is that most podcasts are
talk shows, not music shows. Podcasting cer-
tainly won’t replace music radio unless and until
the licensing roadblock is eased.
But podcasting has already shaken up radio.
Like newspapers that were forced by the popu-
larity of the Web to publish online editions, radio
stations are finding themselves under a grow-
ing popular mandate to put their shows in pod-
cast format for downloading. I now listen to
some of my favorite NPR programs whenever I
want instead of when they are broadcast. And I
still listen to Dawn and Drew when I want to
hang out.

That’s really it — the combination of factors that make podcasts what they
are. Are you not sparkling yet with excitement over podcasts? I understand. It
takes some experience to “get it,” and some observers of the podcast scene
have never warmed up to the format. Falling in love with the promise and
reality of podcasting depends partly on taste and partly on diving in and
experiencing the growing scene.
Podcasts are called podcasts because of the Apple iPod portable music
player. Some confusion surrounds this curious naming. The iPod is very pop-
ular and by far the most prevalent MP3 player on the streets. But any MP3
player can play podcasts. Podcasts were so named because most people put
them in iPods and carry the shows around — it’s portable broadcasting
through iPods. Podcasting.
If you’re reading along, you probably still have loads of questions about how
podcasting works, on both the creative side and the receiving end. I’ll get to
all that. First, I suggest immersing yourself in some browsing and listening, to
awaken some of the joy of the genre.
Getting a First Taste
This section is a lot easier to write now than it was, say, at the start of 2005.
Before user-friendly podcast directories came on the scene, podcasts were
distributed mainly in RSS displays in newsreaders. That environment made
podcasts a little geeky. You can still receive your podcasts in that manner, by
subscribing directly to their RSS feeds and putting those feeds in your text-
based newsreader. (See Chapter 13 for everything important about RSS and
newsreaders.)
The directories that are now bringing millions of new listeners to podcasts
are colorful, cheerful, ungeeky, and easy to use. These browsing environ-
ments resemble online music stores such as the iTunes Music Store. Hey, one
of them is the iTunes Music Store! When Apple released version 4.9 of the
iTunes Music Store (which I sometimes abbreviate as iTMS), it incorporated
a full-fledged podcast directory and download page. In one stroke, podcasts
were introduced to an entirely new market. (I say “market” as if podcasts
were commercial products, but they are universally — as of this writing —
free of charge.)
The iTunes software encompasses both the music store and the podcast
directory; you can browse, audition, and download podcasts to your heart’s
content without buying any music in the store. iTunes presents podcasts as
a whole new world. Submerge yourself by following these steps:
1. Go to the iTunes download site at www.itunes.com.
2. Download and install the iTunes program.
299
Chapter 16: Using Your Real Voice: Podcasting

3. With iTunes open on your screen, click Music Store in the left sidebar.
4. Pull down the menu labeled Choose Genre, and select Podcasts.
Podcasts, though mostly talk, are a genre within the iTunes Music Store.
Figure 16-1 shows part of the podcast directory page in iTunes.
5. Click any podcast.
iTunes displays recent episodes and a Subscribe button. You are always
free to listen to a single podcast without subscribing to the series. When
you do subscribe, iTunes downloads new episodes every time you open
the program, and keeps track of what you’ve listened to so that activat-
ing a partially heard episode starts it up from where you left off. You can
also easily transfer the downloaded episodes to an iPod.
As you can see from the podcast main directory page in iTunes (refer to
Figure 16-1), podcasts have gone prime-time, with content from Major League
Baseball, the producers of the movie Serenity, the Discovery Channel, ABC
News, Disney Online, and other recognized brands. So what’s all this about
podcasting providing a voice to the common person and replacing Big
Media? Well, you know how it goes. In podcasting, as on the Web, big media
has a louder voice and flashier brand than the small players. Nevertheless,
podcasting — like blogging — does provide an outlet for self-expression and
the chance for wide recognition.

If downloading and installing software isn’t to your liking, you can try a Web-
based podcast directory. One relatively new one is produced by Yahoo! and is
aptly named Yahoo! Podcasts. Try it here:
podcasts.yahoo.com
Yahoo! Podcasts presents excellent explanations of podcasting, in addition
to a tagging environment that allows users to label podcasts with tags that
everyone can see and use to find shows. Tagging a podcast is a simple matter
of typing keywords that you think are descriptive of the podcast in a special
tag box (see Figure 16-2). When other users click your tag, they see that pod-
cast, along with other podcasts to which the same tag has been assigned by
other users.
Yahoo! Podcasts is best when integrated with Yahoo! Music Engine, a pro-
gram similar to iTunes that works with non-iPod MP3 players. But the direc-
tory functions fine as an auditioning medium on the Web, without any
downloading.

Two other podcast directories you should know about:
 Odeo: Odeo promises to be a full-fledged podcast studio, where you can
create your own podcasts, in addition to providing a directory. As of this
writing, the studio part was not yet open, but the directory part was. Go
to www.odeo.com.
 Loomia: A nicely designed podcast directory on the Web (no program
installation required), Loomia allows users to assign tags to podcasts
and browse each other’s tags. Go to www.loomia.com.
Creating and Distributing Podcasts
This section covers general steps in creating a podcast and pushing it out
into the world. The specifics would warrant their own book. I point you in a
few productive directions and convey, I trust, a fairly detailed understanding
of how it all works.
The basic outline of podcasting can be boiled down to two steps:
1. Record an audio file.
2. Distribute the audio file in an RSS feed.
Let’s expand each part separately.
Recording a podcast
Podcasts can be as high-tech or as low-tech as your ambitions and standards
demand. If you have something important to say, it doesn’t matter whether
you say it in high-fidelity or low-fidelity. Some of the best podcasts are
recorded over cell phones, and you can imagine the sound quality. Three
basic production levels are used in podcasts:
 Recording over the phone using a Web-based service such as
Audioblog.com
 Recording into your own computer using a headset microphone and
recording software
 Producing high-quality audio either in your computer or in a studio, and
adding music or effects to the show
Audioblog is an audio- and video-uploading service that I discuss in Chapter 17.
You can use Audioblog for posting voice clips in blog entries, but that is not
the same as podcasting. (Remember, a podcast by definition presents regular
302
Part IV: Total Blog Immersion 

episodes and is enclosed in RSS feeds.) Audioblog also offers podcast record-
ing over the phone; once you have an account (which, at this writing, cost
$4.95 a month), you just pick up the phone, dial a special number, and talk up
to 60 minutes. Please, for everyone’s sake, if you’re going to hold down a 60-
minute podcast by yourself, solve the basic riddles of the universe. Anything
less probably won’t fill up the entire hour.
You can record into your computer by connecting a headset microphone
to your MIC input jack of you computer’s sound card; that jack is usually
located on the back panel of the computer (or the front panel of a laptop
computer). One good and much-used program for recording podcasts is
called Audacity (see Figure 16-3). Audacity is a free download available here:
audacity.sourceforge.net
Distributing a podcast
Podcasts go into RSS feeds in a special way. A standard podcast delivery
mechanism in RSS is called an enclosure. The podcast must get into that
enclosure to be recognized by podcast directories such as iTunes, Yahoo!
Podcasts, Odeo, and Loomia. Those directories pluck the podcasts out of the
RSS stream, leaving behind any text that accompanies the podcast. So, a pod-
cast is very much like a blog entry and can even be bundled with a blog entry
on the blog site. But the podcast must be distinctly identified as an enclosure
in the RSS feed.
Some blog programs are better than others at recognizing podcasts and cre-
ating the necessary enclosure. TypePad and WordPress are two of the best;
both programs recognize podcasts when they are uploaded and linked to in
the blog entry. After the podcast is recognized, the RSS enclosure is created
Figure 16-3:
The free

podcasts.
303
Chapter 16: Using Your Real Voice: Podcasting

without effort on your part. That level of automation makes life easy for blog-
gers. They simply create, upload, and link the podcast (not unlike uploading
a photo and putting it in an entry). The blog program does the rest, and the
RSS feed is updated with the necessary enclosure for the podcast.
A Web service called FeedBurner (see Chapter 15) easily creates podcast
enclosures. FeedBurner is a full-service RSS enhancer that helps bloggers
promote their feeds. Basic accounts at FeedBurner are free (upgraded ser-
vice is also available for a monthly subscription), and many podcasters on
various blog platforms use FeedBurner to effectively distribute their
episodes. For more information about creating an RSS feed with podcast
enclosures, go to FeedBurner:

Chapter 17
Photoblogging and Audioblogging
In This Chapter
 Knowing what you need to photoblog
 Posting photos to your blog from anywhere
 Voice blogging with Audioblog
N
o typing is required in this chapter. Here, we discuss photoblogging and
audioblogging. If you are reading straight through the book and have
managed to retain your sanity, this is not your first encounter with either con-
cept. I touch on audioblogging in Chapter 6, because Blogger has a built-in
tool for putting audio in a blog entry. Photoblogging has come up again and
again during the reviews of blogging services and programs in Parts II and III.
Photoblogging is more common than audioblogging for several reasons, not
least among them the fact that more people own digital cameras, and know
how to use them, than own and use computer microphones. But audioblog-
ging is easier than you might think, and this chapter illuminates its mysteries.
In case you’re wondering, this chapter is not concerned with podcasting, which
is a specific type of audioblogging and is covered in Chapter 16. In this chapter,
I examine how to put a short audio clip in a blog entry. Podcasts are related to
RSS feeds and are usually produced on a regular schedule. Audioblogging is
more informal and not necessarily tied into the RSS feed. (See Chapter 13 for
more about RSS and feeds.)
Information in this chapter might influence your choice of blogging service;
some platforms are much more photo-friendly than others. If you’re already
blogging in a program or hosted service that makes working with photos diffi-
cult, consider starting another blog that is dedicated to photos, on a more
supportive platform.

Preparing to Photoblog
It’s easy for you to say “I want to photoblog.” And it’s easy for me to respond,
“Anyone can photoblog.” It’s a different matter to know exactly what is
required. Let’s start from scratch.
Going digital
Photoblogging nearly requires a digital camera. I say “nearly” because you
could conceivably photoblog with a film camera and digitizing service pro-
vided by a developer, or a camera/scanner combination. But using film doesn’t
lead to a happy photoblogging life. The path from film to blog is too slow, too
expensive, and too complicated.
A digital camera stores photos on a memory card, from which they can be
uploaded to your computer. Many digital cameras are marketed with print-
ers, promoting how easy it is to put the memory card into the printer and
print photos — without putting the pictures in the computer at all. Indeed,
bypassing the computer is convenient when the goal is a collection of printed
snapshots. But in photoblogging, the goal is a photo posted on your site, so
it’s the printer you want to bypass. That’s not to say you shouldn’t own a
printer, of course. But the printer is irrelevant to blogging.
Other camera considerations:
 Picture quality in a digital camera is most commonly measured in
megapixels (millions of pixels). A higher number of megapixels yields
more detailed pictures, especially when the photos are enlarged.
Blogging and photoblogging are not known for high-quality photos,
where the size is often constrained to fit into an entry or a sidebar.
(Some professional photographers do use photoblogs to showcase their
work, and they display their albums using thumbnails that expand when
clicked.) You don’t need a great, expensive camera to photoblog. Even a
1-megapixel camera delivers photos that are just fine for a blog.
 More important than picture quality might be the size of the memory
card. One of the joys of digital photography is its freedom from film’s cost-
per-exposure expense. After you buy the camera, digital photography
doesn’t cost anything per photo, and most people quickly get in the habit
of snapping the shutter freely and sorting it all out later. High-quality cam-
eras (5 megapixels and above) need large memory cards because their
photos result in large file sizes.
306
Part IV: Total Blog Immersion 

 Most cameras use a USB connector to upload pictures to the computer.
USB 2.0 is much faster than USB 1.0; you’ll be glad you have it. Many
computers are equipped with memory card slots, enabling you to
remove the card from the camera and stick it in the computer, uploading
the pictures without a cable.
 Camera-equipped cell phones (camera phones) represent another possi-
bility. A camera phone, when combined with a blogging service that 
supports remote hosting, makes it possible to send a photo to a blog
immediately after taking it, without removing the picture from the camera.
Photoblogging, just like written blog entries, can be as profound or superfi-
cial and as objective or personal as you like. Serious photobloggers are like
amateur photojournalists, covering current events with a camera. Casual
photobloggers document their lives with photos like a picture diary.
Choosing a photo-friendly blog service
Strictly speaking, a photoblog is a Weblog whose primary content is photo-
graphic. But there is no harm in taking a broader and more relaxed view. In
this chapter, I use the term photoblogging to mean any use of photographs in
a blog. So in these pages, you are photoblogging if you include a single photo
in your blog, in any fashion, for any purpose.
Photos can be featured in a blog in three ways:
 Embedded in an entry
 Displayed in a sidebar and often linked to a larger pop-up photo
 Collected in photo albums integrated with the blog
The blog services and programs profiled in this book vary alarmingly in their
ability to handle those three display possibilities. You would be justified in
supposing that putting a photo in a blog entry is a piece of cake for any blog
program, as it generally is in an e-mail program. Not so.
Table 17-1 compares how the seven blog platforms in this book handle the
three photo-display options in blogs. Evaluating the programs is a little tricky
because many offer compromised methods rather than built-in tools to do
the job. That is the criterion for this table — the presence of a native ability
to include photos in a blog. When no native ability exists to put photos in, for
example, the sidebar (unless you use another service linking into the blog),
the verdict is “No” with an explanation in parentheses. In cases where there
is a built-in tool but it’s not as user-friendly as it could be; the verdict is “Yes”
with an explanation.

A few notes about this table:
 MSN Spaces and TypePad provide the most complete built-in tools for
photoblogging among the services in this book. MSN Spaces displays
ads in your site. TypePad is a subscription service and has no ads. See
Chapters 4 and 7, respectively, for details.
 Plugins for Movable Type and WordPress are available that provide
photo functions, including the creation of albums.
 Manually entering the URL of a photo location is not necessarily difficult,
but a more automated uploading system that places the photo in an
entry or in a sidebar is preferable.
Moblogging with Photos
Moblogging is mobile blogging — posting entries to your blog from a remote
location. Remote-control blogging takes two forms:
308
Part IV: Total Blog Immersion 

 E-mail blogging: You use any connected computer to e-mail an entry to
your blog. This method might or might not allow photos to be sent,
depending on the blog service. Also, you might be required to use a cer-
tain e-mail account that you specify with the service — again, depending
on the service.
 Cell-phone blogging: Mostly used with camera phones, this method
involves sending a picture from an Internet-connected, camera-equipped
cell phone to an e-mail address that is set up to post the photo to your
blog.
Photo moblogging has gained fame through bad times — notably, in the after-
math of storms and bombing during which citizens with blogs posted photos
faster, in greater volume, and from closer to the events than the mainstream
media. People escaping the London subways after the 2005 bombings took
out their camera phones and streamed photos of that terrible day to their
blogs. Happier moments are just as susceptible to moblogging, and after your
system is in place, sending a photo remotely to your blog can be easier than
posting a regular entry.
309
Chapter 17: Photoblogging and Audioblogging
The Flickr solution
Blog programs installed on your server, such as
Movable Type and WordPress, do not come
with built-in moblogging tools. This is where
Flickr comes in. Flickr is a photo-sharing service
that, among many great features, can accept
moblogged photos and pass them on to many of
the blogs described in this book. Specifically,
Flickr works with Blogger, TypePad, Movable
Type, and WordPress.
Flickr accounts are free, though you can
upgrade to a paid account that has no storage
limits. For our basic moblogging purposes, the
free account works fine. Go to the Flickr home
page to get started:
www.flickr.com
After you have a Flickr page of your own, find
the Your blogs link and click it to get started set-
ting up your moblogging system. Flickr allows
you to set up multiple blogs, if you have them.
But Flickr provides just one e-mail address for
remote entries, so you must choose which blog
you want to use before hitting the road with
your camera phone.
After you’re set up, add that e-mail address to
your cell phone’s address book. Send your
photos to it. Watch them appear in your blog. It’s
that simple, that fun, and definitely worth the
effort of setting it all up in Flickr.

As with all photo work, some blog services make moblogging easier than
others. Of the platforms covered in this book, Blogger and TypePad lead the
way with built-in moblogging tools:
 Blogger.com provides two remote services, one e-mail and one phone.
The e-mail service (called Mail-to-Blogger) does not accept photos, so
that’s off the radar in this chapter. The phone service (called Blogger
Mobile) works beautifully and gives you the option of moblogging to
your already existing Blogger blog (if you have one) or creating a new
blog just for your remotely posted pictures. See Chapter 6 for the
details.
 TypePad merges e-mail blogging with cell-phone blogging by allowing
you to list several e-mail addresses from which your messages will
come. You can assign one slot to your regular e-mail address and
another slot to your phone’s address. (You might have to contact your
cell-phone provider to obtain the address.) Then you assign blogs for
text entries and photo entries. In TypePad Plus and Pro, where you can
operate more than one blog in the account, you can assign one blog to
receive text entries and another blog to receive any pictures you beam
over. The final piece of the puzzle is a special e-mail address assigned to
your TypePad account to receive all remote entries. See Chapter 7 for
the details.
Audioblogging with Audioblog
I mention aubdioblogging in Chapter 6 because Blogger.com has a built-in ser-
vice that lets you create talking blog entries. Here, I want to highlight a differ-
ent service that works with many blogging platforms: Audioblog.
Audioblog is a subscription service that lets you phone in a blog entry or
upload a recorded audio file from your computer. Either way, the near-instant
result is a blog entry with a Play button in it. That Play button works in nearly
any browser on any computer, without opening another program. It just . . .
plays. This system is an advantage over Blogger’s audioblogging service,
which connects the audio to the blog but opens a program such as Windows
Media Player or iTunes to play the audio. Audioblog is not free, but it works
with many blog programs and provides a better experience for your visitors.
Audioblog is not the place to start a blog. The service places audio content
on a blog you already operate. If you are blogging with WordPress, TypePad,
LiveJournal, or Movable Type, follow these steps to get started:
1. Go to Audioblog at www.audioblog.com.
2. Click the Sign Up Now! button.
310
Part IV: Total Blog Immersion 

These sign-up buttons are always so jubilant, as if they were suggesting
you pop open a bottle of champagne.
3. Fill in your billing information, and then click the Go to Confirmation
button.
4. Click the Yes, Submit button.
That is, after you confirm that your information is correct.
5. On the next page, click the Go to Log In Page button.
6. Log in with your username and password.
7. On the My Blogs page, click the Add Blog link.
8. On the next page, name your blog and enter the details of your blog.
The blog name you enter here identifies the blog within Audioblog; it
does not change the name of the blog on the blog. Use the drop-down
menu to select your blog program or service.
9. Click the Save and Update Blog List button.
You can register multiple blogs with Audioblog.
10. On your account page, click the Audio tab.
11. Click the My Moblog link.
12. Write down your phone number and PIN number.
You need these numbers to record a voice entry over the phone. You
might want to print this page. I also have the phone number in my
cell phone’s address book, so I can post an audio blog entry anytime,
anywhere.
After you reach this stage, you’re ready to audioblog. Follow the instructions
on the page displaying your personal numbers. You need the four-digit number
that identifies your blog; it appears next to your blog’s name on that page.
So now you can unfold your phone at any time and post a voice entry that just
about any visitor can effortlessly hear. If you did the Flickr routine described
earlier in this chapter, you can also post photos remotely, perhaps using the
same cell phone. How cool is all this? I’ll answer that; on a scale of one to ten
it maxes out at ten. This is great stuff. The step-throughs in this chapter might
seem long and complicated, but they are worth it. Set aside some time and
take them slowly. When you’re all set up, the actual photoblogging, moblog-
ging, and audioblogging become as easy as making a phone call.

illions of blogs. Multiple millions of blog entries. Many of those blog
entries contain links to other Web content, and bloggers like to know
who is linking to whom. How does one keep track of it all? Google? Yahoo!?
Sure, those generic search engines do index blog entries and mix them into
Web results along with nonblog pages when you run a keyword search. But
the blogosphere has grown so rapidly, and is so rich in content, that an urgent
need exists for dedicated blog search engines. That need has been met by sev-
eral engines that collect only blog content. In addition to traditional keyword-
entry search engines, directories and useful lists have sprung up to help you
navigate the oceanic blogosphere and find the writers you want to read.
This chapter deals exclusively with written blogs, not podcasts. Specific pod-
cast-finding services are described in Chapter 16. Also, see Chapter 3 for a
quick rundown of four blog search engines and how bloggers use them.
Those four engines are
 Technorati (www.technorati.com)
 Feedster (www.feedster.com)

 BlogPulse (www.blogpulse.com)
 Bloglines (www.bloglines.com)
I did not want to duplicate mentions of those engines here, but any one of
them could have been selected for this chapter. Each is worth investigating.
BlogPulse is currently my favorite blog engine; Technorati is a grandfather of
blog searching still loyally used by many; Feedster likewise has a strong repu-
tation; and Bloglines is one of the most popular RSS newsreaders that also
includes a blog search engine.
PubSub
www.pubsub.com
The credibility of blog engines ebbs and flows quickly, driven by the vora-
cious and demanding nature of the blogosphere. At the time of this writing,
PubSub was riding high thanks to the quality of its search results and the
ease with which it can be personalized. PubSub gets part of its name from the
fact that you can “subscribe” to searches. This tracking feature is not a sub-
scription in any traditional sense; it is free, and you don’t even have to regis-
ter at the site to use it. That last fact is remarkable in this era of ubiquitous
site registrations and contributes to the site’s wildfire popularity. You can
just go there and start using it. Here’s how:
1. On the PubSub home page (see Figure 18-1), click the mouse inside
the keyword entry box labeled 1.
Doing so clears the welcome message in that box and readies it to
accept your keyword(s).
2. Type a single word or a phrase.
3. Click the Start Matching Now! button.
The page reloads, and your keyword string is added to the My
Subscription Stack on the left side of the page.
4. Click any subscription in your Subscription Stack to launch a search
for that keyword string.
The results page displays full blog entries (and articles) for the 32 most
recent matches to your keyword(s). Figure 18-2 shows PubSub search
results for the keyword RIAA. You might have to wait a few minutes to
see results. Try adding another keyword or phrase, and then click the
first subscription — you should see results by then.

Chapter 18: Ten Blog Engines and Directories

PubSub claims to work in reverse of typical search engines, which build data-
bases based on periodically crawling the Web. Contrary to such retrospective
indexing, PubSub keeps a database of search queries (Subscription Stacks)
and matches that database to blog entries as they are published; PubSub
calls this prospective searching, and the results are amazingly current.
PubSub automatically identifies your computer and recognizes you when you
return to the site on that computer. This invisible and effortless tracking of
your Subscription Stack makes PubSub a breeze to use, though some people
don’t like Web sites leaving cookies (identifying bits of information) in their
computers, especially without asking. I find PubSub’s method a refreshing
change from the hassle of registration and logging into a site every time I use
it — plus, I know PubSub isn’t going to sell my e-mail address because it
doesn’t have it.
Actually, PubSub does accept registrations (click the Login link), the main 
benefit of which is use of the PubSub Sidebar. The Sidebar attaches to your
browser (there is an Internet Explorer version and a Firefox version) and deliv-
ers continually updating results to your Subscription Stack, so you don’t have
to visit the site and initiate a search. (Figure 18-3 shows the PubSub Sidebar in
action.) With a PubSub account, you can also add an RSS feed for each of your
search subscriptions to a newsreader and check ongoing search results there.
(See Chapter 13 for the complete story of RSS and newsreaders.)

PubSub offers another valuable feature to bloggers who want to track how
many (and which) sites are linking to their entries. Try this:
1. On the PubSub home page, click the PubStats navigation link.
2. On the PubStats page, click SiteStats.
3. On the SiteStats page, enter your blog’s URL.
The resulting page, shown in Figure 18-4, crunches all kinds of numbers
related to your blog and its incoming links (that is to say, links from other
blogs to your site). If you click the InLinks column of the main table, PubSub
shows you which specific sites linked to you on that day.
Blogdex
www.blogdex.net
A product of the MIT Media Laboratory, Blogdex calls itself “The Weblog
Diffusion Index,” and it tracks the most-linked pieces of Web content at any
given moment. Most of those content pieces are articles, because bloggers so
often link to articles and comment on them. So, Blogdex is an ever-changing

Chapter 18: Ten Blog Engines and Directories

directory of the most important daily topics of conversation in the blogos-
phere. Unlike traditional online directories, though, there is no division into
topics and no drilling down into subtopics. Blogdex simply presents a list of
articles (and whatever else is being linked to), and notes how many links cur-
rently exist to each page. (See Figure 18-5.) Click the track this site link below
any item to see which blogs have linked to that page.
Blogdex is not used popularly as a search engine, but it does have a search
function. Click the Search link on the home page. Two modes of searching are
available:
 URLs: Your keywords are matched against Web addresses.
 Text: Your keywords are matched against page titles.
The page title of any Web page appears in the top bar of your Web browser.
The page title is determined by the page creator or site administrator; some
creators and administrators take more care to title their pages accurately
than others. As a result, the Text type of search can return uneven results.
However, I find it more valuable than the URL search, the results of which
tend to be predictable.

To be sure your blog is represented in the Blogdex index, use the Add your
weblog link and fill out the short form.
If you want to keep up-to-date with Blogdex listing results but don’t want
to be bothered visiting the site repeatedly, use RSS in your newsreader
(see Chapter 13). Copy and paste the RSS 2.0 link destination into your 
newsreader.
Clusty
www.clusty.com
If you have never used a clustering search engine, Clusty might be a revela-
tion. One of the problems with a generic Web search (at Google, Yahoo!, or
MSN Search, for example) is that the search engine does not divide your
results by topic. You, the searcher, determine the topic by typing keywords.
That’s fine and gives you a lot of power to find things, but most keywords and
key phrases are rather general. People don’t usually make the effort to craft
long key phrases that narrow a topic with great precision. And because most
people don’t have much patience at sifting through unsorted search results,
the “top-ten phenomenon” holds sway: People look at the first ten search
results, and then move on to another search or settle for a top-ten result that
might not be ideal.
Here’s an example in a general search engine. Imagine you’re searching for
information about lawsuits brought by the music record companies against
individuals for trading music online illegally. You might be vaguely aware of
the facts, and your search might be determined by this key phrase:
music lawsuits individuals
A more sophisticated and targeted search string is
file sharing lawsuits +(riaa OR mpaa) -site:riaa.org -site:riaa.com
If you’re interested in unlocking the power of generic search engines, get
your hands on a copy of Google Search and Rescue For Dummies. I understand
the author needs money to fund his espresso addiction. But to get back to
our example, the second search string delivers a more finely targeted set of
search results, and an accomplished keyword jockey could slant the search
in many other directions. But that second search string requires more knowl-
edge than the average person would have before starting to learn about
music lawsuits.
321
Chapter 18: Ten Blog Engines and Directories

This is where clustered searching comes in. Using the first search string in a
clustering engine delivers results packed into folders, each of which targets a
subtopic of the general search. Look at Figure 18-6, and notice the folders in
the left sidebar. Two folders contain keywords that might be new to begin-
ners in this topic; both keywords appear in the second search string above
(riaa and sharing). So, right away, you get a better overview of the subject
than you would in Google. Click any folder to see that folder’s search results
or, as in Figure 18-6, more subcategories of results.
Clusty is not the only clustering search engine, but it enjoys a lot of buzz for
its speed and quality of results. Its buzz factor only increased when it added
the Blogs tab to its selection of engines. Click that tab on the Clusty home
page to start searching for clustered blog results. You can transfer a Web
search to a blog search by clicking the Blogs tab after getting your Web
search results.
Clusty doesn’t do any of the recursive, who’s-linking-to-whom link analysis
typical of other engines in this chapter. It’s just straight text searching of blog
entries.

Blogwise
www.blogwise.com
Blogwise is a blog directory and search engine whose top priority is immedi-
acy. The home page displays a frequently updated list of blogs that have
updated entries; the top items on the list are usually fresh by just a couple
of minutes.
You can search by keyword at Blogwise (click the Search link in the left side-
bar), but the site is not known as a great searching resource. My experience
is that you need to enter very general search queries to get any results at all.
Carrying forward the example I used in the preceding Clusty section, a search
for music lawsuits individuals returned no results. Simplifying the search
string to music lawsuits likewise delivered no joy. Trying riaa (the name of a
music organization that initiates lawsuits) does bring home some results, but
that is an extremely broad search query by any standards.
Search results are distinguished, as on the home page, by immediacy. The
results are sorted by keyword match, and then sorted again by freshness.
The blog with the most recent entry is placed atop the list, even if that recent
entry does not exactly match your search terms.
Blogwise offers a Blogs by Country directory that is fun to explore, especially
if you can read non-English languages. Look for it on the home page and click
a country. As always, results are sorted by freshness.

Blog of the Day
If you were online in 1995, you probably remem-
ber all the fuss over Cool Site of the Day, an
early Web site whose only purpose was to run
a daily “best of” feature spotlighting one site.
The chosen site was given a ticket to instant
fame and readership. It’s only natural that the
same treatment would be given to blogs. The
best one-blog-a-day site is Blog of the Day,
located here:
http://www.shrednow.com/botd/
index.html
The selections at this site key off current events;
during the aftermath of hurricane Katrina, sev-
eral daily picks highlighted blog coverage of the
disaster. Many choices during less momentous
times feature lightweight personal blogs that
offer stylish writing or fun photos.

What I really want to talk about is Blogwise’s coolest feature: Blog Maps.
Blogwise uses open development tools at Google Maps to display the geo-
graphical location of blogs. You don’t search by blog; you search by location.
The database at Blogwise is gradually growing, and not all map locations are
ready for prime time as of this writing. Figure 18-7 shows the Blog Maps dis-
play of London. Try out Blog Maps here:
www.blogwise.com/blogmaps
Blogdigger
www.blogdigger.com
Your first impression of Blogdigger will probably be along the lines of: “Oh,
another blog search engine.” Indeed, its Search portion operates as a stan-
dard text-crawling engine that returns blog entries to keyword queries. You
have two sorting options: Date and Relevance. Sorting by date doesn’t ignore
relevance, but it lists broadly relevant matches in reverse chronological
order according to posting date. The Relevance option exactly matches your
keywords first and foremost, when possible, disregarding the date.

Part V: The Part of Tens 

Note the five tabs on Blogdigger’s pages (see Figure 18-8):
 Search: This is where you conduct standard blog searches. Blogdigger
crawls the text content of blog entries.
 Links: Here, you enter a site URL (blog or nonblog) to find out which
blogs link to that page.
 Media: Under this tab, you can search for audio, video, images, and Bit
Torrent downloads. (Bit Torrent is a file-sharing network often, but not
necessarily, associated with unauthorized music and movie downloads.)
The audio part is somewhat useful when searching for podcasts (see
Chapter 16) but not as useful as other options I explain in Chapter 16.
Local: Clicking this tab brings up a search engine that finds keyword-
matched pages written by bloggers in certain geographic areas that you
specify. You can use a city or zip code.
Groups: This is the juicy one. Keep reading to know more.

Chapter 18: Ten Blog Engines and Directories

The Groups function at Blogdigger allows you to combine the output of multi-
ple blogs. This type of mashup is called blog merging or blog aggregation,
though the latter term is used also to describe simple newsreaders (see
Chapter 13). Merging two blogs is more useful and less chaotic than you
might imagine. Most people mash blogs that are about the same topic — for
example, several blogs about dogs, or baking, or Google, or some other sub-
ject. Some newsreaders allow merging of RSS feeds that you’ve subscribed to.
Blogdigger provides an effective public interface for creating and sharing
merged blog groups.
Follow these steps to create a Blogdigger group:
1. On the Blogdigger home page, click the Groups tab.
2. On the Groups page, click the create a new group link.
3. On the next page, fill in the information fields.
These fields ask for a group name, your name and e-mail address, and a
group description.
4. Scroll down the page to choose your accessibility features.
Your group can be public (seen by everyone who views the Blogdigger
Groups list) or private (seen just by you). Also, you can choose whether
anyone or only you can add new blogs to your group. Think twice on
this page because, as of this writing, you can’t alter these accessibility
choices later.
5. Click the Create Group button to reach the next step.
6. On the next page, enter the addresses of feeds you want included in
your group. Click the Submit button after pasting each feed address.
Be clear on an important point: On this page, you must add the
addresses of RSS or Atom feeds, not the URLs of blogs. Do not take the
Web addresses from blog sites and try to plug them in here. Instead, go
to blogs you want to add, find the feed addresses of those blogs (see
Chapter 13 for more about this), and then copy and paste those
addresses into this Blogdigger page. It’s not difficult; just be sure you get
the feed address, not the blog’s site address. If you use a newsreader,
you can get feed addresses there for blogs you subscribe to.
After adding your last feed (last for now; you can add more later, or delete
feeds), your group is finished. You don’t need to click a Save button. If your
group is public, it is immediately added to the Blogdigger Groups list. Click
the Back to the Group Page link to see your group in action — that is, to see
the latest entries from your combined blogs, listed in reverse chronological
order. Use the See list of public groups link to view all available groups. There
is good reading ahead, thanks to other users’ resourceful and sometimes
imaginative merging of blogs. If you’d like to see a merged output of the blogs
I write at Weblogs Inc., look for Brad’s WeblogsInc Blogs.
326
Part V: The Part of Tens 

The mashup-sharing aspect of Blogdigger Groups is the best part. Browsing
other people’s merged collections is almost too much fun. Not to sound like a
Boy Scout leader, but remember to tread responsibly when editing publicly
accessible groups. Don’t add your blog willy-nilly to several groups. It will
only get pulled out eventually. Add relevant blogs that add substance to the
group feed.
Daypop
www.daypop.com
Daypop is an iconic blog engine and ranking site that a lot of people have been
using for a lot of years. The basic search engine mixes traditional news sources
with blogs — or keeps them separate if you prefer. Use the drop-down menu
next to the keyword box to select News, Weblogs, or News & Weblogs. (You can
conduct searches of RSS feeds also by using the drop-down menu, but I find the
two RSS-search options to be relatively unproductive.)
For me, Daypop distinguishes itself in the features surrounding the basic
search engine. Check these links at the top of the Daypop home page:
 Top 40: Bloggers link to these top-40 pages in greater volume than other
pages at the time of your search.
 Top News: Similar to the Top 40, this attractive and useful page is pre-
sented differently, like a front page of a news site. Click the Citations link
to see which blogs are linking to that story.
 Top Posts: This page displays a list of most-linked blog posts — that is,
blog entries most linked to by other bloggers.
 Word Bursts: This extraordinary feature measures increases in word
usage from day to day in blog entries. These suddenly popular words
and phrases indicate emerging topics of discussion in the blogosphere.
 News Bursts: Like Word Bursts (see the preceding bullet), News Bursts
result from scanning news pages instead of blog entries.
 Top Wishlist: This interesting but peculiar feature lists the most popular
wish-list items at Amazon.com and has nothing to do with blogging or
blog sites.
 Top Weblogs: This list is derived from citations. That is, the blogs on
this list are linked to most often in Daypop’s blog database.

Three Directories
www.getblogs.com
www.bloguniverse.com
www.postami.com
I’d like to point out three blog directories that always yield interesting finds
and sometimes produce valuable hidden gems when I visit them. Yet, I find
that I don’t include these sites in my regular content trolling. Every once in a
while I remember one of them, go to it, am pleased with the visit, and then
forget about it again.
 Getblogs: The most typical directory category lineup of the three,
Getblogs divides into topics such as Health, Science, and Sports. Each
category displays an alphabetical presentation of blogs. No ranking or
link-worthiness is presented.
 Blog Universe: An adventurous directory, Blog Universe includes
International Blogs and Sex Blogs categories. At the time of this writing,
a Business Blogs section and a Spirituality Blogs section were recently
added.
Postami: Gossip? US Presidential? Unusual topics and eye-burning page
layout make this directory a challenging visit but not without interest.
You might not be surprised to learn of 1216 blogs devoted to President
Bush, but would you guess that 91 people write blogs about Dennis
Kucinich?
Top 100 Lists
Every blogger wants to be on a top-100 list, or even a top-100,000 list. The fol-
lowing sites keep the dream alive, in different ways:
 Technorati Top 100: Probably the most-watched “top list” in the blog
universe, the Technorati Top 100 derives its results by counting links to
blogs. The most-linked blogs get on the list, which is located here:
www.technorati.com/pop/blogs/
 BlogStreet Top 100: BlogStreet takes a different approach from Technorati.
Rather than count links to popular blogs, BlogStreet examines blogrolls —
the lists of blogs, with links to those blogs, that most bloggers put on their
sites. The result is sharply different from Technorati’s list and arguably
less useful. At the same time, the list is arguably more fun to browse than
328
Part V: The Part of Tens 

Technorati’s, which predictably features the same top-ranked blogs over
and over. Find the BlogStreet list here:
www.blogstreet.com/top100.html
IceRocket
www.icerocket.com
Founded by Internet entrepreneur Marc Cuban, IceRocket is, at its core, a
standard blog search engine. But wait — one important feature makes
IceRocket a standout. That feature is a customizable date filter to search for
blog entries. You can restrict the search to entries posted on the current day
or during the last week, the last month, or (and this is best) any period of
time you set. (See Figure 18-9.)
The options to filter by time period appear below the keyword box on any
search result page. Click one of the presets or use the Custom link to set a
date range.

Diarist.net
www.diarist.net
Diarist.net is a source for journaling bloggers and those who like to read
online personal journals. Click the Diary Registry link on the home page to
see the directory of personal blogs. You are presented with a long list of
countries. If you select United States, you then get a list of states. This geo-
graphic sorting is somewhat interesting, especially when browsing in other
countries, though it doesn’t make much sense in the U.S. No matter. Personal
diaries rarely have a topical focus, so who cares how they are sorted? This
site is a treasure trove of chatty and informal writing.

his chapter features miscellaneous blogging resources that didn’t find a

wonder why I don’t highlight important blogging tools such as FeedBurner
or Audioblog, the answer is that they are profiled elsewhere (FeedBurner in
Chapter 15 and Audioblog in Chapter 17). The items in this chapter were
chosen to fill those spare moments when you might want to read a blog
about blogging (The Blog Herald or Blogging Pro), try an interactive tool that
could enhance your blogging (The Wizbang Standalone TrackBack Pinger), or
consume other blogs in a new way (Blogarithm). Have fun!
Blogging Pro
www.bloggingpro.com
Blogging Pro is a blog about blogging resources. A recent collection of entries
on the index page features new releases of blog template themes for WordPress

(see Chapter 10), how to increase AdSense earnings (see Chapter 15), and a
notice of Weblogs seeking to hire a blogger. Living up to its name, the site
inclines toward issues of interest to professional (and semiprofessional) 
bloggers.
Categories include News, Tools, and How-to, with strong coverage of the
Movable Type and WordPress blog programs. (The site is written in
WordPress.) Blogging Pro is managed by one person who also owns other
blogs, so the posting isn’t as frequent as would be ideal.
Wizbang Standalone TrackBack Pinger
www.aylwardfamily.com/content/tbping.asp
Some people think TrackBacks are dying — they have not been universally
adopted by blog programs, and many bloggers don’t understand them. That
last point is true, but if you read my lengthy (and, I hope, clarifying) explana-
tion of TrackBacks in Chapter 3, you might take a liking to the principle of
tracking back from one site to another. TrackBacks are a method of remote
commenting, by which one blogger can write an entry commenting on a post
by another blogger, and leave a notice linking to the entry on that other blog-
ger’s page.
TrackBacks were invented by the blogging company SixApart, which gave
away the tool to any other company that wanted to implement it. Some did;
some didn’t. The Wizbang Standalone TrackBack Pinger gives TrackBack
power to anyone using a blog service or program that doesn’t have
TrackBacks built in. This means that even if you blog with the simple tools of
a social network (see Chapter 5), for example, you can still use the sophisti-
cated TrackBack tool.
Next, I briefly step through how to use Wizbang. This description makes little
sense, most likely, unless you have read the TrackBack sections of Chapter 3.
Figure 19-1 illustrates the following steps:
1. On the Wizbang page, copy the TrackBack URL into the top field.
The TrackBack URL is published below the entry on the blog where you
want to plant your TrackBack. Do not confuse the TrackBack URL with
the permalink; they are different. Use Ctrl+C to copy it from the entry
page, and then Ctrl+V to paste it into the top field.
2. In the second field, paste your permalink URL.
This URL is the Web address of the entry you have just written. The
entry should be relevant to the entry you are commenting on, which
resides on the other blog.
332
Part V: The Part of Tens 

3. In the third field, paste your blog name.
4. In the fourth field, paste the title of your entry.
5. In the large field, type or paste an excerpt of your entry.
By blogging standards, this excerpt should not be very long; Wizbang
limits you to 250 characters.
6. Click the Submit TrackBack button.
Remember that the receiving blog (the blog upon which your TrackBack is
planted) must have TrackBacks enabled. Both sites in a TrackBack must be
running TrackBacks. Wizbang solves the TrackBack deficit on your blog but not
the other blog. You can tell that a blog accepts TrackBacks by the TrackBacks
link next to the Comments link below each entry on the index page.
Bloglet
www.bloglet.com
Bloglet is a Web service that allows you to collect subscriptions to e-mail
updates of your site. It’s hard to predict whether demand will continue for
this service as RSS feeds and newsreaders become more popular. (See
Figure 19-1:

Chapter 19: Ten Resources for the Power Blogger

Chapter 13 for everything you need to know about RSS feeds.) The purpose
of RSS syndication is to give your readers an easy way to check for updates
without taking the trouble to visit your site. That’s the purpose of e-mailed
updates, too, but an e-mail gets into your readers’ faces more than an RSS
feed does. Bloglet is a pushy reminder that you’ve added content to your site.
Many people still prefer e-mail, though, on both the sending and receiving
ends. Certainly, nothing is wrong with offering this service on your pages and
seeing what happens.
The Bloglet service is highly automated. You just sign up and place the Bloglet
subscription form on your site. (Some knowledge of HTML is required to place
the form.) Bloglet does the rest: It monitors your posting, keeps track of the
e-mail addresses of subscribers, and sends a daily notice informing them of
your new blog entries.
Note: Bloglet works with specified blog programs and services, and not with
others. Of the services covered in this book, Bloglet works with Blogger.com,
Movable Type, and Radio Userland.
Blogjet
www.blogjet.com
Blogjet is a posting screen on steroids. And even that description understates
the power of this program. Blogjet is not free (the program costs 40 bucks as
of this writing), but its features are worth the price to many power bloggers.
Blogjet is a downloadable program that resides on your computer desktop like
any other application. It enables you to post a blog entry without using your
browser. Furthermore, Blogjet solves some of the inadequacies of blog ser-
vices. For example, if you run a WordPress blog, inserting a photo in a blog
entry is more difficult than it should be. Blogjet’s posting interface (which
works with most major blog platforms) makes posting photos a point-and-
click affair, as it should be (and is in some services, such as MSN Spaces and
TypePad). Blogjet even includes a voice recorder for creating audio entries.
Overall, Blogjet provides the ideal posting interface, and applies it to whatever
platform or service you are using.

How to Write a Better Weblog
www.alistapart.com/articles/writebetter/
How to Write a Better Weblog, a style guide written in 2002, applies to all blog-
gers no matter when they read it. Good blog writing shares some points with
good general writing, and this resource advises concision, humor, simplicity,
and descriptiveness of style. When it comes to selecting content, How to
Write a Better Weblog advises making the effort to find original source mater-
ial instead of commenting on the same items everyone else is commenting
on. The piece is encouraging and inspirational: “No matter what your audi-
ence size, you ought to write as if your readership consisted of paid sub-
scribers whose subscriptions were perpetually about to expire. There’s no
need to pander. Compel them to resubscribe.”
The article is part of a larger site for Webmasters that includes resources on
coding, page design, and other issues that might not be of interest. I would
normally hesitate to include a single article — just one page of prose — in
this chapter, but this one is a winner that could improve anyone’s blog 
presentation.
Blogarithm
www.blogarithm.com
Blogarithm delivers blog entries to your e-mail box. You choose the blogs, nat-
urally. Why use Blogarithm when you can stock your favorite newsreader with
RSS feeds from every blog you care about? That’s a good question, and I asked
it myself when I first tried Blogarithm. Then I got hooked on Blogarithm’s effi-
cient means of displaying blog entry titles (using a drop-down menu, as shown
in Figure 19-2). I find that I use Blogarithm to remind me of certain blogs that
tend to get buried in my RSS pile in the newsreader. When that e-mail comes
in, I remember that those blogs are worth checking every day, and I get right
to it. Blogarithm is one of several delivery mechanisms I use.
Another service that delivers blog entries by e-mail is R|Mail. I use Blogarithm,
myself, but both are worth checking out. R|Mail is located here:

Google Directory of Weblog Templates

Blog services such as Blogger.com and programs such as WordPress offer a
range of design templates to personalize your blog. The problem is that these
big blog providers have so many millions of users that any personalization
statement you make with one of their preset templates is the same statement
made by countless other bloggers. As a result, an underground network of
template designers exists, offering fresh alternatives.
This page of Google’s directory contains a healthy selection of template
providers and template directories. Templates are often free of charge,
though some designers require payment.

Glossary
AdSense: AdSense is an advertising publishing program offered by Google
that enables participating bloggers to make some money on their Weblogs.
(See Chapter 15.) After signing up for AdSense, eligible blogs can run Google
text (and sometimes banner) ads on the blogs’ pages; the advertisers pay
Google when blog visitors click those ads, and Google shares the money with
bloggers.
AdSense for Feeds: A variation on Google AdSense, the AdSense for Feeds
program places small text ads in RSS feeds when they are displayed in news-
readers. (See Chapter 15.) This program enables bloggers to make money
even if most of their readership occurs off-site. Placing ads in RSS feeds is
somewhat controversial but is becoming less so.
AdWords: Google AdWords is an advertising program in which advertisers
place context-sensitive ads on Google search result pages and, if the adver-
tiser opts to, on other Web sites participating in Google AdSense. (See
Chapter 15.)
anchor link: Anchor links exist in blog entries to cite relevant Web pages that
the reader might want to look at. See embedded link.
archives: Archives are the historical record of a blog. Blog programs and ser-
vices keep track of every entry posted by the blogger; nothing is discarded
unless the blogger intentionally deletes an entry. Most bloggers do not delete
entries except under exceptional circumstances; blog culture requires keep-
ing even regrettable entries available. Links to archived posts are sometimes
provided on each page’s sidebar, organized as a list or as a monthly calendar.
Atom: One of two major syndication feed formats (the other being RSS), Atom
is used by Blogger.com.
audioblogging: Audioblogging refers to creating a spoken-word entry. Some
blog services (Blogger is one) provide tools for recording audio entries.
Other general services (such as Audioblog.com) allow posting audio entries
to blogs on other services. Audioblogging is not the same as podcasting.
blawg: A blawg is a blog about law and legal issues.
blink: This slangy term is a nickname for Web link, especially a link to a cited
Web page in a blog entry. “He blogged about that article in yesterday’s Times
but forgot the blink, so nobody could read the article.”

blog: A contraction for Weblog, a blog is a Web site powered by software that
makes frequent updates easy. New content is usually presented as a dated
entry, with the entries displayed in reverse chronological order. Because of
the organizational scheme, blogs are often used as personal and public
diaries, but a blog can be about anything at all, and some blogs are profes-
sional publishing ventures.
blog digest: A blog digest provides no original material but quotes and points
to entries from many other blogs. Taking its model from the Readers Digest
magazine, blog digests reprint other people’s work, but the most ethical of
them do not quote entire entries.
blog search engine: A blog search engine specializes in finding blog entries that
match keywords and blog entries that link to URLs entered by the searcher.
blogathy: Blogathy occurs when you become apathetic about posting in your
blog. One always hopes that blogathy is temporary.
blogerati: A vaguely defined and sometimes sarcastically employed term,
blogerati refers to the aristocracy of the blogosphere.
blogger: A blogger writes a blog.
bloggerel: This derogatory term refers to blog entries of little merit, often
because they repeat widespread discussion points without adding original
thinking or because they represent debunked viewpoints.
blogging: Blogging is the act of writing and posting blog entries.
Blogistan: Similar to blogosphere, the term Blogistan represents the blogging
nation. Blogosphere carries a more amorphous and nebulous feeling than
Blogistan, but they mean essentially the same thing.
blognoscenti: As with blogerati, this term is vaguely defined and generally
refers to the most knowledgeable inner circle of bloggers.
blogorrhea: Not to be gross, but blogorrhea is too much insubstantial blog-
ging. I didn’t invent the term; I’m just reporting it.
blogosphere: The entire global networked universe of bloggers and blogs is
called the blogosphere. Often called a community, even though millions of
bloggers cannot realistically get to know each other, portions of the blogos-
phere are woven together by connected strands of discourse. The mechanics
of this connection include comments, TrackBacks, and embedded links in
blog entries.
342
Blogging For Dummies 

blogroach: This derogatory term denotes a blog reader who crawls through
comment sections leaving many unnecessary comments.
blogroll: The blogroll is the list of favored sites displayed in a blog’s sidebar.
Attaining a spot on the blogroll of a popular and influential blog is a sign of
success and usually results in more visitors to the blogrolled site.
blogstipation: Blogstipation is writer’s block for bloggers. The condition
might be due to a lack of inspiration, as with traditional writer’s block, or it
might result from exhaustion after blogging too much.
business blog: A business blog, quite simply and obviously, is a blog about
business.
comment: Most blogs allow readers to write and post responses to blog
entries; these responses are in public view and are called comments. Some
blog experts believe that when comments are disabled, preventing readers
from discussing entries, a blog ceases to be a blog. The viewpoint of this
book, however, is that deciding whether to accept comments is the universal
prerogative of bloggers.
comment spam: A pestilent fact of blogging life, comment spam is unsolicited,
irrelevant, inappropriate, and usually commercial messages deposited in the
comments section of a blog. Comment spam is widespread, particularly afflict-
ing blogs with high readership. Spammers use automated programs called
spambots to crawl through the blogosphere, leaving junk comments.
commentariat: Meant as a term of respect, the commentariat is the global
community of people who write comments in blogs. The term can also be
used in a local sense. One might say, “His blog entries are a little boring, but
his commentariat turns out interesting conversations despite that.”
commenter: Someone who writes and posts a comment in a blog.
embedded link: Blogs characteristically provide many context links in their
entries, so readers can see the source material (articles, other blog entries,
and so on) that inspired the blog entry. Rather than extensively quoting
source material, bloggers cite it by linking to it directly from the blog entry.
These links, also called anchor links, are embedded in the entry using a
simple linking function in blog software.
entry: The foundation of a blog, the entry is the piece of new content that
keeps the blog updated. Each new entry written and posted by the blogger is
placed at the top of the index page — the home page of the blog. Previous
entries are pushed down the page until they eventually fall off the page,
343
Glossary

which has a preset entry limit. Entries are never lost, however, because each
new entry is assigned a unique page in the blog and can always be read on
that page.
entry page: The Web page permanently assigned to a blog entry is called the
entry page. Blog entries are placed on the index page when first posted;
simultaneously, each entry is placed on its own page, instantly created to
hold it. Entry pages are cited by other blogs discussing the entry. The URL
(Web address) of the entry page is called the permalink.
event blog: Event blogs are temporary sites set up to cover an event. Typical
event blogs include concert blogs, Academy Award blogs, and professional
trade conference blogs. Often, event blogs feature “live” reporting, by which
a blogger attends the event with a connected laptop computer or other device,
and posts frequent updates of the proceedings. Event blogs are sometimes left
in place as archived histories, even after their events have concluded.
feed: A feed is a summary of blog entries, displayed in newsreaders using a
format in which graphics and other page elements are stripped out. Feeds
always contain the headline of the entry and usually contain some or all of
the entry text. Depending on the blog program or service, the blogger has
variable control over how the feed is presented. On the newsreader end, the
reader also might have some control over how much of the entry is viewed.
Feeds enable the blogger to syndicate blog entries globally, so that readers do
not need to visit the blog. However, the feed always links back to the blog
entry it is displaying, so readers can visit the blog to leave a comment or for
another reason.
feed aggregator: A feed aggregator is another term for newsreader.
fisk: One of most peculiar blogging terms, to fisk is to deconstruct (usually
with some viciousness) an article or blog post written by somebody else.
Fisking involves quoting the target piece point by point and refuting each
point. Dogmatic as it is, fisking is a common blogging style.
flame: Throughout the Internet, a flame is an argument that has turned per-
sonal. Flaming is intended to wound with words and can be found in Usenet
newsgroups, Web-based message boards, and any other discussion environ-
ment (such as blog comments and TrackBacks).
group blog: Group blogs are written by teams of bloggers. Some of the most
influential blogs are team efforts.
hit: When a piece of Web content is viewed, that instance is called a hit. Any
sort of Web page can be hit, including a blog index page or entry page.
Likewise, an RSS feed is hit when it is accessed and viewed. Hits are mea-
sured by traffic logs to determine the size of a blog’s readership.
344
Blogging For Dummies 

hitnosis: The sad condition of obsessively monitoring one’s traffic logs is
called hitnosis. This entranced state often results from a spike in traffic
coming from a citation in a popular blog or being added to a prominent
blogroll.
HTML: An acronym for HyperText Markup Language, HTML is the computer
code underlying all Web pages. It is necessary to know HTML for the self-
installed blog programs discussed in this book and useful to know for some
of the hosted options. Casual bloggers working in write-and-click blogging
services can safely ignore HTML.
index page: The home page of a blog, the index page contains recently
posted entries, with the most recent entry at the top of the page.
instalanche: An effect similar to being slashdotted, an instalanche occurs
when a blog post is cited by Instapundit (www.instapundit.com), one of
the most influential of blogs. The resulting tidal wave of traffic to the cited
blog can sometimes overwhelm that site’s server.
journal blog: A journal blog is a personal, diary-style blog.
link love: Link love is a friendly link from one blog to another. Links drive
traffic, and most bloggers desire traffic, so incoming links are loved.
log: A measurement of a blog’s readership. See traffic log.
macrologue: A term I coined for this book, the macrologue is the global con-
versation woven into the blogosphere through comments, TrackBacks, and
links embedded into entries. Primarily a feature of topical discussion blogs,
the macrologue furthers discourse spread out over many blogs around the
world.
meme: A somewhat overused term that causes some bloggers to roll their
eyes, a meme is an idea or a set of arguments that has attained a life of its
own through widespread discussion.
metablogging: This term sounds like a gigantic blog, but its meaning is differ-
ent and self-referring. A metablog is simply a blog about blogs and blogging.
moblog: A blog run by mobs? Nope; it’s a mobile blog. Moblogs contain con-
tent sent from remote locations using portable computing devices such as
Internet-enabled cell phones.
MSM: This acronym stands for mainstream media, and is often used scorn-
fully by bloggers who regard blogging as superior to traditional journalism
publishing. This attitude regards mainstream media as slow and insular com-
pared to the quick and disclosing culture of blogging.
345
Glossary

news blog: A news blog is a general term for a blog that revolves, in some
way, around news stories. General news blogs cover current events broadly,
but more commonly a news blog focuses on some aspect of daily events such
as politics.
newsreader: In a generic sense, newsreaders are programs that display news
articles in original or summary form. In the context of blogging, a newsreader
is a specialized site or desktop program that lists and displays syndication
feeds chosen by the user. Most blogs offer their content outside the Web site
by means of a feed, the most common format for which is RSS. Newsreaders
are sometimes called RSS aggregators. (See Chapter 13.)
old media: A somewhat (but not necessarily) disrespectful term, old media
refers to newspapers, magazines, and other printed media that make up the
MSM (mainstream media). More generally, an old medium is any genre of cul-
ture that has been supplanted, or will soon be supplanted, by a new format.
partial entry: On a blog index page, partial entries can be used to save
space. Readers can click through to an archived page that contains the full
entry. In an RSS feed, a partial entry likewise saves space and encourages
readers to click through to the site, where they can read the full entry.
permalink: A blog entry’s permalink is the index page link to its permanent
page in the blog. Putting the permalink below each blog entry on the index
page makes it easy for visitors to copy the permalink’s URL and cite the entry
in another blog.
photoblogging: Photoblogging refers to posting a digital photo in a blog.
Serious photobloggers operate blogs with no text entries — just pictures.
Casual photoblogging produces a mix of written and photo entries and often
includes photo displays in the sidebar. Photo albums are often attached to
photoblogs.
ping: When two Internet locations communicate with each other, they are
said to ping each other. The word is especially used in the context of
TrackBacks, which use pings to complete the two-way link. (See Chapter 3.)
podcast: A podcast is simply a series of audio programs recorded in the MP3
file format and distributed in a blog and an RSS feed. Their name derives from
the iPod, the most popular MP3 player, but they can be heard through any
portable player and through any desktop audio program that plays MP3s.
There is nothing new about MP3 programs. Podcasts have become so popu-
lar due to their distribution mechanism that they are really more part of the
RSS revolution than the blogging revolution. That said, it’s worth noting that
the RSS revolution is dependent on the blog revolution. Anyway, podcasts
and blogs are closely related.
post: Both a verb and a noun, a blogger can actually post a post. As a verb,
bloggers post entries. As a noun, bloggers put their posts in their blogs.
346
Blogging For Dummies 

reciprocal link: When two bloggers agree to add each other’s blogs to their
blogrolls, the links are called reciprocal links.
referral log: Part of a site’s traffic log, the referral log shows where a site’s
visitors came from. The referral log, when available, is useful to bloggers who
want to know which sites are linking to them most effectively. If, for example,
a blog’s traffic leaped upward, the referral log could show that an influential
site linked to a blog entry, giving it an unusual amount of visibility and send-
ing lots of traffic.
RSS: An acronym that stands for both Really Simple Syndication and Rich Site
Summary, RSS is a type of syndication feed. As a generic term, RSS represents
all feed formats.
RSS aggregator: Another name for a newsreader.
sidebar: Located on the left or right side of a blog’s index page (and some-
times replicated on every page in the blog), the sidebar can contain links to
archived entries, a blogroll, photos, lists of many kinds, and other content
that relates to and enhances the blog.
slashdotted: In an effect similar to an instalanche, a citation from the hugely
influential site Slashdot (www.slashdot.com) sends so much traffic to the
cited blog that its server can become disabled. This phenomenon is also
known as the slashdot effect.
spam: Generally, spam is advertising deposited inappropriately and unwant-
edly. In a blog, spam can be found in comments and TrackBacks. Spam is
increasingly a problem for bloggers, causing some popular blogs to remove
their comment and TrackBack sections.
spamblog: A scourge of the blogosphere, spamblogs are generated automati-
cally, contain no useful or hand-written content, contain mostly (or exclu-
sively) links, and are intended to manipulate search results at major search
engines. These engines rank Web sites partly by the number of incoming
links, so shady Web marketers set up spamblogs containing hundreds of links
to their sites. In theory, the search engines count all those links and rank the
target sites higher in search results. In fact, search engines are more sophisti-
cated than that, and spamblogs are of questionable value.
splog: Another word for Spamblog.
syndication: Syndication is a method of distributing blog entries beyond the
blog site, primarily to newsreaders. Crucial to the syndication mechanism are
RSS and Atom, two syndication formats. Both these formats create feeds,
which are text-only displays of blog entries. Newsreaders organize these feeds
and display them, allowing their users to gather their favorite blog content in
one window.
347
Glossary

template: A template is a set of design elements replicated throughout a blog.
Templates can determine the blog’s appearance (the color scheme) and
layout (number and placement of sidebars).
theme: In some blog services, themes are identical to templates. More specif-
ically (in TypePad, for example), a blog theme can refer only to the site’s
color scheme and does not affect page layout.
thread: A thread is an online discussion. In the context of blogging, a thread
is a series of comments on an entry page.
TrackBack: A remote-comment system used by some blogging programs and
services, TrackBack enables one blogger to deposit a link to his or her blog
on another blogger’s entry page. (See Chapter 3 for a detailed clarification.)
TrackBacks represent an important part of the conversational aspect of the
blogosphere, but their use is hampered by blog services that don’t support
TrackBacks and also by widespread confusion about how they work.
TrackBack spam: Irrelevant and commercial messages deposited on blogs as
TrackBacks.
traffic: Blog traffic is blog readership. Every visitor to a blog is counted by
that site’s measuring tools as a hit, the smallest increment of Web traffic. RSS
feed readers also count in a blog’s traffic.
traffic log: In any Web site, blogs included, the traffic log measures how
many people visit the site and where they came from (the site from which
they linked to the blog). Many other measurements can be included in a traf-
fic log, such as the type of browser used by the visitor, how long that person
stayed in the site, and which pages were viewed. These statistics are typi-
cally aggregated and displayed in graph or chart format.
vlog: A vlog is a video blog. At this writing, the vlogosphere (to coin a term)
is small but growing, with some observers claiming that vlogs will overtake
podcasts.
Weblog: The formal name of which blog is a contraction.
XML: An acronym for eXtensible Markup Language, XML is the underlying
language of RSS, a standard syndication format.
