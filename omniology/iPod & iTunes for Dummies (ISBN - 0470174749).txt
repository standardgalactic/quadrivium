Dedication
This book is dedicated to John and Jimi (the Bove Brothers) for contributing
tips and spending considerable time testing iPods.
Author’s Acknowledgments
I want to thank John Paul and Jimi for providing technical expertise and per-
forming valuable testing. I also want to thank Rich Tennant for his wonderful
cartoons, and Dennis Cohen for technical expertise. And let me not forget my
Wiley editors Christopher Morris, Teresa Artman, and Brian Walls for ongoing
assistance that made my job so much easier. A book this timely places a con-
siderable burden on a publisher’s production team, and I thank the produc-
tion crew at Wiley for diligence beyond the call of reason.
I owe thanks and a happy hour or three to Carole McLendon at Waterside,
my agent. And I have acquisitions editor Bob Woerner at Wiley to thank for
coming up with the idea for this book and helping me to become a profes-
sional dummy — that is, a Dummies author.
Finally, my heartfelt thanks to members of the Flying Other Brothers (Pete
Sears, Barry Sless, Jimmy Sanchez, Bill Bennett, Bert Keely, TBone, Roger and
Ann McNamee, and G.E. Smith) for the music that inspired me while writing
this book.

iPod & iTunes For Dummies, 5th Edition 

Introduction
You don’t need much imagination to see why so many people are so
happy with their iPods, or why more than 100 million iPods have been
sold as of this writing . . . or why millions of iPhones will also be in circulation
by the time you read this.
Imagine no longer needing CDs. You can grab an iPod for a hike or jog and
always listen to something different. You can take road trips that last for
weeks and never hear the same song twice. Best of all, you can leave your
music library safely at home.
Imagine no longer needing DVDs (or, heaven forbid, ancient VHS cassettes).
You can take your favorite movies and TV shows with you on the road and
watch them on your iPod or connect your iPod to a television to see your
programs on a larger screen. The iPod is a convenient video player that holds
up to 150 hours of video, which represents many more DVDs than you would
probably want to carry with you on the road.
Imagine not waiting for hot new music or a hot TV show. You can be the first
in your circle of friends to experience the exclusive new music and videos
available from the iTunes Store by purchasing the content and loading it onto
your iPod within minutes of discovering it on the Internet.
Imagine not having to buy music and videos more than once — never again
having to replace an unplayable CD or DVD. You can purchase a CD or down-
loadable music and import the music into a digital library that lasts forever.
You can also purchase a movie or TV show, or convert your favorite videos,
and add them to your everlasting library.
Imagine a musician going backstage after a performance and meeting a 
promoter who says that he can get him ten more gigs if he can confirm the
dates right now. This musician calmly scrolls through his calendar for the
entire year (conveniently stored on his iPod), finding all the details that he
needs about gigs and recording sessions, right down to the minute, including
travel directions to each venue. “No problem,” he says. And of course, he
gets the gigs.
Okay, maybe you’re not a rock star whose career depends on the information
on your iPod or iPhone. But if rock stars can use them, so can average music
lovers.
When we first encountered the iPod, it came very close to fulfilling our
dreams as road warriors — in particular, the dream of filling up a car with
music as easily as filling it up with fuel. For example, we use iPods with our

2
iPod & iTunes For Dummies, 5th Edition 
cars using custom in-vehicle interface adapters with iPod connectors, or 
cassette adapters, or even FM radio transmitters (see Chapter 20). Whether
you want to be On the Road with Jack Kerouac (in audio book form) or
“Drivin’ South” with Jimi Hendrix, just fill up your iPod and go!
iTunes was originally developed by Jeff Robbin and Bill Kincaid as an MP3
player called SoundJam MP, and released by Casady & Greene in 1999. It was
purchased by Apple in 2000 and redesigned and released as iTunes. And
speaking of mobile, versions of iTunes have been developed for mobile
phones, such as the Motorola ROKR, Motorola RAZR, and Motorola SLVR.
iTunes version 7.4, the current version as of this writing, packs in a lot more
features. Apple released version 7.0 in September 2006. When the gapless
playback feature wasn’t quite working right (among other things), Apple
updated the program; version 7.0.2 arrived in November 2006. In March 2007,
Apple updated the program to version 7.1, providing support for Apple TV
and offering a full-screen option for the Cover Flow cover browser, as well as
improved sorting options to let you decide how iTunes handles your favorite
artists, albums, and songs. Apple also released QuickTime 7.1.5, delivering
numerous bug fixes and addressing critical security issues. Then in March
2007, Apple fixed a few more bugs and released version 7.1.1 of iTunes. On
May 30, 2007, Apple released version 7.2 and QuickTime Security Update 7.1.6
in order to provide support for purchasing higher-quality audio tracks with-
out the Digital Rights Management (DRM) copy protection. Since then, as
everybody knows, Apple introduced the iPhone on June 29, 2007, and newer
versions of iTunes (now up to version 7.4) and QuickTime (version 7.2).
Do you need these new features, such as gapless playback? Of course, you
do: Concert CDs and albums such as The Beatles’ Sgt. Pepper’s Lonely Hearts
Club Band should be played in a seamless fashion. The tracks are separate,
but the end of one song merges into the beginning of the next song. With 
similar albums, you probably don’t want an annoying gap between the songs
after ripping the CD into iTunes, so you can now set the Gapless Album
option. iTunes is getting better all the time.
Gapless playback is one of many new features in iTunes that can improve
your music library and your iPod or iPhone experience. You can also manage
multiple iTunes libraries, which makes it much easier to keep multiple iPods
or iPhones synchronized to different libraries. All these important new 
features are covered in this book.
About This Book
We designed iPod & iTunes For Dummies, 5th Edition, as a reference. You can
easily find the information you need when you need it. We organized the infor-
mation so that you can read from beginning to end to find out how to use iTunes
and your iPod from scratch. But this book is also designed so that you can dive
in anywhere and begin reading the info you need to know for each task.

We don’t cover every detail of every function of the software, and we intention-
ally leave out some detail so that we don’t befuddle you with technospeak
when it’s not necessary. (Really, engineers can sometimes provide too many
obscure choices that no one ever uses; on the other hand, we did need gapless
playback.) We write brief but comprehensive descriptions and include lots of
cool tips on how to get the best results from using iTunes and your iPod.
If your PC is on the trailing edge rather than the leading edge, don’t worry —
you won’t miss out on the iPod revolution. True, if you don’t use Windows
2000 or Windows XP on your PC, you can’t use iTunes for Windows. However,
if you use Windows Me (Millennium Edition), you can use MusicMatch
Jukebox. Please note that if you’re using MusicMatch, you can find that 
content online on this book’s companion Web site.
At the time we wrote this book, we covered every iPod and iPhone available
and the latest version of iTunes. Although we do our best to keep up, Apple
occasionally slips in a new iPod model or new version of iTunes between
book editions. If you’ve bought a new iPod that’s not covered in the book 
or your version of iTunes looks a little different, be sure to check out the
companion Web site for updates on the latest releases from Apple.
Conventions Used in This Book
Like any book that covers computers and information technology, this book
uses certain conventions:
 Choosing from a menu: In iTunes, when you see “Choose iTunes➪
Preferences in iTunes,” you click iTunes on the toolbar and then 
choose Preferences from the iTunes menu.
With the iPod, when you see “Choose Extras➪Calendars from the iPod
main menu,” you highlight Extras in the main menu with the scroll
wheel, press the Select button to select Extras, and then highlight and
choose Calendars from the Extras menu.
 Clicking and dragging: When you see “Drag the song over the name of
the playlist,” we mean to click the song name, hold the mouse button
down, and then drag the song with the mouse over to the name of the
playlist before lifting your finger off the mouse button.
 Keyboard shortcuts: When you see Ô-I, press the Ô key on a Mac key-
board, along with the appropriate shortcut key. (In this case, press I,
which opens the Song Information window in iTunes.) In Windows, the
same keyboard shortcut is Ctrl-I (which means press the Ctrl key along
with the I key).
 Step lists: When you come across steps that you need to do in iTunes or
on the iPod, the action is in bold, and the explanatory part follows. If
you know what to do, read the action and skip the explanation. But 
if you need a little help along the way, check out the explanation.

Introduction

And Just Who Are You?
You don’t need to know anything about music or audio technology to discover
how to make the most of your iPod and the iTunes software that comes with
it. Although a course in music appreciation can’t hurt, the iPod is designed to
be useful even for air-guitar players who barely know the difference between
downloadable music and System of a Down. You don’t need any specialized
knowledge to have a lot of fun with your iPod and the iTunes software while
building up your digital music library.
However, we do make some honest assumptions about your computer skills:
 You know how to use Mac Finder or Windows Explorer. We assume
that you already know how to locate files and folders and that you can
copy files and folders from one hard drive to another on the computer 
of your choice: a Mac or a Windows PC.
 You know how to select menus and applications on a Mac or a Windows
PC. We assume that you already know how to choose an option from a
menu; how to find the Dock on a Mac to launch a Dock application (or use
the Start menu in Windows to launch an application); and how to launch
an application directly by double-clicking its icon.
For more information on these topics, see these excellent books, all by Wiley:
Mac OS X Tiger All-in-One Desk Reference For Dummies (Mark L. Chambers),
Windows Vista All-in-One Desk Reference For Dummies (Woody Leonhard), 
or Windows XP GigaBook For Dummies (Peter Weverka).
A Quick Peek Ahead
This book is organized into six parts, and each part covers a different aspect
of using your iPod. Here’s a quick preview of what you can find in each part.
Part I: Setting Up and Acquiring 
Media Content
This part gets you started with your iPod: powering it up, recharging its battery,
using its menus, and connecting it to your computer. You install and set up
iTunes on your Mac or your Windows PC. We show you what you can do 
with iTunes. To acquire music, you can buy music from the iTunes Store or rip
audio CDs. You can also find podcasts, audio books, movies, TV shows, and
music videos in the iTunes Store or import them into iTunes from other
sources. You can even play Web radio stations.
4
iPod & iTunes For Dummies, 5th Edition 

Part II: Managing Your Media Content
This part shows you how to sort the content in your iTunes library by artist,
album, duration, date, and other items. You can add and edit iTunes song
information. You discover how to arrange songs and albums into iTunes
playlists that you can transfer to your iPod. When you have your music, audio
books, podcasts, photos, movies, TV shows, and videos organized efficiently,
you can transfer them to the iPod. For your peace of mind, we also cover
backing up your content library, burning CDs, and printing CD, jewel case
inserts with the song information.
Part III: Playing Your iPod
We show you how to locate and play all types of content — music, audio
books, podcasts, movies, TV shows, and videos — on your iPod. We also
describe how to connect your iPod to your home stereo or speakers, and to a
television for a larger video picture. You then discover how to fine-tune the
sound playback in iTunes with the iTunes equalizer and on your iPod with the
iPod equalizer, and how to modify songs in iTunes for playback on your iPod.
Part IV: Using Advanced Techniques
In this part, you discover digital music encoding and how to change your
importing preferences to get the best results with digital audio compression.
We also focus on what you can do to improve the sound of your music with-
out sacrificing hard drive space.
Part V: Have iPod, Will Travel
This part covers how to use your iPod on the road with car stereos and
portable speakers. You find out all the techniques of an iPod road warrior:
setting your alarm clock, sorting your contacts, recording voice memos,
entering personal information into your computer (such as calendar appoint-
ments, To-Do lists, and contacts), and synchronizing your iPod with all your
personal information. We also provide initial troubleshooting steps and
details about updating and restoring your iPod.
Part VI: The Part of Tens
In this book’s Part of Tens chapters, we outline common problems and solutions
for most iPods and provide tips about the iPod equalizer.

T
he B-52’s sing, “Roam if you want to, roam around the world” through
your headphones as you take off. The flight is just long enough to watch
Tom Cruise in the movie Vanilla Sky and the “Mr. Monk and the Airplane”
episode from the first series of the Monk TV show, as well as catch up on the
latest episodes of The Daily Show with Jon Stewart and The Colbert Report. It’s
so easy to hold and watch your iPod that you don’t have to put it away when
your flight dinner arrives. You even have time to listen to the “NFL Rants and
Raves” podcast to catch up on American football.
As the plane lands, you momentarily forget where it is you’re going, so you
read your destination information on your iPod without even pausing the
podcast, and you queue up a playlist of songs to get you through the termi-
nal. If Chicago is your kind of town, you might choose Frank Sinatra. If you’re
in San Francisco, you might choose anything from Tony Bennett to the
Grateful Dead. You have so much content on your iPod (that you can select
and play so easily) that you probably could land anywhere in the world with
appropriate music in your ear and convenient eye candy in your hand.
iPods changed the way people play music on-the-run. Now, they’re changing
the way people play TV shows and videos. A full-size video iPod holds so
much music that no matter how large your music collection is, you’ll seri-
ously consider putting all your music into digital format on your computer,
transferring portions of it to an iPod, and playing music from both your com-
puter and your iPod from now on. And why wait for the best episodes of your
favorite TV shows to be broadcast, when you can download the shows any-
time you want and play them on a video iPod anywhere you want? Albums,
music videos, TV shows, and movies — you might never stop buying CDs and
DVDs, but you won’t have to buy all your content that way. And you’ll never
again need to replace the content that you already own.

As an iPod owner, you’re on the cutting edge of entertainment technology.
This chapter introduces iPods and tells you what to expect when you open
the box. We describe how to power up your iPod and connect it to your com-
puter, both of which are essential tasks that you need to know how to do —
your iPod needs power, and it needs audio and video, which it gets from your
computer.
Introducing iPods
An iPod is, essentially, a hard drive or flash memory drive as well as a digital
music and video player in one device. iPods are such a thing of beauty and
style — and so highly recognizable by now — that all Apple needs to do in an
advertisement is show one all by itself.
The convenience of carrying music on an iPod is phenomenal. For example,
the 160GB sixth-generation iPod Classic can hold around 40,000 songs. That’s
more than two months of nonstop music played around the clock — or about
two new songs per day for the next 54 years. And with iPod’s built-in skip pro-
tection in every model, you won’t miss a beat as you jog through the park or
when your car hits a pothole.
A common misconception is that your iPod becomes your music and video
library. Actually, your iPod is simply another player for your content library,
which is safely stored on your computer. One considerable benefit of using
your computer to organize your content is that you can make perfect-quality
copies of music, videos, movies, podcasts, and audio books. You can then
copy as much of the content as you want, in a more compressed format, onto
your iPod and take it on the road. Meanwhile, your perfect copies are stored
safely on your computer. Your favorite albums, audio books, TV shows,
movies, and podcast episodes can be copied over and over forever, just like
the rest of your information, and they never lose their quality. If you save
your content in digital format, you’ll never see your songs or videos degrade,
and you’ll never have to buy the content again.
The iPod experience includes iTunes (for Mac or Windows), which lets you
synchronize content with your iPod and other devices, such as the iPhone
and Apple TV. You also use it to organize your content, make copies, burn
CDs, and play disc jockey without discs. We introduce iTunes in Chapter 2.
Second-generation and third-generation iPod models can also be synchro-
nized with a Windows PC using MusicMatch Jukebox version 7.5, which was
provided on CD-ROM with some second-generation models before iTunes
became available for Windows. A newer version of this software, renamed
MusicMatch, does not work directly with iPods. If you’re using MusicMatch,
visit this book’s companion Web site to find out how to use MusicMatch.
10
Part I: Setting Up and Acquiring Media Content 

An iPod is also a data player, perhaps the first of its kind. As an external hard
drive, an iPod serves as a portable backup device for important data files.
You can transfer your calendar and address book to help manage your affairs
on the road, and you can even use calendar event alarms to supplement your
iPod’s alarm and sleep timer. You can keep your calendar and address book
automatically synchronized to your computer, where you normally add and
edit information. We cover using an iPod as a general-purpose hard drive in
Chapter 22 and using it to synchronize your computer’s calendar and contact
information in Chapter 23.
Comparing iPod Models
Introduced way back in the Stone Age of digital music (2001), the iPod family
has grown by six generations as of this writing, with custom versions for the
band U2 and offshoots such as the popular iPod nano and the tiny $79 iPod
shuffle that lets you wear up to 240 songs on your sleeve. Apple has recently
introduced sixth-generation iPod models and the iPhone, combining iPod
capabilities with a cell phone and wireless PDA. Even from the beginning,
iPod models were truly innovative for their times. With the MP3 music play-
ers of 2001, you could carry about 20 typical songs (or a single live Phish set)
with you, but the first iPods could hold more than 1,000 typical songs (or a
50-hour Phish concert).
Earlier-generation iPods
Today’s iPod models and iPhone work with iTunes on either Windows com-
puters or Macs, but that wasn’t always the case. The first-generation iPods
worked only with Macs. In 2002, Apple introduced the second generation —
one version for Windows and another for the Mac, using the same design for
both. For the third generation (2003), Apple changed the design once again.
Third-, fourth-, fifth- and sixth-generation iPods — as well as offshoots, such
as iPod mini, iPod nano, and iPod shuffle — work with either Windows or
Mac and come in a variety of hard drive or flash memory sizes. One way to
tell what kind of iPod you have is by its navigational controls. By design, you
can hold an iPod in your hand while you thumb the scroll wheel (our generic
term for scroll wheel, scroll pad, touch wheel, or click wheel). The LCD
screen on full-size models offers backlighting so that you can see it in the
dark. The iPhone and sixth-generation iPod Touch let you tap the sensitive
display with your finger to select items and functions, and flick with your
finger to scroll or move the display.

Chapter 1: Firing Up Your iPod

To learn more about previous generations of iPods, including detailed infor-
mation about cables and connections, visit this book’s companion Web site.
For a nifty chart that shows the differences between iPod models, see the
Identifying Different iPod Models page on the Apple iPod Web site (http://
docs.info.apple.com/article.html?artnum=61688).
Sixth-generation iPods
Apple shook the world once again in late 2007 by introducing a new genera-
tion of iPod models (see Figure 1-1) with attractive enclosures and easier-to-
use controls. 
The sixth-generation iPod models include:
 The iPod touch: This spectacular model, which shares the design char-
acteristics and many of the features of the iPhone, offers a touch-sensi-
tive display and Wi-Fi Internet connectivity so that you can purchase
music directly from your iPod and surf the Web. (Wi-Fi, which is short
for wireless fidelity, is a popular connection method for local area net-
works; you can set up your home or office with Wi-Fi using an inexpen-
sive Wi-Fi hub such as Apple’s AirPort Extreme.) 
Figure 1-1:

12
Part I: Setting Up and Acquiring Media Content 

 The iPod classic: The original iPod design is now slimmer and offers
more capacity and longer battery life than previous generations, with
80GB and 160GB models.
 The iPod nano ( “the fatty”): The new fatter, shorter iPod nano now
plays video as well as music, podcasts, and audio books. 
 The iPod shuffle: The tiniest iPod now comes in a variety of colors.
You can put videos on your iPhone or sixth-generation iPod classic or nano
models by using iTunes. You can even get some of your favorite TV shows,
plus music videos and full-length movies, directly from the iTunes Store. The
color display provides crisp definition for the iPod’s menus, making them
easier to read, even in sunlight. 
Like third-, fourth-, and fifth-generation iPods, the sixth generation also uses
a dock adapter cable to connect the iPod or iPhone to a computer or power
supply. You can also use an Apple or third-party dock with your iPod, and use
the dock adapter cable to connect the dock to your computer or power
supply. The dock keeps your iPod in an upright position while connected and
lets you connect a home stereo or headphones. This makes the dock conve-
nient as a base station when you’re not traveling with your iPod because you
can slip the iPod into the dock without connecting cables. You can pick one
up at an Apple Store or order one online, or take advantage of third-party
dock offerings.
Fingering the iPod touch
The iPod touch, like the iPhone, lets you access the Web over a Wi-Fi Internet
connection. You can use the built-in Safari Web browser to interact with Web
services and applications, and the built-in YouTube application to play
videos. Safari even displays a virtual keyboard for typing login entries, pass-
words, and text of any kind, including numbers and punctuation symbols.
The innovative touch-sensitive display provides a rich set of navigation con-
trols and menus controlled by software. You can use the Cover Browser with
your finger to browse your music and video collection. You can even access
the iTunes Store directly from your iPod touch and purchase content.
Less than a third of an inch thick and weighing only 4.2 ounces, the iPod
touch is slightly smaller than an iPhone and offers the same single menu
button on the front. Apple offers 8GB and 16GB models as of this writing. The
8GB model holds about 1,750 songs, 10,000 photos, or about 10 hours of
video. The 16GB model holds about 3,500 songs, 20,000 photos, or about 20
hours of video. Both models use the same battery that offers up to 22 hours
of music playback, or 5 hours of video playback.
13
Chapter 1: Firing Up Your iPod

Twirling the iPod classics
Sixth-generation iPod classic models use the same click wheel and buttons as
the fifth-generation models, combining the scroll wheel with pressure-sensi-
tive buttons underneath the top, bottom, left, and right areas of the circular
pad of the wheel. As of this writing, Apple provides a slim, 4.9-ounce 80GB
model and a 5.7-ounce 160GB model.
The 80GB model holds about 20,000 songs or about 100 hours of video, and
its battery offers up to 30 hours of music playback, or 5 hours of video play-
back. The 160GB model holds about 40,000 songs or about 200 hours of
video, and its battery offers up to 40 hours of music playback, or 7 hours of
video playback. Both models hold up to 25,000 photos.
Mano a mano with iPod nano
Nicknamed “the fatty” by Apple fans, the new iPod nano, pencil thin and a
little over two inches wide by less than three inches high, weighs only 1.74
ounces but packs a punch: video. This mini marvel offers a 2-inch color LCD
display that crisply displays video, iPod menus and album artwork. Apple
offers a 4GB model that holds about 1,000 songs, and an 8GB model that
holds about 2,000 songs. (See Figure 1-2.)
Each model offers a battery that can play up to 24 hours of music — all day
and all of the night — or 5 hours of video.
Figure 1-2:

the smallest

Part I: Setting Up and Acquiring Media Content 

The iPod nano is the smallest iPod that can serve up videos, podcasts,
photos, and musical slideshows as well as your personal calendar and con-
tacts. Unlike the smaller iPod shuffle, iPod nano is a full-featured iPod with
loads of accessories tailored specifically for it.
iPod nano uses the same style of click wheel and buttons as the sixth-
generation iPod classic models. Like other sixth-generation iPods, iPod nano
uses a dock adapter cable to connect to a computer or power supply. A vari-
ety of docks for the iPod nano are available from Apple and other companies.
Doing the iPod shuffle
If the regular iPod models aren’t small enough to fit into your lifestyle, try
iPod shuffle. The 0.55-ounce iPod shuffle, as shown in Figure 1-3, is shaped
like a money clip and is about the same size — 1.07 x1.62 inches with a depth
of 0.41 inch. In several different flashy colors and convenient for clipping to
just about anything, the iPod shuffle is fast becoming a fashion statement.
However, the current iPod shuffle that clips to your clothing is not the first
iPod that you could wear. That honor belongs to the original iPod shuffle,
which is 3.3 inches long, less than 1 inch wide, and about one-third of an inch
thick. It weighs only 0.78 ounce, which is little more than a car key or a pack
of gum. You can hang it from your ears with the supplied earbuds and wear it
around your neck like a necklace. You can still find them for sale in retail out-
lets and used ones on eBay, but Apple replaced the original with the much
smaller clip-on model.
iPod shuffle models have no display, but that’s actually a good thing because
this design keeps the size and weight down to a minimum, and you don’t
need a display to play a couple hundred songs in random or sequential order.
You can also use your iPod shuffle to hold data files, just like an external flash
memory drive.
The 1GB iPod shuffle holds about 240 songs. The older iPod shuffle, at 512MB,
holds 120 songs, assuming an average of 4 minutes per song, using the AAC
format at the High Quality setting (as described in Chapter 18). Remember,
iPod shuffle is not meant to store music permanently. Instead, you use it just
to play selections from your iTunes library on your computer.
With skip-free playback, lightweight design, and no need for a display, you
can easily use it while skiing, snowboarding, or even skydiving. That’s
because it uses flash memory rather than a hard drive: You can shake it as
hard as you want without a glitch. An iPod shuffle battery offers up to 12
hours of power between charges.
15
Chapter 1: Firing Up Your iPod

Unlike other iPods, iPod shuffle can’t play tunes in the highest-quality Audio
Interchange File Format (AIFF) or Apple Lossless formats, which consume a
lot of storage space. See Chapter 18 for more details on encoding formats.
The current iPod shuffle models built to resemble a money clip connect to
power and to your computer by using a special mini-dock supplied in the
box. The mini-dock includes a cable that links your iPod shuffle to a com-
puter or to an optional power supply and supplies power for recharging its
battery. You don’t need a separate cable. iPod shuffle charges its battery
from your computer, so you don’t need the optional power supply. You can
also get the optional $29 iPod shuffle External Battery Pack, which provides
20 additional hours of playtime with two AAA batteries.
The all-in-one iPhone
When Apple introduced the iPhone on June 29, 2007, lines formed around
the block at the New York and San Francisco stores as eager early adopters

bought out all inventories. Hold one in your hands and you’ll understand
why: the innovative touch-sensitive display provides a rich set of navigation
controls and menus, as shown in Figure 1-4, controlled by software — includ-
ing a full keyboard for entering text, numbers, and special symbols. This
iPod can not only phone home; it can monitor all your e-mail and browse the
Internet with full page display, utilizing a Wi-Fi network when it senses one.

Chapter 1: Firing Up Your iPod

The iPhone comes in 4G ($499) or 8G ($599) models and incorporates flash
memory just like an iPod touch, iPod shuffle or iPod nano. Its 3.5-inch,
widescreen multi-touch display offers 480-by-320–pixel resolution at 160 dots
per inch for crisp video pictures, and it can display multiple languages and
characters simultaneously. The iPhone’s built-in rechargeable lithium ion bat-
tery offers up to 8 hours of talk time (250 hours on standby), up to six hours
browsing the Internet or seven hours playing video, and up to 24 hours play-
ing music. It also offers Bluetooth for using wireless headphones and micro-
phones. And the iPhone is no slouch when it comes to acting like an iPod: It
can play music, audio books, videos (such as TV shows, music videos, and
even feature-length movies), and even podcasts. You can also display photos
and slideshows set to music.
Thinking inside the Box
Don’t destroy the elegantly designed box while opening it; you might want to
place it prominently in your collection of Technology That Ushered in the
21st Century. Before going any further, check the box and make sure that all
the correct parts came with your iPod or iPhone. Keep the box in case,
heaven forbid, you need to return the iPod or iPhone to Apple — the box
ensures that you can safely return it for a new battery or replacement.
The sixth-generation iPod classic box includes earphones and a USB dock
adapter cable that can connect either the iPod or a dock to a computer or
power adapter. You can get accessories, including Apple’s Universal Dock and
an AC power adapter, separately. For example, the iPod AV Connection Kit
offers the adapter, AV cables, Apple Remote, and the Universal Dock with
adapters for all models.
The accessories don’t stop there. Docks of various sizes, shapes, and func-
tions are available from vendors, such as Belkin, Monster, and Griffin and
some docks are combined with home speaker systems. You might also want a
carrying case and some other goodies, many of which are describe in this
book. They are available at the online Apple Store (www.apple.com/store).
You also need a few things that don’t come with the iPod:
 A PC or Mac to run iTunes: On a PC, iTunes version 7.4 requires
Windows XP (with Service Pack 2 to support Apple TV and the iPhone),
or 32-bit editions of Windows Vista, running on a 500 MHz Pentium-class
processor or faster, and a minimum of 256MB. If you intend to watch
video, you need at least a 2.0 GHz Pentium-class processor or faster, and
at least 512MB of RAM and 32MB of video RAM.
18
Part I: Setting Up and Acquiring Media Content 

With a Mac, iTunes version 7.4 requires Mac OS X 10.3.9 or newer or Mac
OS X 10.4.7 or newer (version 10.4.10 or newer required for iPhone), a
500 MHz G3 processor or better; and at least 256MB of RAM. If you
intend to watch video, you need a 1GHz G4 processor or better, and
16MB of video RAM.
 USB connection: PCs must have USB 2.0 (also called a high-powered
USB) for fifth-generation iPods and iPod nano. However, you can use
FireWire (IEEE 1394) with older iPod models. All current-model Macs
provide USB 2.0, and all Macs provide FireWire.
For details about using USB or FireWire cables, visit this book’s compan-
ion Web site.
 Internet connection: Apple recommends a broadband Internet connec-
tion to buy content and stream previews from the iTunes Store, although
it is possible with a dial-up connection. At minimum, you need some
kind of Internet connection to download iTunes itself.
 CD-R or DVD-R drive: Without a disc burner, you can’t burn your own
discs. On a PC, you need a CD-R or DVD-R drive. On a Mac, you need a
Combo or Super Drive to burn your own discs.
 iTunes: Make sure you have the current version of iTunes — use the
automatic update feature, which we describe in Chapter 2. You can
also download iTunes for Windows or the Mac from the Apple site
(www.apple.com/itunes/download); it’s free. See Chapter 2 for
instructions.
Older models, still available in stores and online, might include versions
of iTunes as old as version 4.5, which is fine because version 4.5 works.
(It just doesn’t have all the features of 7.4.) You can download a newer
version at any time to replace it.
 QuickTime: QuickTime (required for video) comes with iTunes. The
iTunes installer for the PC installs the newest version of QuickTime for
Windows (version 7.2 as of this writing), replacing any older version you
might have. Macs have QuickTime preinstalled (version 7.2 as of this
writing), and Mac OS X automatically updates QuickTime if you use the
Software Update feature of System Preferences in the Apple menu.
Powering Up Your iPod
All iPods come with essentially the same requirement: power. Fortunately,
each iPod also comes with a battery and a way of charging it, either directly
from your computer or by using a cable and an AC power adapter that works
with voltages in North America and many parts of Europe and Asia. (See
Chapter 20 for information about plugging into power in other countries.)
19
Chapter 1: Firing Up Your iPod

Fifth- and sixth-generation iPod models (including the iPod touch) and the
iPhone — as well as iPod nano, iPod mini, and third- and fourth-generation
iPods — offer a dock connection. You can connect these models to a dock
that offers USB 2.0 connections for power and synchronizing (or FireWire for
third-generation models). Docks for full-size iPods can also connect to your
home stereo through a line-out connection.
Sixth-generation iPods and iPod nanos are supplied with a cable that has a
USB connector on one end and a flat dock connector on the other end to con-
nect to a dock or to an iPod itself. You can connect the USB end to either the
Apple power supply or the computer’s USB 2.0 port. The iPhone is also sup-
plied with a USB cable for connecting the iPhone or its dock to your com-
puter or to the power supply.
The connection on the bottom of the iPod or iPhone is the same as the con-
nection on the back of the iPod or iPhone dock. To connect your iPod or
iPhone to your computer, plug the flat connector of the cable into the device
or dock (press the buttons on both sides of the flat connector to fit it snugly
into the connection), and then plug the USB connector on the other end into
the USB port on your computer. (Press the same buttons on both sides of the
flat connector to disconnect it.)
Most PCs already have USB 2.0, which is all you need to provide power to
your sixth-generation iPod, iPod shuffle, or iPod nano, and to synchronize it
with your PC. Although you can use a low-powered USB 1.0 or 1.1 connection,
it doesn’t supply power to most iPod models.
Fifth- and sixth-generation models and iPod nano can use FireWire connec-
tions to charge their batteries but not for synchronizing with a computer.
Fifth- and sixth-generation iPods, iPod nano, and iPod shuffle models use USB
to connect to the computer and synchronize content, not FireWire. The iPod
shuffle is supplied with a mini-dock with a USB cable attached and draws
power from the USB port on the computer or from a USB power adapter.
An older USB 1.0 or 1.1 port works for synchronizing your iPod, but it doesn’t
provide power to the iPod. If all you have is an older USB port, you can use it
to synchronize your fifth- or sixth-generation iPod or iPod nano, and then use
a FireWire cable (available from the Apple Store) to provide power by con-
necting it to a FireWire-compatible AC power adapter.
Don’t use another USB device in a chain and don’t use a USB 2.0 hub to con-
nect your iPod unless the hub is a powered hub. Note that a USB keyboard
typically acts like a USB 1.1 hub, but it’s not powered, so it can’t provide
power to the iPod and might slow down performance.
20
Part I: Setting Up and Acquiring Media Content 

A FireWire or USB connection to a Mac provides power to an iPod and
recharges the battery as long as the Mac isn’t in sleep mode. A FireWire
connection to a FireWire/IEEE 1394 card in a PC might not be able to provide
power; to be safe, check with the card manufacturer. The smaller four-pin con-
nections for FireWire/IEEE 1394 cards typically don’t supply power to an iPod.
If your iPod shows a display but doesn’t respond to your touch, don’t panic.
Just check the Hold switch on top or bottom of the unit and make sure that
it’s set to one side so that the orange bar disappears (the normal position).
You use the Hold switch for locking the buttons, which prevents accidental
activation.
You might notice that your iPod’s display turns iridescent when it gets too
hot or too cold, but this effect disappears when its temperature returns to
normal. iPods can function in temperatures as cold as 50 degrees and as warm
as 95° F (Fahrenheit) but work best at room temperature (closer to 68° F).
If you leave your iPod out in the cold all night, it might have trouble waking
from sleep mode, and it might even display a low-battery message. Plug the
iPod into a power source, wait until it warms up, and try it again. If it still
doesn’t wake up or respond properly, try resetting the iPod as we describe in
Chapter 24.
Facing Charges of Battery
You can take a six-hour flight from New York City to California and listen to
your iPod the entire time — and with some models, listen all the way back on
the return flight — without recharging. All iPod models use the same type of
built-in, rechargeable lithium ion (Li-Ion) battery with the following power
specs:
 The first-, second-, and third-generation iPod models offer up to 8 hours
of battery power.
 The fourth-generation models and the iPod shuffle offer up to 12 hours.
 iPod mini offers up to 18 hours.
 The color-display fourth-generation models offer 15 hours of music play-
ing time or 5 hours of photo display with music.
 The fifth-generation iPod models offer between 14 and 20 hours of music
playing time, between 3 and 6 hours of video playing time, or between 4
and 6 hours of photo display with music.
 The iPod nano offers 24 hours of music playing time or 5 hours of video
or photo display with music. (Older models offered 14 hours of music
and 4 hours of photo display with music.)
21
Chapter 1: Firing Up Your iPod

 The sixth-generation iPod classic 80GB model offers 30 hours of music
playback or 5 hours of video or photo display with music. The 160GB
model offers 40 hours of music playback or 7 hours of video or photo
display with music. 
 The iPod touch offers 22 hours of music playing time or 5 hours of video
or photo display with music.
 The iPhone models offer up to 24 hours of music playing time, 7 hours of
video playing time, or between 4 and 6 hours of photo display with music.
However, keep in mind that playback battery time varies with the type of
encoder that you use for the music files in iTunes. (Chapter 18 has more
information about encoders.) It also varies depending on how you use your
iPod or iPhone controls and settings.
The iPod or iPhone battery recharges automatically when you connect it to a
power source. For example, it starts charging immediately when you insert it
into a dock that’s connected to a power source (or to a computer with a pow-
ered FireWire or USB connection). It takes only four hours to recharge the
battery fully for all models, and only three hours for an iPod nano.
Need power when you’re on the run? Look for a power outlet in the airport
terminal or hotel lobby — the battery fast-charges to 80-percent capacity in
1.5 hours. After the first hour and a half, the battery receives a trickle charge
for the next hour and a half, until fully charged.
Don’t fry your iPod or iPhone with some generic power adapter. Use only the
power adapter from Apple or a certified iPod adapter, such as the power
accessories from Belkin, Griffin, Monster, XtremeMac, and other vendors.
A battery icon with a progress bar in the top-right corner of the iPod or
iPhone display indicates how much power is left. When you charge the bat-
tery, the icon turns into a lightning bolt inside a battery. If the icon doesn’t
animate, the battery is fully charged. You can also use your iPod or iPhone
while the battery is charging or disconnect it and use it before the battery is
fully charged.
To check the battery status of an iPod shuffle, press the battery status button
on the back (the long button above the Apple logo and below the position
switch for setting the iPod shuffle to shuffle songs or play them in order). If
the battery status light is
 Green: The iPod shuffle is fully charged.
 Yellow: The charge is low.
 Red: Very little charge is left, and you need to recharge it.
If no light is visible, the iPod shuffle is completely out of power, and you need
to recharge it to use it.

Part I: Setting Up and Acquiring Media Content 

Maintaining battery life
The iPod or iPhone built-in, rechargeable battery is, essentially, a life-or-
death proposition. After it’s dead, it can be replaced, but Apple charges a
replacement fee of $59 plus shipping. Some services may charge less, espe-
cially for older iPod models. If your warranty is still active, you should have
Apple replace it under the warranty program (which may cost nothing except
perhaps shipping). Don’t try to replace it yourself because opening your iPod
or iPhone invalidates the warranty. If your warranty is no longer active, com-
pare Apple’s prices and service to others — we have had very good (if more
expensive) experiences with Apple’s services.
Fortunately, the battery is easy to maintain. We recommend calibrating the
battery once soon after you get your iPod or iPhone; that is, run it all the way
down (a full discharge) and then charge it all the way up (which takes four
hours). Although this doesn’t actually change battery performance, it does
improve the battery gauge so that the gauge displays a more accurate reading.
Unlike nickel-based batteries that require you to fully discharge and then
recharge in order to get a fuller capacity, an iPod or iPhone battery prefers a
partial rather than a full discharge, so avoid frequent full discharges after the
initial calibration. (Frequent full discharges can lower battery life.)
Lithium-ion batteries typically last three years or more and are vulnerable to
high temperatures, which decrease their life spans considerably. Don’t leave
your iPod or iPhone in a hot place, such as on a sunny car dashboard, for
very long.
For a complete description of how Apple’s batteries work, see the Apple
Lithium-ion Batteries page at www.apple.com/batteries.
The bottom of an iPod warms up when it’s powered on. The bottom functions
as a cooling surface that transfers heat from inside the unit to the cooler air
outside. An iPod’s carrying case acts as an insulator, so be sure to remove
the iPod from its carrying case before you recharge it.
Keeping an iPod in its carrying case when charging is tempting but also
potentially disastrous. An iPod needs to dissipate its heat, and you could
damage the unit by overheating it and frying its circuits, rendering it as useful
as a paperweight. To get around this problem, you can purchase one of the
heat-dissipating carrying cases available in the Apple Store. Alternatively,
MARWARE (www.marware.com) offers a variety of sporty cases for about
$30 to $40.
Even when not in use, your iPod drinks the juice. If your iPod is inactive for
14 days, you must recharge its battery. Perhaps the iPod gets depressed from
being left alone too long.
23
Chapter 1: Firing Up Your iPod

Saving power
iPod classic models include a hard drive, and whatever causes the hard drive
to spin causes a drain on power. Your iPod also has a cache — a memory chip
holding the section of music to play next. An iPod uses the cache not only to
eliminate skipping when something jostles the hard drive, but also to con-
serve power because the drive doesn’t have to spin as much.
If you use the AIFF or WAV formats for importing music into iTunes (or
MusicMatch Jukebox version 7.5): Don’t use these formats with your iPod.
Instead, convert the music first, as we describe in Chapter 19. These formats
take up way too much space on the iPod and fill up the iPod cache too quickly,
causing skips when you play them and using too much battery power because
the drive spins more often. (See Chapter 5 for bringing content into iTunes.
Chapter 18 provides detailed information about these encoding formats,
and Chapter 19 describes how to convert your music.)
The following are tips on saving power while using your iPod:
 Pause. Pause playback when you’re not listening. Pausing (stopping)
playback is the easiest way to conserve power.
 Back away from the light. Use the iPod backlight sparingly. Select
Backlight Timer from the iPod Settings menu to limit backlighting to a
number of seconds, or to Off, in the iPod’s Settings menu. (Choose
Settings from the main menu.) Don’t use the backlight in daylight if you
don’t need it.
 Hold it. Flip the Hold switch to the locked position (with the orange bar
showing) to make sure that controls aren’t accidentally activated. You
don’t want your iPod playing music in your pocket and draining the bat-
tery when you’re not listening.
 You may continue. Play songs continuously without using the iPod con-
trols. Selecting songs and using Previous/Rewind and Next/Fast-Forward
require precious energy. Not only that, but the hard drive has to spin
more often when searching for songs, using more power than during
continuous playback.
Always use the latest iPod software and update your software when updates
come out. Apple constantly tries to improve how your iPod works, and many
of these advancements relate to power usage.
Replacing your battery
Apple customers aren’t always happy campers. Early iPods came with batter-
ies that couldn’t be replaced, but all it took were a few premature battery
24
Part I: Setting Up and Acquiring Media Content 

failures and quite a few customer complaints for Apple to institute a battery-
replacement service. Apple also offers a special AppleCare warranty for
iPods and iPhones.
You shouldn’t try to remove or replace the iPod or iPhone internal battery
yourself — and certainly not if the iPod or iPhone is still under warranty
(because opening it breaks the warranty). You need Apple to replace it if it
dies while under warranty, or use Apple or another service to replace it if the
warranty period is over.
If your iPod or iPhone isn’t responding after a reset, follow the troubleshoot-
ing steps in Chapter 24. If these steps don’t restore your iPod or iPhone to
working condition, you might have a battery problem. Go to the Apple sup-
port page for the iPod (www.apple.com/support/ipod) or the iPhone
(www.apple.com/support/iphone) and click the Service FAQ link to read
frequently asked questions and answers about support. Then click the Battery
Service Request Form link on the support page and follow the instructions to
request service and return your iPod or iPhone for a replacement.
Thumbing through the iPod Menus
After you bring content into iTunes and synchronize your iPod, you’re ready
to play. The design of the iPod classic and iPod nano lets you hold the iPod in
one hand and perform simple operations by thumb. Even if you’re all thumbs
when pressing small buttons on tiny devices, you can still thumb your way to
iPod heaven. 
The iPod touch, like the iPhone, offers a multi-touch interface that lets you
tap your way into iPod heaven even faster. With an iPod touch, your fingers
do the walking. You can make gestures, such as flicking a finger to scroll a list
quickly, sliding your finger to scroll slowly or drag a slider (such as the
volume slider), pinching with two fingers to zoom out of a Web page in Safari,
or pulling apart with two fingers (also known as unpinching) to zoom in to the
page to see it more clearly.
Touching iPod touch and iPhone displays
The first button you see on an iPod touch or iPhone display (besides the time
of day and the date) is the message “slide to unlock” — slide your finger
across this message to unlock your iPod touch or iPhone.
25
Chapter 1: Firing Up Your iPod

Your content is now immediately available at the touch of a finger. The
iPhone provides an iPod button in the lower right corner of its main menu
(refer to Figure 1-4) to provide access to your content. The iPod touch pro-
vides Music, Videos and Photos buttons that appear along the bottom row of
the iPod touch main menu, as shown in Figure 1-5.
After touching a button on the iPod touch or iPhone display, a new page
appears with more selections you can touch. In fact, you can touch every
menu or button you see on the display. The iPod touch and iPhone run sepa-
rate applications (Safari, Contacts, Calendar, YouTube, and so on), and the
multi-touch interface changes for each application.
For example, touch the Music button to view a list of artists. After touching
Music, buttons appear along the bottom of the display that you can touch to
view a list of playlists, artists, songs, albums, and more. With a flick of your
finger you can scroll the list, and touch selections to view the albums of an
artist or the contents of an album or playlist. Touch any song to start playing
it, and control buttons appear to control playback: Previous/Rewind,
Play/Pause, Next/Fast-Forward, and a volume slider. All these buttons work
by touch, and the only hard button on the front of the iPod returns you to the
main menu.
The iPod touch and iPhone applications respond to gestures you make with
your fingers. For example, you make the following gestures to perform the fol-
lowing functions:
 Drag with finger: Scroll up or down lists slowly.
 Flick: Quickly scroll up or down lists.
 Tap an hold: While scrolling, tap and hold to stop the moving list.
 Flick from left to right (swipe): Change panes on the iPhone (Safari,
weather, iPod) and delete items (mail, SMS).
 Single tap: Select an item.
 Double tap: Zoom in or out with Safari and all other applications; zoom
in with Maps on the iPhone.
 Two-finger single tap: Zoom out (Maps on the iPhone only).
 Pinch: Zoom out of photos, Maps on the iPhone, and Safari Web pages.
 Unpinch: Zoom into photos, Maps on the iPhone, and Safari Web pages.

Scrolling iPod classic and nano wheels
The circular scroll wheel on iPod classic and iPod nano models makes
scrolling through an entire music collection quick and easy. With your finger
or thumb, scroll clockwise on the wheel to scroll down a list, or counter-
clockwise to scroll up. As you scroll, options on the menu are highlighted.
Use the Select button at the center of the scroll wheel to select whatever is
highlighted in the menu display.
In full-size, third-generation models, the touch-sensitive buttons above the
scroll wheel perform simple functions when you touch them. (First- and
second-generation models aren’t touch sensitive, so you need to press them.)
Fifth-generation iPods and sixth-generation iPod classic models, iPod nano,
iPod mini, and fourth-generation iPods (including color-display models) pro-
vide a click wheel that offers the same functions as the scroll wheel and the
clickable buttons. The click wheel has pressure-sensitive buttons underneath
the top, bottom, left, and right areas of the circular pad of the wheel. These
areas tilt as you press them, activating the buttons.
The iPod main menu for sixth-generation iPod classic models and the iPod
nano offers the following selections:
 Music: Select music playlists, artists, albums, songs, genres, or com-
posers; or select an audio book. You can also select Cover Flow to
browse by cover art, or Search to search for a song or album title or
artist (as we describe in Chapter 15).
 Videos: Select videos by video playlist or by type (movies, music videos,
or TV shows).
 Photos: Select photos by photo album or select all photos in the photo
library.
 Podcasts: Select podcasts by title, and then select podcast episodes.
 Extras: View the clock, set clocks for time zones, set alarms and the
sleep timer, use the stopwatch, view contacts, view your calendar, view
notes, and play games.

tions when used in combination:
 Turn on the iPod. Press any button.
 Turn off the iPod. Press and hold the Play/Pause button.
 Disable the iPod buttons. To keep from accidentally pressing the but-
tons, push the Hold switch to the other side so that an orange bar
appears (the locked position). To reactivate the iPod buttons, push the
Hold switch back to the other side so that the orange bar disappears
(the normal position).
 Reset the iPod. You can reset the iPod if it gets hung up for some
reason. (For example, it might get confused if you press the buttons too
quickly.) See Chapter 24 for instructions on how to reset your iPod.
 Change the volume. While playing a song (the display reads Now
Playing), adjust the volume with the scroll wheel. Clockwise turns the
volume up; counterclockwise turns the volume down. A volume slider
appears on the iPod display, indicating the volume level as you scroll.
 Skip to any point in a song, video, audio book or podcast. While play-
ing an item (the display reads Now Playing), press and hold the Select
button until the progress bar appears to indicate where you are , and
then use the scroll wheel to scroll to any point in the song. Scroll clock-
wise to move forward and counterclockwise to move backward.

Setting the Language
Wiedergabelisten? Übersicht? (Playlists? Browse?) If your iPod classic or iPod
nano is speaking in a foreign tongue, don’t panic — you’re not in the wrong
country. You might have purchased one that’s set to a foreign language. More
likely, someone set it to a different language accidentally or on purpose (as a
practical joke). Fortunately, you can change the setting without having to
know the language that it’s set to.
To set the language, no matter what language the menu is using, follow
these steps:
1. Press the Menu button repeatedly until pressing it doesn’t change the
words on the display or until you see the word iPod at the top.
If pressing the Menu button no longer changes the display, you’re at the
main menu. With fourth-, fifth-, and sixth-generation models and iPod
nano, the menu displays the word iPod no matter what language is
selected — and you know you’re at the main menu.
2. Choose the sixth option from the top on sixth-generation iPods and
the iPod nano, or the fifth option on fifth-generation iPods, or the
fourth option on fourth-generation iPods, iPod mini, and the older
iPod nano. Choose the third option from the top on third-, second-,
and first-generation models. (In English, this is the Settings option.)
Scroll clockwise until the item is highlighted, and then press the Select
button. The Settings menu appears.
3. Choose the third option from the bottom of the Settings menu (which,
in English, is the Language option).
The Language menu appears.
4. Choose the language that you want to use. (English is at the top of
the list.)
If these steps don’t do the trick, the menu may have been customized (some-
thing you can discover how to do in Chapter 21). Someone could have cus-
tomized it previously, or perhaps you accidentally pressed buttons that
customized the menu. To get around this problem, you can reset all the iPod
settings back to the defaults (which is not the same as simply resetting your
iPod, as described in Chapter 24). Unfortunately, resetting your iPod’s settings
wipes out any customizations that you’ve made. You have to redo any
repeat/shuffle settings, alarms, backlight timer settings, and so on.
31
Chapter 1: Firing Up Your iPod

Follow these steps to reset all your settings, no matter what language displays:
1. Press the Menu button repeatedly until pressing it doesn’t change the
words on the display or until you see the word iPod at the top.
If pressing the Menu button no longer changes the display, you’re at the
main menu. With fourth-, fifth-, and sixth-generation models and iPod
nano, the menu displays the word iPod no matter what language is
selected — and you know you’re at the main menu.
2. Choose the sixth option from the top on sixth-generation iPods and
the iPod nano, or the fifth option on fifth-generation iPods, or the
fourth option on fourth-generation iPods, iPod mini, and the older
iPod nano. Choose the third option from the top on third-, second-,
and first-generation models. (In English, this is the Settings option.)
3. Choose the option at the bottom of the menu (in English, the Reset All
Settings option).
The Reset All Settings menu appears.
4. Choose the second menu option (in English, the Reset option; the first
menu option is Cancel).
The Language menu appears.
5. Choose the language you want to use. (English is at the top of the list.)
The language you choose now applies to all the iPod menus. But don’t pull
that practical joke on someone else!

 Installing iTunes on a Mac
 Setting up your iPod
 Downloading upgrades to the software
A
n iPod without iTunes is like a CD player without CDs. Sure, you can use
utility programs from sources other than Apple to put music, podcasts,
and videos on an iPod. (See Chapter 23 if you don’t believe us.) But iTunes
gives you access to the vast online iTunes Store, and it’s excellent for manag-
ing content on your computer and synchronizing your content library with
your iPod.
This chapter explains how to set up your iPod with iTunes on a Mac or for
Windows. iTunes includes the iPod software, which provides the intelligence
inside your iPod. iTunes recognizes the type of iPod you have and installs the
correct software for your iPod.
Installing iTunes on a Windows PC
Setting up iTunes is a quick and easy process. The most up-to-date version of
iTunes as of this writing is version 7.4. However, software updates occur very
rapidly. If you really want the latest version, go directly to the Apple Web site
(www.apple.com/itunes) to get it. You can download iTunes for free.
The CD-ROMs supplied with older iPods offer older versions of iTunes and
iPod software. You should visit the Apple Web site to download the most up-
to-date version of iTunes, which recognizes all iPod models.

Before installing iTunes, make sure that you’re logged on as a Windows
administrator user. Quit all other applications before installing and disable
any antivirus software.
The iTunes installer also installs the newest version of QuickTime, replacing
any older version you might have. QuickTime is the Apple multimedia devel-
opment, storage, and playback technology. Although Windows users aren’t
required to use QuickTime beyond its use by iTunes, QuickTime is a bonus
for Windows users because it offers digital video playback.
If you’re using MusicMatch Jukebox, visit this book’s companion Web site to
find out how to install it.
To install iTunes for Windows, follow these steps:
1. Download the iTunes installer from the Apple site.
Browse the Apple Web site (www.apple.com/itunes) and click the
Download iTunes button, as shown in Figure 2-1. Follow the instructions
to download the installer to your hard drive. Pick a location on your
hard drive to save the installer.
2. Run the iTunes installer.
Double-click the iTunesSetup.exe file to install iTunes. The installer
displays the License Agreement dialog.
Figure 2-1:

the newest
version of
iTunes from
the Internet.
34
Part I: Setting Up and Acquiring Media Content 

3. Click the option to accept the terms of the License Agreement, and
then click Next.
Apple’s License Agreement appears in the installer window, and you can
scroll down to read the agreement. You must choose to accept the agree-
ment, or the installer goes no further.
After clicking Next (which is active only if you accept), the installer dis-
plays the About iTunes information.
4. Read the About iTunes information and then click Next.
The installer might display important Read Me information about the
latest iTunes features. Scroll down to read the entire information.
After clicking Next, the installer displays the iTunes installation options,
as shown in Figure 2-2.
5. Choose iTunes installation options.
You can turn the following options on or off (as shown in Figure 2-2):
• Install Desktop Shortcuts: You can install shortcuts for your
Windows desktop for iTunes.
• Use iTunes as the Default Player for Audio Files: We suggest turning
this option on, allowing iTunes to be the default audio content
player for all audio files it recognizes. If you’re happy with your
audio player, you can deselect this option, leaving your default
player setting unaffected.
6. Choose the destination folder for iTunes.
By default, the installer assumes that you want to store the program in
the Program Files folder of your C: drive (which is an excellent place to
Figure 2-2:
Choose
iTunes
installation
options.
35
Chapter 2: Setting Up iTunes and Your iPod

store it, unless you have other ideas). If you want to use a different
folder, click Browse to use Windows Explorer to locate the desired folder.
7. Click Install to finish.
After you click Install, the installer finishes the installation and displays
the InstallShield Wizard Complete dialog.
8. Choose the option to restart your computer and then click Finish.
Restarting your Windows PC after installing software is always a
good idea.
iTunes (including the iPod software) and QuickTime are now installed on
your PC. To start using iTunes, double-click the iTunes program or use your
Start menu to locate iTunes and launch it.
Installing iTunes on a Mac
As a Mac user, you probably already have iTunes installed because all Macs
sold since 2003 (and many before that time) are preinstalled with iTunes and
Mac OS X, and you also get iTunes if you install Mac OS X on an older machine.
The most up-to-date version of iTunes as of this writing is version 7.4.
The version of iTunes that’s provided with the Mac might be the newest ver-
sion; then again, it might not be. Software updates occur very rapidly. If
iTunes displays a dialog with the message that a new version of iTunes is
available and asks whether you would like to download it now, click Yes to
download the new version. Mac OS X not only downloads iTunes but installs
it automatically.
You can set your Mac to automatically download the latest version of iTunes
when it becomes available. Simply use Software Update from the Mac OS X
System Preferences window. Click the Check Now button to check for a new
version. If one exists, it appears in a window for you to select. Click the check
mark to select it and then click Install to download and install it.
If you want to manually install iTunes on your Mac or manually upgrade the
version you have, browse the Apple Web site (www.apple.com/itunes) to
get it. You can download iTunes for free. Follow these steps:
1. Download the iTunes installer from the Apple site.
Browse the Apple Web site (www.apple.com/itunes), select the Mac
OS X version, and then click the Download iTunes button. (Refer to
Figure 2-1.) Your browser downloads the iTunes installer drive image file
36
Part I: Setting Up and Acquiring Media Content 

iTunes.dmg to your hard drive. After your browser downloads the file,
locate the file in the Finder.
2. Open the iTunes installer drive image.
Double-click the iTunes.dmg file to mount the iTunes installation drive.
3. Read the Read Before You Install iTunes document for up-to-date
information.
Apple provides important Read Me information about installing iTunes
manually.
4. Double-click the iTunes.mpkg file to unpack the installer package.
The iTunes.mpkg file is a package containing all the elements of the
iTunes software and the installation program. After double-clicking this
package file, a dialog appears that asks whether the installer can run a
special program to check your computer.
5. Click Continue to run the special program.
The installer needs to run a program to check your computer and make
sure it’s capable of running iTunes. After it runs the program, the
installer displays the Introduction page.
6. Click Continue, read the Read Me page, and click Continue again.
The installer displays important Read Me information about the latest
iTunes features. If you like, click Save to save the page as a document or
click Print to print it. Click Continue to continue to the License
Agreement.
7. Read the License Agreement and click Continue to go to the second
page. Click the Agree button and then click Continue again.
You can scroll down to read the agreement. You must choose to accept
the agreement by clicking the Agree button, or the installer goes no fur-
ther. After clicking Agree, the installer displays the Select a Destination
page.
8. (Optional) Before you click the Agree button, you can click Save to
save the license agreement as a document or click Print to print it.
No lawyers are present when you do this; it’s all up to you.
9. Select the destination volume and then click Continue.
The installer asks for the destination volume (hard drive), which must be
a Mac OS X startup drive. Any other drive is marked by a red exclama-
tion point, indicating that you can’t install the software there. iTunes is
installed in the Applications folder on the Mac OS X startup drive, and
the iPod Software Updater is installed in the Utilities folder inside the
Applications folder.
37
Chapter 2: Setting Up iTunes and Your iPod

10. Click Install (or Upgrade) to proceed with the installation.
As an alternative, you can customize your installation by clicking
Customize, selecting each package you want to install, and then clicking
Install. The installer skips installing iTunes if you already have a version
as current as (or newer than) the one downloaded.
11. Click Close when the installer finishes.
You can now launch iTunes by double-clicking the iTunes application or click-
ing the iTunes icon on the Dock.
Setting Up Your iPod
When you connect a new iPod for the first time, iTunes displays the Setup
Assistant. Follow these steps to set up your iPod:
1. With iTunes open, connect your iPod to the computer with a USB
cable (or FireWire cable for an older iPod model).
iTunes recognizes your iPod and opens the iPod Setup Assistant to get
you started, displaying first the License Agreement. If your iPod isn’t rec-
ognized in five minutes, see Chapter 24.
2. Click the option to accept the terms of the License Agreement, and
then click Next in Windows, or Continue on a Mac.
Apple’s License Agreement appears in the Setup Assistant window, and
you can scroll down to read the agreement. You must choose to accept
the agreement, or the installer goes no further.
After clicking Next in Windows or Continue on a Mac (which is active
only if you accept), the Setup Assistant displays a dialog that lets you
enter a name for your iPod.
3. Give your iPod a name, set automatic options, and then click Next in
Windows or Continue on a Mac (or Finish if you have already regis-
tered the iPod or are setting up an iPod shuffle).
If you plan on sharing several iPods among several computers, give your
iPod a unique name.
If you want to copy your entire iTunes music library, leave the Auto-
matically Choose Songs For My iPod option selected (not provided for
the iPod shuffle). This option creates a mirror image of your music
38
Part I: Setting Up and Acquiring Media Content 

library on the iPod, including all playlists and audio files, every time you
connect your iPod. (Don’t worry. You can always change this setting
later; see Chapter 12.) If you want to copy only a portion of your library
to the iPod, deselect this option.
The iPhone Setup Assistant provides the option to Automatically Sync
Contacts, Calendars, Email Accounts, and Bookmarks. Deselect this
option if you want to change these synchronization settings first.
For an iPod shuffle, the Setup Assistant displays an option to copy songs
randomly. If you leave the Automatically Choose Songs for My iPod
option selected, iTunes copies a random selection of songs to your iPod
shuffle. You can always choose to fill your iPod shuffle with a different
selection by clicking the Autofill button, as we describe in Chapter 12.
If you have a color-display iPod model, including iPod nano, select the
Automatically Copy Photos to My iPod option if you want to copy all the
photos in your Pictures folder to your iPod. Leave it deselected if you
want to transfer photos later.
If you turn on both the option to copy photos automatically and the
option to copy songs automatically, iTunes copies the songs first and
then copies photos up to the limit of the iPod’s capacity. (See Chapter 12
to find out about transferring photos to your color-display iPod.)
After you click Next in Windows or Continue on a Mac, the Setup
Assistant moves on to the dialog for registering your iPod.
4. Click the Register button to register your iPod online.
The Setup Assistant allows you to register your iPod with Apple online,
to take advantage of Apple support. Apple displays a dialog for entering
your Apple ID; a membership ID for the .Mac service is also valid. If you
purchased your iPod directly from Apple and you have an Apple ID or
.Mac ID, enter the ID and password to swiftly move through the registra-
tion process — Apple automatically recognizes your purchase so that
you don’t need to enter the iPod’s serial number. If you bought your
iPod elsewhere or you don’t have an Apple ID or .Mac ID, Apple displays
a dialog for entering your iPod’s serial number and your personal infor-
mation. Fields marked with an asterisk (*) are required, such as your
name and e-mail address. Click Continue to advance through each dialog
in the registration process.
You can find the iPod’s serial number of the back of your iPod (use a
magnifying glass) or on the side of its packaging.
5. Click Finish on Windows, or Done on a Mac, to finish setup.
39
Chapter 2: Setting Up iTunes and Your iPod

After finishing setup, your iPod’s name appears in the iTunes Source pane
(the left column) under the Devices subheading, as shown in Figure 2-3.
Information about your iPod, including how much space is available, appears
in the main part of the iTunes window. The iPod icon also appears in
Windows Explorer on a Windows PC, or on the Finder Desktop on a Mac.
You can also use the Finder on a Mac, or Windows Explorer on a PC, to see
how much free space is left on the iPod. On a Mac, click the iPod icon on the
Desktop and choose File➪Get Info. The Finder displays the Get Info window
with information about capacity, amount used, and available space. On a PC,
select the iPod in Windows Explorer and choose Properties from the shortcut
menu to see this information. You can also use the About command on the
iPod, which is available on the Settings menu: Choose Settings➪About. The
iPod information screen appears with capacity and available space.
If you selected the automatic update feature in the Setup Assistant, your iPod
quickly fills up with the music from your iTunes music library. Of course, if
you’re just starting out, you probably have no tunes in your library. Your next
step is to import music from CDs, buy music online, or import music from
other sources (see Chapter 4).
Don’t want to add songs now? If you deselect the automatic update feature,
you can still add songs later either manually or automatically, as we describe
in Chapter 12.

You can leave your iPod connected to the computer, using the computer as a
source of power — the iPod appears in iTunes whenever you start iTunes.
However, you might not want to connect to your iPod every time you start
iTunes. If you have an alternate power source for your iPod, disconnect it
from iTunes and your computer by ejecting it. To eject your iPod, click the
eject button next to the iPod name (refer to Figure 2-3) or click the iPod eject
button in the lower-right corner of the iTunes window.
After ejecting the iPod, wait for its display to show the main menu or the OK
to disconnect message. You can then disconnect the iPod from the com-
puter. Don’t ever disconnect an iPod before ejecting it because such bad
behavior might cause your iPod to freeze up and require a reset. (If that hap-
pens, see Chapter 24 for instructions.)
Downloading and Installing
Software Upgrades
Apple upgrades iTunes and the built-in iPod software regularly to add new
features and fix bugs. The best way to stay updated with the latest version is
to get in the habit of downloading upgrades over the Internet. To install the
upgrade, follow these steps:
1. If iTunes displays a dialog with the message that a new version of
iTunes is available and asks whether you would like to download it
now, click Yes to download the new version.
• On a Windows PC: iTunes launches your Web browser and takes
you right to the iTunes download page (refer to Figure 2-1). Follow
the instructions in “Installing iTunes on a Windows PC” in this
chapter.
• On a Mac: iTunes automatically downloads and installs the
upgrade. When you start iTunes after installing an upgrade, you
must click the option to agree to Apple’s License Agreement.
iTunes then starts as usual.
You can set your Mac to automatically download the latest version of
iTunes and iPod Software when they become available. Just use Software
Update from the Mac OS X System Preferences window. Click the Check
Now button to check for a new version. If one exists, it appears in a
window for you to select. Select it and then click Install to download and
install it.
41
Chapter 2: Setting Up iTunes and Your iPod

2. After installing the iTunes upgrade, connect your iPod to your com-
puter as you normally do.
iTunes automatically detects new iPod software if it is available, as
shown in Figure 2-4.
3. Click the Update button to install the software in your iPod.
iTunes displays information about the new iPod software.
4. Click Next to continue to the Apple License Agreement, and click the
option to agree with it.
iTunes automatically installs the update into your iPod. After your iPod
is set up and updated with the newest version of its software, you are
ready to find out what iTunes can do for you.

M
ore than half a century ago, jukeboxes were the primary and most 
convenient way for people to select the music they wanted to hear
and share with others, especially newly released music. Juke joints were 
hopping with the newest hits every night. You could pick any song to play at
any time, but you had to insert a coin and pay for each play. Radio eventually
supplanted the jukebox as the primary means of releasing new music to the
public, and the music was free to hear — but you couldn’t choose to play any
song you wanted at any time.
Today, using iTunes, you not only have a digital jukebox and a radio in your
computer, but you also have online access to millions of songs, thousands of
podcasts, and hundreds of TV shows, movies, and audio books. Connect your
computer to a stereo amplifier in your home or connect speakers to your
computer, and suddenly your computer is the best jukebox in the neighbor-
hood. Connect your computer to a television, and you have a full multimedia
environment in your home, all controlled by iTunes.
This chapter gives you an overview of what you can do with iTunes, and you
get started in the simplest way possible: using iTunes to play music tracks on
a CD. You can use iTunes just like a jukebox, only better — you don’t have to
pay for each song you play, and you can play some or all of the songs on an
album in any order.
The most up-to-date version of iTunes as of this writing is version 7.4.
However, software updates occur very rapidly. If you really want the latest ver-
sion, go directly to the Apple Web site to get it, as we describe in Chapter 2.

What You Can Do with iTunes
You can purchase songs or entire albums, audio books, TV shows, movies,
and other videos from the iTunes Store and download them directly into your
iTunes library (as we describe in Chapter 4), or you can copy these items
from other sources (including audio CDs) into your iTunes library. You can
also subscribe to podcasts that transfer audio or audio/video episodes, such
as weekly broadcasts, automatically to your iTunes library from the Internet
or through the iTunes Store. You can even use iTunes to listen to Web radio
stations and add your favorite stations to your music library. After you store
the content in your iTunes library, you can play it on your computer and
transfer it to iPod, Apple TV, and iPhone devices. You can also burn the audio
content onto an audio CD or make backup copies of audio and video onto
other hard drives or DVD data discs.
Transferring songs from a CD to your computer is referred to as ripping a CD
(to the chagrin of the music industry old-timers who think that users intend
to destroy the discs or steal the songs). Ripping an entire CD’s worth of songs
is quick and easy, and track information, such as artist name and title, arrives
automatically over the Internet for most commercial CDs. (You can add the
information yourself for rare CDs, custom-mix CDs, live CDs, and others that
are unknown to the database.)
You can also add video files to your iTunes library by: choosing content from
the iTunes Store (such as TV shows, feature-length movies, music videos, and
even free movie trailers); or by downloading standard video files in the
MPEG-4 format from other sources on the Internet.
Why not create your own videos? Use a digital camcorder — or use the iSight
camera built into every MacBook — and copy the videos to iTunes. You can
even convert a television signal (or any analog video signal) for viewing in
iTunes by using products such as EyeTV 250 from Elgato Systems (www.
elgato.com).
Although you can’t use iTunes to transfer video content from a DVD, you can
use other software to convert DVDs to digital video files, and you can transfer
video content from older VHS players by using a digital video camcorder.
Visit this book’s companion Web site for more details.
iTunes gives you the power to organize content into playlists. You can even
set up dynamic, smart playlists that reflect your preferences and listening
habits. iTunes offers an equalizer with preset settings for all kinds of music
and listening environments, and it gives you the ability to customize and save
your own personalized settings with each item of content.
44
Part I: Setting Up and Acquiring Media Content 

The Mac and Windows versions of iTunes are virtually identical, with the
exception that dialogs look a bit different between the two operating sys-
tems. There are also a few other differences, mostly related to the different
operating environments. The Windows version lets you import Windows
Media (WMA) songs; the Mac version, like most Mac applications, can be
controlled by AppleScript programs. Nevertheless, as Apple continues to
improve iTunes, the company releases upgrades to both versions at the 
same time, and the versions are free to download.
Opening the iTunes Window
You can run iTunes anytime (with or without an iPod) to build and manage
your library of music, audio books, podcasts, Web radio stations, TV shows,
and other videos. You don’t have to connect your iPod until you’re ready to
transfer content to it (as we describe in Chapter 12).
When you launch iTunes, your library and other sources of content appear.
Figure 3-1 shows the iTunes window on a PC running Windows XP, using the
Browse pane to browse by artist. You can click the column headings in the
List pane to sort your library by artist, album title, or any of the other view
options.
The Mac and Windows versions of iTunes look nearly identical and offer the
same viewing options, including the cover browser (also known by its older
name, Cover Flow). Figure 3-2 shows the iTunes window on the Mac with the
cover browser open, displaying the cover art for albums.
iTunes offers a view of your library and your sources for content, as well as
controls for organizing, importing, and playing content, as follows:
 Source pane: Displays the source of content, now handily divided into
the following sections:
• Library: Includes your music, movies, TV shows, podcasts, audio
books, iPod games, and all available radio stations
• Store: Includes the iTunes Store and your Purchased list
• Devices: Can include iPods, such as the iPod nano in Figure 3-2
named TBone-Nano, CDs such as the Sgt. Pepper’s CD in Figure 3-1,
iPhones, and Apple TV
• Playlists: Includes Party Shuffle and your playlists
45
Chapter 3: Getting Started with iTunes

 Cover browser: The coolest new feature, also called Cover Flow. The
cover browser lets you flip through your cover art to choose songs. You
can use the slider to move swiftly through your library, or you can click
to the right or left of the cover in the foreground to move forward or
backward in your library.
 List pane and Browse pane: Depending on the source that’s selected in
the Source pane under Library, Store, Devices, or Playlists, these two
panes (refer to Figure 3-1) display a list of the content in your library or
a list of Web radio stations, the content available in the iTunes Store, the
tracks of a music CD or the entire library on your iPod, or the Party
Shuffle list or any one of your playlists.

However, whereas a CD actually pops out of some computers, iPods are
hard drives, and ejecting them simply removes (unmounts) the drives
from the system so that you can disconnect them.
If you don’t like the width of the Source pane, you can adjust it by dragging
the shallow dot on the vertical bar between the Source pane and the List
pane and Browse pane. You can also adjust the height of the List and Browse
panes by dragging the shallow dot on the horizontal bar between them. To
resize the iTunes window on a Mac, drag diagonally from the bottom-right
corner. In Windows, drag the edges of the window horizontally or vertically.
Playing CD Tracks in iTunes
iTunes needs content. You can get started right away by ripping music from
CDs into your library. For more instant gratification, though, you can play
music right off the CD without importing it. Maybe you don’t want to put the
music into your library. Maybe you just want to hear it first, as part of your
Play First, Rip Later plan.
To play a CD, insert any music CD — or even a CD-R that someone burned for
you — into your computer. After you insert the CD, iTunes displays a dialog
that asks whether you want to import the CD into your library right now —
you can click Yes to import now, or No to do nothing yet. Click No for now;
we show you how to import music in Chapter 5. The iTunes Browse button
changes to an Import button in anticipation of ripping the CD at any time.

If you’re connected to the Internet, iTunes accesses the Gracenote CDDB for
song information while you are answering the import question, so that after
you click Yes or No, iTunes presents the track information for each song auto-
matically, as shown in Figure 3-3. (Gracenote CDDB is a song database on the
Internet that knows the track names of most commercial CDs but not home-
made mix CDs. You can read about Gracenote CDDB and editing song infor-
mation in Chapter 9.)
When you play a CD in iTunes, it’s just like using a CD player. To play a CD
from the first track, click the Play button. (If you clicked somewhere else after
inserting the disc, you might have to click the first track to select it before
clicking the Play button.) The Play button then turns into a Pause button, 
and the song plays.
When the song finishes, iTunes continues playing the songs in the list in
sequence until you click the Pause button (which then toggles back into the
Play button) or until the song list ends. You can skip to the next or previous
song by using the arrow keys on your keyboard or by clicking the Forward
button or the Back button (next to the Play button). You can also double-click
another song in the list to start playing it.
You can press the spacebar to perform the same function as clicking the Play
button; pressing it again is just like clicking the Pause button.
The Status pane above the list of songs tells you the name of the artist and
the song title as well as the elapsed time of the track. When you click the
artist name, the artist name is replaced by the album name. The time on the
left of the slider is the elapsed time; the time on the right is the duration of
the song. When you click the duration, it changes to the remaining time; click
it again to return to the song’s duration.

Eject a CD by clicking the Eject button or by choosing Controls➪Eject Disc.
Another way to eject the CD is to click the Eject icon next to the CD name in
the Source pane. You can also right-click the CD name and choose Eject from
the contextual menu.
Rearranging and repeating tracks
You can rearrange the order of the tracks to automatically play them in any
sequence you want, similar to programming a CD player. When you click the
up arrow at the top of the first column in the List pane (refer to Figure 3-3), it
changes to a down arrow, and the tracks appear in reverse order.
To change the order of tracks that you’re playing in sequence, just click and
hold the track number in the leftmost column for the song, and then drag it
up or down in the list. You can set up the tracks to play in a completely differ-
ent sequence.
Skipping tracks
To skip tracks so that they don’t play in sequence, deselect the check box
next to the song names. iTunes skips deselected songs when you play the
entire sequence.
To remove all check marks from a list, press Ô on a Mac or Ctrl in Windows
while clicking a check mark. Select an empty check box while pressing Ô or
Ctrl to add check marks to the entire list.
Repeating a song list
You can repeat an entire song list by clicking the Repeat button, which you
find below the Source pane on the left side of the iTunes window (or by
choosing Controls➪Repeat All). When it’s selected, the Repeat button shows
blue highlighting. Click the Repeat button again to repeat the current song
(or choose Controls➪Repeat One). The button changes to include a blue-
highlighted numeral 1. Click it once more to return to normal playback (or
choose Controls➪Repeat Off).
The Shuffle button, located to the left of the Repeat button, plays the songs in
the list in random order, which can be fun. You can then press the arrow keys
on your keyboard or click the Back and Forward buttons to jump around in
random order.

Displaying visuals
The visual effects in iTunes can turn your iTunes window into a light show
that’s synchronized to the music in your library. You can watch a cool display
of eye candy while the music plays — or leave it on like a lava lamp.
Choose View➪Turn On Visualizer to display visual effects (or press Ô-T on a
Mac or Ctrl-T in Windows). An animation appears in the iTunes window and
synchronizes with the music. Choose View➪Turn Off Visualizer (or press Ô-T
on a Mac or Ctrl-T in Windows) to turn off the visual effects.
You can tweak the animation a bit by changing the Visualizer options. Choose
View➪Visualizer➪Options to open the Visualizer Options dialog, as shown in
Figure 3-4.
The Visualizer Options dialog offers the following options that affect the ani-
mation (but not the performance of iTunes when it’s playing music):
 Display Frame Rate: Choosing this option displays the frame rate of the
animation along with the animation.
 Cap Frame Rate at 30 fps: Choosing this option keeps the frame rate at
30 fps (frames per second) or lower, which is roughly the speed of video.
 Always Display Song Info: Choosing this option displays the song name,
artist, and album for the song currently playing, along with the animation.
 Use DirectX (Windows only) or Use OpenGL (Mac only): You can
choose to use DirectX on a Windows PC or OpenGL on a Mac to display
very cool animation with faster performance. These are the most widely
used standards for three-dimensional graphics programming.
 Faster but Rougher Display: When you use this option, animation plays
faster but with rougher graphics. Select this option if your animation
plays too slowly.

Chapter 3: Getting Started with iTunes

Choosing View➪Full Screen (or pressing Ô-F on a Mac or Ctrl-F in Windows)
while the Visualizer is on sets the visual effects to fill the entire screen. When
displaying the full-screen visual effects, you can click the mouse button or
press Escape (Esc) to stop the display and return to iTunes.
The Preferences dialog in iTunes gives you a bit more control over the size of
the animated effects and density of the visual animation — offering a choice of
Small, Medium, or Large animations to suit your tastes. Choose iTunes➪
Preferences on a Mac, or Edit➪Preferences in Windows, click the Advanced
tab, and then click the General tab, which displays the Advanced General pref-
erences. Choose the Visualizer Size — Small, Medium, or Large — in the pop-
up menu, as shown in Figure 3-5. You can also select the Display Visualizer Full
Screen option to always display the Visualizer in full-screen mode.
While the animated visual effects play, press Shift-/ (as if you’re typing a ques-
tion mark) to see a list of keyboard functions. Depending on the visual effect,
you might see more choices of keyboard functions by pressing Shift-/ again.

You can enhance iTunes with plug-ins that provide even better visuals. For
example, SpectroGraph from Dr. Lex displays a spectrogram of the music, 
and Cover Version from imagomat displays the album cover artwork. You 
can find these and many other enhancements at PluginsWorld.com (http://
itunes.pluginsworld.com).
After installing an iTunes plug-in, you can switch from one plug-in to another
by choosing View➪Visualizer to see the submenu of plug-ins (including
iTunes Visualizer, which is supplied with iTunes). Choose View➪Visualizer➪
iTunes Visualizer to select the iTunes Visualizer.
Using the iTunes MiniStore
If you turn on the iTunes MiniStore pane, which appears below the List and
Browse panes, it makes suggestions for what to buy from the iTunes Store
based on what you’re listening to. No, celebrity DJs and music historians
aren’t choosing what shows up here; your peers are. The MiniStore informs
the online store about the songs you select whenever the MiniStore pane 
is open. The store simply shows you music that other listeners purchased
when they purchased the music you’re playing. You can click any item in the
MiniStore pane to go right to the iTunes Store page for that item. See Chapter
4 for details about using the iTunes Store.
The MiniStore operates only if you give it permission. When you first start
iTunes, the MiniStore is not yet turned on (refer to Figure 3-2). Choose
View➪Show MiniStore, and the MiniStore pane appears at the bottom of the
window (refer to Figure 3-1), offering suggestions as you play the content in
your library.
When you have the MiniStore pane open, iTunes transmits information to the
store about the selection you’re playing. The iTunes MiniStore does not
transmit the current song data if the MiniStore pane is hidden. To hide the
MiniStore, choose View➪Hide MiniStore.
If the MiniStore can’t find the artist for the song you’re playing, it displays 
No Match and offers choices that are simply in the same genre, along with
New Releases, Top Songs, and Top Albums. If you select an audio book or TV
show in your library, you’ll see the top-selling audio books or TV shows in
the MiniStore. If you don’t have an iTunes Store available for your country,
you see the U.S. store, just as Chuck Berry once sang, “Anything you want, 
we got right here in the U.S.A.”

W
hen Apple announced its online music service, Apple chairman Steve
Jobs remarked that other services put forward by the music industry
tend to treat consumers like criminals. Steve had a point. Many of these ser-
vices cost more and add a level of copy protection that prevents consumers
from burning more than one CD or using the music (that they bought) on
other computers or portable MP3 players.
Record labels drug their feet for years, experimenting with online sales and
taking legal action against online sites that allowed free downloads and music
copying. Although the free music attracted millions of listeners, the free ser-
vices were under legal attack in several countries, and the digital music that
was distributed wasn’t of the highest quality (not to mention the widespread
and sometimes intentional misspellings in the song information and artist
names). Consumers grew even warier when the Recording Industry Associ-
ation of America (RIAA; a lobbying organization looking out for the interests 
of record companies) began legal proceedings (illegal copyright infringement)
against people who possibly thought they were downloading free music.
No one should go to jail for being a music junkie. Consumers and the industry
both needed a solution. Apple did the research on how to make a service that
worked better and was easier to use, and the company forged ahead with the
iTunes Store. By all accounts, Apple has succeeded in offering the easiest,
fastest, and most cost-effective service for buying content online for your
computer and iPod.

When Apple first introduced the online store, it was called the iTunes Music
Store. Although the store still has millions of songs and Apple has sold more
than two billion songs as of January 2007, the company dropped Music from
its title because the iTunes Store sells much more. You can now purchase and
download feature-length movies as well as TV shows and music videos, and
the iTunes Store also offers games you can play on your iPod.
The iTunes Store offers parental controls that let you disable various sec-
tions and the purchase of various contents based on PG/TV ratings. It also
offers an option to immediately burn a disc backup of the content you pur-
chased. The iTunes Store offers gift certificates that you can e-mail to others
and allows accounts that you can set up for others (such as children) with
credit limits but without the need to use a credit card. In fact, Apple adds
new features to the iTunes Store almost every week.
In this chapter, we show you how to sign in and take advantage of what the
iTunes Store has to offer.
Visiting the iTunes Store
You can visit the iTunes Store by connecting to the Internet and using iTunes
or America Online (AOL). You can even click an iTunes Store link on Apple’s
Web site, or a similar link on Web sites that are iTunes affiliates with songs
for sale (such as www.rockument.com). The link automatically launches
your installed copy of iTunes and opens the iTunes Store.
As of this writing, the iTunes Store offers millions of songs, with most songs
available for download for 99 cents each and entire albums available for
download at less than the CD price. You can play these copy-protected songs
on up to five different computers, burn CDs, and use the songs on an iPod.
Apple also offers songs and albums in its iTunes Plus section from some
record labels (such as EMI) at a higher price and with higher sound quality
without copy protection. You can play these songs on just about any music
player and on an unlimited number of computers, — and, of course, burn CDs
with them.
You can also buy episodes and entire seasons of TV shows and even pur-
chase them in advance, so you see them immediately as they are released.
First-run movies are also available along with free movie trailers as well as
audio books. iTunes also offers tons of free content in the form of podcasts,
which are similar to syndicated radio and TV shows, but you can download
them into iTunes and play them at your convenience on your computer 
and iPod.
56
Part I: Setting Up and Acquiring Media Content 

Like with most online services, the music that you buy online is not as high in
audio quality as music on a commercial CD although most people can’t tell
the difference when playing the music on car stereos or at low volume. In
Chapter 18, we explain why there is a quality tradeoff to reduce the space 
the music occupies on the hard drive or flash memory of your iPod. As we
explain in Chapter 18, the quality of the music sold in the iTunes Store is
comparable with the quality you get when ripping CDs or importing songs
using the MP3 or AAC formats. You also get song information (such as artist,
song titles, the album title, and cover artwork), and the iTunes Store provides
electronic liner notes for some albums just like the printed notes you some-
times find on a commercial CD. Some albums are provided with the electronic
equivalent of a complete jewel case booklet that you can print yourself.
The iTunes Store is part of iTunes version 4 and newer, but you should be
using version 7.4 as of this writing. If you’re running an older version of
iTunes, download the newest version, as we describe in Chapter 2.
You can preview any song or video for up to 30 seconds (and audio books
and podcasts up to about 90 seconds). If you have an account set up, you 
can buy and download songs, audio books, podcasts, TV shows, movies, 
and videos immediately. We don’t know of a faster way to purchase content.
To open the iTunes Store, you have at least four choices:
 Click the iTunes Store option in the Source pane. The iTunes Store
home page opens, as shown in Figure 4-1.
 Click any link in the MiniStore pane. The iTunes Store home page
opens and automatically switches your Source pane selection to iTunes
Store. The MiniStore pane offers suggestions based on the music you
select in your library; see Chapter 3 for details.
 Follow a content link in iTunes. Click the content link (the gray-circled
arrow next to a song or video title, an artist name, or an album title) to
go to an iTunes Store page related to the song or video, artist, or album.
iTunes searches the iTunes Store based on the item you selected. If
nothing closely related turns up, at least you end up in the iTunes Store,
and you might even find music you like that you didn’t know about.
 Go to iTunes on AOL and click the iTunes link. If you use AOL, you can
browse or search the AOL music area for songs and click the iTunes link
to automatically launch iTunes and go to the iTunes Store.
If you need to fire up your modem and log on to your Internet service to go
online, do so before clicking the iTunes Store option or following a content
link — otherwise iTunes will wait for an Internet connection for a while and
eventually give up.
57
Chapter 4: Shopping at the iTunes Store

The iTunes Store uses the iTunes List and Browse panes to display its wares.
You can check out content to your heart’s content although you can’t buy
content unless you have an iTunes Store account set up. You can use the
Choose Genre pop-up menu to specify music genres, or you can click links 
for new releases, exclusive tracks, and so on.
We use the term pop-up menu for menus on the Mac that literally pop up from
dialogs and windows; in Windows, the same type of menu actually drops
down and is called a drop-down menu. We use the term pop-up menu for both.
The iTunes Store also provides buttons on a gray bar just above the adver-
tised content in the List pane. The left and right triangle buttons work just
like the Back and Forward buttons of a Web browser, moving back a page or
forward a page, respectively. The button with the Home icon takes you to the
iTunes Store home page. The Browse button in the lower-right corner
switches the view between Browse view (with the List and Browse panes
both open) and List view (with only the List pane open).

Setting Up an Account
You need an account to buy music. To create an iTunes Store account, follow
these steps:
1. In iTunes, click the iTunes Store option in the Source pane or click a
music link or MiniStore pane link.
The iTunes Store home page appears (refer to Figure 4-1), replacing the
iTunes List pane and Browse pane.
2. Click the Sign In button in the upper-right area of the window to
create an account (or sign in to an existing account).
If you already have an account that you’ve logged on to before using
iTunes, the account name appears in place of the Sign In button.
After you click the Sign In button, iTunes displays the account sign-in
dialog, as shown in Figure 4-2.
If you already set up an account with the iTunes Store with the .Mac 
service, with other Apple services (such as the Apple Developer
Connection), or with AOL, you’re halfway there. Type your ID and pass-
word and then click the Sign In button. Apple remembers the personal
information that you put in previously, so you don’t have to re-enter it
every time you visit the iTunes Store. If you forgot your password, click
the Forgot Password? button, and iTunes provides a dialog to answer
your test question. If you answer correctly, iTunes e-mails your pass-
word to you.
3. Click the Create New Account button.
iTunes displays a new page, replacing the iTunes Store home page with
the terms of use and an explanation of steps to create a new account.

4. Click the Agree button and then fill in your personal account 
information.
iTunes displays the next page of the setup procedure, shown in Figure 4-3,
which requires you to type your e-mail address, password, test question
and answer (in case you forget your password), birth date, and privacy
options.
5. Click the Continue button to go to the next page of the account setup
procedure, and then enter your credit card information.
The entire procedure is secure, so you don’t have to worry. The iTunes
Store keeps your personal information (including your credit card infor-
mation) on file, and you don’t have to type it again.
6. Click Continue to finish the procedure.
The account setup finishes and returns you to the iTunes Store home
page. You can now use the iTunes Store to purchase and download con-
tent to play in iTunes and use on an iPod, an iPhone, or an Apple TV.
If you use AOL and the AOL Wallet feature, you can assign payment for your
iTunes Store account to your AOL Wallet. AOL Wallet contains your billing
and credit card information for purchases. AOL Wallet automatically fills
information into the text boxes of the account setup pages so that you don’t
have to.

Browsing and Previewing Songs
The iTunes Store home page is loaded with specials and advertisements 
to peruse. To look at music in more depth, choose Music from the iTunes
STORE menu on the left panel at the top of the home page next to the new
releases panel. iTunes displays more panels of advertisements and specials
for music lovers. You can then choose a genre from the Genres menu on the
left panel next to the advertisements to see only those specials and ads for a
particular genre. You can click just about anything to get more information:
today’s top-ten songs, albums, audio books, TV shows, movies, exclusive
offerings, and more.
What if you’re looking for particular music in a particular genre? You can
browse the iTunes Store by genre and artist name in a method similar to
browsing your iTunes library.
To browse the iTunes Store, click the Browse button in the lower-right corner
of the iTunes window, or click the Browse link in the Quick Links panel on the
right side of the iTunes Store home page.
iTunes displays the store’s offerings categorized by type of content (such as
Music), and displays music by genre — and within each genre, by artist and
album. Select a genre in the Genre column, then a subgenre in the Subgenre
column, then an artist in the Artist column, and finally an album in the Album
column, which takes you to the list of songs from that album that are avail-
able to preview or purchase, as shown in Figure 4-4.
To see more information about a song or the album that it came from, click
the content link (one of the gray-circled arrow buttons in the List pane):
 Clicking the arrow in the Artist column takes you to the artist’s page 
of albums.
 Clicking the arrow in the Album column takes you to the album page.
 Clicking the arrow in the Name column takes you to album page with the
song highlighted.

Chapter 4: Shopping at the iTunes Store

My only complaint about browsing by artist is that artists are listed alphabet-
ically by first name. For example, you have to look up Bob Dylan under Bob
and not Dylan.
To preview a song, click the song title in the List pane and then click the Play
button (or press the spacebar).
By default, the previews play on your computer off the Internet in a stream,
so you might hear a few hiccups in the playback. Each preview lasts about 30
seconds. Just when you start really getting into the song, it ends. If the song
is irresistible, though, you can buy it on the spot.
If you have a slow Internet connection — especially if it’s slower than 128
Kbps — the preview might stutter. You can get around this problem by choos-
ing iTunes➪Preferences on a Mac or Edit➪Preferences on a Windows PC and
then clicking the Store tab to see the Store preferences. In the Store prefer-
ences, click the Load Complete Preview before Playing option to turn it on.
If you know specifically what you’re looking for, you can search instead of
browse. The Search field in the top-right corner of the iTunes window lets
you search the iTunes Store for just about anything. You can type part of a
song title or artist name to quickly search the iTunes Store, or use the Power
Search feature to narrow your search. (See the “Power searching” section
later in this chapter.)

Browsing the charts
What do Louis Armstrong, Roy Orbison, The Beach Boys, Dean Martin, and
Mary Wells have in common? Each had a top-ten hit in the charts for 1964 —
so says Billboard, the weekly magazine for the entertainment industry 
that has kept tabs on song popularity for more than one-half century. And
because the iTunes Store offers pop charts for each year going back to 1946,
you can probably find some of the songs that you grew up with.
You can’t find every song that made the charts — only the songs that the
iTunes Store offers.
To find the charts, click the Browse button in the lower-right corner of the
iTunes window to browse the iTunes Store (refer to Figure 4-4). Select Charts
at the very top of the iTunes Store column. From the Charts column, you can
select Billboard Hot 100, Billboard Top Country, or Billboard Top R&B
(rhythm and blues).
Power searching
You’re serious about music, and you truly desire the power to search for
exactly what you want. We know your type — and we have the function right
here for you.
Click the Power Search link on the iTunes Store home page in the Quick Links
panel to go directly to the Power Search page. At the top of the Power Search
page, as shown in Figure 4-5, you can choose the type of content to search
through: All (search all types), Music, Movies, TV Shows, Music Videos,
Audiobooks, or Podcasts. Click Music to power-search for music.
You can fill in the song title, the artist name, and the album title (refer to
Figure 4-5), or just fill in one of those text boxes (for example, if all you know
is the song title). You can narrow your search by picking a genre from the
Genre pop-up menu or by adding a composer name — or both. After you 
fill in as much as you know, click the Search button.
Browsing celebrity and published playlists
Do you want to be influenced? Do you want to know what influenced some of
today’s celebrities and buy what they have in their record collections? Choose
Music from the iTunes Store menu to go to the Music page. Scroll down the
iTunes Store Music page and click a celebrity name in the Celebrity Playlists
pane to go to that celebrity’s page with the playlist. A typical celebrity playlist
offers about an album’s worth of songs from different artists. You can preview
or buy any song in the list or follow the music links to the artist or album page.
63
Chapter 4: Shopping at the iTunes Store

The Music page lists some of the celebrity playlists, but a lot more aren’t
listed there (more than 370 the last time we checked). To see all the celebrity
playlists, click the Celebrity Playlists link in the More in Music menu on the
left side of the Music page.
You can also be influenced by other buyers and do a little influencing your-
self. Go to the Music page and click the iMix link in the More in Music menu 
to check out playlists that have been contributed by other consumers 
and published in the iTunes Store. iMixes offer 30-second previews of any
songs in the playlist. To find out how to publish your own iMix playlist, see 
Chapter 10.
You can also include a Web link (URL) to an iTunes Store page in an e-mail
message or other document so the reader can click the link to go directly 
to the iTunes Store page. You can drag the last button on the gray bar just
above the advertised content that displays the page name — or drag any
piece of artwork from the page — to an e-mail message or document you 
are composing, and iTunes copies the link. You can also Control-click (Mac)
or right-click (Windows) the item and choose Copy iTunes Store URL.

Browsing and Previewing Movies, TV
Shows, Videos, and Audiobooks
The uncool thing about video stores — besides the weird people who hang
out in them — is the lack of any ability to preview videos before you buy
them. And the only way to preview TV shows is to watch TV. However, you
can use the iTunes Store to preview movies, music videos, and TV shows
before you buy them — as long as your computer has a broadband connec-
tion to the Internet. Most shows offer 30 seconds of previewing time.
To find TV shows, movies, music videos, or audio books, do one of the 
following:
 Click the TV Shows, Movies, Music Videos, or Audiobooks link in the
iTunes STORE menu on the left side of the iTunes Store home page. The
iTunes Store displays advertisements for the most popular items as well
as a list of Top Songs, Top Albums, Top TV Show Episodes, and Top
Movies.
 Browse the iTunes Store by clicking the Browse link in the Quick Links
panel on the right side of the iTunes Store home page (or clicking the
Browse button in the lower-right corner of the iTunes window). Select
TV Shows, Movies, Music Videos, or Audiobooks from the iTunes Store
column, then do one of the following:
• For a TV show, pick a genre in the Genre column, then a TV show
in the Shows column, and a season of episodes in the Seasons
column.
• For a movie, pick a genre from the Genre column.
• For a music video, pick a genre from the Genre column, then pick
an artist from the Artist column.
• For an audio book, pick a genre from the Genre column, then pick
an author from the Author/Narrator column.
To preview a TV show or music video, click the title in the list and then click
the Play button (or press the spacebar). (Movies are actually videos on the
computer, so we use the term videos from now on.) The video plays in the
Artwork pane in the lower-left corner of the iTunes window, as shown in
Figure 4-6. If the Artwork pane isn’t visible, click the Show/Hide Artwork
button to display it. Click the iTunes Play/Pause, Forward/Next, and
Previous/Rewind buttons to control playback, and use the iTunes volume
slider to control the volume, just like with songs. For more details about 
playing videos in iTunes, see Chapter 6.

right-facing triangle in the window to play the video and click it again to
pause the video. Drag the slider to move forward or backward through the
video. You can click the Rewind or Fast-Forward buttons in the window to
move backward or forward through a video. You can also choose options in
the View menu to show the video window half-size, actual size, double-size,
fit-to-screen, or full screen.
Movies are also just a click away. The Movies link on the iTunes Store home
page takes you to a Movies page. Click an advertisement, thumbnail, or title
to go to the specific movie’s page, and click the View Trailer button to pre-
view the movie, as shown in Figure 4-8.
Use the iTunes Play button, just as you would for a song, to play the movie
trailer. At any time or after the movie trailer plays, click the Close Preview
button in the lower-right corner of the iTunes window to return to the 
movie page.

Audio books can be even more entertaining than movies and certainly easier
to consume while driving or walking. The Audiobooks link on the iTunes
Store home page takes you to the Audiobooks page. Click an advertisement,
thumbnail, or title to go to the specific audio booklet page, and click the
Preview button to preview the audio book. Use the Play/Pause button to
pause and resume playback.
You can play content in your iTunes library while waiting for an iTunes Store

Browsing and Subscribing to Podcasts
Podcasting is a popular method of publishing audio and video shows to 
the Internet, enabling people to subscribe to a feed and receive the shows
automatically. Similar to a tape of a radio broadcast, you can save a podcast
episode and play it back at your convenience, both in iTunes on your com-
puter and on your iPod. A podcast episode can be anything from a single
song to a commentary-hosted radio show; a podcaster, like a broadcaster,
provides a stream of episodes over time. Thousands of professional and 
amateur radio and video shows are offered as podcast episodes.
The iTunes Podcast page on the iTunes Store lets you browse, find, preview,
and subscribe to podcasts, many of which are free. You don’t need an
account to browse the iTunes Store and subscribe to free podcasts.
To find podcasts in the iTunes Store, do one of the following:
 Click the Podcasts link in the iTunes STORE menu on the home page.
The iTunes Store displays the Podcast page, with advertisements for
popular podcasts and a list of Top Podcasts. You can click the Top
Podcasts link to see the most popular podcasts in specific categories.
You can also get to the Podcast page by clicking Podcasts in the iTunes
Source pane and then clicking Podcast Directory at the bottom of the
List view.
 Browse all podcasts in a particular category. Click the Browse button
in the lower-right corner and then select Podcasts in the iTunes Store
column. Select a category from the Category column and a subcategory
from the Subcategory column.
 Search for a podcast by name or keyword. You can type a search term
into the Search iTunes Store field in the upper-right corner of the iTunes
window to find any podcasts or other content items that match. You can
also use the Power Search feature, described earlier in this chapter in
the section, “Power searching.”
After you select a podcast, the iTunes Store displays the podcast’s specific
page in the iTunes Store, as shown in Figure 4-9, with all available podcast
episodes in the List pane. (There are three episodes in Figure 4-9 for the
Rockument podcast.)
68
Part I: Setting Up and Acquiring Media Content 

To select, play, and subscribe to a podcast, follow these steps:
1. Choose a podcast in the iTunes Store.
The iTunes Store offers a description, a Subscribe button to receive 
new podcasts, and a link to the podcast’s Web site for more information.
The page also lists the most recent podcast. Some podcasters offer sev-
eral podcasts in one feed. You can click the lowercase i icon on the far-
right podcast listing margin to display separate information about the
podcast.
2. To preview the podcast, click the Play button or press the spacebar.
You can play a preview of any podcast in the list. iTunes plays the pod-
cast for about 90 seconds just like a Web radio station, streaming to
your computer. To jump ahead in a podcast or play the entire podcast
episode, you must first subscribe to the podcast. By subscribing, you
enable downloading episodes to your computer.
3. Click the Subscribe button to subscribe to the podcast.
In typical Apple fashion, iTunes first displays an alert to confirm that
you want to subscribe to the podcast.
4. Click OK to confirm.
iTunes downloads the podcast to your computer and switches to the
Podcasts selection in the Source pane. iTunes displays your newly sub-
scribed podcast in the List pane, as shown in Figure 4-10.
Figure 4-9:

5. (Optional) Get more episodes of the podcast.
When you subscribe to a podcast, you get the current episode. However,
each podcast can contain multiple episodes. To download previously
available episodes, click the triangle next to the podcast name in the List
pane (refer to Figure 4-10) to see the individual episodes, and then click
the Get button next to an episode to download it. For more information
about adding and deleting podcasts and podcast episodes, see Chapter 5.
6. To play the podcast in full, select it and click the Play button.
You can now play the podcast just like any other song in your iTunes
library. The blue dot next to a podcast means you haven’t yet played it.
As soon as you start listening to a podcast, the dot disappears. For more
information about playing podcasts, see Chapter 6.
Anyone can create a podcast and then submit it to the iTunes Store by following
Apple’s published guidelines. (Click the Submit a Podcast link on the Podcast
page in the iTunes Store.) In fact, the Rockument and the Flying Other Brothers
music podcasts, available in the iTunes Store (and from www.rockument.com),
are produced by this book’s author. You can find out more about creating pod-
casts in Podcasting For Dummies, by Tee Morris and Evo Terra (Wiley).
You can play the podcast, incorporate it into playlists, and make copies and
burn CDs as much as you like. See Chapter 5 for details on subscribing to,
deleting, and updating podcasts.

Browsing and Previewing iPod Games
Got Pac-Man? How about Ms. Pac-Man? The iTunes Store offers colorful
games to play on your iPod — all kinds of games, from Mini Golf and Mahjung
to the classic Tetris and Cubis 2. You can even play the wildly popular
Japanese game Sudoku. The games play on fifth- and sixth-generation iPods
that can play videos — not in iTunes itself. However, you can see a preview of
the game while browsing the iTunes Store.
To find the iPod games, click the iPod Games link in the iTunes STORE menu
on the iTunes Store home page. iTunes displays the iPod Games page with
thumbnail icons for each game. Click the game’s icon to go to the games
page. Click the Preview button on the game’s page to see a preview of the
game. Use the iTunes Play button, just as you would for a song, to play the
game preview. At any time or after the preview plays, click the Close Preview
button to return to the movie page.
Buying and Downloading Content
As you select content, you can purchase the items and download them to
your computer immediately. Alternatively, you can gather your selections 
in a virtual shopping cart first to see your choices and decide whether to 
purchase them before downloading them all at once.
Depending on how you set up your account, you can buy and download the
content immediately with the 1-Click option or place the items in your iTunes
Store Shopping Cart temporarily, to purchase and download later. You can
change your shopping method at any time.
Each time you buy content, you get an e-mail from the iTunes Store with the
purchase information. It’s nice to know right away what you bought.
Your decision to download each item immediately or add to a shopping cart
and download later is likely based on how your computer connects to the
Internet. If you have a slow connection such as a phone line, you probably
want to use the shopping cart to avoid tying up the phone with each download.
Using 1-Click
Apple offers 1-Click technology in the iTunes Store so that with one click,
your digital content immediately starts downloading to your computer —
and the purchase is done.
71
Chapter 4: Shopping at the iTunes Store

With 1-Click, you click the Buy button whether the item is a song, an album, a
TV show episode, or an audio book. For example, if you select a song in the
List pane, click the Buy Song button in the far-right column for the song. (You
might have to scroll your iTunes Store window to see the far-right column.)
When you select a TV show episode, click the Buy Episode button in the far-
right column. You can click the Buy Album button in an album advertisement.
With 1-Click, iTunes complies immediately.
The iTunes Store displays a warning dialog to make sure that you want to buy
the item, and you can then go through with it or cancel. If you click the Buy
button to purchase it, the song, album, audio book, or video download auto-
matically shows up in your iTunes library. The iTunes Store keeps track of
your purchases over a 24-hour period and charges a total sum rather than for
each single purchase.
1-Click seems more like two clicks. If you really want to use only one click to
buy an item from iTunes, select the Don’t Warn Me option in the warning
dialog so that you never see it again.
Using the shopping cart
You don’t have to use the 1-Click technology. Instead, you can add items to
the shopping cart to delay purchasing and downloading until you’re ready.
With the shopping cart, the iTunes Store remembers your selections, allow-
ing you to browse the iTunes Store at different times and add to your total
without making any purchases final. You can also remove items from the cart
at any time. When you’re ready to buy, you can purchase and download the
items in your cart in one fell swoop.
If you switch to the shopping cart method (see the following section,
“Changing your iTunes Store preferences”), the Buy button changes to an
Add button — as in Add Song, Add Album, Add Episode, and so on. After
adding items, you can view the selections in your shopping cart by selecting
the Shopping Cart option underneath the iTunes Store option in the Source
pane (see Figure 4-11).
The shopping cart appears in the List view with your selections listed, and
recommendations from the iTunes Store appear along the top of the window.
Albums appear with a triangle next to their name, which you can click to
open and see the album’s songs. As you can see in Figure 4-11, albums, indi-
vidual songs, music videos, TV episodes, and audio books are listed in alpha-
betical order by artist name (or TV show name, as in The Colbert Report).
72
Part I: Setting Up and Acquiring Media Content 

When you’re ready to purchase everything in your shopping cart, click the BUY
NOW button in the lower-right corner of the Shopping Cart view to close the
sale and download all the items at once. Alternatively, you can click the Buy
(for an album) or Buy Song buttons for each item that you want to purchase.
To delete items from your shopping cart, select them and press
Delete/Backspace. A warning appears asking whether you’re sure that you
want to remove the selected items. Click Yes to go ahead and remove the
selections from your shopping cart.
You can see the list of all the items that you purchased by selecting the
Purchased playlist under the iTunes Store option in the Source pane. The List
view and Browse view change to show the items you purchased.
Changing your iTunes Store preferences
You can change your shopping method by choosing iTunes➪Preferences on
the Mac or by choosing Edit➪Preferences in Windows. In the Preferences
window, click the Store button. The Store Preferences window appears, as
shown in Figure 4-12.
Figure 4-11:

Chapter 4: Shopping at the iTunes Store

You can set the following features:
 Change from 1-Click to Shopping Cart or vice versa. 1-Click is the default.
 Automatically download prepurchased content, such as a Season Pass of
TV show episodes. As the episodes become available, iTunes automati-
cally downloads them.
 When you purchase a collection of songs, such as an iMix prepared by
other iTunes Store visitors or a list of iTunes Essentials chosen by the
iTunes Store staff, you can set iTunes to automatically assign the collec-
tion to a new playlist by selecting the Automatically Create Playlists
When Buying Song Collections option. For details about using playlists,
see Chapter 10.
 For better playing performance (fewer hiccups) with previews over slow
Internet connections, select the Load Complete Preview before Playing
option. (It’s deselected by default.)
If you use more than one computer with your iTunes Store account, you can
set the preferences for each computer differently and still use the same
account. For example, your home computer might have a faster connection
than your laptop on a remote connection, so you can set your iTunes prefer-
ences accordingly: The home computer could be set to 1-Click, and the
laptop could be set to shopping cart.
Resuming interrupted downloads
All sales are final; you can’t return the digital merchandise. However, the
download must be successful — you have to receive it all — before the
iTunes Store charges you for the purchase. If for any reason the download is
Figure 4-12:

ences.
74
Part I: Setting Up and Acquiring Media Content 

interrupted or fails to complete, your order remains active until you connect
to the iTunes Store again.
iTunes remembers to continue the download when you return to iTunes and
connect to the Internet. If, for some reason, the download doesn’t continue,
choose Store➪Check for Purchases to continue the interrupted download.
You can also use this command to check for any purchased music that hasn’t
downloaded yet.
While downloading from the iTunes Store, you can select Downloads in the
Store section of the Source pane, as shown in Figure 4-13, to see the progress
of your downloads, and to pause and resume (or cancel) any particular
download.
For the impatient viewers, the iTunes Store lets you start watching a video or
movie before it finishes downloading. Click Downloads as you’re download-
ing and double-click the item to watch it. The download continues as you
watch from the beginning.
If your computer’s hard drive crashes and you lose your information, you
also lose all your digital content — you have to purchase and download them
again. However, you can mitigate this kind of disaster by backing up your
content library (which we describe in detail in Chapter 13), including backing
up video files. You can also burn your purchases to an audio CD, as we
describe in Chapter 14.

Redeeming gift certificates 
and prepaid cards
If you’re the fortunate recipient of an iTunes Store gift certificate, all you need
to do is go to the iTunes Store (we mean using iTunes online, of course; there
are no physical stores as of this writing) and set up a new account if you
don’t already have one. Recipients of gift certificates can set up new accounts
without having to provide a credit card number. As a recipient of a gift, you
can simply click None for the credit card option and use the gift certificate as
the sole payment method.
You can receive gift certificates on paper (delivered by the postal service) 
or by e-mail. You can also receive a prepaid card with a fixed balance. To
redeem a certificate, click the Redeem link in the Quick Links panel on the
right side of the iTunes Store home page to go to the Redeem page. In the
Redeem Code section of the Redeem page, type the number printed on the
certificate or supplied in the e-mail, and click the Redeem button to credit
your account. If you haven’t signed into your account yet or you have no
account, iTunes displays the sign-in dialog; for information about setting up
an account, see the “Setting Up an Account” section, earlier in this chapter.
If you use Apple’s Mail program or access your .Mac e-mail through the Safari
Web browser, you can redeem a gift certificate that was sent by e-mail by
clicking the Redeem Now button at the bottom of the e-mail message. This
button launches iTunes with the iTunes Store option selected in the Source
pane and displays the Redeem page with the certificate’s number automati-
cally filled in. Click the Redeem button to credit your account.
The balance of your gift certificate (how much you have left to spend)
appears right next to your account name in the iTunes Store window and is
updated as you make purchases.
Managing Your Account
Online stores record necessary information about you, such as your credit
card number, your billing address, and so forth. You can change this informa-
tion at any time, and you can also take advantage of iTunes Store account fea-
tures, such as sending gift certificates, setting parental controls, and setting
up allowance accounts.

Viewing and changing 
account information
Life is unpredictable. As John Lennon sang in “Beautiful Boy (Darling Boy),”
“Life is what happens to you while you’re busy making other plans.” So if
your billing address changes, or you need to switch to another credit card, or
you need to change your password for any reason, you can edit your account
information at any time.
To see your account information in the iTunes Store, click the Account
button that shows your account name, or click the Account link in the Quick
Links panel of the iTunes Store home page. iTunes displays a dialog for you
to enter your account password. Then click the View Account button to see
your account in the iTunes Store.
Your account page displays your Apple ID, the last four digits of the credit 
card that you use for the account, your billing address, your most recent 
purchase, and your computer authorizations. (See “Authorizing computers 
to play purchased music,” later in this chapter.) You can click buttons to 
edit your account and credit card information, and also to manage alerts
(e-mail messages sent by iTunes about new releases from artists that are
listed in your purchase history). You can also manage your iMix playlists 
(see Chapter 10 for details on how to create and manage an iMix), and view
your purchase history.
Viewing your purchase history
In the rock ’n’ roll lifestyle, you might recall songs from the 1960s but not
remember what you bought last week. To view your purchase history, go to
your account page by clicking the Account button (top-right corner), or click
the Account link in the Quick Links panel of the iTunes Store home page, and
then type your password to log into your account. Click the View Account
button; on your account page, click the Purchase History button.
The iTunes Store displays the items that you purchased, starting with the
most recent. If you bought a lot of content, not all of the items appear on the
first page. To see the details of previous purchases, click the arrow to the left
of the order date. After viewing your history, click Done at the bottom of the
history page to return to your account page.

Chapter 4: Shopping at the iTunes Store

Setting up allowances
Do you trust your kids with your credit card? You don’t have to answer that,
but you can sidestep the entire issue by gifting an allowance account that lets
you set the amount of credit each month, from $10–$200 in increments of $10.
You can change the amount of an allowance or stop it at any time. (And if
these accounts are for kids, put your mind at rest by reading “Setting
parental controls,” later in this chapter.)
To use an allowance account, the recipient must be using iTunes version 4 
or newer and live in a country where the iTunes Store is available on the
Internet (such as the United States).
You can set up the allowance account yourself or define an allowance on an
existing account. The recipient signs in to the account and types his or her
password — no credit card required. When the recipient reaches the limit 
of the allowance, that account can’t buy anything else until the following
month. The iTunes Store saves any unused balance until the next iTunes
Store purchase.
To set up an allowance account, click the Buy iTunes Gifts link in the Quick
Links panel on the right side of the iTunes Store home page. Scroll the result-
ing Buy iTunes Gifts page to the bottom to find and click the Set up allowance
now link in the Allowances section. iTunes takes you to the Allowance Setup
page, where you can enter your name, your recipient’s name, the monthly
allowance amount (using the Monthly Allowance pop-up menu), and your
recipient’s Apple ID and password.
Click Continue to proceed with the account setup process, and then follow
the instructions to finish setting up the account.
To stop an allowance or change the amount of an allowance account, go to
your account page by clicking the Account button (top-right corner), or click
the Account link in the Quick Links panel of the iTunes Store home page, and
then type your password to log into your account. Click the View Account
button and scroll the account page until you see the Setup Allowance button;
click this button to go to the Allowance page.
Sending gift certificates
A song is a gift that keeps on giving every time the recipient plays the song. 
A gift of a music video or TV show might commemorate a special occasion.
Besides, you can’t go wrong giving an iTunes Store gift certificate to that 
special person who has everything. You can send a certificate as an e-mail
message or print the certificate yourself on your own printer.
78
Part I: Setting Up and Acquiring Media Content 

Before sending a gift certificate, first make sure that the recipient can run
iTunes 4 or newer versions. Also, he or she must be able to run iTunes 6 or
newer versions for video. (You might want to subtly suggest to the future
recipient in an e-mail that it’s time to download the newest version of iTunes,
just to find out whether he or she has the requisite system configuration; see
Chapter 1.)
To buy a gift certificate to send to someone, click the Buy iTunes Gifts link in
the Quick Links panel on the right side of the iTunes Store home page. Scroll
the resulting Buy iTunes Gifts page to the Printable Gift Certificates or Email
Gift Certificates sections. Click the Buy Now link in either section to start the
process of buying a gift certificate. Follow the instructions to enter your
name, the recipient’s name, the recipient’s e-mail or snail mail address (for
printed certificates), the amount of the gift, and a personal message.
Setting parental controls
Art may imitate life, but there are times when you might not want life to imi-
tate art — or in this case, your kids’ lives to be exposed to entertainment you
deem inappropriate. iTunes not only provides a Parental Advisory Label next
to explicit items in the online store but also lets you restrict explicit content
from displaying in the iTunes Store. You can also disable podcasts, radio 
content, the iTunes Store itself, and shared music so that these items don’t
appear in the Source pane.
To set parental controls, choose iTunes➪Preferences on the Mac or Edit➪
Preferences in Windows. In the Preferences window that appears, click the
Parental tab to see the Parental Control preferences.
You can click the options to disable podcasts, radio stations, the iTunes
Store, and shared libraries so that they sources of content don’t appear in
the iTunes Source pane.
To restrict content itself, you can choose a rating system for a specific coun-
try in the Ratings For pop-up menu, and then click options to restrict movies
and TV shows using the chosen country’s rating levels available in pop-up
menus. You can also click the option to restrict all explicit content.
After selecting options, click the Lock icon to prevent further changes. iTunes
displays a dialog requiring you to type the administrator password for your
computer system. Click OK after typing the password, and then click OK
again to close iTunes preferences so that the changes take effect.
To make changes later, click the Lock icon to unlock the preferences, and
type this administrator password again.
79
Chapter 4: Shopping at the iTunes Store

Authorizing computers to 
play purchased music
The computer that you use to set up your account is automatically authorized
by Apple to play the content you buy from the iTunes Store. Fortunately, the
content isn’t locked to that computer. You can copy your purchased songs,
audio books, podcasts, and videos to other computers and play them with
iTunes. When you first play them on the other computers, iTunes asks for
your iTunes Store account ID and password to authorize that computer. You
can have up to five computers authorized at any one time. You can also 
authorize a computer at any time by choosing Store➪Authorize Computer.
Purchased songs, audio books, and videos need to be downloaded or copied
to one of your authorized computers before you can copy them from the
added computer to an iPod using iTunes.
If you want to delete one computer and add another computer, you can
remove the authorization from a computer by choosing Store➪Deauthorize
Computer on that computer. If you need to deauthorize a computer that no
longer works, you can contact Apple through its iTunes Store support page
(www.apple.com/support/itunes/store/authorization).
Remember to deauthorize your computer before you upgrade it, sell it, or
give it away. Also, we recommend that you deauthorize your computer before
upgrading your RAM, hard drive, or other system components. Otherwise,
the upgraded system might count as another authorized computer. If you’ve
reached five authorizations due to system upgrades or failed computers, 
you can reset your authorization count by clicking Deauthorize All on the
Account Information screen. You can do this only once per year. The
Deauthorize All button appears only if you have five authorized computers
and you haven’t used the option in the last 12 months.

Part I: Setting Up and Acquiring Media Content 

Adding Music
Bringing music tracks from a CD into iTunes is ripping a CD. We’re not sure
why it’s called that, but Apple certainly took the term to a new level with an
ad campaign for Macs that featured the slogan Rip, Mix, Burn. Burning a mix
CD was the hip thing to do a few years ago. With iTunes, you can still rip and
mix, but if you have an iPod, you no longer need to burn CDs to play your
music wherever you go.
Ripping, in technical terms, is extracting the song’s digital information from
an audio CD. In common terms, ripping also includes compressing the song’s
digital information and encoding it in a particular sound file format. The rip-
ping process is straightforward, but the import settings that you choose
affect sound quality, hard drive space (and iPod space), and compatibility
with other types of players and computers.
Setting the importing preferences
Although importing music from an audio CD takes a lot less time than playing
the CD, it still takes time. To minimize that time, you want your import set-
tings to be correct before starting. To do this
1. Choose iTunes➪Preferences-->Advanced on a Mac or Edit➪
Preferences➪Advanced in Windows.
The iTunes Preferences dialog, with the Advanced tab showing, opens.
2. Click the Importing tab.
The Importing preferences appear, as shown in Figure 5-1.
The Importing preferences tab offers the following options, which you set
before ripping a CD:
 On CD Insert: From this menu, choose from the following to take the
appropriate action immediately after you insert an audio CD: 
• Show the CD: iTunes does nothing else.
• Playing: See Chapter 3 for details on playing CDs.
• Ask to Import CD: iTunes displays a dialog asking whether you want
to import the CD.
• Import CD: iTunes uses the current importing preferences and 
automatically imports the CD. Don’t use this setting unless you’re
sure that you’ve set your preferences to your liking for automatic
importing.
82
Part I: Setting Up and Acquiring Media Content 

• Import CD and Eject. iTunes automatically imports and then ejects the
CD, making way for the next one. This option is useful for importing a
batch of CDs. Don’t use this setting unless you’re sure that you’ve set
your preferences to your liking for automatic importing.
 Import Using: Set this pop-up menu to one of the encoders. For more
information that can help you choose the right encoder for your music,
see Chapter 18.
 Setting: Set this pop-up menu to High Quality or better for most music.
You can change this setting to get better quality or use hard drive space
more efficiently, as we describe in Chapter 19.
 Play Songs While Importing or Converting: Select this check box to
play the songs at the same time that you start ripping them. This option
slows down the speed of importing, but hey — you get to listen to the
music right away.
 Automatically Retrieve CD Track Names from Internet: iTunes auto-
matically grabs the song titles, artist names, album titles, and so forth
directly from the Internet database of songs, as we describe in Chapter 9.
We recommend that you select this option (assuming that you’re con-
nected to the Internet, that is).

Chapter 5
Bringing Content into iTunes
In This Chapter
 Setting your music importing preferences
 Ripping music from CDs and adding music files
 Adding audio books and video files to your library
 Subscribing to podcasts on Web sites
T
hree excellent reasons to bring your music CDs into iTunes, or to 
download media files from the iTunes Store into iTunes, are
 To preserve the content forever
 To play the content easily from your computer (without having to
fumble with discs)
 To take the content in your iPod with you
In this chapter, we show you how to store content in your iTunes library. 
A song or video in digital format can be kept in that format in a file on any
number of digital media storage devices. Even if your CDs, DVDs, and hard
drive fail, your backup copy (assuming that you made a backup copy on a
safety CD or hard drive) is still as perfect as the original digital file. You may
make any number of digital copies with no technical limitations on playing
the copies except those imposed by the iTunes Store for content that you
purchase.
While you add more content, your iTunes library becomes your entertain-
ment center. With it, you can find any item you want to play faster than you
can open a CD jewel case, as we show in Chapter 8. Your iTunes library also
manages your content and makes it easy to transfer some, or all of it, to your
iPod (see Chapter 12).

 Create Filenames with Track Number: Select this check box to include
the track number in the filenames created by iTunes for the songs that
you rip. Including the track number makes it easier to find tracks on an
iPod when using a car’s audio controls — that is, if you’ve connected
your iPod to a car stereo system, which Chapter 20 covers.
 Use Error Correction When Reading Audio CDs: Although you’ll
reduce importing speed, select this check box to use error correction if
you have problems with audio quality or if the CD skips. (Not every skip-
ping CD can be imported even with error correction, but it might help.)
 The Import Using pop-up menu: This menu gives you the opportunity to
set the type of encoding, and this choice is perhaps the most important.
 The Setting pop-up menu: This offers different settings depending on
your choice of encoder. For example, in Figure 5-1, we chose the AAC
Encoder with the High Quality setting. In Figure 5-2, we switched to the
MP3 Encoder in the Import Using pop-up menu, and we’re in the process
of choosing Higher Quality from the Setting pop-up menu.

Encoding is a complicated subject that requires a whole chapter to explain.
(In fact, Chapter 18 provides an in-depth look if you want to know more.) 
For a quick and pain-free ripping session, choose from among the following
encoders in the Import Using pop-up menu based on how you plan to use
your iTunes library:
 AAC Encoder: We recommend AAC for all uses. (However, AIFF or WAV
is better if you plan to burn another CD with the songs you ripped and
not use them in your iPod.) Choose the High Quality option from the
Setting pop-up menu.
You can convert a song that’s been ripped in AIFF, Apple Lossless, or
WAV to AAC or MP3. However, ripping a CD with one encoder might be
more convenient. After that, you can rip it again with a different encoder.
For example, you might import Sgt. Pepper’s Lonely Hearts Club Band
with the AAC encoder for use in your Mac and iPod and then import it
again with the AIFF encoder. You might call the album Sgt. Pepper-2, for
example, in order to burn songs onto a CD. After burning the CD, you
can delete Sgt. Pepper-2 to re-claim the hard drive space.
 AIFF Encoder: Use AIFF if you plan to burn the song to an audio CD
using a Mac (use WAV for Windows). AIFF offers the highest possible
quality, but it takes up a lot of space (about 10MB per minute). Choose
the Automatic option from the Setting pop-up menu for best results, or
consult Chapter 19 for details on setting custom options. Don’t use AIFF
format for songs that you intend to transfer to your iPod; convert them
first to AAC or MP3.
 Apple Lossless Encoder: Use the Apple Lossless encoder for songs that
you intend to burn onto audio CDs as well as for playing on iPods. The
files are just small enough (about 60–70 percent of the size of the AIFF
versions) that they don’t hiccup on playback.
 MP3 Encoder: Use the MP3 format for songs that you intend to burn on
MP3 CDs or that you intend to use with MP3 players or your iPod — it’s
universally supported. If you use MP3, we recommend choosing the
Higher Quality option from the Setting pop-up menu.
 WAV Encoder: WAV is the high-quality sound format that’s used on PCs
(like AIFF), but it also takes up a lot of space (about 10MB per minute).
Use WAV if you plan on burning the song to an audio CD or using WAV
with PCs. Choose the Automatic option from the Setting pop-up menu
for best results, or consult Chapter 19 for details on setting custom
options. Don’t use WAV for songs that you intend to transfer to your
iPod. Convert them first to AAC or MP3, as we describe in Chapter 19.

Chapter 5: Bringing Content into iTunes

Don’t fall into the gaps
Some CDs — particularly live concert albums, classical albums, rock operas
(such as The Who’s Tommy), and theme albums (such as Sgt. Pepper’s Lonely
Hearts Club Band by The Beatles) — are meant to be played straight through,
with no fading between the songs. Although you can cross-fade between
songs automatically in iTunes, you can’t on your iPod.
Fortunately, you can turn on the Gapless Album option for multiple songs
such as Side 1 of an album or an entire album. With the Gapless Album option
set in iTunes, songs play seamlessly one to the next. You can also play these
songs seamlessly on fifth-generation iPods (and second-generation iPod
nanos) that have the latest software update.
To turn on the Gapless Album option for an entire CD before importing it,
follow these steps:
1. Select the CD in the Source pane.
The CD title appears in the Source pane under Devices. Click the title to
select it.
2. Choose File➪Get Info.
The CD Info dialog opens, as shown in Figure 5-3.
3. Select the check box next to the Gapless Album option and then 
click OK.
To turn on the Gapless Album option for multiple songs on the CD but not the
entire CD, follow these steps:
1. Select the songs.
From the album, select the songs that you want to play continuously.

2. Choose File➪Get Info and then click Yes in the warning dialog about
editing multiple items.
The Multiple Item Information dialog opens, as shown in Figure 5-4.
3. Choose Yes from the Gapless Album pop-up menu.
To turn on the Gapless Album option for one song at a time, click the song
and choose File➪Get Info. Click the Options tab and then select the Part of 
a Gapless Album option for each song.
What happens if you turn on Crossfade Playback for playing songs in iTunes,
as we describe in Chapter 6, but you don’t want to cross-fade between spe-
cific songs on an album that has no gaps? You don’t have to keep turning
Crossfade Playback on and off: Simply deselect the Gapless Album option 
for those songs.
For older iPod models, or as an alternative to using the Gapless Album
option, you can use the Join Tracks option when ripping a CD to join the
tracks in your iTunes library so that they play seamlessly on an iPod. To 
join tracks, select the tracks and choose Advanced➪Join CD Tracks. You 
can join tracks only when ripping a CD, not afterward.
To select multiple songs, click the first one, press Ô on a Mac or Ctrl in
Windows, and click each subsequent song. To select several consecutive
songs, click the first one, hold down the Shift key, and then click the last one.

Chapter 5: Bringing Content into iTunes

Ripping music from CDs
After checking your importing preferences to be sure that your settings are
correct, you’re ready to rip. To rip a CD, follow these steps:
1. Insert an audio CD.
The songs appear in the List pane as generic, unnamed tracks at first. If
your computer is connected to the Internet, you’ve turned on the option
to automatically retrieve song information from the Internet, and the CD
is in the Gracenote database (described in Chapter 9), iTunes automati-
cally retrieves the track information.
If the first attempt at retrieving song information doesn’t work and you
see unnamed tracks, check your connection to the Internet and then
choose Advanced➪Get CD Track Names to try again to get the track
information. If you don’t want to connect to the Internet or if your CD
isn’t recognized by the Gracenote database, you can type the track infor-
mation yourself (see Chapter 9).
2. (Optional) Deselect the check boxes next to any songs on the CD that
you don’t want to import.
iTunes imports only the songs that have check marks next to them;
when you remove the check mark next to a song, iTunes skips that song.
Be sure to set your importing preferences and the Gapless Album option
to your liking before actually ripping the CD.
3. Click the Import button.
The Import button is at the bottom-right corner of the iTunes window.
The status display shows the progress of the operation. To cancel, click
the small x next to the progress bar in the status display.
iTunes plays the songs while it imports them if you previously set the
option in the importing preferences to play them while importing. You
can click the Pause button to stop playback, but the importing contin-
ues. If you don’t want to listen to the songs while they import, deselect
the Play Songs While Importing check box in the iTunes Preferences
dialog. (See the earlier section, “Setting the importing preferences.”)
iTunes displays an orange, animated waveform icon next to the song
that it’s importing. When iTunes finishes importing each song, it dis-
plays a check mark next to the song, as shown in Figure 5-5. (On a color
monitor, the check mark is green.) iTunes chimes when it finishes the
import list.
4. When all the songs are imported, eject the CD by clicking the Eject
button at the lower-right corner of the iTunes window.
You can also choose Controls➪Eject Disc to eject the disc, or click the
Eject icon next to the disc name in the Source pane.
88
Part I: Setting Up and Acquiring Media Content 

Adding music files
The quality of the music that you hear depends initially on the quality of the
source. Web sites and services offering music files vary widely. Some sites
provide high-quality, legally derived songs that you can download, and some
sites provide only streaming audio that you can play — but not save — on
your hard drive or on a CD (such as a Web radio station).
The allegedly illegal file-sharing services offering MP3 files might vary in qual-
ity. Unauthorized copies of songs might be saved in a lower-quality format to
save space and download time, so beware of less-than-high-quality knockoffs.
You can download the music file or copy it from another computer to your
hard drive. After you save or copy an MP3 file — or, for that matter, an AIFF
or WAV file — on your hard drive, you can simply drag it into the iTunes
window to bring it into your library. If you drag a folder or disk icon, all the
audio files that it contains are added to your iTunes library. You can also
choose File➪Add to Library as an alternative to dragging.
When you add a song to your iTunes library, a copy is placed inside the
iTunes Music folder: that is, as long as you have your iTunes preferences set
for Copy Files to iTunes Music Folder When Adding to Library. (This is the
default setting, which you can find in the General pane of the Advanced tab of
the iTunes Preferences dialog.) See Chapter 13 for details on storing music in
your iTunes Music folder.
Figure 5-5:

89
Chapter 5: Bringing Content into iTunes

If you have song files in another folder or another hard drive, and you want to
add them to the iTunes library without copying the files to the iTunes Music
folder, you can copy a link to the original files without copying the files. To
copy only links to song files and not copy the actual files when you add songs,
you can turn off the default copy files option by doing the following:
1. Choose iTunes➪Preferences (Mac) or Edit➪Preferences (Windows).
2. Click the Advanced tab in the iTunes Preferences dialog.
3. Click the General tab under the Advanced tab.
4. Turn off the Copy Files to iTunes Music Folder When Adding to
Library setting.
You can check out the contents of your music folder by using the Finder on 
a Mac or Windows Explorer on a Windows PC. On the Mac, the iTunes Music
folder lives in the iTunes folder inside the Music folder in your Home folder.
The path to this folder is your home folder/Music/iTunes/iTunes
Music. In Windows, the iTunes Music folder resides in the iTunes folder
inside the My Music folder of the My Documents folder in your user folder.
The path to this folder is Your User folder\My Documents\My Music\
iTunes\iTunes Music. These are the default locations; you can change the
default folder by following these steps:
1. Choose iTunes➪Preferences on a Mac or Edit➪Preferences in
Windows.
2. Click the Advanced tab in the iTunes Preferences dialog.
3. Click the General tab under the Advanced tab.
4. Choose a new location for the music folder.
When you bring a song file into iTunes, the song is copied into a new file in
the iTunes library without changing or deleting the original file. You can then
convert the song to another format. For example, you can convert an AIFF file
to an MP3 file while leaving the original intact. Find out about converting
your songs to a different format in Chapter 19.
MP3 CDs are easy to add because they’re essentially data CDs. Simply insert
them into your CD-ROM drive, open the CD in the Finder, and drag and drop
the MP3 song files into the iTunes window. Downloaded song files are even
easier — just drag and drop the files into iTunes. If you drag a folder or CD
icon, all the audio files it contains are added to your iTunes library.
Visit the companion Web site to find out how to bring any sound into iTunes,
even music from scratchy vinyl records or sound effects recorded through a
microphone. You might want to import unusual sounds or digitize and pre-
serve rare music that can’t be found anywhere else.
90
Part I: Setting Up and Acquiring Media Content 

How do you get stuff like that into iTunes? On a Mac, you can use GarageBand,
which is part of the iLife suite (available from the Apple Store and preinstalled
on all new Macs), or use a sound-editing program such as CD Spin Doctor
(about $40) from Roxio (www.roxio.com), or Sound Studio 3 (about $80)
from Freeverse (www.freeverse.com/soundstudio). These programs typi-
cally record from any analog source device, such as a tape player or even a
turntable. Sound Studio 3 lets you record and digitize directly to your hard
drive on a Mac running OS X. CD Spin Doctor for Mac OS X provides special
features for recording music from vinyl records. Many commercial applica-
tions are available to choose from that work with Windows, including
RecordNow 9 Music Lab Premier (about $50) from Roxio.
You may also use MusicMatch Jukebox to record sound through a PC’s line-in
connection. If you’re using MusicMatch, visit this book’s companion Web site.
AIFF- or WAV-encoded sound files occupy too much space in your music
library and on your iPod. Voice recordings and sound effects tend to be 
low-fidelity and typically don’t sound any better in AIFF or WAV format than
they do in formats that save hard drive space. Also, sound effects and voice
recordings are typically mono instead of stereo. You can save hard drive and
iPod space and still have quality recordings by converting these files to MP3
or AAC formats, changing them from stereo to mono in the process, and leav-
ing the original versions intact. We describe converting songs in Chapter 19.
Adding Audio Books
Do you like to listen to audio books and spoken magazine and newspaper
articles? Not only can you bring these files into iTunes, but you can also
transfer them to an iPod and take them on the road, which is much more 
convenient than taking cassettes or CDs.
Audible is a leading provider of downloadable, spoken audio files. Audible lets
you authorize computers to play the audio files — just like the iTunes Store;
see Chapter 4. Audible does require that you purchase the files, and content
from Audible is also licensed by Apple to be included in the iTunes Store.
Audible content includes magazines and radio programs as well as books.
To import Audible files, follow these steps:
1. Go to www.audible.com.
Set up an account if you don’t already have one.
2. Select and download an Audible audio file.
Files that end with .aa are Audible files.
91
Chapter 5: Bringing Content into iTunes

3. Drag the Audible file to the iTunes window.
If this is the first time that you’ve added an Audible file, iTunes asks for
your account information. You enter this information once for each com-
puter that you use with your Audible account.
To disable an Audible account, open iTunes on the computer that you no
longer want to use with the account, and choose Advanced➪Deauthorize
Audible Account. In the Deauthorize Audible Account dialog that appears,
enter the user name and password for the account, and then click OK.
You need to be online to authorize a computer or to remove the authorization
from that computer.
Adding Podcasts
You can add podcasts to your iTunes library by subscribing to them in the
iTunes Store (as we describe in Chapter 4) or by subscribing to them directly
from Web sites that host them. Similar to a tape of a radio broadcast, you can
save and play a podcast at your convenience — both in iTunes on your com-
puter and on your iPod.
A podcast can be anything from a single song or video to a radio or TV show.
Audio podcasts are saved in the MP3 format and may be used with any media
player, device, or application that supports MP3, including your iPod. Video
podcasts are saved in the QuickTime (.mov) format or the Moving Pictures
Expert Group (MPEG-4) formats, including the standard .mp4 format and the
Apple TV .m4v format, which can be used with iPods (that play video), Apple
TV, and many other video players.
The podcast producer uses Real Simple Syndication (RSS) technology — 
the same technology used to distribute blogs and news feeds across the
Internet — to publish the podcast. RSS feeds are typically linked to an RSS 
or an eXtensible Markup Language (XML; the language of RSS) button. With a
feed reader, aggregator application, or browser plug-in, you can automatically
check RSS-enabled Web pages and display updated stories and podcasts. RSS
version 2, the most popular version for podcasting, is supported directly by
some Web browsers, including Apple’s Safari for Mac OS X.
With iTunes, you can play a podcast, incorporate it into playlists, make
copies, and burn it onto CD as much as you like. If you don’t like the podcast,
simply delete it from your iTunes library and update your iPod to delete it
from your iPod.
92
Part I: Setting Up and Acquiring Media Content 

Subscribing to podcasts
The Podcasts section of the iTunes Store offers access to thousands of pod-
casts, but more than a million podcasts exist, many of which are available
only by visiting their Web sites. You can subscribe to podcasts directly from
iTunes without ever visiting the iTunes Store. However, the store makes it
easy to subscribe to the podcasts, so check there first. Turn to Chapter 4 to
see how to subscribe to podcasts in the iTunes Store.
By subscribing, we mean simply listing the podcast in your iTunes Podcasts
pane so that new episodes are downloaded automatically. It’s like a magazine
subscription that’s updated with a new issue every month or so. You don’t
have to register or fill out any form. You don’t have to provide an e-mail
address or any other information. Your copy of iTunes automatically finds
new podcast episodes and downloads them to your computer.
The easiest way to subscribe to a podcast is through the iTunes Store. If you
can’t find a podcast in the store and you know how to find its Web site, use
your browser and then go to that Web site. To subscribe to a podcast on a
Web page, follow these steps:
1. In your browser, Control-click (Mac) or right-click (Windows) the pod-
cast’s RSS2 link on the Web page.
Look for the RSS version 2 link on the Web page. Many sites use an icon,
as shown in Figure 5-6.
2. Copy the podcast’s RSS2 link.
• Safari: Choose Copy Link.
• Firefox or Internet Explorer: Choose Copy Link Location.
When you paste it, the link should look something like
http://www.rockument.com/blog/?feed=RSS2
3. In iTunes, choose Advanced➪Subscribe to Podcast.
The Subscribe to Podcast dialog opens, as shown in Figure 5-7.
4. Paste the RSS2 link by choosing Edit➪Paste and then click OK.
As an alternative, you can also press Ô-V on a Mac or Ctrl-V in Windows.
iTunes downloads the podcast to your computer and switches to the
Podcasts selection in the Source pane.
5. Click the i icon to see information about the podcast.
You can click the i icon on the far-right podcast listing margin, as shown
in Figure 5-8, to display separate information about the podcast’s newest
episode.
93
Chapter 5: Bringing Content into iTunes

6. Select the podcast and then click the Play button.
You can now play the podcast just like a song or video in your iTunes
library. You can use the iTunes playback controls to fast-forward,
rewind, or play the podcast from any point. The blue dot next to a pod-
cast means you haven’t played it yet. As soon as you start listening to or
watching a podcast, the dot disappears.
Podcasts don’t show up in Party Shuffle unless you drag them into the Party
Shuffle playlist; see Chapter 6.
If the podcaster embedded a photo in an audio podcast file or included a link to
a video from the file, the photo or video content appears in the Artwork pane.

Updating podcasts
Many podcast feeds provide new material on a regular schedule. iTunes 
can check these feeds automatically and update your library with new 
podcast episodes. You can, for example, schedule iTunes to check for 
new podcast episodes — such as news, weather, traffic reports, and morning
talk shows — before you wake up and automatically update your iPod. When
you get up, you have new podcast episodes to listen to in your iPod.
To check for updates manually, select Podcasts in the Source pane and then
click the Refresh button in the lower-right corner of the Podcasts pane. All
subscribed podcast feeds are updated immediately when you click Refresh,
and iTunes downloads the most recent (or all) episodes, depending on how
you set your podcasts preferences to schedule podcast updates.
Scheduling podcast updates
To set your podcast preferences so iTunes can check for new podcasts auto-
matically, choose iTunes➪Preferences on a Mac or Edit➪Preferences in
Windows. In the iTunes Preferences dialog, click the Podcasts tab to display
the podcast preferences, as shown in Figure 5-9.
Figure 5-8:
Display

95
Chapter 5: Bringing Content into iTunes

You can schedule your podcasts with these settings:
 Check for New Episodes: Choose to check for podcasts every hour, day,
week, or manually — whenever you want.
 When New Episodes Are Available: You can download the most recent
one (useful for news podcasts), download all episodes (useful for pod-
casts you might want to keep), or nothing so that you can use the
Refresh button to update manually as you need.
 Keep: Choose to keep all episodes, all unplayed episodes, the most
recent episodes, or previous episodes.
Keeping unplayed episodes is a useful way to organize your news pod-
casts. If you’ve played an episode (or a portion of it), you likely don’t
need it anymore, but you probably do want to keep the ones you haven’t
played yet. Set iTunes to automatically delete podcast episodes that you
don’t want to keep.
If you copy podcasts automatically during an update of your iPod, as we
describe in Chapter 12, don’t set the Keep All Unplayed Episodes option
in iTunes. This is why: If you listen to part of a podcast episode on your
iPod and then update your iPod, the podcast episode disappears from
iTunes (because it is no longer unplayed). But don’t worry; the episodes
are still out there. You can always recover one by choosing to download
all episodes on the Podcasts tab of the iTunes Preferences dialog.
Adding Videos
Besides purchasing and downloading videos from the iTunes Store, as we
describe in Chapter 4, you can also download videos from the Internet or
copy them from other computers and bring them into iTunes to use with
your video-enabled iPod.

Part I: Setting Up and Acquiring Media Content 

You can watch QuickTime and MPEG-4 movies (files that end in .mov, .m4v, 
or .mp4) in iTunes and use them in a video-enabled iPod and with Apple TV.
QuickTime, the Apple digital video file format, is installed on every Mac. It’s
also installed on PCs along with the Windows version of iTunes. QuickTime is
used extensively in the digital video production world for making DVDs and
movies for the Web. Music videos, movie trailers, and other videos you can buy
on the iTunes Store are in the QuickTime format. MPEG-4 is a standard format
for digital video that works on just about any computer that plays video.
You can drag the video into iTunes just like a song file. Drag each video file
from the Mac Finder or Windows Desktop to the library, directly to a playlist
in the iTunes Source pane, or to the Album view on the right side of the
iTunes window, as shown in Figure 5-10.
The video files that you drag into iTunes, along with the movies you purchase
from the iTunes Store, display in the Movies section of your iTunes library —
click Movies in the Source pane (refer to Figure 5-10).
Video files are organized in folders and stored in the music library on your
hard drive just like song files. You can find the video file’s location on your hard
drive and its type by choosing File➪Get Info.
You can create your own QuickTime or MPEG-4 video files with a suitable
video-editing application, such as iMovie for the Mac (part of the iLife soft-
ware suite that includes iTunes), or Apple QuickTime Pro for Windows, avail-
able from the Apple Store.

I
f you like to entertain folks by spinning tunes and playing videos at home 
or at parties, iTunes could easily become your media jockey console.
Imagine how much music you could have at your fingertips with an iTunes
library that can grow as large as your hard drive. You can fit more than 20,000
songs, or 64 days of nonstop music, in about 100GB of hard drive space. When
we last checked the Apple store, you could buy a 2 terabyte (TB) external drive
for either Mac or PC that would probably hold enough music to run a radio 
station. But that’s not all: You can also manage your videos and favorite TV
shows and play them in full-screen mode on your computer running iTunes.
Your computer is already a mean multimedia machine with the capability 
to mix sounds, photos, and videos. You can play music through your com-
puter’s built-in speakers or through headphones, but you’ll get better results
with high-quality external speakers. You can even connect your home com-
puter to an excellent stereo for high-quality sound. The same is true for video:
You can use iTunes to play video on your computer’s display, or you can send
it to a larger television or display monitor — even a video projector — to get a
bigger picture.
And if you’ve integrated Apple TV with your home stereo and television, you
can use iTunes to feed music to Apple TV, which has its own hard drive. See
Chapter 7 for details on using Apple TV.

Changing the Computer’s Output Volume
You can control the volume and other characteristics of the sound coming
from your computer’s speakers, headphones, or external speakers. Even if
you connect your computer to a stereo amplifier with its own volume and
equalizer controls, it’s best to get the volume correct at the source — your
computer and iTunes — and then adjust the output volume as you please on
your stereo or external speaker unit.
You control the volume by using your computer system’s audio controls.
iTunes also controls the volume, but that control is within the limits of the
computer’s volume setting. For example, if you set your computer’s volume
to half and set iTunes volume to full, you get half volume because the com-
puter limits the volume to half. If you set your computer volume at half and
also reduce the iTunes volume to half, you actually get one-quarter volume —
half the computer’s setting. After the sound leaves your computer, you can
adjust it further with the volume controls of your stereo system or external
speakers.
The appropriate volume depends entirely on your preferences for hearing
music, audio books, or video soundtracks. In general, though, the maximum
level of output from your computer is preferable when connecting to a stereo
system or speakers with volume controls. After setting your computer to 
the maximum volume, adjust the iTunes volume or your stereo or speaker
volume (or both) to get the best sound. When using the computer’s speakers
or headphones, the computer’s volume and the iTunes volume are the only
volume controls that you have, so after adjusting the volume on your com-
puter to the maximum level (or lower if you prefer), adjust the iTunes volume.
Adjusting the sound on a Mac
The Mac was built for sound from the very start. Making and playing music
has been part of the Mac culture since the day that Steve Jobs introduced an
audience to the original Mac with sound coming from its small speaker. (It
played synthesized speech and simple tones, but it was the first personal
computer with built-in sound.)
Today’s Mac comes with built-in or external speakers and at least one head-
phone/line-out connection that you can use to connect external speakers or 
a stereo system. Mac OS X lets you configure output speakers and control
levels for stereo speakers and multichannel audio devices.
If you use external speakers, headphones, or a stereo system, make sure that
you connect these devices properly before adjusting the volume.

To adjust the volume on your Mac, follow these steps:
1. Choose System Preferences from the Apple menu or the Dock and
then click the Sound icon.
Otherwise, press Option and a volume control key simultaneously as a
shortcut. You can have iTunes open and playing music while you do this.
2. In the Sound preferences window that opens, click Output and select
the sound output device.
If you have headphones or external speakers attached to the head-
phones connection on your Mac, a Headphones option appears in the

Speakers or Internal Speakers option appears.
3. Adjust the volume.
You can do any of the following:
• Drag the slider to adjust the volume while you listen to music.
• Select the Mute check box to silence your Mac.
• Drag the Balance slider to put more music in the left or right 
channels.
4. Close the Preferences window. Choose System Preferences➪Quit

Using AirTunes for Wireless 
Stereo Playback
You want to play the music in your iTunes library, but your stereo system is
in another room, and you don’t want wires going from one room to the other.
What you need is an AirPort in your home — specifically, AirPort Express
with AirTunes, which lets you play your iTunes music through your stereo or
powered speakers in any room of your house, without wires. The only catch
is that your computer must be within range of AirPort Express.
Apple’s AirPort technology provides Wi-Fi wireless networking for any AirPort-
equipped Mac or PC that uses a Wi-Fi–certified IEEE 802.11b or 802.11g wire-
less card or offers built-in Wi-Fi. For more about AirPort, see Mac OS X Tiger
All-in-One Desk Reference For Dummies, by Mark L. Chambers (Wiley).
To use a stereo system or powered speakers with AirTunes, connect the
system or speakers to the AirPort Express audio port. iTunes automatically
detects the connection.
If you already have a wireless network in place, you can add AirPort Express
and AirTunes without changing anything. Connect the AirPort Express Base
Station to the stereo system or powered speakers and then plug the Base
Station into an electrical outlet. The AirPort Express Base Station wirelessly
links to your existing wireless network without requiring any change to the
network.
You can use several AirPort Express Base Stations — one for each stereo
system or set of powered speakers, in different rooms — and then choose
which stereo/speaker system to use from the pop-up menu.
To use AirTunes and AirPort Express, follow these steps:
1. Install the software supplied with AirPort Express.
The CD-ROM includes support for AirTunes.
2. Connect your stereo or a set of powered speakers to the AirPort
Express audio port.
You can use an optical digital or analog audio cable. (Both are included
in the AirPort Express Stereo Connection Kit available from the Apple
Store.) Which cable you use depends on whether your stereo or set of
powered speakers has an optical digital or analog connection.
103
Chapter 6: Playing Content in iTunes

3. Plug AirPort Express into an electrical outlet.
Use the AC plug that came with AirPort Express or the power extension
cord included in the AirPort Express Stereo Connection Kit. AirPort
Express turns on automatically when connected to an electrical outlet.
The status light glows yellow while AirPort Express is starting up. When
it starts up completely, the light turns green.
4. On your computer, set your iTunes preferences to look for speakers
connected wirelessly with AirTunes.
a. Choose iTunes➪Preferences (Mac) or Edit➪Preferences (Windows).
b. Then click the Advanced button and then click the General tab.
c. Select the Look for Remote Speakers Connected with AirTunes option
in the Advanced General pane, as shown in Figure 6-3.
In the Advanced General pane, you also have these options:
• To control volume from a stereo: Select the Disable iTunes Volume
Control for Remote Speakers option to control speakers separately
(a setting you should use if connecting to a stereo with a volume
control).
• To control volume from iTunes: Leaving this option deselected (the
default) enables you to control the volume from iTunes.
After turning on the option to look for AirTunes-connected speakers, a
pop-up menu appears in the lower-right corner of the iTunes window set
to Computer.
5. Click the Computer pop-up menu and then select the AirTunes-
equipped network.
The pop-up menu includes the Computer itself and any available wire-
less AirTunes networks, as shown in Figure 6-4. You can select the
AirTunes network to play music (“Little Net Buddy” in Figure 6-4). From
that point, iTunes plays music through the AirTunes network rather
than the computer. To play music through speakers connected to the
computer (or through the computer’s built-in speakers), choose
Computer from the pop-up menu.
The AirPort Express is small enough to fit in the palm of your hand, and it
travels well because all it needs is a power outlet. You can take your laptop
and AirPort Express to a friend’s house or party, connect the AirPort Express
to the stereo system and a power outlet, and then use your laptop anywhere
in its vicinity to play DJ. You can even use portable, powered speakers in a
hotel room without wires and use a hotel room’s LAN-to-Internet access with
an AirPort Express to connect your wireless computer and other wireless
computers in the room to the Internet.

Chapter 6: Playing Content in iTunes

Playing Songs
When you’ve found a song you want to play (see Chapter 8 for searching
details), simply select it in the Song List pane and then click the Play button.
The Play button toggles to a Pause button while the song plays. When the
song finishes, iTunes continues playing the songs in the list in sequence until
you click the Pause button (which then toggles back into the Play button) or
until the song list ends. This setup is useful if you select an album, but not so
great if you select a song at random and don’t want to hear the next one.
(Fortunately, you can arrange songs in playlists so that they play back in
exactly the sequence you want; see Chapter 10 for details.)
You can skip to the next or previous song by pressing the right- or left-arrow
keys on your keyboard, respectively, or by clicking the Forward or Back but-
tons next to the Play button. You can also double-click another song in the
list to start playing it.
Press the spacebar to perform the same function as the Play button; press
the spacebar again to pause.
You can choose songs to play manually, but iTunes also provides several
automated features so that you can spend less time prepping your music
selection and more time enjoying it.
Queuing up tunes with Party Shuffle
Playlists, as we describe in Chapter 10, are great for organizing music in the
order that you want to play it, but you can have iTunes serve up songs at
random by using Party Shuffle. Not a dance step or a pub game, Party Shuffle
is a dynamic playlist that automatically generates a semi-random selection in
a list that you can modify on the fly. With Party Shuffle at work, you might
even find songs in your library you forgot about or rarely play. Party Shuffle
always throws a few rarely played songs into the mix.
To use Party Shuffle, follow these steps:
1. Click Party Shuffle in the Source pane.
The Song List pane and Browse pane are replaced with the Party Shuffle
track list and settings at the bottom, as shown in Figure 6-5.
2. Choose a source from the Source pop-up menu below the Party
Shuffle track list.
You can select Music (for the entire music portion of your library) or
any playlist (including a smart playlist; see Chapter 10 for details) as the
source for music in Party Shuffle. If you select a playlist, Party Shuffle
limits its choices to songs from that playlist.
106
Part I: Setting Up and Acquiring Media Content 

3. Set the following options:
• Recently Played Songs: Choose how many songs should remain in
the Party Shuffle list after they’re played. You can drag already-
played songs (even though they’re grayed out after playing) to a
spot later in the list to play them again.
• Upcoming Songs: Choose how many songs should be listed as
upcoming (not yet played). By displaying upcoming songs first, you
can decide whether to rearrange the list or delete songs from the
Party Shuffle playlist before they’re played.
• Play Higher Rated Songs More Often: Select this option to have
iTunes add more high-rated songs to the random list. Using this
option, you weight the randomness in favor of higher-rated songs.
See Chapter 9 to find out how to add ratings to songs.
4. (Optional) If you don’t like the order of songs, you can rearrange
them. If you dislike any songs, you can eliminate them.
You can rearrange the order of songs in Party Shuffle by dragging songs
to different positions in the Party Shuffle list. Eliminate songs by select-
ing them in the Party Shuffle playlist and pressing Delete/Backspace (or
choosing Edit➪Delete). Don’t worry — the songs are not deleted from
your library, just from the Party Shuffle playlist.
5. Play Party Shuffle by selecting the first song and then clicking the
Play button or pressing the spacebar.
You can start playing the first song or any song on the list. (When you
pick a song in the middle to start playing, the songs before it are grayed
out to show that they won’t play.)
Figure 6-5:
Adjust the
settings for
Party
Shuffle.
107
Chapter 6: Playing Content in iTunes

6. Add, delete, or rearrange songs even while Party Shuffle plays.
While the Party Shuffle list plays, you can add songs in one of two ways:
• Open Party Shuffle in a separate window by double-clicking the Party
Shuffle item in the Source pane. You can then drag songs from the
main iTunes window — either from the Music portion of your
library or from a playlist — directly into position in the Party
Shuffle track list.
• Without opening Party Shuffle in a separate window, you can switch to
the library or a playlist and drag the song to the Party Shuffle item in
the Source pane. When you add a song to Party Shuffle, it shows up
at the end of the track list. You can then drag it to a new position.
You can add one or more albums to the Party Shuffle track list by dragging
the albums; the songs play in album order. You can also add all the songs 
by an artist by dragging the artist’s name. Party Shuffle acts like a dynamic
playlist — you add, delete, and change the order of songs on the fly.
Cool DJs mix the Party Shuffle window with other open playlist windows. 
Just double-click the playlist item in the Source pane to open it in a separate
window, as shown in Chapter 10. You can then drag songs from different
playlist windows to the Party Shuffle window while Party Shuffle plays,
adding songs in whatever order you want in real time.
Cross-fading song playback
You can often hear a song on the radio fade out while another song immedi-
ately fades in over the first song’s ending — a cross-fade. With iTunes, you can
smoothly transition from the ending of one song to the beginning of the next
one. Ordinarily, iTunes is set to have a short cross-fade of one second (the
time after the fade-out of the first song to the fade-in of the second).
What’s totally cool is that you can cross-fade two songs in iTunes even if
they’re from different sources. The songs could be in your library, in a shared
library, on CD, or even on one (or more) iPods connected to your computer
and playing through iTunes (as we describe in Chapter 16). You could play DJ
at a party with a massive music library on a laptop and enlarge that library
with one or more iPods and any number of CDs, and have the songs cross-
fade just like on the radio or at a dance party with a professional DJ.
You can change the cross-fade by choosing iTunes➪Preferences on a Mac or
Edit➪Preferences in Windows, and then clicking the Playback button. The
Playback preferences dialog appears, as shown in Figure 6-6.
108
Part I: Setting Up and Acquiring Media Content 

In the Playback preferences dialog, select the Crossfade Playback option and
then increase or decrease the cross-fade by dragging the slider. Each notch in
the slider represents one second. The maximum amount of cross-fade is 12
seconds. With a longer cross-fade, you get more overlap from one song to the
next; that is, the second song starts before the first one ends. To turn off the
cross-fade, deselect the Crossfade Playback check box.
Playing Streaming Radio
Radio stations from nearly every part of the world are broadcasting on 
the Internet. You can tune in to Japan-A-Radio for the top 40 hits in Japan,
Batanga Cubanisimo for the best in Cubanismo-Latin jazz, or Radio Darvish
for traditional Persian music. You can also check out the local news and
sports from your hometown, no matter where you are. You can listen to 
talk radio and music shows from all over the country and the world.
By radio, we really mean a streaming broadcast. A streaming broadcast sends
audio to your computer in a protected stream of bits over the Internet. Your
computer starts playing the stream as soon as the first set of bits arrives, and
more sections are transferred while you listen so that you hear it as a contin-
ual stream. Broadcasters can use this technology to continually transmit new
content, just like a radio station. Of course, real radio stations also make use
of this technology to broadcast their programs over the Internet.
Figure 6-6:
Set the
cross-fade
between
songs.
109
Chapter 6: Playing Content in iTunes

In addition, thousands of Web sites offer temporary streaming audio broad-
casts all the time. A rock group on tour can offer a broadcast of a special con-
cert, available for only one day. You might want to tune in weekly or monthly
broadcasts, such as high-tech talk shows, news programs, documentaries,
sporting events . . . the list is endless. You can even have access to private
broadcasts, such as corporate board meetings.
You can’t record or save a song from a streamed broadcast without special
software. Nor can you play a streaming broadcast on your iPod, except as a
podcast. (See Chapter 5 about adding podcasts.)
Listening to a radio station
iTunes offers a set of links to radio stations on the Internet, so you might
want to try these first. Follow these steps:
1. Select the Radio option in the Source pane.
The iTunes window displays a list of categories of radio stations.
2. Open a category to see a list of stations in that category.
Click the triangle next to a category name to open the list of radio
streams in that category, as shown in Figure 6-7. Some large radio sta-
tions offer more than one stream. iTunes automatically connects to the
Internet to retrieve the latest list of radio stations for each category.
3. Select a stream and then click the Play button.
To select a stream, click its name in the Song List pane. (Actually, it’s the
Radio Station List pane now because you selected Radio in the Source
pane.) Within seconds, you hear live radio off the Web.
If you use a dialup modem connection to the Internet, you might want to
choose a stream with a bit rate of less than 56 Kbps for best results. The Bit
Rate column (see Figure 6-7) shows the bit rate for each stream.
iTunes creates a buffer for the audio stream so that you hear continuous
playback with fewer Internet-related hiccups than most Web radio software.
The buffer temporarily stores as much of the stream as possible, adding
more of the stream to the end of the buffer while you play the audio in the
buffer. If you hear stutters, gaps, or hiccups when playing a stream, set 
your buffer to a larger size by choosing iTunes➪Preferences (Mac) or Edit➪
Preferences (Windows). In the Preferences dialog, click the Advanced button
and then the General tab, and then choose a size from the Streaming Buffer
Size pop-up menu.

Part I: Setting Up and Acquiring Media Content 

Creating a playlist of your radio stations
Car radios offer preset stations activated by you pressing a button. Of course,
you first need to tune in to the station of your choice to set that button. You
can save your radio station choices in an iTunes playlist, and the process 
is easy:
1. Select a radio station stream.
2. Drag the stream name to the bottom of the list of playlists in the
Source pane.
iTunes creates a playlist using the stream name. You can add more radio
streams to the same playlist by dragging their names over the new
playlist name in the Source pane.
Drag as many streams as you like to as many playlists as you like. You can
click any playlist name and rearrange that playlist as you want, dragging
stream names as you would drag song names. See Chapter 10 to discover
how to create and use playlists.
Radio streams in your playlists play only if you’re connected to the Internet.

Chapter 6: Playing Content in iTunes

To quickly create a playlist from selected radio streams, first select the
streams just as you would select multiple songs and then choose File➪New
Playlist from Selection.
Adding a radio station to iTunes
You can tune in to any broadcast on the Internet. All you need to know is the
Web address, also known as the URL (Uniform Resource Locator), which is
the global address of documents and other resources on the Web. You can
find most URLs from a Web site or e-mail about a broadcast.
Follow these steps to add a Web broadcast to your iTunes library:
1. Choose Advanced➪Open Stream.
The Open Stream dialog appears, with a URL text field for typing a Web
address.
2. Type the exact, full URL of the stream.
Include the http:// prefix, as in
http://64.236.34.141:80/stream/1014
If you’re connected to the Internet, iTunes automatically retrieves the
broadcast and places it at the end of your song list.
3. Click OK.
As of this writing, iTunes supports only MP3 broadcasts. You can find lots of
MP3 broadcasts from SHOUTcast (www.shoutcast.com) and Live365.com
(http://live365.com).
Playing Podcasts
Podcasts that you subscribe to appear in the List pane that appears when you
select the Podcasts option in the Source pane. You can add podcast episodes
to your library by subscribing to them in the iTunes Store (see Chapter 4) or
on a Web site (see Chapter 5). To play a podcast episode, follow these steps:
1. Select the Podcasts option in the Source pane.
The podcasts appear in the Song List pane.
2. Select the podcast in the Podcasts list and then click the triangle to
see its episodes.
The triangle rotates, and a list of episodes appears beneath the podcast,
as shown in Figure 6-8.
112
Part I: Setting Up and Acquiring Media Content 

3. Select the podcast and then click the Play button.
You can use the iTunes playback controls to fast-forward or rewind the
podcast or play it from any point. The blue dot next to a podcast means
you haven’t yet played it. As soon as you start listening to a podcast, the
dot disappears.
When you play a podcast, iTunes remembers your place when you stop lis-
tening to it, just like a bookmark in an audio book. iTunes resumes playing
from the bookmark when you return to the podcast to play it.
Some podcasts are enhanced to include chapter marks and photos. When
you play an enhanced podcast in iTunes, a Chapters menu appears on the
iTunes menu bar. Choose this menu to display the podcast’s chapter marks,
artwork, and chapter start times, as shown in Figure 6-9.
If the podcaster embedded a photo in an audio podcast file or included a link to
a video from the file, the photo or video content appears in the Artwork pane.
While you can drag a podcast into a playlist to include it in a playlist, you can
also drag a podcast to the Source pane to create a new playlist, as shown in
Figure 6-10, as long as you drag it to an empty space in the Playlist section of
the Source pane (and not into another playlist). The new playlist takes on the
name of the podcast. (For example, dragging The Flying Other Brothers–Music
Podcast to the Source pane in Figure 6-10 creates The Flying Other Brothers–
Music Podcast playlist.) For more information about playlists, see Chapter 10.

Playing Audio Books
You can store and play audio books, articles, and spoken-word titles just like
songs in iTunes — you can find them by selecting Audiobooks in the Source
pane under Library. You can download titles from the iTunes store (as we
describe in Chapter 4) or from Audible (www.audible.com; as we describe
in Chapter 5).
To play an audio book, select it just like you would a song (see details on
browsing and listing content in Chapter 8) and then click the Play/Pause
button. You can use the iTunes playback controls to fast-forward or rewind
the audio book or play it from any point.
Audio books from Audible and the iTunes Store are enhanced to include chapter
marks. When you play any of these audio books in iTunes, the Chapters menu
appears on the iTunes menu bar, just like a podcast with chapters. Choose the
Chapters menu to display and select the audio book’s chapter marks (refer to
Figure 6-9).
Playing Videos
iTunes is versatile when it comes to playing videos — the TV shows, movies,
video podcasts, and music videos you downloaded from the iTunes Store
(see Chapter 4) as well as the video files you dragged into iTunes from other
sources (see Chapter 5).
To watch a video in iTunes, select it in your library (see details on browsing
and listing movies, TV shows, and videos in Chapter 8), and then click the
Play/Pause button. Use the iTunes Play/Pause, Forward/Next, and Previous/
Rewind buttons to control playback and the iTunes volume slider to control
the volume, just like with songs.
The video appears in the Artwork pane in the lower-left corner of the iTunes
window, as shown in Figure 6-11. If the Artwork pane isn’t visible, clicking the
video makes it appear. You can also make the Artwork pane appear or disap-
pear by clicking the Show/Hide Artwork button.
You can view your video in two ways:
 Open it in a separate window at different sizes.
 Fill the entire display with the video.
115
Chapter 6: Playing Content in iTunes

Playing a video in a separate window
To watch a video in a separate window, click the video while it plays in the
Artwork pane. A separate window appears that includes a transparent
QuickTime controls pane with buttons for controlling video playback, as
shown in Figure 6-12. Click the right-facing triangle at the center of the
QuickTime controls pane to play or pause, and then drag the slider to move
forward or backward through the video. Click the rewind or fast-forward but-
tons on either side of the play button in the controls pane to move backward
or forward through a video.

To set your iTunes preferences to always play video in a separate window,
choose iTunes➪Preferences (Mac) or Edit➪Preferences (Windows). Next,
click the Playback button and then choose the In a Separate Window option
from the Play Videos pop-up menu, as shown in Figure 6-13. From that point
on, videos in your library play in a separate window that offers QuickTime
playback controls.
The transparent QuickTime control pane disappears while the video plays,
but you can make it reappear at any time by moving the cursor to the bottom
center of the video window. The control pane also offers a volume control
slider to set the audio volume of the video, and the Full-Screen Video button
to change the video display to full-screen. (See the following section, “Playing
a video full-screen.”) You can resize the separate video window by dragging
the lower-right corner of the window. You can also choose fixed window sizes
by choosing them from the View menu. For example, choose View➪Half Size
to display the video window at half the actual size, or View➪Double Size to
display the window at twice the size. Choose View➪Actual Size to set the
window back to the actual size of the video picture.
Playing a video full-screen
To watch the video on the full screen, click the Full-Screen Video button in
the transparent QuickTime control pane (refer to Figure 6-12). This button
doesn’t appear unless you’re playing a video in a separate window. You can
also choose View➪Full Screen.
Figure 6-13:

Chapter 6: Playing Content in iTunes

After clicking the Full-Screen Video button (or choosing View➪Full Screen),
video fills your screen and begins playing. The following controls are
available:
 Esc (Escape): Press to stop full-screen playback and return to the iTunes
window.
 Spacebar: Press to pause playback. (Pressing the spacebar again
resumes playback.)
 Your mouse or pointing device: Simply move these to display the transpar-
ent QuickTime control pane and then click the Full-Screen Video button
(now with its arrows pointing inward) to stop full-screen playback and
return to the iTunes window.
A cool party trick is to seamlessly mix music videos and music with visuals.
(See Chapter 3 to learn about displaying visuals.) To create a mixed playlist
of music and videos (see Chapter 10 to create playlists), choose iTunes➪
Preferences (Mac) or Edit➪Preferences (Windows). Then click the Playback
button and choose the Full Screen (with Visuals) option from the Play Videos
pop-up menu. When you play the mixed music-video playlist, iTunes automat-
ically shows full-screen video for your videos and full-screen visuals for your
music, seamlessly moving from one to the other.
For many, the computer display is just fine for viewing videos full-screen. The
picture clarity on a Mac (even Mac PowerBook and iBook), for example, is
better than any comparably sized television. However, if you want to connect
your PC to a television, follow the instructions that came with your PC. (Most
likely you’ll use the same cables that you would use to connect an iPod to a
television; see Chapter 16.)
You can connect a Mac to a television that offers an S-video connection or
standard RCA video and audio connections. After connecting to the televi-
sion, follow these steps:
1. Choose System Preferences from the Apple menu.
The System Preferences window appears with icons for each set of 
preferences.
2. Click the Displays icon in the System Preferences window.
The Display preferences window appears. Depending on the type of 
display, you might see tabs for different panes.
3. Click the Display tab for the Display preferences pane if it isn’t
already selected.
The preferences appear with settings for your display.

4. Click the Detect Displays button.
The Mac detects the television and sets it to the appropriate resolution.
For more about setting display resolutions on the Mac, see Mac OS X Tiger
All-in-One Desk Reference For Dummies, by Mark L. Chambers (Wiley).
If you don’t see a picture on your television, be sure your TV is set to the cor-
rect input source: Video in (RCA) or S-video in (if you use an S-video cable).
You can also use other types of video equipment. For example, a video
recorder that accepts RCA or S-video input can record the video and a video
projector can display it on a large screen.
Perhaps the easiest way to connect your computer (and other computers in
your local network) to your television and stereo system is through Apple TV.
Apple TV lets you connect wirelessly (or by wired Ethernet) to any computer
running iTunes in the network and store content for playback. See Chapter 7
for details on sharing your iTunes library with Apple TV.

Sharing Content Legally
In This Chapter
 Sharing content purchased from the iTunes Store
 Using a local area network to share an iTunes library
 Setting up and sharing content with Apple TV
 Copying media files to other drives and computers
 Copying from Macs to PCs and vice versa
H
ey, it’s your content after you buy it — that is, to the extent that you
can make copies for yourself. You want to play your music and videos
anywhere and even share them with your friends. It’s only natural.
And to help, iTunes lets you share a library over a local area network (LAN)
with other computers running iTunes.
If you use a Wi-Fi (wireless) network, consider getting an Apple TV, which
connects wirelessly to your network and with high-quality cabling to your
television and stereo system. You can then share any iTunes library on any
computer on the network with Apple TV to play on your TV and stereo.
You can also copy the content files to other computers without any restrictions
on copying although protected content has playback restrictions. You can
easily share the music that you rip from your CDs: After the music becomes
digital, you can copy it endlessly with no subsequent loss in quality. You can
also share the songs, audio books, podcasts, and videos that you download. Of
course, if the songs, audio books, and videos are in a protected format (such as
content bought from the iTunes Store), the computers that access the shared
library must be authorized to play the content. Whether the computers are
connected to a LAN by cable (such as Ethernet) or by wireless technology
(such as the Apple AirPort), you can share your library with other computers —
up to five other computers in a single 24-hour period.
In this chapter, we show you how to bend the rules and share your iTunes
library with others. (After all, your parents taught you to share, didn’t they?)

122
Part I: Setting Up and Acquiring Media Content 
Sharing Content from the iTunes Store
To a limited extent, you can share all the content that you buy online from the
iTunes Store. Some content — such as free podcasts as well as albums sold 
at a higher price in the iTunes Plus section of the store with higher audio 
quality and without copy protection — can be shared without any limitations.
However, individual songs and albums sold at lower prices; along with com-
mercial movies, music videos, TV shows, audio books, and paid podcasts; are
limited by copy protection, also known as digital rights management (DRM).
The songs available in the iTunes Plus section can play on any computer or
any digital-audio player. Entire albums and individual songs are now available
in this higher-quality, non-DRM format, but they don’t replace DRM-protected
songs also sold through iTunes at the lower price ($0.99 per song). That way,
consumers have a choice. And if you’ve already purchased DRM-protected EMI
songs at 99 cents each, you can upgrade them to the new format for 30 cents
each.
I fought the law, and the law won: Sharing and piracy
Apple CEO Steve Jobs gave personal demon-
strations of the iTunes Store and the iPod to Paul
McCartney and Mick Jagger before introducing
the online store. According to Steven Levy at
Newsweek (May 12, 2003), Jobs said, “They both
totally get it.” The former Beatle and the Stones’
frontman are no slouches: Both conduct music-
business affairs personally and have extensive
back catalogs of music. They know all about the
free music-swapping services on the Internet, but
they agree with Jobs that most people are willing
to pay for high-quality music rather than down-
load free copies of questionable quality.
Digital Rights Management (DRM), also known
as copy protection, is ineffective against piracy
because determined pirates always circumvent
it with newer technology; only consumers are
inconvenienced.
The record labels are finally “getting it” as well.
EMI, one of the largest, agreed in the spring of
2007 to sell songs and albums in the iTunes Plus
section of the store, at a higher price ($1.29 per
song) but without DRM getting in the way. Many
of the songs available from free sharing services
are low-quality MP3 audio files, which sound only
as good as an FM radio broadcast. The iTunes
Plus section offers licensed music in a format that
offers higher-quality sound, and we prefer the
original authorized version of the song — not
some knock-off that might have been copied from
a radio broadcast.
As for copying songs for personal use, the law
is murky at best. You can mix hit songs in with
your personal videos, but don’t expect to see
those videos on MTV or VH1, or even YouTube
for very long (as YouTube and other video shar-
ing sites police their sites for unauthorized con-
tent). Whether you’re interested in obtaining the
rights to music to use in semipublic or public
presentations or even movies and documen-
taries for public distribution, you can contact
the music publisher or a licensing agent. Music
publishing organizations, such as the Music
Publishers’ Association (www.mpa.org), offer
information and lists of music publishers as well
as explanations of various rights and licenses.

The Apple form of DRM is known as FairPlay, and it works with the standard
AAC format. (Read all about AAC, MP3, and other audio format encoders in
Chapters 18 and 19.) Protected files are keyed to an individual purchaser’s
identity. Although they can be copied to and from computers, they can’t be
played on a given computer unless that computer has been authorized.
Apple employs FairPlay protection for the lower-priced songs. These filenames
use the .m4p extension for protected music rather than .m4a for the unpro-
tected AAC format. Apple uses a protected video format for TV shows, music
videos, and movies in the online store. These filenames use the .m4v or .mp4
extension for protected video rather than .mpg for the standard MPEG-4 format.
Unprotected AAC files are as freely portable and playable as MP3 files are. You
can send an unprotected AAC file to anyone else with iTunes or any other soft-
ware capable of reading AAC files, and the recipient can play it successfully.
To tell whether a song purchased from the iTunes Store is protected with
FairPlay or not, select the song and choose File➪Get Info. Next to the Kind
heading reads “Protected AAC Audio File” for FairPlay-protected songs or
“Purchased AAC Audio File” for non-protected, higher-quality songs bought
in the iTunes Plus section.
The FairPlay protection used with iTunes Store content allows you to do the
following:
 Create backups. You can download the content files and make as many
copies as you want (even burn them onto data CDs and DVDs).
 Copy content to iTunes libraries on other computers. Play songs and
videos on up to five separate computers. See Chapter 4 to find out how
to authorize your computers.
 Copy content to iPods, iPhones, and Apple TV devices. Copy the music
and videos to as many iPods and iPhones as you want as well as to
Apple TV devices. See Chapter 12 for automatic and manual device syn-
chronization.
 Burn up to seven CDs. Burn seven copies of the same playlist contain-
ing protected songs to an audio CD — but no more. You can also burn
data CDs and DVDs with content files for backup purposes. See Chapter
14 for tips on CD and DVD burning.
 Share content over a network. Up to five computers running iTunes on
a LAN can play the content in your shared library in a 24-hour period.
You can also play music in your library over a wireless connection to a stereo
amplifier or receiver by using AirTunes and AirPort Express, which we cover
in Chapter 6.
You might also want to know where the songs, audio books, podcasts, and
videos are stored on your hard drive so that you can copy the content to
123
Chapter 7: Sharing Content Legally

other computers and hard drives and create a backup of your entire library.
You might want to move the library to another computer because computers
just keep getting better year after year. To find the location of your content
files, see Chapter 13.
Sharing Content on a Network
If you live like the Jetsons — with a computer in every room connected by a
wireless or wired network — iTunes is made for you. You can share your
iTunes library with other computers in the same network. These computers
can be PCs that run Windows or Macs that run OS X — as long as they run
iTunes. If they can communicate with each other over the network, iTunes
can share a content library with up to five PCs in a single 24-hour period. The
restriction to five in a 24-hour period is yet another one of the imposed rules
of record labels and video producers.
When you share content on a network, the content is streamed over the net-
work from the computer that contains the library (the library computer) to
the computer that plays it. A stream arrives in the receiving computer bit by
bit; the computer starts playing the stream as soon as the first set of bits
arrive, and more sections are transferred while you listen. The result is that
the recipient hears music and sees video as a continual stream. Broadcasters
use this technology to continually transmit new content (just like a radio 
station). The content isn’t copied to the receiving computer’s library, and
you can’t burn the shared library songs onto a CD or copy the songs to an
iPod without third-party software — such as WireTap Pro for the Mac (www.
ambrosiasw.com/utilities/wiretap) or Blaze Media Pro for Windows
(www.blazemp.com).
Sharing an iTunes library can be incredibly useful for playing content on lap-
tops, such as a PowerBook, that support the wireless AirPort network. You
can manage a very large content library on a desktop computer with a large
hard drive, and then play content on the laptop or notebook computer with a
smaller hard drive without having to copy files to the smaller hard drive.
Sharing your library with other computers
To share your iTunes library — turning your computer into the library 
computer — follow these steps:
1. Choose iTunes➪Preferences (Mac) or Edit➪Preferences (Windows)
and then click the Sharing tab.
The Sharing dialog appears, as shown in Figure 7-1, offering options for
sharing music.
124
Part I: Setting Up and Acquiring Media Content 

2. Select the Share My Library on My Local Network option.
3. Select either the Share Entire Library option or the Share Selected
Playlists option and then choose the playlists to share.
4. Add a password if you want to restrict access to the shared library or
playlists.
Pick a password that you don’t mind sharing with others; for example,
your name is a good password, but your ATM PIN isn’t. The password
restricts access to only those who know it.
iTunes displays Reminder: Sharing music is for personal use
only.
5. Click OK.
Shared libraries or playlists appear in the iTunes Source list in the Shared
section with the computer’s user name (for example, “Tony Bove’s Music” is
the name of the shared library on the computer where “Tony Bove” is logged
in as the user).
You can change the Shared name that iTunes uses for your shared library or
playlists. To change the name others see, choose iTunes➪Preferences on a Mac
or Edit➪Preferences in Windows, click General, and then type a new name in the
Shared Name field. The name that you choose appears in the Shared section of
the iTunes Source pane for other computers that share your library.
Before turning off sharing for your library, you must first notify anyone sharing
the library to eject the shared library. Otherwise, iTunes displays a warning
dialog allowing you to continue (and break off the connection to the shared
library) or to leave sharing turned on for the moment.

Accessing a shared library
You can access the content from the other computers on the network by 
following these steps:
1. Choose iTunes➪Preferences on a Mac or Edit➪Preferences in
Windows and then click the Sharing tab.
The Sharing dialog appears and offers options for sharing content. Refer
to Figure 7-1.
2. Select the Look for Shared Libraries option.
The shared libraries or playlists appear in the Shared section of the
Source pane. Figure 7-2 shows a shared library in the Source pane. If
more than one computer on your home network is sharing music, a 
triangle appears next to the Shared heading. Click this triangle to reveal
all the shared libraries on the local network.
3. Click the triangle next to a shared library entry in the Source pane, as
shown in Figure 7-3, to see shared playlists. Play them as you normally
would.
iTunes fills the view on the right with the artists and content from the
shared library.

Sharing Content with Your Apple TV
Wouldn’t it be nice to be able to play the content in your iTunes library on
your television and stereo system without having to mess with cables? You
can. Just sit back on your couch and let Apple TV offer up a smorgasbord of
content from your iTunes library, which can be on your computer in another
room and streamed to Apple TV over the network. You can also transfer con-
tent to your Apple TV so that you don’t have to use your computer to play
the content or even have your computer on while playing content.
Apple TV (about $300) is like a large iPod that wirelessly synchronizes with one
or more iTunes libraries on Macs and PCs and connects to your high-definition
or regular television and stereo system. You can watch movies you download
from the online iTunes Store (or anywhere else) on your high-definition televi-
sion with full surround sound. You can listen to music and podcasts in your
iTunes library through your home stereo and show photo slideshows with
music. It’s the wave of the future — couch potatoes kicking back with Apple
consumer gear.
You control Apple TV with the Apple Remote, which uses Apple TV’s built-in
infrared (IR) receiver. The menus for playing content and changing Apple TV
settings appear on your television, so you can sit back on your couch and
tune in to anything synchronized from your iTunes library. You can also play
all the music in an iTunes library, streamed from the computer running
iTunes, without synchronizing the entire library.

Chapter 7: Sharing Content Legally

Apple TV hardware isn’t much different than a low-end laptop computer; it
runs a slimmed version of Mac OS X. Apple TV requires a Mac or PC running
iTunes version 7.1 or newer. (See Chapter 2 for detailed requirements for run-
ning iTunes.) Apple TV works with widescreen, enhanced-definition, or high-
definition TVs capable of 1080i, 720p, 576p, or 480p resolutions. As of this
writing, the iTunes Store doesn’t yet offer HDTV (high-definition television)
content — but when it does, Apple TV is ready for it.
The first generation Apple TV includes a 40GB model and a 160GB model for
synchronizing with iTunes. With the 40GB model you can synchronize up to
50 hours of movies and TV shows, or fill it up with 9,000 songs (or about
25,000 pictures), and play them on your TV and stereo. And yet, it’s so easy
to set up that you have to leave your couch for only a few minutes before
you’re back on it, soaking up the content.
Setting up Apple TV
Apple TV works transparently with a PC or Mac, taking advantage of the broad-
band connection to the Internet via your wireless network. It supports 802.11
wireless networks, including Apple AirPort networks. Newer AirPort Extreme-
enabled Macs let you create a wireless network using only your computer and
Apple TV. (If you have a Mac or PC without wireless capability, though, you 
can connect Apple TV to your network using an Ethernet cable that’s sold 
separately.) You can then synchronize Apple TV with an iTunes library on any
Mac or PC within reach of the wireless network. When you change your library
in iTunes, Apple TV automatically synchronizes with your library.
To connect the device (only 1.1" thick and 7.7" square) to your TV or audio-
video (AV) receiver, use one of the following methods, as shown in Figure 7-4:
 For TVs with stereo or surround sound that support High-Definition
Multimedia Interface (HDMI): Use an HDMI cable, which provides video
and audio to the television/audio system. The Apple Store offers HDMI-
to-HDMI cables for TVs and AV receivers that support HDMI.
 For TVs that support Digital Video Interface (DVI): Use an HDMI-to-DVI
cable or an HDMI-DVI adapter for an HDMI cable, both of which are 
available from the Apple Store. Then use either an optical audio cable or
a standard analog audio cable pair to provide audio to your stereo or
surround sound system.
 For TVs or AV receivers that don’t offer HDMI or DVI (or if these ports
are used by other devices, such as your cable receiver): Use a component
video cable (with three connectors) and either an optical audio cable or a
standard analog audio cable pair.
128
Part I: Setting Up and Acquiring Media Content 

You should connect Apple TV to your TV and stereo first before proceeding
so that when you connect Apple TV to power, you see the menu for Apple TV
on your television.
Choosing an iTunes library for Apple TV
When you first connect Apple TV to a power source, it immediately starts 
its setup procedure, using your television as the display. Grab your Apple
Remote (supplied with Apple TV) and follow these instructions — all from
the comfort of your couch:
1. Choose a language.
Point the Apple Remote at the Apple TV and use the remote’s buttons to
navigate up and down the list and select a language. The plus (+) button
scrolls up, the minus (–) button scrolls down, and the Play/Pause button
selects a menu choice. After choosing a language, Apple TV displays the
network screen.
2. Select a network.
Apple TV searches for a wireless network unless you’ve connected it to an
Ethernet network (in which case Apple TV automatically detects it, and
that’s that). For wireless networks, follow the on-TV instructions to select
your network by name, and (if necessary) supply a password by using the
Apple Remote to navigate the individual letters of the password. You can

even manually configure the IP address, subnet mask, router, and DNS
address if your network doesn’t allow DHCP connections or you need 
to for other reasons. (We’re assuming here that you know what you’re
doing — if not, get help from the person who set up your network.)
After setting up your network connection, Apple TV displays a five-digit
passcode on your TV that identifies the device for synchronization with
a computer.
3. Remember (or write down) your five-digit passcode.
The next step is to get off your couch and go over to your computer —
which can be in the next room, as long as it accesses the same network
as Apple TV. Then follow these steps:
4. Start iTunes.
Shortly (a minute or less), the Apple TV icon and name appear in the
Source pane under Devices.
5. Select Apple TV in the Source pane (as shown in Figure 7-5) and then
enter the five-digit passcode into the digit fields.
This passcode appears on your TV; see earlier in this step list.
The digit fields appear in the iTunes page, to the right of the Source
pane. After entering the fifth digit, iTunes displays a page that lets you
enter the name for your Apple TV, as shown in Figure 7-6.

6. Give your Apple TV a new name.
Enter a new name that befits the new king of the living room and then
click OK. iTunes then displays the registration page for Apple TV.
7. Register your Apple TV or skip registration if you want.
Click Continue to register, Later to register later, or Never Register to
skip registration. We recommend registering your Apple TV in order to
maintain your warranty (and optionally receive email notices of
updates). If you choose to register, follow the instructions to enter your
Apple ID and password (or select the option for no ID) and then click
Continue. Fill out your personal information and then click Continue to
finish the registration process. iTunes then takes you to the online store,
so that you can start purchasing content immediately.
Your new Apple TV starts synchronizing automatically with your iTunes library,
copying movies, TV shows, music, podcasts, and photos (in that order) until it
runs out of space. If your iTunes library is larger than the capacity of your Apple
TV, you will want to manage content synchronization — see Chapter 12.
To play content on Apple TV, use the Apple Remote to choose from the Apple
TV main menu. You can select Movies, TV Shows, Music, Podcasts, and Photos;
or, choose Settings to change your Apple TV settings or choose Sources to
change sources of content.

Chapter 7: Sharing Content Legally

Copying Media Files
You can copy content freely from your iTunes window to other hard drives
and computers or copy the content folders from the iTunes Music folder to
other hard drives and computers. On a Mac, you can use the Finder to copy
content files as well as drag stuff from the iTunes window into folders or hard
drives. Windows PCs offer several methods, including using Windows Explorer
to copy files.
By default, the files are organized in folders by artist name and by album title
(or by book, video, or TV show title) within the iTunes Music folder: that is,
unless you change options in the Advanced section of iTunes Preferences; see
Chapter 13. For example, copying an entire album, or every song by a specific
artist, is easy — just drag the folder to its new-home folder on another hard
drive.
You can find out the location of any content item by selecting the item in
iTunes and choosing File➪Get Info. Click the Summary tab in the Get Info
dialog to see the Summary options. Although you can change the location of
your iTunes library, most people leave the library in its default location,
which is inside the iTunes Music folder in the iTunes folder on the startup
hard drive.
On a Mac, the iTunes Music folder can be found at its default location:
your home folder/Music/iTunes/iTunes Music
On a Windows PC, the iTunes Music folder can be found at
your user folder/My Documents/My Music/iTunes/iTunes Music
Your playlists, including the library itself (which is in some ways a giant
playlist), are stored as eXtensible Markup Language (XML) files in the iTunes
folder along with your iTunes Music folder.
The easiest way to copy an album from a folder on a hard drive into your
iTunes library is to drag the album’s folder over the iTunes window and drop
the folder there. If you drop it into the Source pane, iTunes creates a playlist
of the album’s songs using the album name. To copy individual songs, you
can drag the song files over the iTunes window and drop them in the Song
List pane. When you add a piece of content (song, video, podcast, or audio
book) to your iTunes library, a copy is placed inside the iTunes Music folder.
132
Part I: Setting Up and Acquiring Media Content 

Copying Files between Macs and PCs
Song files are not small: Album folders filled with songs are quite large, and
video files are far larger than song files. Copying a library from a Mac to a PC,
or vice versa, is not a simple task because of the enormity of these file sizes.
Attaching a file to an e-mail message is the most popular method of transfer-
ring a file to someone. However, when you attach a file to an e-mail message,
the attached file is encoded in a format that increases the size of the attach-
ment by up to 40 percent. Many e-mail servers won’t accept an attachment
larger than 5MB; some won’t accept attachments larger than 4MB. In cases
such as those, don’t even think about sending music and video file copies via
e-mail. Just remember our little homily: If the file is over four, it won’t go
through the door. (Four megabytes, that is, and the door is the limitation of
your Internet service provider’s e-mail server.) If you use a .Mac e-mail
account, the limitation is 10MB.
Well, heck, just about every jazz tune and Grateful Dead jam we listen to in
iTunes is larger than 3MB. A song compressed in the AAC or MP3 format is
typically between 2MB and 10MB, so you might get by with one pop song
attached to an e-mail, but that’s it.
One way to transfer larger amounts of content is by using an external FireWire
or a USB hard drive formatted for a PC: For example, an iPod installed for
Windows would do nicely. (Note: You need FireWire or USB to connect an
external drive.) In such a scenario, the Mac then recognizes that iPod when
you plug it in even though the drive is formatted for Windows. You can copy
files directly to the hard drive and then take the hard drive over to your PC.
(You can find out about using an iPod as a hard drive in Chapter 22.)
On a LAN, you can share forever. If your computers communicate over a LAN,
they can share files — even large ones. To copy large files or entire folders
between two Macs in a LAN, simply allow personal file sharing on your Mac.
Likewise, if someone wants to make a file or folder available to you over a
LAN, all she has to do is enable personal file sharing.
Allowing personal file sharing perhaps sounds a bit liberal and maybe even a
tad dangerous — potentially inviting mischief and voyeurism — but you can
indeed control what others can do.
Mac OS X makes it very easy to share files and folders with Windows comput-
ers. You can enable Windows file sharing on a Mac, or you can access the
Windows computer from a Mac. To access a Windows PC from a Mac, you
need a valid user ID and password for an account on the Windows computer.
133
Chapter 7: Sharing Content Legally

You can go to that account’s Home directory on the Windows computer and
use your Mac to copy folders and files to and from the PC. For more informa-
tion about file sharing on a Mac (specifically between Mac and Windows 
computers on a network), see Mac OS X Tiger All-in-One Desk Reference For
Dummies, by Mark L. Chambers (Wiley).
Copying very large song files over the Internet is a bit more complex, involving
the use of a communication application such as iChat AV or one that offers the
File Transfer Protocol (FTP). Although you can easily download an MP3 song
file from a Web page or an FTP site with any browser (all you need is the Web
or FTP address, and a user ID and password if the site is protected), you can’t
send the file to a protected site with most browsers unless the site is set up for
this function. One easy way to share your files from a Mac is to use the .Mac
service to create a Web page that accommodates anyone with the right pass-
word, even Windows-using folks, to visit and download files you put there. For
information about setting up a .Mac account, see iLife ’04 All-in-One Desk
Reference For Dummies, by yours truly (Wiley).
To make it easy for others to copy files to and from a Mac at their conve-
nience, enable FTP access for the Mac. To do this
1. Open System Preferences.
2. Click the Sharing icon.
3. Click the Services button.
4. Select the FTP Access option.
A message at the bottom of the Sharing pane provides the address of
your FTP server on your Mac, something like
ftp://192.168.1.246
5. Give the address to those with an account on your computer so that
they can access files and folders by using a Web browser, an FTP
client (such as Fetch 5), or Mac OS X.
If you’ve turned on the firewall in Mac OS X, click the Firewall button in
the Sharing preferences and then select the FTP Access option; this
allows FTP access through the firewall.
How about transferring files to other FTP sites, such as a password-protected
site that requires the use of an FTP client? You have several options:
 Use an FTP client, such as Fetch 5 or RBrowser 4 for Mac OS X or FTP
Explorer for Windows. You can find Fetch 5 at http://fetchsoftworks.
com (for $25, as of this writing). You can use it for 15 days before paying
for it. RBrowser 4 (www.rbrowser.com) is free to download and use and
looks a bit like the Mac Finder. FTP Explorer (www.ftpx.com) is shareware
you can use for a month before paying $36. (Students and faculty members
can use it for free.)
134
Part I: Setting Up and Acquiring Media Content 

 Use the FTP function inside another application, such as Adobe
Dreamweaver or Adobe GoLive.
 Use a free Terminal application, such as the one supplied with Mac OS X,
found in the Utilities folder inside your Applications folder, which offers
FTP. For instructions, see Mac OS X Tiger All-in-One Desk Reference For
Dummies, by Mark L. Chambers (Wiley).
Most FTP utilities and functions within applications provide an easy way to
copy files. For example, Fetch 5 provides a drag-and-drop interface for trans-
ferring any type of file with FTP servers. After you establish a connection
with the FTP server by typing the appropriate information (the FTP server
name, your ID, your password, and the directory that you have access to),
you can drag files to and from the FTP server window via the Finder, or you
can browse folders to select files and then use the Get and Put buttons.
You can send an entire folder of files, such as an album of songs or an artist
folder with multiple albums, by stuffing the folder (or even a set of folders)
into a compressed Zip file. (Zip is a standard compression format.) Select the
files or folders and Control-click (Mac) or right-click (Windows) the selection.
In Mac OS X, choose Create Archive; in Windows, choose WinZip (or similar
Zip utility that installs itself into Windows menus).
You can then transfer the Zip file to the FTP server in one step. Although the
Zip file formats compress other types of files, the files won’t get any smaller if
your music files are already compressed as MP3 or AAC. However, the format
offers a compact way of sending an entire folder of files.

Searching, Browsing, and 
Sorting in iTunes
In This Chapter
 Browsing your iTunes library
 Changing options for viewing your content
 Sorting content by view options
 Searching for content in the library
You rip a few CDs, buy some songs and movies from the iTunes Store, and
you’re hooked. You keep adding more and more content to your library
and forget how to find items you added last month. It’s time to discover how
to organize your content and navigate your iTunes library.
The iTunes library is awesome, even by everyday jukebox standards. Even
though previous versions were limited to a paltry (cough!) 32,000 files per
library and you had to create multiple libraries to get around that limit, the
current version (actually all versions newer than version 4) can virtually hold
an unlimited number of files. Of course, the limit depends entirely on how
much space you have on your hard drive.
Consider that an 80GB iPod can hold about 20,000 songs — enough music to
last over a month even if played 24 hours each day! If you keep your iTunes
library down to the size of what fits on your iPod, though, you still have a for-
midable collection at your fingertips. If your music collection is getting large,
organize it to make finding songs easier. After all, finding U2’s “I Still Haven’t
Found What I’m Looking For” is a challenge even in a library of “only” 32,000
songs.
This chapter shows you how to search, browse, and sort your iTunes library.
You can find any song, movie, TV show, audio book, podcast, game, or radio
station in seconds. You can also change the viewing options to make your
library’s display more useful, such as displaying songs sorted by artist, album,
genre, or other attributes, or sorting TV shows by season or episode.

Part II: Managing Your Media Content
Browsing Your Library Content
The iTunes window provides the Browse and List panes on the right side and
the Source pane on the left side (refer to Figure 3-1 in Chapter 3). The Browse
and List panes offer a view of your library and content, depending on which
sources of content you choose in the Source pane on the left side. The
choices in the Source pane are as follows:
 Library section: Select Music, Movies, TV Shows, Podcasts, Audiobooks,
iPod Games, or Radio.
• Music: Lists the entire library of songs and music videos, purchased,
ripped, or copied into the library.
• Movies: Lists only the movies purchased in the iTunes Store and
movie files you’ve added to your library.
• TV Shows: Lists only the TV shows purchased in the iTunes Store.
• Podcasts: Lists only the podcasts you’ve subscribed to. (See
Chapter 5 for details on subscribing to and browsing podcasts.)
• Audiobooks: Lists only the audio books purchased in the iTunes
Store or from Audible.com or other sources. (See Chapter 6 for
details on playing audio books.)
• iPod Games: Lists only the iPod games purchased in the iTunes
Store or from other sources.
• Radio: Lists the Web radio stations you can play. Radio station con-
tent is streamed to your computer but not stored in your library.
 Store section: The iTunes Store. You’ve likely been there before; see
Chapter 4.
 Devices section: Your iPod, iPhone, Apple TV, and other devices appear
here. When you select a device such as an iPod, iTunes displays the syn-
chronization options for that iPod. See Chapter 12 for details on opening
and navigating the library on an iPod.
 Playlist section: Smart playlists and regular playlists appear in this sec-
tion. (See Chapter 10 for information about playlists.) Also appearing in
this section is Party Shuffle, which lists the Party Shuffle playlist. (See
Chapter 6 for tips on using the Party Shuffle feature.)
Overwhelmed by the long list of content in the List pane? Try browsing: Switch
from List view to Browse view, which has browsing columns you can use to
easily find items, such as music albums or TV episodes. After selecting a
source of content in the Source pane, click the Browse button in the lower-right
corner to toggle between Browse view, in which the Browse pane appears
above the List pane (refer to Figure 3-1 in Chapter 3), or List view, in which the
List pane of songs or other items appears by itself.

In addition to the Browse button, iTunes offers three View buttons in the
upper-right corner to change your view of the Browse pane and List pane:
 The left button (or choose View➪List View) shows items in a list. Click
the Browse button to toggle between the list by itself and the list with
browsing columns.
 The center button (or choose View➪Album view) shows items in a list
grouped with thumbnail cover art images. Click the Browse button to
toggle between the album view by itself and the album view with browsing
columns, as shown in Figure 8-1.
 The right button shows the cover browser, also known as Cover Flow, as
described in the upcoming section, “Browsing by cover art.” (You can
also show the cover browser by choosing View➪Cover Flow View.) The
Browse button has no function in this view.

Chapter 8: Searching, Browsing, and Sorting in iTunes

Browsing by cover art
Does viewing an album cover whet your appetite for the music inside? Of
course it does. Album covers provide a context for the music that simply
can’t be put into words or conveyed by sound alone. The box art for a video
and the cover of a book help sell the product, but cover art is particularly
influential with music.
One fantastic innovation of iTunes (version 7.1.1 or later) is how it integrates
cover art from albums, book covers, and video boxes with your library so
that you can flip through your content to find items based on the artwork.
Figure 8-2 shows the iTunes window (on a Mac) using Cover Flow view to dis-
play the Music portion of the iTunes library. (Mac and Windows versions of
iTunes look nearly identical and offer the same viewing options.)
Cover Flow lets you flip through your cover art to select music, movies, TV
shows, and audio books. (The cover browser doesn’t work with podcasts,
games, or radio stations.) Just drag the slider to scroll swiftly through your
library, or you can click to the right or left of the cover art in the foreground to
move forward or backward in your library, respectively. When you scroll or
click through cover art, the content items in the List pane also change. Double-
click the foreground cover art to start playing the first item — whether it’s an
album’s first song, a movie, the first chapter of an audio book, or the first
episode of a TV show.

Part II: Managing Your Media Content

Click the Browse Full-Screen button to display Cover Flow, um, full-screen.
You can still click a cover to select an album, click within each cover to move
forward and backward, and use the cover browser’s slider to navigate your
library. iTunes also offers a volume control slider to set the audio volume
while browsing full-screen cover art. Press Esc (Escape) or click the Browse
Full-Screen button (with its arrows pointing inward) in the lower-right corner
of the display to stop displaying the cover browser full-screen and return to
the iTunes window.
To fill your library automatically with cover art for the CDs you ripped, get
yourself an iTunes Store account (if you don’t already have one). Log in to
your account; then choose Advanced➪Get Album Artwork. iTunes grabs the
cover art not only for iTunes Store purchases but also for CDs you ripped —
provided that the albums are also available in the iTunes Store. You can 
also get your cover art from other places that sell CDs (including Amazon.
com) or even scan them from the actual CDs. The optimal size for cover art is
300 x 300 pixels.
Browsing songs by artist and album
To browse music in your library, select Music in the Source pane in the Library
section. The List view shows the title of each song in the Name column, the
artist or band name in the Artist column, and the title of the album in the
Album column. The Browse view organizes songs by Genre, Artist, and Album.
(The Genre column appears only if you leave the Show Genre When Browsing
option turned on in the General dialog of iTunes Preferences.) You can switch
to Album view (refer to Figure 8-1) or to Cover Flow view (refer to Figure 8-2) to
show the album cover art.
Select a genre in the Genre column to see artists in that genre or select All at
the top of the Genre column to see all artists for all genres. When you select
an artist in the Artist column (the middle column; see Figure 8-3), the album
titles appear in the Album column (on the right). When you select an album
in Browse view, iTunes displays only the songs for that album in the List pane
below the Browse pane.
To see more than one album from an artist at a time, press Ô (Mac) or Ctrl
(Windows) and then click each album name.
When you select different albums in the Album column, the List pane dis-
plays the songs from that album. The songs are listed in proper track order,
just as the artist, producer, or record label intended (assuming that the cor-
rect track information has been downloaded from the Internet or entered into
the song’s information dialog, as we describe in Chapter 9).
143
Chapter 8: Searching, Browsing, and Sorting in iTunes

If you don’t get track information from the Internet for each song (as we show
in Chapter 5) or if you add the track information via the content item’s infor-
mation dialog (as we describe in Chapter 9), iTunes displays a blank space
for the Artist and Album name along with Track 01 and so on for each track.
However, that makes browsing for a song or artist by name difficult.
To see all the songs in the library in Browse view, select All at the top of each
of the columns — Genre, Artist, and Album.
Note: iTunes version 7.1.1 and newer versions no longer consider Clash and
The Clash to be different music groups, sorting them properly under C. We
show you how to edit the artist name and other information in Chapter 9.
Browsing audio books
To browse the audio books in your library, select Audiobooks in the Source
pane in the Library section. The List view shows the title of each book with its
part number (long books typically have multiple parts) in the Name column,
and the author’s name in the Artist column. If you add the Album column
heading to your List view (as we describe in the section, “Changing the List
view options,” later in this chapter), the title of the book appears in the Album
column. The Browse view organizes audio books by Genre, Artist (the author),
and Album (the book). (The Genre column appears only if you leave the Show
Genre When Browsing option selected in the General dialog of iTunes
Preferences.)

Part II: Managing Your Media Content

Browsing movies, videos, and TV shows
Any video files you add to your library from sources other than the iTunes
Store are classified as movies, and you can find them in the Movies section of
the Source pane. You can also find in the Movies section those movies and
short films you downloaded from the iTunes Store.
To browse movies, select Movies in the Source pane. The List view shows
the title of each movie in the Name column. The Album view (as shown in
Figure 8-4) and the Cover Flow view show the first key frame of the movie or
the box cover art for the movie. The Browse view organizes movies by
Genre, Artist, and Album.
To browse TV shows downloaded from the iTunes Store, select TV Shows in
the Source pane. The List view shows the title of each episode in the Name
column, the title of the show itself in the Show column, and the season
number in the Season column. The Album view and the Cover Flow view
show the promotional cover art for the TV show. The Browse view organizes
TV shows by Genre, Show, and Season.

Chapter 8: Searching, Browsing, and Sorting in iTunes

Browsing iPod games
Your iPod is, in a sense, a pocket game machine. Although they won’t give
Nintendo, Xbox, or PlayStation models much competition, fifth- and sixth-
generation iPods that play video can also play games you can purchase and
download from the iTunes Store. And although you can’t play the games in
iTunes, you can browse the list of games you downloaded from the store.
To browse iPod games downloaded from the iTunes Store, select iPod Games
in the Source pane. A scrollable pane appears to the right of the Source pane,
displaying thumbnail images of the games. Click a thumbnail image to see a
description of the game.
Okay, we know you’re a closet gamer, so rush right over to Chapter 15 for
details on how to run iPod games.
Displaying Content in List View
To display your content in the List pane as a list, click the left View button
(refer to Figure 8-1). You can then click the Browse button in the lower-right
corner of the iTunes window to toggle between the list by itself and the list
with browsing columns. The column headings in the iTunes List view have
different meanings for the following types of content:
 Songs and music videos: The Name is the title of the song; the Artist is
the band, artist, or performer. The Album is the title of the CD or LP on
which the song appeared. For music videos, the Name is typically the
title of a song in the music video.
 Podcasts: The Name is the title of the podcast episode (as in “Ballad Roots
of California Folk-Rock”), the Artist is the name of the podcast author (as in
Tony Bove), and the Album is the name of the podcast (as in Rockument).
 Audio books: The Album is typically the book’s title (as in Fear and
Loathing in Las Vegas), and the Name is typically the title of one of the
parts (as in Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas–Part 1 of 3).
 TV shows: The Name is the name of the TV show episode (as in “Mr. Monk
and the Airplane”), the Artist is the name of the show (as in Monk), and
the Album is the season (as in Monk, Season 1).
Understanding the content indicators
When you make choices in iTunes, it displays an action indicator next to each
content item in List view — song, movie, TV show episode, music video,
audio book, radio station, or podcast episode — to show you what it’s doing.
Here’s a list of the indicators and their meanings:
146
Part II: Managing Your Media Content

 Orange waveform: iTunes is importing the item.
 Green check mark: iTunes finished importing the item.
 Exclamation point: iTunes can’t find the item.
If you move or delete the item accidentally, you can move the item back
into iTunes by dragging its file from your hard drive into the iTunes
window. (To find content files on your hard drive, see Chapter 13.)
 Broadcast icon: The item is on the Internet and plays as a stream.
 Black check mark: The item is marked for the next operation, such as
importing from an audio CD or playing in sequence.
Click to remove the check mark.
 Speaker: The item (song, movie, TV show episode, music video, audio
book, radio station, or podcast episode) is playing.
 Chasing arrows: iTunes is copying the content item from another loca-
tion or downloading it from the Internet.
Changing the List view options
iTunes lets you customize the List view in the List pane. The list starts out
with the Name, Time, Artist, Album, Genre, My Rating, Play Count, and Last
Played categories. You might have to drag the horizontal scroll bar along the
bottom of the song list to see all these columns. You can display more, less,
or different information in your song list.
Customize your List view in the following ways:
 Make a column wider or narrower. While you move your cursor over
the divider between two columns, the cursor changes to a vertical bar
with opposing arrows extending left and right; you can click and drag
the divider to change the column’s width.
 Change the order of columns. Click a column heading and drag the
entire column to the left or right.
You can’t change the position of the Name column and the narrow
column to its left, which displays indicators.
 Add or remove columns. All columns except Name can be added or
removed:
a. Choose View➪View Options.
b. Select the columns that you want to appear in the list from the View
Options dialog (as shown in Figure 8-5).
You can also change the view options by Ctrl-clicking or right-clicking any
column heading in the list in either Browse view or List view.
147
Chapter 8: Searching, Browsing, and Sorting in iTunes

Browse view includes a Genre column on the left side. If you don’t need a
Genre column, you can remove it from the Browse view:
1. Choose iTunes➪Preferences (Mac) or Edit➪Preferences (Windows).
2. Click the General tab at the top of the Preferences window.
3. In the General dialog, deselect the Show Genre When Browsing
option, which is on by default.
Sorting Content by the List View Options
With just a little know-how, you can use the List view options to sort the list-
ing of content items. You can sort items not only by name or album but also
by composer, the date the items were added to the library, or other informa-
tion that you can add to an item (as we describe in Chapter 9).
At the very least, you can sort the content by the column headings you now
use in the List view. You can also add other column headings to your List
view (as we describe in the earlier section, “Changing the List view options”)
and sort with them.
For example, clicking the Time heading reorders the items by their duration
in ascending order (shortest to longest). If you click the Time heading again,
the sort is in descending order (reversed, starting with the longest item). You
can sort by any column heading, such as Artist, Album, Track, Date Added,
and Ratings.
You can tell whether the sort is in ascending or descending order by the little
arrow indicator in the heading. When the arrow points up, the sort is in
ascending order; when pointing down, it’s in descending order.
Figure 8-5:
Change the
viewing
options for
List view.
148
Part II: Managing Your Media Content

Alternatively, you can sort the list in alphabetical order. Click the Artist head-
ing to sort the items in the list by artist name in alphabetical order (arrow
pointing up). Click it again to sort the list in reverse alphabetical order (arrow
pointing down).
iTunes also lets you sort the song list via the Album column. Each time you
click Album, the heading cycles through each of the following options:
 Album, which sorts alphabetically by album title.
 Album by Artist, which groups albums by artist and then lists them
alphabetically.
 Album by Year, which groups albums by artist and then lists them
chronologically by year (set in the Song Information dialog).
iTunes keeps track of the songs, audio books, and podcasts you skip — not
to be polite, just to be useful. You can use this feature to sort the Music and
Audiobooks sections of your library in List view, thereby making it easier to
select and delete the items you skip. (The Skip Count doesn’t count how
many times you skip videos, TV shows, and movies.)
In addition to the usual List view options (which you can change by Ctrl-
clicking or right-clicking any column heading in the list, or by choosing
View➪View Options), you can now view and sort by the Skip Count. Skip
Count keeps track of how many times you skipped the content item within the
first 19 seconds, using the Forward/Next button. (Clicking a new item and
playing it the first time doesn’t count.) You can also view and sort the list by
selecting Last Skipped in View Options, which shows the date and time when
you last skipped the item. Another way to select and delete items that have a
high skip count is to create a smart playlist; see Chapter 10 for details.
Searching for Content
Because your iTunes library will most likely grow, you might find the usual
browsing and scrolling methods that we describe earlier in this chapter too
time-consuming. Let iTunes find your content for you!
If you want to search the entire library in Browse view, select All at the top of
the Genre and Artist columns to browse the entire library before typing a
term in the Search field. Or, if you prefer, click the Browse button again to
return to the List view.
Locate the Search field — the oval field in the top-right corner — and follow
these steps:
1. Click in the Search field and enter several characters of your search
term.
149
Chapter 8: Searching, Browsing, and Sorting in iTunes

Use these tips for successful searching:
• Specify your search with a specific title, artist, or album.
• Narrow your search by typing more characters. Using fewer charac-
ters results in a longer list of possible songs.
• Case doesn’t matter. The Search feature ignores case. For example,
when we search for miles, iTunes finds “Eight Miles High,” “Forty
Miles of Bad Road,” “She Smiles like a River,” and everything 
by Miles Davis.
2. Look through the results, which display while you type.
The search operation works immediately, as shown in Figure 8-6, display-
ing, in the song list, any matches in the Name, Artist, and Album columns.
If you’re in Browse view with an artist and a particular album selected,
you can’t search for another artist or song. Use browsing with searching
to further narrow your search.
3. Scroll through the search results and then click an item to select it.
To back out of a search so that the full list appears again, you can either click
the circled X in the Search field (which appears only after you start typing
characters) or delete the characters in the Search field. You then see the
entire list in the library’s song list, just like before you began your search. All
the items are still there and remain there unless you explicitly remove them.
Searching manipulates only your view of the items.

Part II: Managing Your Media Content

Finding the Content’s Media File
Getting lost in a large library is easy. While you browse your library, you
might want to return quickly to view the current item playing. While your file
plays, choose File➪Show Current Song (or press Ô-L on a Mac or Ctrl-L in
Windows as a shortcut). iTunes shows you the item that’s playing.
You can also show the location of the media file for any content item. This
trick comes in handy when you want to copy a song or video file to another
hard drive or over a network, or when you want to open it in another applica-
tion. On a Mac, choose File➪Show in Finder (or press Ô-R); in Windows,
choose File➪Show in Windows Explorer (or press Ctrl-R). iTunes gives con-
trol to the operating system (Mac or Windows), which displays the folder
containing the media file.
You can show the file location if it’s on your hard drive but not if it’s in a
shared library on another computer. See Chapter 13 for more details on look-
ing for media files.
Showing Duplicate Items
Because your library will grow, you’ll probably want to check for duplica-
tions. Some songs that appear on artist CDs also appear on compilation or
soundtrack CDs. If you rip them all, you could have duplicate songs that take
up space on your hard drive. You might even have duplicate videos, audio
books, or podcast episodes.
On the other hand, maybe you want to find different versions of the same
song by the same artist. Even when the songs appear on different albums,
iTunes can quickly find all the songs with the same title by the same artist.
To show duplicate items in the list, choose View➪Show Duplicates. iTunes
displays all the duplicate items in alphabetical order in the List pane. If
iTunes is in Browse view, you see all the duplicate items in artist order. Click
the artist to see the duplicate items specifically for that artist.
To stop showing duplicate items and return to your previous view (either List
view or Browse view), click the Show All button below the list of duplicates.
Deleting Content
Deleting content might seem counterproductive when you’re trying to build
up your iTunes library, but sometimes you just have to do it. For example,
you want to delete
151
Chapter 8: Searching, Browsing, and Sorting in iTunes

 Versions of songs: You might have ripped a CD twice — say, once in AIFF
format to burn the songs onto another CD and once in AAC format for
your library and iPod. You can delete the AIFF versions in your library
after burning your CD (as we describe in Chapter 14).
 Songs from playlists: You can delete songs from playlists yet keep the
songs in your library. When you delete a song from a playlist, the song is
simply deleted from the list — not from the library. You can delete entire
playlists as well without harming the songs in the library. You have to
switch to the Library option in the Source pane to delete songs from the
library. (See Chapter 10 for more information about playlists.)
 Any podcast, video, song, or audio book album, or artist from the
library:
• Podcasts: Select the Podcasts option in the Source pane and then
select any podcast or podcast episodes. Press Delete/Backspace
(or choose Edit➪Delete) to delete them. If you delete the podcast,
you remove it from your library, and you have to re-subscribe to it
to get it back. If you delete an episode, you can get it back by click-
ing the Get button next to the episode. You can also select a single
podcast episode and then choose Edit➪Delete All to delete all
episodes but keep the podcast itself.
• Movies or TV shows: Select the Movies or TV Shows option in the
Source pane and then select any movie or TV show episodes or
seasons. Press Delete/Backspace (or choose Edit➪Delete). You can
also select a single TV show episode and then choose Edit➪Delete
All to delete all episodes.
• Audio books: Select the Audiobooks option in the Source pane and
then select any book section or all the sections of a book (books
are typically divided into multiple sections). Press
Delete/Backspace (or choose Edit➪Delete).
• Songs (individually, or albums, or artists) or music videos: Select
the Music option in the Source pane and then select the item or
items — which can be on or more songs, an entire album, all the
works of an artist, or a selection of albums or artists. For example,
you can select an album in Browse view to automatically select all
the songs on the album. Press Delete/Backspace (or choose Edit➪
Delete).
Deleting a content item from the iTunes library removes the item from your
library, but it doesn’t remove it from your hard drive until you agree.
In the first warning dialog that appears, click Remove to remove the selected
items from the library, or click Cancel.
152
Part II: Managing Your Media Content

When iTunes displays a second warning
Some of the selected files are located in your iTunes
Music folder. Would you like to move these files to the

you can click Yes to trash the item, click No to keep it in your music folder, or
click Cancel to cancel the operation.
If you choose to move the album or artist folder to the Trash, the album or
artist folder is deleted from your hard drive; otherwise, it remains in your
iTunes Music folder.
If you leave music files and folders in your iTunes Music folder, you can add
them back to your iTunes library by dragging and dropping them into the
iTunes window.
You can delete multiple items in one clean sweep. Press Shift while you click
a range of items. Alternatively, press Ô (Mac) or Ctrl (Windows) when you

Adding and Editing Information 
in iTunes
In This Chapter
 Retrieving information online
 Editing information for each content item
 Adding information, cover art, comments, and ratings
O
rganization depends on information. You expect your computer to do a
lot more than just store a song with Track 01 as the only identifier. Not
only can iTunes retrieve the song’s track information from the Internet but it
can also find the cover art for you.
Adding all the information for your iTunes content seems like a lot of trouble,
but you can get most of the information automatically from the Internet — and
without all that pesky typing. Adding track information is important because
you certainly don’t want to mistakenly play “My Guitar Wants to Kill Your
Mama” by Frank Zappa when trying to impress your classical music teacher
with the third movement of Tchaikovsky’s Pathétique Symphony, do you? And
because videos you make yourself or convert from other sources don’t have
this automatic information, you have to enter some description to tell them
apart.
This chapter shows you how to add information to your content library in
iTunes and edit it for better viewing so that you can organize your content by
artist, album name, genre, composer, and ratings. You can then use this infor-
mation to sort in List view or Browse view by clicking the column headings.
This chapter also describes how to add cover art for navigating your library
with Cover Flow.

Retrieving Song Information 
from the Internet
Why bother entering information if someone else has already done it for you?
You can easily get information about most music CDs from the Internet (that
is, assuming you can connect to the Internet). The online database available
for iTunes users holds information for millions of songs on commercial CDs
and even some bootleg CDs.
Retrieving information automatically
When you pop a commercial music CD into your computer running iTunes,
iTunes automatically looks up the track information for that CD on the
Internet and fills in the information fields (name, artist, album, and so on).
You don’t need to do anything to make this happen. You can also edit the
information after iTunes fills in the fields.
If your computer doesn’t access the Internet automatically, you might want
to turn off this automatic information retrieval (you can always retrieve the
information manually as we describe later in this section). To turn off the
retrieval of track information, follow these steps:
1. Choose iTunes➪Preferences (Mac) or Edit➪Preferences (Windows).
The iTunes Preferences dialog appears with buttons along the top.
2. Click the Advanced tab.
The preferences on the Advanced tab appear.
3. Click the Importing tab.
The Advanced Importing preferences appear.
4. Deselect the Automatically Retrieve CD Track Names from Internet
option.
With this option turned on, iTunes connects to the Internet automatically
and retrieves the track information. When turned off, iTunes does not
retrieve the information, but you can retrieve it manually as we describe
in the next section.
Retrieving information manually
You can connect manually to the Internet at any time (for example, by using a
modem connection) and retrieve the song information when you’re ready to use
it. After you connect to the Internet, choose Advanced➪Get CD Track Names.
156
Part II: Managing Your Media Content

Even if you automatically connect to the Internet, the song information data-
base on the Internet (Gracenote CDDB) might be momentarily unavailable, or
you might have a delayed response. If at first you don’t succeed, choose
Advanced➪Get CD Track Names again.
Entering Content Information
You have to enter the information for certain media, including CDs that aren’t
known by the Gracenote CDDB, custom CD-Rs, and videos and audio books
that you bring into iTunes from sources other than the iTunes Store. No big
deal, though; just follow these steps:
1. Click directly in the information field (such as Artist) in either Browse
view or List view.
2. Click again so that the mouse pointer toggles to an editing cursor.
3. Type text directly into the information field.
157
Chapter 9: Adding and Editing Information in iTunes
Using the Gracenote database
The first time we popped a commercial music
CD into a computer, song information appeared
like magic. iTunes automatically displayed the
song names, album title, and artist names. How
did it know? This information isn’t stored on a
standard music CD in digital form, but iTunes
has to recognize the disc somehow.
The magic is that the software knows how to
reach out and find the information on the
Internet — in the Gracenote CDDB service.
CDDB stands for (you guessed it) CD Database.
The site (www.gracenote.com) hosts CDDB
on the Web and searches for music CDs by
artist, song title, and other methods. The iTunes
software already knows how to use this data-
base so you don’t have to!
Gracenote recognizes an audio CD by taking into
account the number, sequence, and duration of
tracks. (This is how the database recognizes CD-
Rs that are burned with the identical songs in the
same order.) The database keeps track of infor-
mation for most of the music CDs that you find on
the market.
Although the database doesn’t contain any infor-
mation about personal or custom CDs, people
can submit information to the database about
such CDs. You can even do this from within
iTunes: Type the information for each track while
the audio CD is in your computer and then choose
Advanced➪Submit CD Track Names. The infor-
mation that you enter is sent to the Gracenote
CDDB site, where the good people who work tire-
lessly on the database check out your informa-
tion before including it. In fact, if you spot a typo
or something erroneous in the information that
you receive from the Gracenote CDDB, you can
easily correct it. Just use the Submit CD Track
Names command to send the corrected version
back to the Gracenote site. The good folks at
Gracenote appreciate the effort.

After grabbing the song information from the Internet or typing it, iTunes
keeps track of the information for the CD even if you just play the CD without
importing it. The next time you insert the CD, the song information is auto-
matically filled in.
Editing the Information
Retrieving ready-made song information from the Internet is a great help, but
you might not always like the format it comes in. Maybe you want to edit artist
and band names or other information. For example, we like to list solo artists
by last name rather than by first name. (Gracenote CDDB lists artists by first
name.) For example, we routinely change Miles Davis to Davis, Miles.
Other annoyances sometimes occur when bands feature The at the beginning
of their names, such as The Who, The Band, The Beatles, and The Beach
Boys. Even though these names sort correctly (in alphabetical order, under
their proper names), we dislike having The before the band name, so we rou-
tinely remove it.
You might also want to change the information that is supplied by the iTunes
Store for the movies, TV shows, music videos, audio books, and podcasts you
download. And if you obtain your content from other sources, you might
need to add information for the first time.
In either Browse view or List view, you can edit the content information 
by clicking directly in the specific track’s field (such as the Artist field) and
then clicking again so that the mouse pointer toggles to an editing cursor. You
can then select the text and type over it — or use the Copy, Cut, and Paste
commands on the Edit menu — to move tiny bits of text around within the
field. As you can see in Figure 9-1, we changed the Artist field to Beck, Jeff.
Figure 9-1:
Click inside
a field to
edit the
information.
158
Part II: Managing Your Media Content

You can edit the Name, Artist, Album, Genre, and My Ratings fields in the list.
However, editing this information by choosing File➪Get Info is easier. Keep
reading to find out why.
Editing multiple items at once
Editing in the content list is fine if you’re editing the information for one item,
but typically you need to change all the tracks of an audio CD. For example, if
a CD of songs by Bob Dylan is listed with the artist as Bob Dylan, you might
want to change all the songs at once to Dylan, Bob. Changing all the informa-
tion in one fell swoop is fast and clean, but like most powerful shortcuts, you
need to be careful because it can be dangerous.
You can change a group of items in either Browse or Song List view. Follow
these steps to change a group of items at once:
1. Select a group of content items by clicking the first item and then
pressing Shift while you click the last item.
All the items between the first and last are highlighted. You can extend a
selection by Shift-clicking other items or add to a selection by Ô-clicking
(Mac) or Ctrl-clicking (Windows). You can also remove items already
selected by Ô-clicking (Mac) or Ctrl-clicking (Windows).
2. Choose File➪Get Info or press Ô-I (Mac) or Ctrl-I (Windows).
A warning message displays:
Are you sure you want to edit information for multiple
items?
Speed-editing the information in multiple items at once can be danger-
ous for your library organization. If, for example, you change the name
of the item (the song or movie title, for example), the entire selection
has that name! Be careful about what you edit when using this method.
3. Click Yes to edit information for multiple items.
The Multiple Item Information dialog appears, as shown in Figure 9-2.
4. Edit the field you want to change for the multiple items.
When you edit a field, a check mark appears automatically in the check
box next to the field. iTunes assumes that you want that field changed in
all the selected items. Make sure that no other check box is selected
except the field that you want.
5. Click OK to make the change.
iTunes changes the field for the entire selection of items.

Chapter 9: Adding and Editing Information in iTunes

You can edit the content information in iTunes immediately after inserting the
CD — before importing the audio tracks from the disc. The changes you make
to the track information for the CD are imported along with the music. What’s
interesting is that when you access the library without the audio CD, the
edited version of the track information is still there. iTunes remembers 
the edited song information until the next time you insert that audio CD.
Editing fields for a single item
Although the track information grabbed from the Internet is enough for identi-
fying a song in your iTunes library, some facts — such as composer credits —
might not be included. Adding composer credits is usually worth your effort
because you can then search and sort by composer and create playlists based
on the composer. Videos (movies, TV shows, and music videos), podcasts, and
audio books might also have information in their fields that you want to change
or have blank fields that could use some helpful information.
To locate a single item — song, video, podcast, or audio book, choose File➪
Get Info (or press Ô-I on a Mac or Ctrl-I in Windows). You see the item’s infor-
mation dialog, as shown in Figure 9-3.
When you select one item, its information dialog appears; when you select
multiple items, the Multiple Item Information dialog appears.

Part II: Managing Your Media Content

A selection’s information dialog offers the following tabs:
 Summary: The Summary tab (as shown in Figure 9-3) offers useful infor-
mation about the media file format and location on your hard drive, the
file size, and the information about the digital compression method (bit
rate, sample rate, and so on).
 Info: The Info tab allows you to change the name, artist, composer,
album, genre, year, and other information. You can also add comments,
as shown in Figure 9-4.
 Video: The Video tab lets you set the type of video — movie, TV show,
or music video — in the Kind pop-up menu. For TV shows, you can add
show information including the title of the show, episode number and ID,
and season number.
 Sorting: The Sorting tab allows you to add information to fields for addi-
tional choices while sorting your library content. For example, you can
add a different name for the artist in the Sort Artist field to the right of
the Artist field. Information from the Info tab appears on the left side,
and you can add an alternative sort field on the right side. You can even
add a Show field for the title of a concert or some other use. Choose
View➪View Options to select a sort field as a List view option, and then
you can sort your content in List view by using the sort fields.

 Options: The Options tab, as shown in Figure 9-5, offers the following:
• Volume Adjustment: Drag the slider to the right to increase the
volume adjustment up to 100%; drag the slider to the left to
decrease the volume adjustment up to 100%.
• Equalizer Preset: Choose an equalizer preset for an item. See
Chapter 17 for details on how you can use this preset to control
how an item sounds on your iPod as well as in iTunes.
• Ratings: Assign up to five stars to an item as a rating. (See how in
the upcoming section, “Adding a rating.”)
• Start Time and Stop Time: Set the start and stop times for an item. 
Visit this book’s companion Web site for details.
• Remember Playback Position: Set this option for an item so that
when you select and play the item, iTunes resumes playing it from
where you left off. This option is usually turned on for audio books,
movies, and TV shows.
• Skip When Shuffling: Set this option for an item to be skipped from
Party Shuffle.
• Part of a Gapless Album: Set this option for an item to be played
back without a gap between songs. (See Chapter 5 to find out
about the gaps between songs.)

 Lyrics: The Lyrics tab offers a text field for typing or pasting lyrics (or
any text).
You can view the lyrics on fifth- and sixth-generation iPods and iPod
nano models by starting a song, or choosing the Now Playing option
from the main menu, and then pressing the Select button three times
(once to show the slider, again to show the cover art, and one more time
to show the lyrics).
 Artwork: The Artwork tab allows you to add or delete artwork for the
item. See the upcoming section, “Adding Cover Art.”
If you follow the careers of certain guitarists, vocalists, or session musicians,
you can sort your music in List view by something other than the given artist
for the album. First, provide a new entry for the Sort Artist or Sort Album
Artist fields in the Sorting tab, and then choose that field as a view option so
that you can sort on it. For example, we like to use the Sort Artist field for the
leader, lead guitarist, or lead singer in a band, or a session player or special
guest (such as Nicky Hopkins, who played keyboards on a variety of albums
by different bands including The Who, The Rolling Stones, and The Beatles).
After entering Nicky Hopkins into the Sort Artist field for the songs, we can
choose View➪View Options and select Sort Artist for a column heading. We
can then sort the List view by clicking the new Sort Artist heading to find all
recordings featuring Nicky Hopkins.

Chapter 9: Adding and Editing Information in iTunes

You can apply the entry of a sort field in the Sorting tab to all the tracks of the
same album, or to all tracks by the same artist, album artist, composer, or
show. After changing the sort field for an item in the Sorting tab, select the item
in List view, Control-click (right-click in Windows) the item to display the con-
textual menu, and then choose Apply Sort Field. Click Yes to make the change.
To move through an album one item at a time when using Get Info (without
closing and reopening the information dialog), click the Previous or Next 
buttons in the bottom-left corner of the dialog.
Adding a rating
iTunes also allows you to rate your content. The cool thing about ratings is
that they’re yours. You can use ratings to mean anything you want. For exam-
ple, you can rate songs based on how much you like them, whether your
mother would listen to them, or how they blend into a work environment.
You might have noticed the My Top Rated playlist in the Source pane. This
playlist is an example of a smart playlist — a playlist that updates when ratings
are changed. The My Top Rated playlist plays all the top-rated songs in your
library. You can find out more about playlists in Chapter 10. You can also rate
videos based on your watching habits as well as audio books and podcasts.
To add a rating to a content item, click the Options tab (refer to Figure 9-5)
and drag inside the My Rating field to add stars. The upper limit is five stars
(for the best).
Adding Cover Art
iTunes displays the cover art for your albums, videos, movies, podcasts,
audio books, and TV shows in the Cover Flow browser (see Chapter 8 for
details), and color-display iPods, Apple TV, and the iPhone also display the
cover art. So it makes sense to get the art, especially since it’s free!
Items that you buy from the iTunes Store typically include an image of the
album, book, or box cover art or a photo of the artist that serves as cover
art. You can see the artwork in the lower-left corner of the iTunes window by
clicking the Show/Hide Artwork button, as shown in Figure 9-6. The artwork
changes for each item or album that you select and play.
To fill your library automatically with cover art for the CDs you ripped, get
yourself an iTunes Store account if you don’t already have one. Log in to your
account and then choose Advanced➪Get Album Artwork. iTunes grabs the
cover art not only for iTunes Store purchases but also for CDs you ripped —
provided that the albums are also available in the iTunes Store.
164
Part II: Managing Your Media Content

To download cover art for ripped CDs automatically after ripping them (with-
out having to manually choose Advanced➪Get Album Artwork each time),
choose Preferences from the iTunes menu on a Mac or the Edit menu in
Windows, click the General tab if it is not already selected, and select the
Automatically Download Missing Album Artwork option.
You can also get your cover art from other places that sell CDs (including
Amazon.com) or even scan them from the actual CDs. The optimal size for
cover art is 300 x 300 pixels. Save it in a graphics format that iTunes (and its
underlying graphics technology, QuickTime) understands — JPEG, GIF, PNG,
TIFF, or Photoshop. With a Web browser, you can visit Web pages to scout for
suitable art; just Control-click (Mac) or right-click an image (Windows) to
download and save the image on your hard drive.
To add artwork to one or more items, select it (or them) in your iTunes
library and do one of the following:
 Drag the artwork’s image file from a Desktop folder into the artwork
viewing area (the bottom-left corner of the iTunes window).
To add artwork for an entire album (rather than just individual songs) or
season of TV shows, first select the album or season in Browse view or
select all the items in List view. Then drag the image file into the artwork
viewing area.
 Add artwork to a single item through the information window.
Choose File➪Get Info and then click the Artwork tab in the Get Info
dialog. Click the Add button, browse your hard drive or network for the
image file, select the file, and then click OK.
Figure 9-6:

Chapter 9: Adding and Editing Information in iTunes

 Add artwork for multiple items in the Multiple Item Information
dialog.
Choose File➪Get Info after selecting the items, enable the Artwork field
(select its check box), and then drag a graphics file for the cover art
from a Desktop folder to the Artwork well. Click Yes to the warning 
message to change the artwork.
See the “Editing multiple items at once” section, earlier in this chapter,
to find out more about using the Multiple Item Information dialog.
To remove the artwork from an item, view the artwork in a larger window or
resize the artwork, choose File➪Get Info, and then click the Artwork tab. You
can add a different image (or several images) with the Add button, delete
images with the Delete button, or resize images with the size slider.

with Playlists
In This Chapter
 Creating a playlist of multiple songs

 Adding podcast episodes and videos to playlists
 Creating and editing smart playlists
 Creating an iMix playlist for the iTunes Store
T
o organize your content for different operations, such as copying to your
iPod or Apple TV, or burning a CD, you make a playlist — a list of the
items that you want in the sequence that you want to play them.
You can use playlists to organize your music playback experience. For exam-
ple, you can make a playlist of love songs from different albums to play the
next time you need a romantic mood, or you can compile a playlist of surf
songs for a trip to the beach. We create playlists specifically for use with an
iPod on road trips and generate other playlists that combine songs from dif-
ferent albums based on themes or similarities. For example, we have a jazz
playlist for cruising around the city at night, a classic rock playlist for jogging
in the morning, a playlist of short films mixed with TV shows for a long air-
plane ride, and a playlist of rain songs to celebrate rainy days.
You can create as many playlists of songs, audio books, podcast episodes,
and videos in any order that you like. The items and their files don’t change,
nor are they copied: iTunes simply creates a list of the item names with links
to the actual items and their files.
You can even create a smart playlist, which automatically includes items in the
playlist based on the criteria you set up and also removes items that don’t
match the criteria. The information included in iTunes (see Chapter 9) is very
useful for setting up the criteria. For example, you can define the criteria for a
smart playlist to automatically include songs from a particular artist or songs
that have the highest rating or fit within a particular musical genre.

Creating Playlists
You need to create a playlist to burn a CD, but playlists can also make it easier
to play items you like without browsing the entire library looking for them. You
can create playlists of individual songs or entire albums. You can also include
audio books, TV shows, videos, podcast episodes, and Web radio stations in
playlists.
Song playlists
You can drag individual songs into a playlist and rearrange the songs to play
in any sequence you want.
To create a playlist, follow these steps:
1. Click the Add Playlist button or choose File➪New Playlist.
Clicking the Add Playlist button, in the bottom-left corner of the iTunes
window under the Source pane, creates a new playlist in the Source pane
named untitled playlist.
2. In the Source pane, click untitled playlist twice and give it a new
descriptive name.
After clicking the playlist name once, a text cursor appears, and the playlist
name is highlighted. You can begin typing a new name. After you type a
new name, iTunes automatically sorts it into alphabetical order in the
Source pane (underneath the preset smart playlists and other sources).
3. Select Music in the Source pane and then drag songs from the library
to the playlist.
Drag one song at a time (as shown in Figure 10-1) or drag a group of
songs, dropping them onto the playlist name in the Source pane. The ini-
tial order of songs in the playlist is based on the order in which you drag
them to the list. Of course, you can rearrange the songs in any order
after dragging them, as we show in the next step.
4. Select the playlist in the Source pane and then drag songs to rearrange
the list.
• To move a song up the list and scroll at the same time: Drag it over
the up arrow in the first column (the song number).
• To move a song down the list and scroll: Drag it to the bottom of
the list.
• To move a group of songs at once: Press Shift and select a range of
songs (or press Ô on a Mac or Ctrl in Windows while clicking to
select specific songs) and then drag them into a new position.
168
Part II: Managing Your Media Content 

You can drag songs from one playlist to another. Only links are copied, not
the actual files. Besides dragging songs, you can also rearrange a playlist by
sorting the list: Just click the column heading Name, Time, or Artist, and so
on. When you double-click a playlist, it opens in a new window that displays
the song list.
To open a playlist in a new window, double-click the playlist icon next to the
playlist name in the Source pane. You can then select the Music option to
browse your music library and drag items to the separate playlist window.
To create a playlist quickly, select the group of songs that you want to make
into a playlist. Choose File➪New Playlist from Selection, or drag the selection
to the white area underneath the last playlist in the Source pane. You can
then type a name for the new playlist that appears.
Album playlists
Making a playlist of an album is simple. Select the Music option in the Source
pane and drag an album from the Album list in Browse view to the white area
below the items in your Source pane. Or, select the album and then choose
File➪New Playlist from Selection. iTunes automatically creates a new playlist
named after the album.
You might want to play several albums of songs without having to select each
album when you play them. For example, you might want to use an iPod on
that long drive from London to Liverpool to play The Beatles’ albums in the
order they were released (or perhaps the reverse order, reversing The Beatles’
career from London back to Liverpool).
Figure 10-1:
Drag a song

playlist.
169
Chapter 10: Organizing iTunes Content with Playlists

To create a playlist of entire albums in a particular order, follow these steps:
1. Create a new playlist.
Create a playlist by clicking the Add Playlist button under the Source
pane or by choosing File➪New Playlist.
A new playlist named untitled playlist appears in the Source pane.
2. In the Source pane, click untitled playlist twice and give it a new
descriptive name.
3. Select the Music option in the Source pane and then click the Browse
button to find the artist.
The Album list appears in the right panel.
4. Drag the album name over the playlist name.
5. Select and drag each subsequent album over the playlist name.
Each time you drag an album, iTunes automatically lists the songs in the
proper track sequence.
You can rename a playlist at any time by clicking its name twice and typing a
new one. Also, in case you forget which songs are in which playlists, you can
see all the playlists that include a particular song. In Browse view or List view,
press Control on a Mac and click the song; in Windows, right-click the song
and choose Playlists from the contextual menu. The playlists that include the
song are listed in the submenu.
You can organize your playlists into folders in the Source pane. Choose File➪
New Folder to create a folder in the Playlists section of the Source pane. Then
drag playlist names in the Source pane and drop them over the new folder —
just like how you treat folders in your operating system. Folders are useful
for grouping playlists that are similar in content — or, in our case, similar in
function. For example, we use a folder to organize the playlists we use to syn-
chronize different iPods. (See Chapter 12 to read about iPod synchronization.)
You can include smart playlists as well as regular playlists in folders.
Podcast playlists
You can add podcast episodes to your playlists, or you can even create a
playlist consisting entirely of podcast episodes. However, podcasts are a
slightly different animal than albums or songs. You can drag individual podcast
episodes to a playlist. However, if you drag a podcast by its name, iTunes adds
to the playlist only the most recent episodes you listened to (even if only for
one second). To add episodes that you haven’t heard, you have to select the
episodes and then drag them to the playlist.
170
Part II: Managing Your Media Content 

To add a single podcast episode to a playlist, follow these steps:
1. Click the Add Playlist button or choose File➪New Playlist.
The Add Playlist button is in the bottom-left corner of the iTunes
window under the Source pane.
A new playlist named untitled playlist appears in the Source pane.
2. In the Source pane, click untitled playlist twice and give it a new
descriptive name.
After you type a new name, iTunes automatically sorts it into alphabeti-
cal order in the Source pane, underneath the preset smart playlists and
other sources.
3. Select the Podcasts option in the Source pane and then open a podcast
by clicking the triangle next to its name.
The podcast opens to reveal its episodes. (See Chapter 6 for details on
opening podcasts and playing podcast episodes.)
4. Drag episodes from the Podcasts list to the playlist.
Drag one episode at a time or drag a selection of episodes and then
drop them onto the playlist name in the Source pane. The initial order
of episodes in the playlist is based on the order in which you drag them
to the list. Of course, you can rearrange the episodes in any order after
dragging them, as we show you in the next step.
5. Select the playlist in the Source pane and then drag episodes to
rearrange the list.
• To move an episode up the list and scroll at the same time: Drag it
over the up arrow in the first column (the item number).
• To move an episode down the list and scroll: Drag it to the bottom of
the list.
• To move multiple episodes at once: Press Shift and select a range of
episodes (or press Ô on a Mac or Ctrl in Windows to select specific
episodes) and then drag them into a new position.
You can also create a playlist consisting only of podcast episodes, just like
creating a playlist from an album. Follow these steps:
1. Create a new playlist.
Create a playlist by clicking the Add Playlist button under the Source
pane or by choosing File➪New Playlist.
A new playlist named untitled playlist appears in the Source pane.
2. In the Source pane, click untitled playlist twice and give it a new
descriptive name.
3. Select the Podcasts option in the Source pane and then select a pod-
cast by name.
171
Chapter 10: Organizing iTunes Content with Playlists

4. Drag the podcast name over the playlist name.
iTunes adds the current podcast episode and any other episodes you’ve
already heard to the playlist. Note, however, that episodes you haven’t
listened to aren’t included. You have to drag unheard episodes directly.
Video playlists
You can drag individual videos and TV shows into a playlist and rearrange
them to play in any sequence you want.
To create a video playlist, follow these steps:
1. Click the Add Playlist button or choose File➪New Playlist.
Clicking the Add Playlist button, in the bottom-left corner of the iTunes
window under the Source pane, creates a new playlist in the Source pane
named untitled playlist.
2. In the Source pane, click untitled playlist twice and give it a new
descriptive name.
After you type a new name, iTunes automatically sorts it into alphabeti-
cal order in the Source pane, underneath the preset smart playlists and
other sources.
3. Select the Movies or TV Shows option in the Source pane and then
drag videos from the library to the playlist.
Drag one video at a time or drag a selection of items, dropping them
onto the playlist name in the Source pane. The initial order of videos in
the playlist is based on the order in which you drag them to the list.
4. Select the playlist in the Source pane and then drag videos to
rearrange the list.
• To move a video up the list and scroll at the same time: Drag it over
the up arrow in the first column (the item number).
• To move a video down the list and scroll: Drag it to the bottom of
the list.
• To move a group of videos at once: Press Shift and select a range of
items (or press Ô on a Mac or Ctrl in Windows to select specific
songs) and then drag them into a new position.
You can mix videos with songs and other items in a playlist. For example,
mixing songs and music videos, songs and a video documentary, or just a
selection of TV shows, music, podcasts, movies, and audio books for an
entire day’s worth of entertainment. However, if you transfer the playlist to
an iPod that doesn’t play video, the iPod skips the videos.
172
Part II: Managing Your Media Content 

Deleting items from a playlist
You can delete items from playlists while keeping the items in your library.
When you delete an item from a playlist, the item is simply deleted from the
list — not from the library. You can also delete playlists without harming the
content in the library. Note: Switch to the Library sections (Music, Movies,
TV Shows, and so on) in the Source pane to delete items from your library.
To delete an item from a playlist, select the playlist in the Source pane and
then select the item. Press Delete/Backspace or choose Edit➪Delete. In the
warning dialog that appears, click Remove to remove the selected item from
the list.
You can also completely delete an item from your library from within a playlist
by selecting the item and pressing Ô-Option-Delete (Mac) or Ctrl-Alt-Backspace
(Windows).
To delete a playlist, select the playlist in the Source pane and then press Delete/
Backspace or choose Edit➪Delete.
Using Smart Playlists
Under Party Shuffle (near the top of the Playlists section of the Source pane),
you can find smart playlists, which are indicated by a gear icon. iTunes comes
with a few sample smart playlists, such as My Top Rated and Recently Added,
and you can create your own. Smart playlists add items to themselves based
on prearranged criteria, or rules. For example, when you rate your content
items, My Top Rated changes to reflect your new ratings. You don’t have to
set anything up because My Top Rated and Recently Added are already
defined for you.
Of course, smart playlists are ignorant of your taste in music or video. You
have to program them with rules by using the information in iTunes (see
Chapter 9). For example, you can create a smart playlist that uses the Year field
to grab all the songs from 1966. This list, in no particular order, might include
The Beatles (“Eleanor Rigby”), Frank Sinatra (“Strangers in the Night”), The
Yardbirds (“Over Under Sideways Down”), and Ike and Tina Turner (“River
Deep, Mountain High”) — a far-out playlist, no doubt, but not necessarily what
you want. You can use other fields of information that you entered (such as 
ratings, artist name, or composer) to fine-tune your criteria. You can also use
built-in functions, such as Play Count (the number of times the item was played)
or Date Added (the date the item was added to the library).
173
Chapter 10: Organizing iTunes Content with Playlists

Creating a smart playlist
To create a new smart playlist, choose File➪New Smart Playlist. The Smart
Playlist dialog appears (as shown in Figure 10-2), offering the following
choices for setting criteria:
 Match the Following Rule: From the first pop-up menu (see Figure 10-2),
you can choose any of the categories used for information, such as
Composer or Last Played. From the second pop-up menu, you can choose
an operator, such as the greater-than or less-than operator. The selections
that you make in these two pop-up menus combine to create a rule, such
as Year is greater than 1966. You can also add multiple conditions
by clicking the + button (on the right), and then decide whether to match
all or any of these conditions. The Match xx of the Following Rules option
is enabled by default when you set one or more rules.
 Limit To: You can limit the smart playlist to a specific duration, measured
by the number of songs (items), time, or size in megabytes or gigabytes,
as shown in Figure 10-3. You can have items selected by various methods,
such as random, most recently played, and so on.
 Match Only Checked Items: This option selects only those songs or
other items that have a check mark beside them, along with the rest of
the criteria. Selecting and deselecting items is an easy way to fine-tune
your selection for a smart playlist.
Figure 10-2:
Set the first
match rule

174
Part II: Managing Your Media Content 

 Live Updating: This allows iTunes to continually update the playlist
while you play items, add or remove items from the library, change their
ratings, and so on.
After setting up the rules, click OK. iTunes creates the playlist, noted by a
gear icon and the name untitled playlist (or whatever phrase you used for the
first condition, such as the album or artist name). You can click in the playlist
field and then type a new name for it.
Editing a smart playlist
To edit a smart playlist, select the playlist and choose File➪Edit Smart Playlist
(or Control-click (Mac) or right-click (Windows) the playlist and then choose
Edit Smart Playlist from the pop-up menu). The Smart Playlist window appears
with the criteria for the smart playlist.
For example, to modify the smart playlist so that items with a higher rating
are picked, simply add another star or two to the My Rating criteria.
Figure 10-3:
Use multiple
conditions
and a time
limit for 
a smart
playlist.
175
Chapter 10: Organizing iTunes Content with Playlists
A smart playlist for recent additions
Setting up rules gives you the opportunity to
create playlists that are smarter than the ones
supplied with iTunes. For example, we created a
smart playlist with criteria (as shown in Figure
10-3) that does the following:
 Includes any item added to the library in the
past week that also has a rating greater
than three stars.
 Limits the playlist to 72 minutes to be sure it
fits on a 74-minute audio CD, even with gaps
between the songs. It also refines the selec-
tion to the most recently added if the entire
selection becomes greater than 72 minutes.
 Matches only selected items.
 Performs live updating.

You can also choose to limit the playlist to a certain number of items selected
by various methods, such as random, most recently played, and so on.
Creating an iMix
Amateur disk jockeys, rejoice! The iTunes Store offers the iMix section for
sharing your iTunes playlists with other iTunes users. Although you can
submit a playlist of any items to be published in the iMix section of the store,
only items available from the store are actually published. Unavailable items
are skipped.
Browsers in the iTunes Store can view the playlist by entering the iMix section
and clicking any playlist. See Chapter 4 for information about navigating the
iTunes Store, playing short preview clips, and buying content.
To create an iMix, follow these steps:
1. Select the playlist in your iTunes library and choose File➪Create an
iMix.
iTunes displays a warning dialog before accessing the iTunes Store to
publish your playlist.
2. Click the Create button in the warning dialog.
iTunes displays the iTunes Store sign-in dialog.
3. Enter your ID and password and then click Publish.
iTunes selects the iTunes Store option in the Source pane and displays
the iMix page. You see the iMix playlist that will be published, which
includes only available items from the store.
4. Edit the title and description for the iMix playlist and then click the
Publish button.
iTunes publishes the playlist in the iMix section of the store. Others can
browse the playlist and buy any items.

technology makes video editing easy, more cost-effective, and more fun,
opening up entirely new possibilities.
Of course, your vacation photos and videos are priceless to you, preserving
special memories. Family gatherings, vacations, and weddings don’t happen
every day. You want to take these pictures and videos with you when you
visit friends and relatives. However, you don’t want to lug a slide show pro-
jector and a carousel loaded with expensive slides, or wait for a video service
to transfer your videos from camcorder media to VHS cassettes that you can
play in your neighbor’s VCR. So why not use your iPod instead?
All color-display iPod models can play photos and slide shows, and the fifth-
and sixth-generation iPod, as well as the iPhone and Apple TV can play photo
slideshows and videos. The full-size iPod models that display color also con-
nect easily with televisions and video equipment, so you can show slide shows
or videos to a larger audience. You can organize your digital photo library on
your computer and then transfer the photos directly to a color-display iPod in
one easy step — and still keep your color-display iPod synchronized when you
add more photos to your library.
In this chapter we describe what you need to know to get your photos and
videos organized on your computer and ready for iTunes and your iPod,
iPhone, and Apple TV.

puter and editing photos and videos, including detailed information about

Organizing Photos on Your Computer
Using a computer to organize and archive all your digital photos makes
sense. You can organize massive quantities of photos in the photo library in
your computer. You can also add keywords, titles, and film roll information to
each photo automatically, which helps make locating a particular photo very
easy. Keep the photos you like and delete the ones you don’t like. If you have
a color printer, obtaining extra prints is as easy as using the Print command.
You can even e-mail the photos to a service for high-quality prints.
Photo library software, such as iPhoto (on a Mac) or Adobe Photoshop
Elements 4 or Photoshop Album (on a Windows PC) can organize any number
of photos, limited only by available hard drive space. At an average size of
2MB per photo (many photos occupy less space), you can store 10,000
photos on a 20GB hard drive. Of course, you can expand a photo library over
multiple hard drives or create multiple libraries. The number of digital
photos that you can manage has no practical limit.
Most importantly, you can take your photos with you, safely tucked into your
iPod. On a Mac, you can use iPhoto (version 4.0.3 or newer) to import photos
into your computer and organize them into albums. You can then use iTunes
to transfer photos and photo albums automatically from your iPhoto library.
On a Windows PC, you can use Adobe Photoshop Album (version 1.0 or
newer) or Photoshop Elements (version 3.0 or newer) to import photos into
your computer and organize your photos into collections. You can then use
iTunes to transfer photos automatically from your Photoshop Album or
Photoshop Elements library. If you use other photo-editing programs, you
can still update your iPod with the photos, as we describe in Chapter 12.
However, the collections in Photoshop Album and Photoshop Elements 
synchronize automatically with your iPod.
After you import the photos, your photo application stores them in its photo
library and displays them. For example, when iPhoto finishes importing, it
displays a small image for each photo in the photo library, as shown in Figure
11-1. These small versions of your images, which can be reduced to very
small, are thumbnails.
You’ve probably seen photo albums with plastic sleeves for holding photo-
graphic prints. A digital photo album is similar in concept but holds digital
photo files instead of prints. In both cases, an album is simply a way of orga-
nizing photos and placing them in a proper sequence. You select the photos

from your photo library and arrange them in the order you want. iPhoto uses
album as its term; Adobe Photoshop Elements and Photoshop Album call the
album a collection. We use the term album for both.
You can use photo albums to assemble photos from special events (say, a
vacation) or to display a particular subject (such as your favorite nature
photos). If you have more photos in your library than what you want to put
on your iPod, consider organizing albums specifically for transfer to the iPod
and for automatic updating. The order that your photos appear in the album
is important because it defines the order of photos in a slide show on your
iPod. You can also use albums to organize photos for a slide show, QuickTime
movie, or Web page.
You can make as many albums as you like comprising any images from your
photo library. Because the albums are lists of images, they don’t use disk
space by copying the images. Instead, the actual image files remain in the
photo library. Similar to an iTunes playlist, a photo album is a reference list
of photos in your library. You can include the same photo in several albums
without making multiple copies of the photo and wasting disk space.
Organizing photos with iPhoto
To assign photos to an album in iPhoto, follow these steps:
1. Select Library in the iPhoto Source pane.
The photos in your library appear as thumbnails in the viewer tab.
Figure 11-1:
Imported

Chapter 11: Managing Photos and Videos

2. Click the Add Photo Album button.
The + button is underneath the Source pane; refer to Figure 11-1.
Alternatively, choose File➪New Album or press Ô-N.
The New Album dialog appears.
3. Type the album name and then click OK.
4. Select photos in your library and then drag them into the album.
When you click a photo, you know the photo is selected when an outline
appears around it. You can select a block of photos by clicking the first
photo and pressing Shift while clicking the last one. The first and last
photo — and all the photos in between — are selected automatically.
You can also add individual photos to a selection by Ô-clicking each
photo.
A number appears (see Figure 11-2), showing the number of selected
photos in the range.
5. Click the photo album name in the Source pane to rearrange the
photos in the album.
When you click an album name in the Source pane, only the photos you
dragged to the album — not the entire library — appear in the viewer
tab. You can reposition pictures within the album by simply dragging
them to a different location.
iPhoto also lets you create smart albums, which collect photos based on pre-
arranged criteria. For example, you can set up a smart album that collects
Click this button to add an album.
Figure 11-2:
Add multiple
photos at
one time to

180
Part II: Managing Your Media Content 

only the highest-rated photos taken during the last six months, based on rat-
ings you’ve assigned to them.
To create a smart album in iPhoto, follow these steps:
1. Choose File➪New Smart Album and then type a name for the album in
the Name field.
2. Set the conditions for including photos in the smart album.
Make your choices from the pop-up menus. Choose a condition from the
first pop-up menu and then choose a comparison, such as a greater-than
or less-than sign, from the second pop-up menu.
3. Combine conditions for better results.
To add additional matching conditions, click the + button. Then decide
whether to match any of these conditions by choosing the option you
want from the pop-up menu next to Match.
4. When you finish, click OK to save your smart album.
iPhoto automatically updates your smart album when any photo that
matches the criteria is added to or removed from the library.
Organizing photos in Photoshop Album
Windows users can assign photos to a collection via Adobe Photoshop
Album. Follow these steps:
1. Click the Collections tab.
2. Click the Create New Collection button.
The Create Collection dialog appears.
3. Type the collection name and then click OK.
4. Select photos and then drag them into the collection.
You can select multiple photos by clicking the first one and then press-
ing Ctrl while clicking more photos.
5. Select the check box next to the collection name to view the collection
and rearrange the photos in the collection.
You can reorder pictures within the album by simply dragging them to a
different position.

Chapter 11: Managing Photos and Videos

Preparing videos for iTunes and iPods
Video-editing software allows you to edit and improve your imported video
clips, add transitions and special effects, and even edit the soundtrack. The
final result is a digital video file on your computer’s hard drive, which you
can save in a format acceptable to iTunes and your iPod.
To bring a video file into iTunes, simply drag it into the iTunes window or
over the iTunes icon, or choose File➪Add File to Library. After the video is in
your iTunes library, you can play it just like the videos you buy from the
iTunes Store.
iTunes accepts a number of different video file formats, including QuickTime
MOV and MPG files as well as files in the MPEG-4 format, including MPEG-4 files
encoded with the improved H.264 compression standard. These are typical
export options in a number of video-editing programs. H.264, also known as
MPEG-4 AVC (Advanced Video Coding), offers significantly greater compression
than the current MPEG-4 ASP (Advanced Simple Profile) standard, and provides
near DVD quality at under 1 megabits per second, which makes it useful for
wireless Internet connections and iPods.
The QuickTime video technology comprises a collection of digital video file
formats that offer many choices for quality, compression, picture size, and
playback format. Since iTunes uses QuickTime, it can play video formats that
the iPod won’t, such as AVI files, MPEG-1 and MPEG-2, and even MPEG-4 videos
in which the aspect ratio or bit rate is not compatible with fifth- and sixth-
generation iPods that play video. iTunes won’t transfer such videos to these
iPods — it skips them during the synchronization process described in
Chapter 12.
Exporting your videos
Use your video-editing program to save or export a video project as a video
file and then bring your video file into iTunes to play or synchronize it with
your iPod (see Chapter 12). For example, in iMovie on a Mac
1. Choose File➪Share and then click the QuickTime button to export a
digital video file.
2. Choose Expert Settings from the Compress Movie For pop-up menu.
3. Click the Share button to display the Save Exported File As dialog.
4. Click the Options button to define your digital video settings.
You can set the file format, data rate, image size, and frame rate, which
control the picture and audio quality.
182
Part II: Managing Your Media Content 

Explaining all these digital video settings and formats is beyond the
scope of this chapter, but you do need to know which format to use for
which purpose. Just about all digital video formats play well on comput-
ers, but some formats provide better picture quality on a television or
video monitor than others provide. Only two formats — standard MPEG-
4 and H.264-encoded MPEG — play on iPods. Here’s the difference
between the two:
 Displaying on an iPod: H.264 encoding for MPEG-4 is better. You
can set your video image size to 320 x 240 pixels with a data rate
up to 768 Kbps and a frame rate up to 30 frames per second (fps).
Although it might not look as good as Standard MPEG-4 encoding
on a television, most people don’t notice the difference, and the
file size is usually smaller.
 Displaying on a television connected to your iPod: Standard
MPEG-4 is better. You can set your image size to 480 x 480 pixels
with a data rate up to 2.5 Mbps and a frame rate up to 30 fps.
Although it might not look as good as H.264 on the iPod display, 
it looks better on a television.
You can easily convert files to an iPod-ready format, but doing so is time-
consuming. Predetermined by settings, some computers can take half a day or
more to convert a two-hour video file into a format useful for your iPod. Picking
the right format and the proper settings in advance in your video-editing soft-
ware is a good idea; otherwise, you might have to redo your conversions.
To learn more about creating and importing videos into your computer and
editing videos, including details about software for converting video files,
visit this book’s companion Web site.
Converting your videos for iPods
iTunes provides an option for converting videos in the iTunes library into a
format that looks better when you play them on an iPod display. To convert a
video to H.264 for use in your iPod
1. Select the video in your iTunes library, and then Control-click (Mac)
or right-click (Windows) the selected video.
2. Choose Convert Selection for iPod (or choose Advanced➪Convert
Selection for iPod).
The selected videos are automatically copied, and the copies are con-
verted to H.264 at a width of 320 pixels. The original versions remain
unchanged.
183
Chapter 11: Managing Photos and Videos

You can also use software utilities to convert video from a variety of sources,
including DVDs, into iPod-compatible video formats you can import into
iTunes. For details about software for converting video files, visit this book’s

Chapter 12
Synchronizing Devices 
with iTunes
In This Chapter
 Synchronizing your iPod, iPhone, or Apple TV
 Filling up your iPod, iPhone, or Apple TV with selected content
 Copying content directly to your iPod or iPhone
 Managing playlists and editing information on your iPod or iPhone
 Synchronizing an iPod shuffle with Autofill
You use iTunes to put content on your iPod, iPhone, and Apple TV. With
iTunes, you can fill these devices very quickly and keep them synchro-
nized every time you connect them. (iTunes can also keep your iPod and
iPhone synchronized with contacts and calendars; see Chapter 23.)
iTunes lets you decide whether to copy some or all of your songs and audio
books, photos, movies, TV shows, music videos, and podcasts. The choice is
easy if your iTunes library and photo library together are small enough to fit
in their entirety on your iPod, iPhone, or Apple TV. For example, if your
iTunes and photo libraries combined are less than 75GB and you have an
80GB iPod, simply copy everything. (You can see the size of your library in
GB, or gigabytes, at the bottom of the iTunes window in the center.) Copying
your entire library is just as fast as copying individual items (if not faster)
because you don’t have to select among albums and movies, create special
playlists to keep your devices filled, or do anything except connect the
devices to your computer. iTunes does the rest.
This chapter shows you how to set up iTunes to automatically synchronize
your iPod, iPhone, and Apple TV with everything in your library as well as
how to copy content to these devices selectively. You can also copy music,
audio books, and podcasts to your iPod manually. (Apple TV models and
iPhones synchronize only by playlist.) iTunes is flexible in that you can use
separate options to synchronize music, TV shows, movies, and so on. For
example, you can copy to your iPod all your songs and audio books but only

some of your TV shows, none of your movies, and only the podcasts you
haven’t heard yet. Or you can automatically copy to your iPod TV shows,
movies, music videos, and podcasts, and then manually copy music and
audio books to your iPod to fill up the rest of the space, or delete music 
and audio books directly from your iPod if you need to make more room.
This chapter also explains how to fill an iPod shuffle automatically or manually
as well as how to manage space on an iPod shuffle.
Copying and Deleting Content
Automatically
You can set your iPod, iPhone, or Apple TV to copy your entire iTunes library
automatically — synchronizing to your library: The iPod, iPhone, or Apple TV
matches your library exactly, item for item, playlist for playlist. If you made
changes in iTunes after the last time you synchronized, those changes are
automatically made in the device when you synchronize again. If you added
or deleted content in your iTunes library, that content is added or deleted in
the iPod, iPhone, or Apple TV library.
If you store photos in an iPhoto library (on a Mac) or in a program (such as
Adobe Photoshop Album in Windows), you can use iTunes to transfer photos
to your iPod, iPhone, or Apple TV automatically and synchronize the device to
your library so that any changes you make to the photo library are copied to
the device.
iPods can be set by default to automatically synchronize with all music in
your iTunes library and all photos in your photo library — see Chapter 2 for
details on setting up your iPod. Apple TV models and iPhones synchronize
with everything in your iTunes and photo libraries when you click the Sync
button, you can transfer photos to your iPod automatically and synchronize
your iPod to your library so that any changes you make to the photo library
are copied to your iPod.
Content items stored remotely (such as songs shared from other iTunes
libraries on a network) aren’t synchronized because the files aren’t physically
on your computer. Apple TV can stream content from other iTunes libraries
on the same network but synchronizes with only one library. (See Chapter 7
for more info on how to share iTunes files over a network with iTunes as well
as how to copy files to different computers and their iTunes libraries.)
To automatically synchronize your iPod with your iTunes library, just follow
these simple steps:
186
Part II: Managing Your Media Content 

1. With iTunes running, connect the iPod.
The iTunes status pane tells you that iTunes is syncing the device. If you
select the name of the iPod in the Source pane, as shown in Figure 12-1,
you can see on the Summary page of the device’s synchronization
options how much space on the device is occupied by content and how
much is still free.
When your iPod is set to synchronize automatically (that is, selecting
the entire library, or selecting either a playlist or manually selected
items), the List view and Browse view for the device’s contents are
grayed out in the iTunes window. Because you manage the contents
automatically, you don’t have direct access to the content in the device
via iTunes. For direct access, see the later section, “Copying Content to
Your iPod Manually.”
2. Wait for the synchronization to finish and then click Eject to eject the
iPod.
Wait until the iTunes Status pane (at the top) displays that the synchro-
nization is finished. You can then click the Eject button, which appears
in the bottom-right corner of the iTunes window.
On a Mac, you can also eject an iPod by dragging its icon on the Desktop
to the Trash. (In OS X 10.3, you can click the Eject icon next to the iPod
icon in the Finder Sidebar.) In Windows, you can right-click the iPod icon
and choose Eject.

Chapter 12: Synchronizing Devices with iTunes

3. Disconnect your iPod from your computer.
Don’t disconnect your iPod until its menu appears in its display.
That’s it. Your iPod is now synchronized.
You probably don’t need to know anything else in this chapter about syn-
chronizing your iPod unless your iTunes library and additional photo library
are too large to fit. (In that case, see the upcoming section, “If your library
won’t fit on the device.”) Or, if you want to be more selective about the con-
tent while copying to the device automatically, see the later section, “Copying
and Deleting Content Selectively.”
iTunes remembers your synchronization settings for each iPod that you con-
nect from the last time when you synchronized the device.
To prevent an iPod from automatically synchronizing, press Ô-Option (Mac)
or Ctrl-Alt (Windows) while you connect the device, and then keep pressing
until the iPod name appears in the iTunes Source pane.
If you connect to your computer an iPod previously linked to another com-
puter, iTunes displays a message warning you that clicking Yes replaces the
device’s content with the content from your computer’s library. If you don’t
want to change the iPod’s content, click No. If you click Yes, iTunes erases
the iPod and synchronizes the device with your computer’s library.
Synchronizing your iPhone
To automatically synchronize your iPhone with your iTunes library, just
follow these simple steps:
1. With iTunes running, connect the iPhone, and select its name when it
appears in the Source pane.
iTunes displays the iPhone name in the Source pane, as shown in Figure
12-2. After you select its name, iTunes displays the Summary page with
the iPhone’s synchronization options to the right of the Source pane,
including how much space on the device is occupied by content and
how much is still free.
2. If the iPhone is not already set to synchronize automatically, click the
Sync button to synchronize the iPhone.
You can set your iPhone to synchronize automatically during the iPhone
setup process — and if you did so, your iPhone starts synchronizing auto-
matically after you connect it. If you did not set your iPhone to synchro-
nize automatically, click the Sync button to synchronize it to your iTunes
and photo libraries. You can also set the iPhone to synchronize automati-
cally from this point on by selecting the Automatically Sync When this
iPhone is Connected option on the Summary page (refer to Figure 12-2).
188
Part II: Managing Your Media Content 

3. Wait for the synchronization to finish and then click Eject to eject the
iPhone.
Wait until the iTunes Status pane (at the top) displays that the synchro-
nization is finished. You can then click the Eject button, which appears
in the bottom-right corner of the iTunes window.
On a Mac, you can also eject an iPhone by dragging its icon on the
Desktop to the Trash. (In OS X 10.3, you can click the Eject icon next to
the iPhone icon in the Finder Sidebar.) In Windows, you can right-click the
iPhone icon and choose Eject.
4. Disconnect your iPhone from your computer.
That’s it. Your iPhone is now synchronized.
You probably don’t need to know anything else in this chapter about syn-
chronizing your iPhone unless your iTunes library and additional photo
library are too large to fit. (In that case, see the upcoming section, “If your
library won’t fit on the device.”) Or, if you want to be more selective about
the content while copying to the device automatically, see the later section,
“Copying and Deleting Content Selectively.”
iTunes remembers your synchronization settings for each iPhone that you
connect from the last time when you synchronized the device.

Chapter 12: Synchronizing Devices with iTunes

Synchronizing your Apple TV
If you set up Apple TV to connect wirelessly or via Ethernet to your computer
running iTunes (as described in Chapter 7), the name of your Apple TV auto-
matically appears in the iTunes Source pane in the Devices section as soon as
iTunes detects it on the network. You don’t have to do anything — iTunes
immediately begins synchronizing the Apple TV device with your library.
The iTunes status pane tells you that iTunes is syncing the device. If you
select the name of the Apple TV in the Source pane, as shown in Figure 12-3,
you see on the Summary page of the synchronization options how much
space on the device is occupied by content and how much is still free. If 
synchronization doesn’t start automatically, click the Sync button on the
Summary page to start things rolling.
When Apple TV and iTunes get together, not only can you smile on your
brother and love one another, but
 You can watch video content (or listen to audio content) on Apple TV
while Apple TV is synchronizing.
 You can use Apple TV to play anything in your iTunes library on your
computer while iTunes is open:

Part II: Managing Your Media Content 

1. Choose Sources from the Apple TV main menu.
2. Choose the name of your iTunes library in the Sources menu.
If the name is grayed out, iTunes isn’t connected to your Apple TV.
(See Chapter 7 for details on how to set up your Apple TV.)
 You can enable (or disable) synchronization for an Apple TV device:
1. Choose Sources from the Apple TV main menu.
2. Choose Syncing.
 You can also select Change iTunes Library. To synchronize with a new
library, follow the instructions for choosing an iTunes library with Apple
TV (see Chapter 7).
Note: This option erases everything from your Apple TV before synchro-
nizing with the other library, so be sure that’s what you want to do.
If your library won’t fit on the device
If your iTunes library is too large to fit on your iPod or iPhone, you can still
keep your iPod or iPhone automatically synchronized to a subset of your
library. You have four options:
 Create multiple iTunes libraries. You can create several subsets of your
main library (sub-libraries) so that each sub-library could be small
enough to fit on a certain type of device. For example, you might create
a sub-library for an 80GB iPod, and another sub-library for a 40GB Apple
TV, and yet another subset for an 8GB iPod Nano. Before connecting a
device, you could switch to its corresponding sub-library and then syn-
chronize automatically. To find out how to manage multiple iTunes
libraries, see Chapter 13.
 Copy content selectively or manually. You can automatically synchro-
nize your iPod, iPhone, or Apple TV to specific music and music video
playlists, TV shows and movies, podcasts, and photo albums. (See the
upcoming section, “Copying and Deleting Content Selectively.”) You can
also copy music and podcasts directly to your iPod. (See the later sec-
tion, “Copying Content to Your iPod Manually.”)
 Let iTunes decide what goes on the device. iTunes decides which songs
and albums to include by using the ratings that you set for each song,
and creates a playlist specifically for synchronizing with that device. We
explain this method in this section.
If you synchronized your iPod or iPhone before but your iTunes library has
grown larger and won’t fit, iTunes first checks for photos on the device. If
your iPod or iPhone already has photos on it, iTunes asks whether you want
to delete them to gain more space. After clicking Yes or No, iTunes tries its
191
Chapter 12: Synchronizing Devices with iTunes

best to fit everything. If it has to cut something, though, it skips the photos
and displays the message Some photos were not copied.
If you’re still short of space even after skipping photos, iTunes displays a
warning about the lack of free space, and asks whether you want to disable
podcast synchronization for the device, and let iTunes create a selection of
songs.
 If you click Yes, iTunes creates a new playlist (titled Your device name
Selection, as in “TBone iPod Video Selection”) and displays a message
telling you so. Click OK, and iTunes synchronizes your iPod or iPhone
using the new playlist. iTunes also sets your iPod or iPhone to synchro-
nize music automatically by playlist, as we describe later in “Copying
and Deleting Content Selectively.”
 If you click No, iTunes updates automatically until it fills your iPod or
iPhone without creating the playlist.
Either way, iTunes decides which songs and albums to include by using the
ratings that you set for each song. iTunes groups album tracks together and
computes an average rating and play count for the album. It then fills the
iPod or iPhone, giving higher priority to albums with play counts and ratings
greater than zero. You can therefore influence the decisions that iTunes
makes by adding ratings to songs or entire albums; see Chapter 9.
The 40GB Apple TV actually holds about 32 gigabytes of iTunes library con-
tent; the 160GB model holds about 144GB (the rest is occupied by the system
and media files provided by Apple). Your iTunes library could be larger than
your Apple TV’s capacity, so iTunes synchronizes Apple TV starting with all
movies and TV shows before moving on to the music videos, music and audio
books, podcasts, and finally photos. See the following section to discover
how to copy playlists and items selectively to your Apple TV.
Copying and Deleting Content Selectively
Even if your iTunes library is too large to fit on your iPod, iPhone, or Apple
TV, you can still use automatic methods to synchronize your device. Just be
selective, choosing which playlists, TV shows, movies, podcasts, and photo
albums to automatically copy.
You can automatically keep your device synchronized to a subset of your
library, adding new material under your control, in the following ways:
 Select content items to ignore during synchronization with iPods and
iPhones, as described in the later section, “Selecting items to ignore
when synchronizing.”
192
Part II: Managing Your Media Content 

 Create playlists of the music you want to transfer, or create a smart
playlist that selects content for you (as described in Chapter 10) and
then synchronize by playlists, as described in the later section,
“Choosing playlists to synchronize.”
 Limit the transfer and synchronization of photos to albums or collec-
tions rather than the entire photo library, as we describe in the later 
section, “Choosing photo albums to synchronize.”
 Select which TV shows to transfer, as we describe in the upcoming sec-
tion, “Choosing TV shows to synchronize.” TV shows take up consider-
able space in an iPod, iPhone, or Apple TV device. You can select, for
example, to transfer only episodes of shows you haven’t watched yet.
 Select which movies to transfer, as we describe in the later section,
“Choosing movies to synchronize.” Movies take up the most space in an
iPod, iPhone, or Apple TV device.
By synchronizing selectively, you can still make your iPod, iPhone, or Apple
TV match at least a subset of your iTunes library. If you make changes to that
subset in iTunes, those changes are automatically made in the device when
you synchronize again. For example, if you change your settings to update by
certain playlists, any changes you make to those playlists — adding or delet-
ing songs, for example — are reflected in your iPod, iPhone, or Apple TV the
next time you synchronize it to your computer.
Selecting items to ignore when synchronizing
You can decide which songs, audio books, music videos, movies, TV shows,
or podcast episodes you don’t want to synchronize, and simply not include
them with your iPod or iPhone (this feature is not available with Apple TV).
To use this method, you must first deselect the items in your iTunes library
that you don’t want to transfer.
To select (or deselect) an item in your iTunes library, select the check box
next to the item so that the check mark appears (or disappears). To select
(or deselect) a podcast episode, open the podcast first. (See Chapter 6 for
information about opening and playing podcasts.)
You can quickly select (or deselect) an entire album by selecting it in Browse
view and pressing Ô (Mac) or Ctrl (Windows) while making your selections.
After you deselect the items you don’t want to transfer and select the items
you do want to transfer, connect your iPod or iPhone to your computer. Then
follow these steps:
193
Chapter 12: Synchronizing Devices with iTunes

1. Select the device name in the Devices section of the iTunes Source pane.
After selecting the name, the device’s synchronization options appear
with the Summary page visible. (Refer to Figure 12-1 for an iPod or
Figure 12-2 for an iPhone.)
2. Select the Only Sync Checked Items check box and then click Apply to
apply the changes and sync an iPod (click Apply and then Sync to
sync an iPhone).
iTunes automatically restarts synchronization and copies only the items
in the iTunes library that are selected. iTunes also deletes from the
device any items in the library that are not selected.
3. Wait for the updating to finish and then click the iPod or iPhone Eject
button.
Wait until the iTunes Status pane tells you the sync is complete before
ejecting your iPod or iPhone.
Choosing playlists to synchronize
Your music library includes songs, audio books, and music videos. When
synchronizing your iPod, iPhone, or Apple TV, you can include all these
items or just those items defined in playlists. You can create an infinite
number of playlists of any length, as described in Chapter 10. The Music tab
of the synchronization options page for the device gives you options for
choosing music in playlists.
For example, you can create four playlists that contain all essential rock, folk,
blues, and jazz albums, and then select all four, or just one, two, or three of
these playlists to synchronize your iPod, iPhone, or Apple TV. You can create
sets of playlists specifically for synchronizing different devices, such as your
Apple TV set containing movie-related music, or an all-jazz set for your iPod.
Synchronizing automatically by playlists is also an easy way to automatically
synchronize an iPod, iPhone, or Apple TV when a large iTunes library won’t
fit in its entirety. You can also drag songs and albums directly to your iPod
just like you do with any other content item, as we describe in the later sec-
tion, “Copying Content to Your iPod Manually.”
Before using this option, create the playlists in iTunes (see Chapter 10) that
you want to copy to the device, and then connect your iPod or iPhone to
your computer. (If you’re synchronizing an Apple TV, it should already be
detected and in the Source pane.) Then follow these steps:
1. Select the device name in the iTunes Source pane.
2. Click the Music tab.
The Music synchronization options page appears, as shown in Figure 12-4.

Part II: Managing Your Media Content 

3. Select the Sync Music and the Selected Playlists options.
4. From the list box, select each playlist that you want to synchronize
with the device.
You can scroll the list box to see all your playlists. Mark the check box
to select a playlist.
5. Click Apply to apply the changes and sync an iPod (click Apply and
then click Sync to apply changes and sync an Apple TV or iPhone).
iTunes automatically synchronizes the device by erasing its contents
and copying only the playlists that you select in Step 4.
iTunes copies only the music and audio books in these playlists. If you also
select the Include Music Videos option (as in Figure 12-4) on the Music syn-
chronization options page, iTunes includes music videos listed in the playlists.
You can also show album cover art on the color display of fifth- and sixth-
generation iPods by selecting the Display Album Artwork on your iPod option.
If you select the Only Sync Checked Items option on the Summary page of the
device synchronization options (refer to Figure 12-1 for an iPod or Figure 12-2
for an iPhone), only checked items are copied. iTunes ignores items that are
unchecked, even if they’re listed in the chosen playlists for synchronization.
To select all the music and audio books in your library, select the Sync Music
check box and then select the All Songs and Playlists radio button on the
Music synchronization options page. To include all music videos, select the
Include Music Videos option.

Choosing movies to synchronize
Movies take up a lot of hard drive space, so if you limit the movies you syn-
chronize with your iPhone, Apple TV, or fifth- and sixth-generation video iPod,
you gain extra space for more content.
The movies portion of your library includes movies downloaded from the
iTunes store and video files copied into the iTunes library from other sources.
Any video file that isn’t a TV show or music video downloaded from the
iTunes store is categorized as a movie in your iTunes library. Music videos
downloaded from the iTunes Store are included in the music section of your
library; see the earlier section, “Choosing playlists to synchronize.”
You can also drag movies directly to your iPod just like you do with any other
content item, as we describe in the later section, “Copying Content to Your
iPod Manually.”
The Movies tab of the synchronization options page for the device gives you
options for choosing movies to include. Follow these steps:
1. Select the device name in the iTunes Source pane.
2. Click the Movies tab.
The Movies synchronization options page appears, as shown in Figure 12-5.

3. Select the movie synchronization options for the device.
For fifth- and sixth-generation iPods that play video, as well as the iPhone,
select the Sync Movies option (as shown in Figure 12-5), and then select
one of the following options:
• All Movies: Synchronizes all movies with your iPod, iPhone, or
Apple TV.
• Unwatched Movies: You can select to synchronize all unwatched
movies, or choose from the pop-up menu the most recently added
unwatched movie (1 most recent), or the three, five, or 10 most
recently added unwatched movies (3, 5, or 10 most recent).
• Selected: You can select specific movies or video playlists. Scroll
the list box to see all your movies or video playlists. Mark the
check box to select a movie or video playlist to synchronize with
the device.
For Apple TV, select these options, as shown in Figure 12-6:
• Pop-up menu of unwatched or recent Movies: You can choose from
the pop-up menu to synchronize all movies, all unwatched movies,
or the most recently added movie (1 most recent), or the most
recently added three, five, or 10 movies (3, 5, or 10 most recent).
You can alternatively select unwatched recently added movies in
the same increments.
• Selected: You can select specific movies or video playlists. Scroll
the list box to see all your movies or video playlists. Mark the
check box to select a movie or video playlist to synchronize with
the device.
With Apple TV, you can mark both the selected movies option (then
selecting movies or playlists to synchronize) and the unwatched movies
options in the pop-up menu, to synchronize them as well. For example,
in Figure 12-6, we chose 3 Most Recent Unwatched Movies plus the
selected movies.
4. Click Apply to apply the changes and sync an iPod (click Apply and
then click Sync to apply changes and sync an Apple TV or iPhone).
iTunes automatically synchronizes the device by erasing its contents
and copying only the movies that you select in Step 3.
If you select the Only Sync Checked Items option on the Summary page of the
device synchronization options for an iPod or iPhone (refer to Figure 12-1 for
an iPod or Figure 12-2 for an iPhone), only checked items are copied. iTunes
ignores items that are unchecked, even if they’re listed in the chosen movies
for synchronization.

Choosing TV shows to synchronize
TV shows also take up a lot of hard drive space, but you can limit the number
of episodes you synchronize with your iPhone, Apple TV, or fifth- or sixth-
generation video iPod, you gain extra space for more content.
You can also drag TV show episodes directly to your iPod just like you do with
any other content item, as we describe in the upcoming section, “Copying
Content to Your iPod Manually.”
The TV Shows portion of your library includes only TV shows downloaded
from the iTunes store. The TV Shows tab of the synchronization options page
for the device gives you options for selecting which TV shows to include.
Follow these steps:
1. Select the device name in the iTunes Source pane.
2. Click the TV Shows tab for an iPod or the Videos tab for an iPhone.
The TV Shows synchronization options page appears, as shown in
Figure 12-7 for an iPod; for an iPhone, the Videos synchronization page
appears with separate sections for TV Shows and Movies.

Choosing podcasts to synchronize
Although you can listen to an audio podcast or watch a video podcast at any
time on your computer, a podcast’s real value is that you can take it with you
in your iPod or iPhone, or play it on your home TV and stereo with your
Apple TV. You can keep your iPod, iPhone, and Apple TV automatically syn-
chronized with the most recent podcast episodes.
You can also drag podcast episodes directly to your iPod just like you do
with any other content item, as we describe in the upcoming section,
“Copying Content to Your iPod Manually.”
The Podcasts tab of the synchronization options page for the device gives
you options for choosing podcast episodes to include. Follow these steps:
1. Select the device name in the iTunes Source pane.
2. Click the Podcasts tab.
The Podcasts synchronization options page appears, as shown in 
Figure 12-8.

Part II: Managing Your Media Content 

3. Select the Sync Episodes Of option and choose a modifier from the
pop-up menu.
You can choose from the pop-up menu to synchronize all unplayed
episodes, the most recently added episode (1 most recent), or the 3, 5,
or 10 most recently added episodes (3, 5, or 10 most recent). You can
also select unplayed recently added episodes and new episodes in the
same increments.
4. Select one of the following podcast options below the Sync Episodes
Of option:
• All Podcasts: Synchronizes the episodes selected in Step 3 for all
podcasts with your iPod, iPhone, or Apple TV.
• Selected Podcasts: Synchronizes the episodes selected in Step 3 for
selected podcasts. For example, in Figure 12-8, we’re synchronizing
all episodes of the selected podcasts (use the pop-up menu to
switch from “all” to other choices, such as all unplayed episodes of
the selected podcasts). Scroll the list box to see all your podcasts.
Mark the check box to select a podcast to synchronize with the
device.
5. Click Apply to apply the changes and sync an iPod (click Apply and
then click Sync to apply changes and sync an Apple TV or iPhone).
iTunes automatically synchronizes the device by erasing its contents
and copying only the episodes of podcasts that you selected in Step 4.
If you set iTunes to keep only your unplayed episodes, listen to part of a pod-
cast episode on your iPod, and then update your iPod, the podcast episode
disappears from iTunes.
As described in Chapter 6, iTunes can keep track of the playback position so
that when you play a podcast, iTunes remembers your place when you stop 
listening to it, just like a bookmark in an audio book. iTunes resumes playing
from the bookmark when you return to the podcast to play it. You can synchro-
nize podcasts with filenames ending with .m4b to any iPod and never lose your
bookmarked place, whether you listen on your iPod or on your computer.
Choosing photo albums to synchronize
You can take your pictures with you, safely tucked into your color-display iPod
or iPhone, and you can display slide shows at home with your Apple TV. On a
Mac, you can use iPhoto (version 4.0.3 or newer) to import photos into your
computer and organize them into albums, as we describe in Chapter 11. You
can then use iTunes to transfer photos from your iPhoto library automatically.
201
Chapter 12: Synchronizing Devices with iTunes

In Windows, you can use Adobe Photoshop Album (version 1.0 or newer) 
or Photoshop Elements (version 3.0 or newer) to import photos onto your
computer and to organize your photos into collections, as we describe in
Chapter 11. You can then use iTunes to transfer photos from your photo
library automatically.
If you don’t have any of these programs, you can use any other photo-editing
or photo-organizing software and store your photos in a folder on your hard
drive, or on a CD or server volume. You can then use iTunes to transfer photos
from the folder, treating the folder as a photo album. The folder could be on
CD-ROM or on a server volume as long as the CD-ROM or volume is mounted.
Whether you transfer photos from a library or from a folder on your hard
drive, you can keep your color-display iPod, iPhone, and Apple TV synchro-
nized with the photo library and its albums or with the subfolders and image
files in the folder.
If you store photos in a photo library, such as iPhoto (Mac) or Photoshop
Elements (Windows), you can synchronize your entire photo library to your
color-display iPod, iPhone, or Apple TV automatically. Any changes you make
to the library are consequently copied to your iPod, iPhone, or Apple TV. See
the earlier section, “Copying and Deleting Content Automatically.”
To transfer only photos in specific albums in a library to your iPod and keep
your iPod synchronized with these albums (not the entire library), follow
these steps:
1. Select the device name in the iTunes Source pane.
2. Click the Photos tab.
The Photos synchronization options page appears, as shown in 
Figure 12-9.
3. Select the Sync Photos From option and then choose a photo library
or a folder from the pop-up menu.
You can choose your photo library (such as iPhoto on a Mac, or Adobe
Photoshop Album in Windows) from the pop-up menu to synchronize
photo albums, or you can choose a folder from the pop-up menu (say,
your Pictures folder). You can also choose Folder from the pop-up menu
to browse files and folders on your hard drive or other storage media
(such as a CD-ROM or a server volume). In Finder or Windows Explorer,
browse your hard drive (or other storage media) for the folder contain-
ing images and then click Choose (Mac) or OK (Windows).
If you want photos in a folder to appear in separate photo albums on
your iPod, create subfolders inside the folder and organize your photos
and image files inside these subfolders. iTunes copies the subfolder
assignments as if they were album assignments.
202
Part II: Managing Your Media Content 

4. Select one of the following photo options below the Sync Photos From
option:
• All Photos and Albums: Synchronizes all photos and albums from
the library or folder selected in Step 3 with your iPod, iPhone, or
Apple TV.
• Selected Albums: Synchronizes the photo albums from the library
(or subfolders from the folder) selected in Step 3. For example, in
Figure 12-9, we synchronize from our iPhoto library the selected
album “John & Jimi music.” Scroll the list box to see all the photo
albums in your photo library (or subfolders in your folder). Mark
the check box to select a photo album (or subfolder) to synchro-
nize with the device.
5. Click Apply to apply the changes and sync an iPod (click Apply and
then click Sync to apply changes and sync an Apple TV or iPhone).
iTunes automatically synchronizes the device by erasing its contents
and copying only the photo albums that you selected in Step 4.
iTunes copies all other types of content first, before copying photos, but you
can influence the order in which iTunes copies photo albums. When you
select photo albums to synchronize in Step 4 above, you can drag the albums
in the list into any order you choose — for example, you can select and drag
the most important photo albums to the top of the list.
Figure 12-9:

Chapter 12: Synchronizing Devices with iTunes

No matter what photo application you use, you can save photos as image
files in a folder on your hard drive and then bring them into your iPod when-
ever you want. It’s rare for an iPod to meet an image file format it doesn’t like.
On a Mac, use JPEG (JPG), GIF, TIFF (TIF), Pict, PNG, PSD (Photoshop), PDF,
jpg 2000, SGI, and BMP. In Windows, use JPEG (JPG), GIF, TIFF (TIF), PNG,
and BMP.
Copying Content to Your iPod Manually
You can add content to your iPod directly via iTunes, and you can delete con-
tent from your iPod as well. The iPod name appears in the iTunes Source
pane. When selected, its contents appear in the iTunes List pane, replacing
the library contents.
You might have one or more reasons for copying manually, but here are some
obvious ones:
 Your entire library is too big for your iPod, and you want to copy individ-
ual items directly.
 You want to share a single library with several iPods, and you have dif-
ferent song selections that you want to copy to each iPod directly.
 You share an iPod with others, and you want to copy your content to the
iPod without wiping out its existing content.
 You want to copy some songs or videos from another computer’s iTunes
library without deleting any content from your iPod.
 You want to edit the playlists and content information directly on your
iPod without changing anything in your computer’s library.
 You want to play your iPod through the computer’s speakers and take
advantage of iTunes playback features (such as cross-fading between
two tracks; see Chapter 6).
When you set your iPod to manually manage music and videos, all contents
on your iPod are active and available in iTunes. You can copy items directly
to your iPod, delete items on the iPod, and edit the iPod’s playlists directly.
To set your iPod to manually manage music and videos, first connect your
iPod to your computer. Then follow these steps:
1. Select the iPod’s name in the Devices section of the iTunes Source pane.
After selecting the name, the device’s synchronization options appear
with the Summary page visible. (Refer to Figure 12-1.)
204
Part II: Managing Your Media Content 

2. Select the Manually Manage Music and Videos check box and then
click OK to the warning.
iTunes displays a message warning you that disabling automatic synchro-
nization requires manually ejecting the iPod before each disconnect.
3. Click Apply to apply the change.
To prevent an iPod from automatically synchronizing, press Ô-Option (Mac)
or Ctrl-Alt (Windows) while you connect the device, and keep pressing until
the iPod name appears in the iTunes Source pane.
If you connect to your computer an iPod previously linked to another com-
puter, iTunes displays a message warning you that clicking Yes replaces the
device’s content with the content from your computer’s library. If you don’t
want to change the iPod’s content, click No. If you click Yes, iTunes erases
the iPod and synchronizes it with your computer’s library.
Don’t disconnect your iPod while managing music and videos manually. You have
to eject the device and wait until it displays the message OK to disconnect
(in first- and second-generation iPods) or the main menu. You risk making the
device’s hard drive or flash memory unreadable, forcing you to restore it to its
original factory condition (see Chapter 24).
Copying items directly
As soon as you set your iPod to manually manage music and videos, you can
copy music and video items directly from your iTunes library. Follow these
steps (with your iPod connected to your computer):
1. Select Music in the iTunes Source pane in the Library section (or a
playlist).
The library’s or playlist’s songs appear in List view or Browse view.
2. Drag items directly from your iTunes library or playlist over the iPod
name in the Source pane, as shown in Figure 12-10.
When you drag a playlist name, all the songs associated with the playlist
copy along with the playlist itself. When you drag an album title, all the
songs in the album are copied.
3. Wait for the copying to finish and then click Eject to eject the iPod.
Wait until the iTunes Status pane (at the top) tells you that the copying
is finished. You can then click the Eject button, which appears in the
bottom-right corner of the iTunes window.
On a Mac, you can also eject an iPod by dragging its icon on the Desktop
to the Trash. (In OS X 10.3, you can click the Eject icon next to the iPod
icon in the Finder Sidebar.) In Windows, you can use various methods,
such as right-clicking the iPod icon and then choosing Eject.
205
Chapter 12: Synchronizing Devices with iTunes

4. Disconnect your iPod from your computer.
Don’t disconnect your iPod until its menu appears in its display.
Deleting items on your iPod
When you manually manage music and videos, you can delete content from
the iPod directly. Manual deletion is a nice feature if you just want to go in
and delete a song, video, or album to make room for new content.
To delete any item in your iPod, set the option to manually manage music
and videos (if it isn’t set that way already), and then follow these steps:
1. Select the iPod in the iTunes Source pane.
The iPod’s content appears in List view or Browse view, replacing the
view of your computer’s library.
2. Select an item in the List or Browse view and press Delete/Backspace
or choose Edit➪Delete.
iTunes displays a warning to make sure you want to do this; click OK to
go ahead or Cancel to stop. If you want to delete a playlist, select the
playlist and press Delete or choose Edit➪Delete.
Figure 12-10:
Copy an

206
Part II: Managing Your Media Content 

Like in the iTunes library, if you delete a playlist, the items listed in the
playlist are not deleted. They’re still on your iPod unless you delete the items
directly from the iPod in List view or Browse view.
Creating playlists directly on an iPod
Playlists from your iTunes library are automatically copied when you syn-
chronize your iPod. However, you might want to edit the library in your iPod
separately, perhaps creating new playlists or changing the song information
manually.
To create a new playlist, follow these steps:
1. Select the iPod in the iTunes Source pane.
2. Open the playlists for the iPod.
Click the triangle next to the iPod name to open the list of playlists on
the device.
3. Create a new playlist by clicking the Add Playlist (+) button in the
bottom-left corner of iTunes under the Source pane or by choosing
File➪New Playlist.
Untitled playlist appears in the Source pane under the iPod entry.
4. Click the Untitled Playlist name twice, and type a new name for the
playlist.
After you type a new name, iTunes automatically sorts the iPod list into
alphabetical order.
5. Select the iPod name in the Source pane.
The iPod’s contents appear in the List pane, replacing the computer’s
library content.
6. Drag items from the List pane to the playlist.
The order of items in the playlist is based on the order in which you drag them
to the list. You can rearrange the list by dragging items within the playlist.
You can create smart playlists on the iPod exactly the same way as in the
iTunes library. A smart playlist updates itself when you create it with iTunes
and then updates itself every time you connect and select your iPod with
iTunes. To read about smart playlists, see Chapter 10.
207
Chapter 12: Synchronizing Devices with iTunes

Editing content information on your iPod
With the iPod selected in iTunes and set for manually managing music and
videos, you can edit the content information just like you do in the iTunes
library by scrolling down the list and selecting items.
After selecting the iPod in the Source pane, the List pane displays the contents
of the iPod.
You can edit song information (such as name, artist, album, genre, and rat-
ings) directly in the columns in the List pane. To edit song information, select
the song and then click inside the text field of a column to type new text.
You might find it easier to edit this information by choosing File➪Get Info and
typing the text into the Information dialog that appears.
iTunes grabs song information from the Internet (as we describe in Chapter 9),
but this information typically doesn’t include composer credits. If you have
the inclination to add composer credits, doing so is worth your time because
you can then search, sort, and create playlists based on this information. This
is particularly important for classical music lovers because the iPod makes it
easy to find songs by the performer/artist but not by the composer — and
sorting by composer is what many classical music fans prefer.
Synchronizing an iPod shuffle
iPod shuffle is designed for quick and convenient music synchronizing. Just
plug it into your computer and then click the Autofill button in iTunes. It also
offers automatic compression to fit more songs (or audio books, which are
treated as songs) into your iPod shuffle space.
Although Apple proudly advertises its capability to shuffle songs randomly,
the key to its success isn’t that you can shuffle the songs already there but
that you can copy random songs to it every time you connect it to your com-
puter. Eventually, you can shuffle through everything in your library if you so
wish, by randomly filling your iPod shuffle every time. On the other hand,
you can fine-tune your random selection and even reorder the iPod shuffle’s
playlist to play back in a specific order.
Although you can add songs to your iPod shuffle manually by dragging a
playlist or song, you can also automatically fill it without having to set
options for automatic updating. Autofill automatically picks songs from your
entire iTunes library or from a playlist you select in the Source pane. You can
also manage the playlist for your iPod shuffle directly, after using Autofill, to
fine-tune your selection.
208
Part II: Managing Your Media Content 

Using Autofill
To use Autofill to copy songs to your iPod shuffle, follow these steps:
1. Connect the iPod shuffle to your computer.
When you connect an iPod shuffle to your computer, it shows up in the
Source pane.
2. Select the iPod shuffle in the iTunes Source pane.
The Autofill pane appears below the List pane, as shown in Figure 12-11.
The songs on the iPod shuffle appear in List view, replacing the view of
your library.
3. Choose your source of music in the Autofill From pop-up menu.
Choose either a playlist or Music (for the entire music library). If you
choose a playlist, Autofill uses only the playlist as the source of music.
4. (Optional) To pick random songs, select the Choose Items Randomly
option.
5. (Optional) To pick only the best songs (if you’re choosing them ran-
domly), select the Choose Higher Rated Items More Often option.
Figure 12-11:

Chapter 12: Synchronizing Devices with iTunes

6. (Optional) To replace songs already on the iPod shuffle, select the
Replace All Items When Autofilling option.
If you don’t select this option, iTunes adds the songs without replacing
existing songs.
7. Click the Autofill button to start copying songs.
iTunes grabs a subset of your music, creates a playlist, and copies the
contents of the playlist to your iPod shuffle.
8. Wait for the copy operation to finish and then click the Eject button.
Wait until the iTunes Status pane (at the top) tells you that the copying
is finished. You can then click the Eject button, which appears in the
bottom-right corner of the iTunes window.
You can click the Autofill button over and over to create different random
playlists. When you get one you like, select all its contents and choose
File➪New Playlist From Selection to create a new playlist that contains the
songs generated by Autofill. The next time you connect your iPod shuffle,
select this new playlist from the Autofill From pop-up menu and then click
the Autofill button to load the music from the playlist to your shuffle.
iPod shuffle can play audio books sold by the iTunes Store and by Audible.
com. Unfortunately, iTunes won’t automatically add them to the iPod shuffle —
you have to add them manually. Be sure to play audio book sections on your
iPod shuffle in sequential order rather than in random (shuffle) order, or you
may hear chapters in the wrong order — see Chapter 15 for details on playing
content on an iPod shuffle.
Copying items manually
iPod shuffle is always set for manual management. When you connect an iPod
shuffle to your computer, you can copy music (or audio books) directly to it,
delete items on it, and edit its playlist.
To copy items to your iPod shuffle directly, connect it to your computer and
follow these steps:
1. Select Music in the iTunes Source pane in the Library section.
Your music library’s content appears in List view.
2. Drag and drop items directly from your iTunes library to the iPod
shuffle’s name in the Source pane.
When you copy a playlist, all the songs in the playlist are copied. When
you copy an album, all the songs in the album are copied.
210
Part II: Managing Your Media Content 

3. Wait for the copy operation to finish and then click the iPod Eject
button.
Wait until the iTunes Status pane (at the top) tells you that the copying
is finished. You can then click the Eject button, which appears in the
bottom-right corner of the iTunes window.
To delete any item in your iPod shuffle, follow these steps:
1. Select the iPod shuffle in the iTunes Source pane.
The songs on the iPod shuffle appear in List view, replacing the view of
your library.
2. Select one or more songs on the iPod shuffle and then press Delete/
Backspace or choose Edit➪Delete.
iTunes displays a warning to make sure you want to do this; click OK to
go ahead or Cancel to stop.
Managing space on your iPod shuffle
It’s a nifty song player! No, it’s an external flash drive for data backup! Either
way, you can wear the iPod shuffle on your sleeve, around your neck,
attached to your belt, or in your pocket — which makes it quite convenient
for either music or data. To maximize the data potential of your iPod shuffle,
see Chapter 22.
To manage space on your iPod shuffle, connect it, select it in the Source
pane, and then click the Settings tab on the iPod shuffle’s synchronization
options page. Scroll the Settings page to the bottom to see more options, as
shown in Figure 12-12.
You can allocate storage for music and data by using the slider at the bottom
of the page (as in Figure 12-12) with More Songs on the left side and More
Data on the right. Drag the slider to the right to open up space for data, or to
the left to open up more space for music. Don’t worry — adding more space
won’t affect any data files already stored on the iPod shuffle.
If the storage allocation slider is as far left as it can go or as far left as you want
to take it (leaving space for data), you still have one more method of squeezing
music onto the iPod shuffle: the Convert Higher Bit Rate Songs to 128 kbps AAC
option. This option does just what it says: It converts songs with higher bit
rates in either protected or unprotected AAC files or MP3 files into smaller AAC
files by using 128 Kbps as the bit rate. (For more information about these audio
formats and bit rates, see Chapter 18.) It performs this conversion on the fly
while copying songs to the iPod shuffle, but it doesn’t change the songs in your
library. Protected AAC songs retain their protection.

Chapter 12: Synchronizing Devices with iTunes

You can save considerable space by converting songs to a lower bit rate. 
An iPod shuffle holding an average of 180 songs encoded at 192 Kbps in MP3
can hold an average of 260 songs via this option. The conversion reduces an
uncompressed AIFF file to about 7 percent of its original size.

 Locating the iTunes library
 Exporting playlists from iTunes
 Moving your iTunes library to another hard drive
 Managing multiple iTunes libraries
 Backing up your iTunes library
You might think that your digital content is safe, stored as-is, on your
iPod, iPhone, Apple TV, and hard drive. However, demons in the night
are working overtime to render your hard drive useless — and at the same
time, someone left your iPod out in the rain, your iPhone can’t phone home,
and your Apple TV is on the fritz.
Copyright law and common sense prohibit you from using copyrighted content
and then selling it to someone else. However, with iTunes, you’re allowed to
make copies of music, videos, audio books, and podcasts that you own for 
personal use, including copies for backup purposes.
In this chapter, you find out how to make a backup of your entire library. This
operation is very important, especially if you’ve purchased items that don’t
exist anywhere else in your collection but on your computer. That way, even if
your hard drive fails, you still have your iTunes library. You can also manage
multiple iTunes libraries, which makes it much easier to keep multiple iPods
synchronized to different libraries.
You can’t copy content from your iPod, iPhone, or Apple TV to your computer
via iTunes. It’s a one-way trip from iTunes to your iPod, iPhone, or Apple TV.
You can’t copy stuff from your player device with iTunes because record labels
and video distributors don’t want indiscriminate copying, and Apple has 
complied with these requests. You can, however, use third-party utility programs
(not supported by Apple) to copy content both ways. (You can read more on
this topic in Chapter 23.) This chapter describes how to keep a backup of your
iTunes library on your computer, another hard drive, or a backup medium 
so that you don’t rely on your iPod, iPhone, or Apple TV as your sole music
storage device.

The iTunes Store uses Apple FairPlay technology, which protects the rights 
of copyright holders while also giving you some leeway in how you can use
the copyrighted content. You can copy the media files freely so that backup
is easy and straightforward on either a Mac or a PC.
Studying Files in an iTunes Library
If you’re like that guy in the movie Diner who couldn’t stand to have his records
misfiled, you’ll love iTunes and its nice, neat file-storage methods. For all con-
tent items, iTunes creates a folder named for the artist and also creates folders
within the artist folder named for each album. These folders are stored in the
iTunes Music folder unless you change your storage preferences.
Finding the iTunes library
The default method of storing content in the iTunes library is to store all
media files — including music, videos, podcasts, and audio books — in the
iTunes Music folder, which is inside the iTunes folder. With this method,
media files that you drag to the iTunes window are copied into the iTunes
Music folder without deleting the original files. iTunes keeps iPod games in
the iPod Games folder in the iTunes folder and houses cover art in the Album
Artwork folder in the iTunes folder. So that’s easy — everything is inside the
iTunes folder.
iTunes maintains a separate iTunes folder (with a separate iTunes Music
folder) in each Home folder (Mac) or user folder (PC). If you share your com-
puter with other users who have Home folders, each user can have a separate
iTunes library on the same computer (and, of course, a separate iPod that
synchronizes with it). You need only one copy of the iTunes program.
On a Mac, iTunes stores your content library in your Home folder’s Music
folder. The path to this folder’s default location is
your home folder/Music/iTunes/iTunes Music
On a Windows PC, iTunes stores your content library in your user folder. The
path to this folder’s default location is
your user folder/My Documents/My Music/iTunes/iTunes Music
214
Part II: Managing Your Media Content 

Changing how files are stored 
in the library
The default method of organizing files in the iTunes library is to store content
files in album and artist folders, naming the files according to the disc number,
track number, and title.
For example, the song “Here, There and Everywhere” has the track number
and song title in the filename (05 Here, There And Everywhere.mp3).
The filename extension even tells you the type of encoding format — in this
case, MP3. Note: Songs encoded in AAC have the extension .m4a (for unpro-
tected songs) or .m4p (for protected songs purchased from the iTunes Store).
This song is saved in the Revolver folder (for the album), which is in The
Beatles folder (for the artist).
Movies, music videos, and TV shows follow the same naming conventions
(even if they don’t make much sense). Here’s an example from the TV show
Monk. Episode 13 (season 1) is titled “Mr. Monk and the Airplane.” This infor-
mation makes up the filename (13 Mr. Monk and the Airplane.m4v),
which is stored in the Season 1 folder (the album) inside the Monk folder
(the artist).
What about songs performed by multiple artists, such as movie sound-
track albums and compilations with multiple artists? Compilation and 
soundtrack albums, and songs designated as part of a compilation, are stored
in album folders within the Compilations folder rather than within individual
artist folders.
To designate a song as part of a compilation, select the song, choose File➪
Get Info, click the Info tab in the information dialog, and then select the Part
of a Compilation check box.
To designate an entire album as a compilation album, select the album, choose
File➪Get Info, and then choose Yes from the Part of a Compilation pop-up
menu. Even if Yes is already selected for the album, choose Yes again in order
to set the check mark for updating.
The filename and location within artist and album folders change when you
change the information for a song (or video, audio book, or podcast episode)
in the information fields. For example, if you change the song title, the filename
also changes. If you change the artist name, the folder name for the artist might
change, or the file might move to a new folder by that name. iTunes organizes
the files based on the song information.
To make changes to song information without changing the files on your hard
drive, choose iTunes➪Preferences (Mac) or Edit➪Preferences (Windows) and
then click Advanced. On the Advanced tab, click the General tab and then
deselect the Keep iTunes Music Folder Organized option.
215
Chapter 13: Gimme Shelter for My Media

Leave the Keep iTunes Music Folder Organized option selected, especially if
you plan on copying the music files to an Apple TV or to an iPod or iPhone
that will then be used with a car installation. (We describe car installations in
Chapter 20.) Most iPod interfaces for car stereos provide a way to navigate
the iPod with the car stereo controls but don’t display the proper artist,
album, and song titles unless the iTunes music folder is organized by the
default method.
Maybe you don’t want to store copies of your media files in the library —
especially if you already have copies stored on your hard drive in another
location and need to conserve space. If you want to add content to your
iTunes library without copying the files into the iTunes Music folder:
1. Choose iTunes➪Preferences (Mac) or Edit➪Preferences (Windows).
2. Click the Advanced tab.
3. Click the General subtab in the Advanced pane.
4. Deselect the Copy Files to iTunes Music Folder When Adding to
Library option.
The next time you drag a media file into the iTunes window, it stores only a
reference in your iTunes library to the file that specifies its actual location.
The file isn’t copied or moved.
Locating a media file
No matter where you store your iTunes library or your media files, you can
find the location of any item by selecting the item, choosing File➪Get Info,
and then clicking the Summary tab of the information dialog that appears.
You can see the file type next to the Kind heading of the Summary tab. The
Where section tells you where the song is, as shown in Figure 13-1.
If you access shared libraries on a network, you probably have content you
can display in iTunes that isn’t actually in your library but is part of a shared
library or playlist on a network. Thus, when you look at the Summary tab 
of the information dialog for an item in a shared library, the Where section
doesn’t appear.
You can also open the folder containing the media file for any content item.
Select the item in List, Browse, Album, or Cover Flow view. Then, on a Mac,
choose File➪Show in Finder (or press Ô-R); in Windows, choose File➪Show
in Windows Explorer (or press Ctrl-R). iTunes gives control to the operating
system, which displays the folder containing the media file. You can show
the file if it’s on your hard drive but not if it’s in a shared library on another
computer.
216
Part II: Managing Your Media Content 

Manipulating an iTunes Library
If you’re like me, your iTunes library is huge. I’ve nearly filled the internal
hard drives of two computers. What do you do if you want to expand your
library, but you run out of space? How do you move your library to a higher-
capacity hard drive? What if you have media files all over your hard drive and
you need to consolidate them all in once place so you can reclaim drive
space? You can do all that and more.
Consolidating the library media files
If you have media files that are stored on different hard drives that are con-
nected to the same computer, you can have iTunes consolidate your library
by copying everything into the iTunes Music folder. By first consolidating your
library, you make sure that any backup operation you perform is complete.
To consolidate your iTunes library, choose Advanced➪Consolidate Library.
The original media files remain where they are, but copies are made in your
Music folder.
Figure 13-1:
Locate a

217
Chapter 13: Gimme Shelter for My Media

Changing the location of the library
You can store your iTunes library in a different location on your hard drive or
on another hard drive — as long as you tell iTunes where to find it. To change
where iTunes stores your content library, follow these steps:
1. Choose iTunes➪Preferences (Mac) or Edit➪Preferences (Windows)
and then click the Advanced tab.
2. Click the General tab.
3. Click the Change button, as shown in Figure 13-2.
You can then browse to select another location on any connected hard
drive.
After selecting a new location, the content you bring into iTunes (by ripping
CDs, downloading items from the iTunes Store, or dragging media files) is
stored in the new location. However, previously imported media files stay
where they are. To move the previously imported files to the new library
Figure 13-2:

library.
218
Part II: Managing Your Media Content 

location, drag the media files into the iTunes window so that iTunes stores
them automatically in the new location and updates its library file properly.
You can then delete the media files you copied from the old library location.
To change the storage location back to the iTunes folder inside the Music
folder, click the Reset button in the Preferences window (refer to Figure 13-2).
Moving your library to another hard drive
To move your entire library to another hard drive (presumably a higher-
capacity drive), you can change the location of the library and consolidate
the library at the same time. Follow these steps:
1. Create a folder — name it iTunes — on the other hard drive.
iTunes is a good name, but you could call it anything, and iTunes can
still find it.
2. Change the location of the iTunes library to the new iTunes folder.
To change where iTunes stores the library, see the earlier section,
“Changing the location of the library.”
iTunes creates a new iTunes Music folder inside your new iTunes folder.
3. In the General section of the Advanced pane of the Preferences
dialog, select the Copy Files to iTunes Music Folder When Adding to
Library and the Keep iTunes Music Folder Organized options and
then click OK.
These options might already be enabled. Just double-check to make sure
that they’re selected.
4. Choose Advanced➪Consolidate Library.
iTunes automatically copies all the media files, along with playlists, into
the new iTunes Music folder.
Exporting iTunes playlists
With iTunes, you can export a playlist onto a different computer to have the
same playlist in both places.
You must also copy the songs, videos, podcast episodes, and audio books in
the playlist for the playlists on the other computer to work. Better yet, copy
the entire artist folders containing the items to keep them organized. Exporting
a playlist doesn’t copy the items in the playlist. You get only a list of the items
in eXtensible Markup Language (XML) format — not the content of these items.
You still need to copy the actual media files to the other computer.
219
Chapter 13: Gimme Shelter for My Media

To export a single playlist, select the playlist and then choose File➪Export.
On a Mac, choose the XML option from the Format pop-up menu in the Save:
iTunes dialog and then click the Save button. On a Windows PC, choose the
XML option from the Save as Type pull-down menu in the Save As dialog.
After exporting a playlist to another computer, you can import the playlist
into iTunes on that computer by choosing File➪Import, selecting the XML
file, and then clicking the Choose button. You can also export all the playlists
in your library at the same time by choosing File➪Export Library; then
import them into iTunes on the other computer by choosing File➪Import and
selecting the exported XML file.
You can also import M3U playlist files from other applications that manage
playlists. The M3U format is supported by media players and streaming
servers, such as Winamp (www.winamp.com) and VideoLAN Client (www.
videolan.org).
Managing Multiple iTunes Libraries
You can create more than one iTunes library and manage multiple libraries
with one copy of the iTunes application on your computer. You can also create
one or more sub-libraries of your main library on the same hard drive. You
might want to do this if your main library is too large to fit on an iPod and you
don’t want to resort to manually managing music and videos. You can set up
automatic synchronization with a sub-library that fits entirely on the iPod.
Because iTunes can create the sub-library without copying content files, you
don’t waste hard drive space because sub-libraries share the same files as the
main library.
Consider setting up multiple libraries or sub-libraries if you want to do any of
the following:
 Create one or more sub-libraries of your main library on the same
hard drive, sharing the same content folders and files. You can then
automatically synchronize different iPods, iPhones, and Apple TVs with
each sub-library.
 Divide a large library into separate libraries on separate hard drives.
You might want to do this to spread a large library over several drives.
You can then automatically synchronize different iPods, iPhones, and
Apple TVs with each library.
 Separate your video collection from your music collection to store the
larger video files on a different hard drive.
 Keep podcasts in a separate library that’s updated more often than
your main library.
 Keep all new content separate from older content.
220
Part II: Managing Your Media Content 

Creating a sub-library of the main library
To create a new library, hold down Option (Mac) or Shift (PC) when launch-
ing iTunes. Then choose Create a New Library (the other choices are Quit or
Choose a Library) to set up a new empty library.
By default, the hard drive location of the iTunes folder for the newly created
library is the same as the previously opened library — the folder is named
iTunes 1 to distinguish it from the iTunes folder for the pre-existing library.
When you add more separate libraries, the folders are named iTunes 2,
iTunes 3, and so on.
After you create multiple libraries, remember to hold down Option (Mac) or
Shift (Windows) while launching iTunes whenever you want to switch between
them. Otherwise, iTunes opens with the library that was previously opened.
You can import playlists and drag content from your iTunes folder into your
new library without copying the content files because the files are in the
same folder on the same hard drive. This makes it easy to consider your main
library to be a Master library that links to the entire contents of the iTunes
folder as well as to create sub-libraries for each iPod, iPhone, or Apple TV
that share the same content files as the Master library.
Creating a separate library 
on a different hard drive
You can also create a new library that links to a different iTunes folder on a
different hard drive so that the content files are divided (not shared) between
libraries. For example, you might want to put all video files on a separate
hard drive in a separate library. Follow these steps to create a new library on
a different hard drive:
1. Create a new iTunes library by holding down Option (Mac) or Shift
(PC) when launching iTunes, and then choose Create a New Library.
The new iTunes library is created, empty of content.
2. Choose iTunes➪Preferences (Mac) or Edit➪Preferences (Windows).
The Preferences dialog appears with the tabs along the top.
3. Click the Advanced tab and then click the General tab.
4. Click the Change button for the iTunes Music folder location.
Your directory browser appears, enabling you to create and then select
a folder to locate your iTunes content files. Alternatively, you can click
the Reset button to restore the standard location in your user directory
(the default setting when you first use iTunes).
221
Chapter 13: Gimme Shelter for My Media

5. Create a folder for your content files and then select it.
When starting a new library that links to another hard drive, create a
folder somewhere on the other hard drive, call it iTunes Music or some-
thing similar, and then select it.
6. Activate the iTunes folder management options.
Make sure the Keep iTunes Music Folder Organized option and the Copy
Files to iTunes Music Folder when Adding to Library option are both
selected.
7. Click OK to close Preferences.
The new library links to the new folder location so that when you add new
content to the library, the content is copied to the new folder. If the purpose
of your new library is to hold all your videos, you can now copy all your
videos from the original library’s content folder to the iTunes window, adding
the content to the new library. iTunes copies the content files to the new
folder. You can then delete the videos from the original library.
Backing Up an iTunes Library
Backups? You don’t need no stinkin’ backups?
Yes, you do, so think twice about not making them! We know: Backing up your
files can be inconvenient and can eat up the capacity of all your external hard
drives. Still, it must be done. And fortunately, it’s easy to do. With iTunes, you
can copy your library to another hard drive on your computer or to another
computer. You can burn as many data DVDs as needed to store all the files (see
Chapter 14). You can even copy a library from a Mac to a PC and vice versa.
Backing up to DVD-Rs or CD-Rs
Apple provides a handy wizard that walks you through backing up your
iTunes library, playlists, and iTunes Store purchases to CD-Rs or DVD-Rs. 
(R means one-time recordable.) You can choose to back up the entire library,
perform incremental backups (only items added or changed since the last
backup), or save only store purchases. Choose File➪Back Up to Disc and
then choose one of the following:
 Back Up Entire iTunes Library and Playlist. This might take a stack of
DVD-Rs (or a truckload of CD-Rs), but it’s worth doing if you have no
other way to back up your library.
222
Part II: Managing Your Media Content 

 Back Up Only iTunes Store Purchases. This is an essential procedure
because if you lose these files, you have to repurchase them. You can
use CD-Rs or DVD-Rs.
 Only Back Up Items Added or Changed Since Last Backup. Use this
method to copy only items that were added or changed.
To restore your iTunes library from a stack of backup DVD-Rs or CD-Rs, open
iTunes and insert the first disc. Then follow the instructions to restore your
library.
Backing up to another hard drive
To copy your entire library to another hard drive, locate the iTunes folder on
your computer. Drag this entire folder to another hard drive or backup device,
and you’re all set. This action copies everything, including the playlists in
your library.
The copy operation might take some time if your library is huge. Although
you can interrupt the operation anytime, the newly copied library might not
be complete. Finishing the copy operation is always best.
If you restore the backup copy to the same computer with the same names for
its hard drive, the backup copy’s playlists work fine. Playlists are essentially
XML lists of songs with pathnames to the song files: If the hard drive name is
different, the pathnames won’t work. However, you can import the playlists
into iTunes by choosing File➪Import, which realigns the playlist pathnames to
the new hard drive. Alternatively, you can use the method described in the
upcoming section, “Backing up from Mac to PC or PC to Mac.”
If you copy just the iTunes Music folder and not the entire iTunes folder,
you’re copying the files but not your playlists. You still have to export your
playlists; see the earlier section, “Exporting iTunes playlists.”
If you use a Mac and subscribe to the Apple .Mac service, you can download
and use the free Backup software. This software lets you save the latest versions
of your files regularly and automatically so that you never have to worry about
losing important files. With Backup, you can quickly and easily store files on
your iDisk (a portion of an Internet hard drive hosted by .Mac) or on CD or DVD
as data files — not as CD songs. (See Chapter 14 to read how to burn an audio
or MP3 CD.) The iDisk is perhaps the least convenient even though you do get
some free space with a .Mac membership. Copying to the iDisk is slow even
over a high-speed connection. We use iDisk to transfer individual songs and
large files to other people and to back up very important documents. However,
you’re better off using data DVDs as a backup medium for data and audio CDs
for your songs and albums.
223
Chapter 13: Gimme Shelter for My Media

Backing up from Mac to PC or PC to Mac
Maybe you use a Mac but you want to transfer your iTunes library to a PC
that runs iTunes, or the other way around. Or perhaps you want a foolproof
method of copying your entire library to another computer, whether it’s a
Mac, a PC running Windows, or just a computer that uses a different name for
its hard drive (or a different path to the Home folder or user folder).
To back up your iTunes library no matter what the situation is, follow these
steps:
1. Locate your iTunes Music folder on your old computer.
Locate your iTunes Music folder as described in the earlier section,
“Finding the iTunes library.” Consider the first computer as the old
computer and the one receiving the copied library as the new computer.
2. Download and install iTunes on the new computer.
See Chapter 2 for instructions on installing iTunes. If the new computer
already has an iTunes Music folder with music that you want to preserve,
move that iTunes Music folder to another folder on the hard drive or
copy it to another hard drive or storage medium.
3. Copy the iTunes Music folder from the old computer to the newly
installed iTunes folder on the new computer.
If you have multiple users on the new computer, make sure that you
choose the appropriate Home folder (Mac) or user folder (Windows).
The copy operation for a large music library takes a while.
4. Choose File➪Export Library on the old computer, browse to a location
on your hard drive or network, and then click Save.
When you export your entire library, iTunes creates the XML file iTunes
Music Library.xml that links to music files and stores all your
playlists.
5. Start iTunes on the new computer.
6. Choose File➪Import on the new computer and then import the
iTunes Music Library.xml file.
The music library is now available on the new computer.
The iTunes Music Library file (iTunes Music Library.xml) must be
located within the iTunes folder where iTunes can find it.

 Choosing the right format for burning a disc
 Creating a burn playlist
 Setting burn preferences
 Burning an audio CD, an MP3 CD, or a data DVD
 Printing CD jewel case inserts and song lists
 Troubleshooting tips
O
nce upon a time, when vinyl records were popular, rock radio disk
jockeys (who didn’t like disco) held disco-meltdown parties. People
were encouraged to throw their disco records onto a pile to be burned or
steamrolled into a vinyl glob. We admit having participated in one such 
meltdown. However, this chapter isn’t about that (nor is it about anything
involving fire or heat). Rather, burning a disc is the process in which the 
CD drive recorder’s laser heats up points on an interior layer of the disc to
record information.
You burn CDs for a lot of reasons. Reason numero uno for us is to make safety
copies of songs we buy from the iTunes Store — in addition to backup copies
of song files on other hard drives. We also like to custom-mix songs from dif-
ferent artists and albums onto a CD. (Don’t confuse a custom mix with mixing:
The latter is a production technique for combining tracks into a single song.)
And from iTunes, you can print CD jewel case inserts with the song list. You
can even burn data DVDs to back up your files.
This chapter boils down everything about disc recording for you. You can find
out here what kind of discs to use, which devices play the discs, how to get
your playlist ready, and what settings to use for burning. Read on to discover
what you need to make sure your burns aren’t meltdowns — where the only
melting is the music in your ears.

226
Part II: Managing Your Media Content 
Do not violate copyright law. You are allowed to copy content to disc for your
own use, but you cannot legally copy content for any other purpose. Consult
a lawyer if you’re in doubt.
Selecting Recordable CDs and DVDs
You can arrange any songs in your library into a playlist and then burn a CD
from that playlist. (See Chapter 10 for more on creating playlists.) If you have
a CD-R, CD-RW, or DVD-R drive (such as the Apple SuperDrive for a Mac) and
a blank CD-R (R stands for recordable), you can create your own music CDs
that play in most CD players. You can also include audio books and podcast
episodes in a playlist and burn them onto CDs.
Blank CD-Rs (I’m talking discs now and not drives) are available in most elec-
tronics and computer stores — even in supermarkets. You can also get them
online from the Apple Store (not the music store — the store that sells com-
puters and accessories). Choose iTunes➪Shop for iTunes Products (Mac) or
Help➪Shop for iTunes Products (Windows) to reach the Apple Store online.
The discs are called CD-R because they use a recordable format related to
commercial audio CDs (which aren’t recordable, of course). You can also
create a CD-R of songs in the MP3 format, which is useful for backing up a
music library or making discs for use in MP3 CD players.
Many CD burners, such as the Apple SuperDrive, also burn CD-RWs (record-
able, read-write discs) that you can erase and reuse. However, CD players
don’t always recognize CD-RWs as music CDs. Some burners can also create
data DVD-Rs and DVD-RWs, which are useful for holding data files, but you
can use these discs only with computers that have DVD drives. Some com-
mercial DVD players won’t recognize a data DVD-R or DVD-RW but might still
recognize an MP3 DVD-R.
You can play MP3 files burned on a CD-R in MP3 format on any MP3 disc player,
on combination CD/MP3 players, on many DVD players, and (of course) on
computers that recognize MP3 CDs (including computers with iTunes).
What You Can Fit on a CD-R or DVD-R
You can fit up to 74 minutes of music on a high-quality CD-R; most can go as
high as 80 minutes. The sound files on your hard drive might take up more
space than 650MB if they’re uncompressed, but you can still fit 74 minutes (or
80 minutes, depending on the disc) because the CD format stores information
without error-correction data.

If you burn music to a CD-R in MP3 format, the disc can hold more than 12
hours of music. You read that right — 12 hours on one disc. This is why MP3
discs are popular: because they are essentially CD-Rs with MP3 files stored 
on them.
If you have a DVD burner, such as an Apple SuperDrive, you can burn data
DVD-Rs or DVD-RWs to use with other computers. This approach is suitable
for making backup copies of media files (or any data files). A DVD-R can hold
about 4,700,000,000 bytes (more than 4GB).
Creating a Burn Playlist
To burn a CD (actually a CD-R, but most people refer to recordable CD-R discs
as CDs), you must first define a playlist for the CD. (See Chapter 10 to find out
how to create a playlist.) You can use songs encoded in any format that iTunes
supports; however, you get higher-quality music with the uncompressed AIFF
and WAV formats or with the Apple Lossless format.
If your playlist includes music purchased from the iTunes Store in the pro-
tected AAC-encoding format, some rules might apply. For example, as of this
writing, the iTunes Store allows you to burn seven copies of the same playlist
containing protected songs to an audio CD, but no more.
227
Chapter 14: Baking Your Own Discs with Printed Inserts
The little Red Book that launched an industry
The typical audio CD and CD-R uses the Compact
Disc-Digital Audio (CD-DA) format Mode 2 Form 2,
better known as Red Book. This book isn’t some-
thing from Chairman Mao: It’s a document (pub-
lished in 1980) that provides the specifications for
the standard CD developed by Sony and Philips.
According to legend, this document was in a
binder with a red cover.
Here’s another legend: In 1979, Norio Ohga, hon-
orary chairman and former CEO of Sony (and a
maestro conductor), overruled his engineers
and insisted that the CD format be able to hold
Beethoven’s Ninth Symphony. This symphony is
74 minutes and 42 seconds long — now the
standard length of a Red Book audio CD.
CD-DA defines audio data digitized at 44,100 sam-
ples per second (44.1 kHz) and in a range of 65,536
possible values (16 bits). The format for the audio
is called pulse code modulation (PCM).
To import music onto the computer from an audio
CD, you have to convert the music to digital
sound files by a program, such as iTunes. When
you burn an audio CD, iTunes converts the sound
files back into the CD-DA format while it burns
the disc.

You can get around this limitation by creating or using a new playlist, copying
the protected songs to the new playlist, and then burning more CDs with the
new playlist.
Calculating how much music to use
When you create an audio CD playlist, you find out how many songs can fit
on the CD by totaling the durations of the songs. You can see the size of a
playlist by selecting it; the bottom of the iTunes window shows the number
of songs, the amount in time, and the amount in megabytes for the selected
playlist, as shown in Figure 14-1.
In Figure 14-1, the selected playlist takes about 1.1 hours (exactly 1:08:54) to
play, so it fits on a standard audio CD. (The 15 songs take up only 65.3MB of
hard drive space; they were purchased from the iTunes Store and encoded in
the compressed and protected AAC format.)
A one-hour playlist of AIFF-encoded music, which might occupy over 600MB of
hard drive space, also fits on a standard audio CD. The amount you can fit on a
standard audio CD depends on the duration, not the hard drive space occupied
by the music files. Although a CD holds between 650MB and 700MB (depending
on the disc), the music is stored in a special format known as CD-DA (or Red
Book) that fills byte sectors without error-correction and checksum informa-
tion. (You can read about CD-DA and Red Book in the sidebar, “The little Red
Book that launched an industry.”) Thus, you can fit about 90MB more — 740MB
total — of AIFF-encoded music on a 650MB disc. We typically put 1.1 hours
(about 66 minutes) of music on a 74-minute or an 80-minute CD-R, leaving min-
utes to spare.
Figure 14-1:

228
Part II: Managing Your Media Content 

Always use the actual duration in hours, minutes, and seconds to calculate
how much music you can fit on an audio CD — either 74 or 80 minutes for
blank CD-Rs. We recommend leaving at least one extra minute to account for
the gaps between songs.
You do the opposite for an MP3 CD or a data DVD. Use the actual megabytes to
calculate how many song files can fit on a disc — up to 700MB for a blank CD-R.
You can fit lots more music on an MP3 CD-R because you use MP3-encoded
songs rather than uncompressed AIFF songs.
If you have too many songs in the playlist to fit on a CD, iTunes burns as many
songs in the playlist as will fit on the CD (either audio or MP3). Then it asks you
to insert another CD to continue burning the remaining songs in the playlist.
If you include in a burn playlist a very long song that you purchased from the
iTunes Store, you see a dialog telling you to put that long song in its own
playlist. Then burn that single-song playlist separately.
Importing music for an audio CD-R
Before you rip an audio CD of songs, as we describe in Chapter 5, that you
want to burn to an audio CD-R, you might want to change the import settings.
(Check out Chapter 19 if you need to do this.) Use the AIFF, WAV, or Apple
Lossless encoders for songs from audio CDs if you want to burn your own
audio CDs with music at its highest quality.
AIFF is the standard digital format for uncompressed sound on a Mac, and
you can’t go wrong with it. WAV is basically the same thing for Windows. The
Apple Lossless encoder provides CD-quality sound in a file size that’s about
55 to 60 percent of the size of an AIFF- or WAV-encoded file. Both the AIFF
encoder and the WAV encoder offer the same custom settings for sample
rate, sample size, and channels, which you can set by choosing Custom from
the Settings pop-up menu in the Importing section of the Advanced pane of
iTunes Preferences. You can choose the automatic settings, and iTunes
detects the proper sample rate, size, and channels from the source. Apple
Lossless is always set to automatic.
Many songs you can purchase from the iTunes Store are supplied in an 
unprotected format encoded in AAC that carries no restrictions, but others —
notably the lesser-priced songs — are sold in a protected AAC format. You
can’t convert the protected format to anything else, but you can still burn the
songs onto CDs, and the quality of the result on CD is acceptable. Audio books
also come in a protected format that can’t be converted, but you can burn
them onto CDs with acceptable quality.
229
Chapter 14: Baking Your Own Discs with Printed Inserts

The AAC encoder creates an audio file that is similar in audio quality to one
created by the MP3 encoder, but takes up less space; both are acceptable to
most CD listeners. We think AAC offers a decent trade-off of space and quality
and is suitable (although not as good as AIFF or Apple Lossless) for burning
to an audio CD. For a complete description of these encoders, see Chapter 18.
Switching import encoders for MP3 CD-R
MP3 discs are essentially CD-Rs with MP3 files stored on them. Consumer MP3
CD players are readily available in consumer electronics stores, including
hybrid models that play both audio CDs and MP3 CDs.
You can fit 8–12 hours of stereo music on an MP3 CD with the MP3 format —
the amount varies depending on the encoding options and settings you
choose. For example, you might be able to fit up to 20 hours of mono
(monaural) recordings because they use only one channel and carry less
information. On the other hand, if you encode stereo recordings at high bit
rates (above 192 bits per second), you may fit up to 9 hours. If you rip an
audio CD, you can set the importing options to precisely the type of MP3 file
you want; see Chapter 19.
You can use only MP3-encoded songs to burn an MP3 CD-R. Any songs not
encoded in MP3 are skipped and not burned to the CD-R. Audible books and
spoken-word titles are provided in an audio format that uses security tech-
nologies, including encryption, to protect purchased content. You can’t burn
an MP3 CD-R with Audible files; any Audible files in a burn playlist are
skipped when you burn an MP3 CD-R.
Setting the Burning Preferences
Burning a CD is a simple process, and getting it right the first time is a good
idea because when you burn a CD-R, it’s done one time — right or wrong. You
can’t erase content on a CD-R like you can with a CD-RW. Because you can’t
play a CD-RW in as many CD players, we recommend using a CD-R if you want
to burn an audio CD. Fortunately, CD-Rs are inexpensive, so you won’t be out
more than a few cents if you burn a bad one. (Besides, they’re good as coasters
for coffee tables.)
Set the following options to ensure that you burn your CD right the first time.
You can access these options by choosing iTunes➪Preferences (Mac) or
Edit➪Preferences (Windows), clicking the Advanced tab, and then clicking
the Burning tab:
230
Part II: Managing Your Media Content 

 Use Sound Check: Musicians do a sound check before every perfor-
mance to check the volume of microphones and instruments and their
effect on the listening environment. The aptly named Use Sound Check
option in the Burning preferences dialog (see Figure 14-2) turns on the
Sound Check feature to balance your tunes, volume-wise.
 Gap between Songs: Another professional touch is to add an appropri-
ate gap between songs, just like commercial CDs. With this option
enabled, you can set the gap time as well.
 Include CD Text: Selecting this option adds the artist and track name
text to the CD for certain CD players (often, in car players) that can dis-
play the artist and track name while playing a CD.
 Disc Format: Choosing the appropriate disc format is perhaps the most
important choice. Decide whether you’re burning an audio CD (CD-R), an
MP3 CD (CD-R), or a Data CD (CD-R) or DVD (DVD-R or DVD-RW). Your
choice depends on what type of player you’re using, or whether you’re
making a data backup of files rather than a disc that plays in a player.
Figure 14-2:

231
Chapter 14: Baking Your Own Discs with Printed Inserts

 Preferred Speed: iTunes typically detects the rating of a blank CD-R and
adjusts the recording speed to fit. However, if your blank CD-Rs are rated
for a slower speed than your burner or if you have problems creating
CD-Rs, you can change the recording speed setting to match the CD’s
rating.
Follow these steps to set the preceding options:
1. Choose iTunes➪Preferences (Mac) or Edit➪Preferences (Windows),
click the Advanced tab, and then click the Burning tab.
The burning preferences appear. Refer to Figure 14-2.
2. Choose a specific recording speed or the Maximum Possible option
from the Preferred Speed pop-up menu.
3. Select a disc format:
• Audio CD: Burn a normal audio CD of up to 74 or 80 minutes
(depending on the type of blank CD-R) using any iTunes-supported
music files, including songs bought from the iTunes Store. Although
connoisseurs of music might use AIFF- or WAV-encoded music 
to burn an audio CD, you can also use songs in the AAC and MP3
formats.
• MP3 CD: Burn an MP3 CD with songs encoded in MP3 format. No
other formats are supported for MP3 CDs.
• Data CD or DVD: Burn a data CD-R, CD-RW, DVD-R, or DVD-RW
with music files. You can use any encoding formats for the songs.
Important: Data discs won’t play on most consumer CD players:
They’re meant for use with computers. However, data discs are
good choices for storing backup copies of music bought from the
iTunes Store.
4. (Optional, audio CDs only) Select the Use Sound Check option.
Note: This option, for audio CDs only, works regardless of whether you’re
already using the Sound Check option in the Playback preferences for
iTunes playback. You can select this option for burning without ever
changing the preferences for iTunes playback.
5. (Audio CDs only) Choose a duration from the Gap between Songs pop-
up menu.
You can choose from a gap of 0 to 5 seconds, or None. We recommend
leaving the menu set to the default setting of 1 second.
6. (Optional, audio CDs only) Select the Include CD Text option to
include artist and track names for CD players that can display text.
7. Click OK.
232
Part II: Managing Your Media Content 

Burning a Disc
After you set the burning preferences, you’re ready to start burning. Follow
these steps to burn a disc:
1. Select the playlist and then click the Burn Disc button.
The Burn Disc button replaces the Browse button in the lower-right
corner of the iTunes window whenever you select a playlist (refer to
Figure 14-1).
A message appears telling you to insert a blank disc.
2. Insert a blank disc (label side up).
iTunes immediately checks the media and begins the burn process,
displaying a progress bar and the names of the songs burning to 
the disc.
When iTunes finishes burning the disc, iTunes chimes, and the disc is
mounted on the Desktop.
3. Eject the newly burned disc from your drive and then test it.
4. Don’t delete your burn playlist yet.
You can read why in the following section.
Burning takes several minutes. You can cancel the operation at any time by
clicking the X next to the progress bar, but canceling the operation isn’t like
undoing the burn. If the burn has already started, you can’t use that CD-R or
DVD-R again.
If the playlist has more music than can fit on the disc using the chosen
format, iTunes burns as much as possible from the beginning of the playlist
and then asks you to insert another disc to burn the rest. To calculate the
amount of music in a playlist, see the earlier section, “Calculating how much
music to use.”
Spoken word fans: Audible audio books with chapter markers are burned
onto a CD with each chapter as a separate track.
If you choose the MP3 CD format, iTunes skips over any songs in the playlist
that aren’t in this format.
233
Chapter 14: Baking Your Own Discs with Printed Inserts

Printing Song and Album Information
Putting music on a blank CD-R doesn’t change the disc’s look in any way, so
how do you know the disc isn’t just another blank? Put it inside a case and
include something in print that identifies it.
You can print the CD jewel case insert, song list, and album notes for the CD
you just burned. (That’s why you didn’t delete the burn playlist yet.) You can
even print the cover art. If you have a color printer, you can print gorgeous
color inserts for your CDs. If you don’t have a suitable printer, you can save
the printed version as a Portable Document Format (PDF) file that you can
print at a Kinko’s or similar copy shop.
Select the playlist and choose File➪Print to see the iTunes Print dialog (as
shown in Figure 14-3). You can see all the choices you have for jewel case
inserts, song listings, and album notes as well as a preview of how they look
when printed.
Printing inserts
Everyone calls the standard CD case a jewel case even though the only pre-
cious element in the package is the music. Jewel cases have slots for inserting
a printed insert or booklet. You can print your own insert directly from iTunes
via the burn playlist.
To print a CD insert, select the album for which you want to print the artwork
and then follow these steps:
1. Choose File➪Print.
2. From the iTunes Print dialog, select the CD Jewel Case Insert option.
Figure 14-3:

3. Choose a theme from the Theme pop-up menu.
Themes include: Text Only (without song artwork), Mosaic (with artwork
from songs arranged in a mosaic), and Single Cover (with one song’s art-
work). Figure 14-4 shows Mosaic (Black & White) in the preview.
4. (Optional) Click the Page Setup button to set page layout options, such
as landscape or portrait orientation.
The CD insert themes automatically set the proper orientation, but you
can change them in the Page Setup dialog.
5. Click the Print button and then follow your normal printing procedures.
Printing song lists and album notes
Cover art for an insert is a nice decoration, but if you choose an art-based
theme rather than one that lists the songs, you might still want another sheet
with a song list to tell which track is which. You might also want a more
detailed song list that includes information for each song, such as the com-
poser, duration, original album, and perhaps even the rating you assigned in
iTunes.
To print a song list, follow these steps:
1. Choose File➪Print.
2. Select the Song Listing option.
3. Choose one of the following themes for the song listing from the
Theme pop-up menu:
• Songs: This theme prints a column for each song name, duration,
artist, and album title.
Figure 14-4:
Choose a
theme for 
a jewel 
case insert.
235
Chapter 14: Baking Your Own Discs with Printed Inserts

• User Ratings: This theme prints the same columns as the Songs
theme and adds a column with the ratings that you assign in
iTunes. This theme prints in landscape orientation.
• Dates Played: This theme prints the same columns as the Songs
theme and adds columns for the play count and the date last
played, set by iTunes when you play songs. This theme prints in
landscape orientation.
• Custom: This theme prints the columns as they’re set in the iTunes
Song List pane. You can print any piece of information about the
songs that iTunes stores, such as composer, genre, and year. See
Chapter 8 to add or change the viewing options for columns in the
Song List pane.
4. Click the Print button and then follow your normal printing procedures.
To print a catalog-style album listing, select the Album Listing option in the
dialog. (Refer to Figure 14-3.) This option prints the album title, artist, song
names, and song lengths.
Need a printed list of the music in your library? You can use the Song Listing
or Album Listing options to print all the content in your iTunes library
(including audio books and music videos) rather than just a playlist. Select
the Music option in the Source pane. Then choose File➪Print and select your
printing options. If you want to save paper and create an electronic version,
create a PDF file via the Print dialog (Mac or Windows).
If you want to print more extensive notes or use a CD jewel case insert layout
that iTunes doesn’t offer in its printing themes, you can export the song infor-
mation to a text file and then edit that information in a word processor or page
layout program to make liner notes for the CD. iTunes exports (as a text file) all
the song information for a single song, a playlist, an album, songs by an artist,
or songs in the library. To export song information, follow these steps:
1. Select the album, songs, or playlist.
2. Choose File➪Export.
3. Browse your hard drive and choose a location to store the song list.
4. In the Export dialog, select the Plain Text option from the Format pop-
up menu.
The Plain Text option is the right choice for you unless you use a
double-byte language, such as Japanese or Chinese, for which the
Unicode option is the right choice.
5. Click the Export button.
To print high-quality inserts from an exported song list, try the Discus
Labeling Software (www.magicmouse.com), which also allows you to print
labels for your CD-Rs and DVD-Rs. Discus supports more than 2,600 different
236

sheet-fed paper labels including labels for CDs and DVDs, mini-CDs, mini-CD
jewel cases, business card CDs, jewel case covers and inserts, DVD cases,
VHS spine and face labels, audiocassette labels, and business/calling cards.
Mac users can take advantage of Disc Cover from Belight Software (www.
belightsoft.com), which can import content and images from iTunes,
iPhoto, iDVD and other sources and lets you experiment with styles and
graphic tools. Disc Cover offers a library of label and paper layouts from 
popular manufacturers such as Avery, Neato, and Memorex, and supports
direct-on-CD printers.
Troubleshooting Burns
Murphy’s Law applies to everything, even something as simple as burning a
CD-R. Don’t think for a moment that you’re immune to the whims and treach-
eries of Murphy (no one really knows who Murphy is) who, in all his infinite
wisdom, pronounced that anything that can go wrong will go wrong (and usu-
ally at the least convenient time). In this section, we cover some of the most
common problems that you might encounter when burning discs.
The best way to test your newly burned disc is to pop it right back into your
computer’s drive — or, if it’s an audio CD, try it on a consumer CD player. On
most CD players, an audio CD-R plays just like any commercial audio CD. MP3
CDs play fine on consumer MP3 CD players and also work in computers with
CD-ROM and DVD drives.
If the disc works on the computer but not on a commercial CD player, you
might have a compatibility problem with the commercial player and CD-R.
For example, we have a ten-year-old CD player that doesn’t play CD-Rs very
well, and car players sometimes have trouble with them.
The following list gives some typical problems, along with the solutions, that
you might run into when burning a CD:
Problem: The disc won’t burn.
Solution: Perhaps you have a bum disc. Hey, it happens. Try using
another disc or burning at a slower speed.
Problem: In a consumer CD player, the disc doesn’t play or stutters while
playing.
Solution: This happens often with older consumer players that don’t
play CD-Rs well, and with some players that are fussy about reading 
less-expensive CD-Rs or certain brands. Try the disc in your computer’s
CD-ROM or DVD drive. If it works there and you set the format to Audio CD,
you probably have a compatibility problem with your consumer player.
237
Chapter 14: Baking Your Own Discs with Printed Inserts

Problem: The disc doesn’t show tracks on a consumer CD player or
ejects immediately.
Solution: Be sure to use the proper disc format. The Audio CD format
works in just about all consumer CD players that can play CD-Rs. MP3
CDs work in consumer MP3 CD players and computer CD-ROM and DVD
drives. Data CDs or DVDs work only in computer drives.
Problem: Some songs in your playlist were skipped and not burned onto
the disc.
Solution: Audio CD-Rs burn with songs encoded in any format, but you
can use only MP3-encoded songs to burn an MP3 CD-R. Any songs not
encoded in MP3 — including songs purchased from the iTunes Store in
protected AAC format — are skipped when burning MP3 CDs. (Any
Audible files are also skipped, which can’t be put onto an MP3 CD.) If
your playlist for an audio CD-R includes music purchased from the iTunes
Store, some rules might apply — see the earlier section, “Creating a Burn
Playlist.”

or a music lover, nothing compares with the feeling of having a lot of
song choices at your fingertips. Rather than sitting back and soaking up
the preprogrammed sounds of radio or CDs, you can control your iPod play-
back to pick any song that you want to hear at any time. Or, shuffle through
songs to get an idea of how wide your music choices are or just to surprise
yourself or others. You can even follow a thread of musical ideas, such as The
Kingsmen’s version of “Louie Louie” through “All Day and All of the Night” by
The Kinks, “Dirty Water” by The Standells, “Little Bit of Soul” by The Music
Explosion, The Troggs’ “Wild Thing,” all the way to the version of “Wild
Thing” by Jimi Hendrix.
With your full-size iPod or iPod nano, you can locate and play music easily,
browsing by artist and album — even by composer. Selecting a playlist is
simple, but if you don’t have playlists from iTunes (or you don’t want to hear
those playlists), you can create a temporary On-The-Go playlist. In this chap-
ter, you discover how to locate and play content on any iPod. Note: If you
have an iPod shuffle, see the later section, “Playing an iPod shuffle.”
Locating Songs on Your iPod
With so many songs on your iPod, finding a particular one by its song title
can take longer than finding it another way — like finding a needle in a
haystack or even trying to find “Needle in a Haystack” by The Velvelettes in a
Motown catalog. It may be faster to locate albums by cover art, or songs by
searching for artist (or composer), genre, album, or playlist.

You can also search for audio books and podcasts by artist (author name) or
album (title).
By cover art (using Cover Flow)
Sixth-generation iPods, including the iPod nano and the iPod touch, can dis-
play the cover art for albums. The Cover Flow browser lets you flip through
your cover art to select music on your iPod.
To browse music by cover art with an iPod touch or iPhone model, choose
Music from the iPod touch main menu or iPod from the iPhone main menu,
and then quickly switch to holding the device horizontally, in order to
display a landscape-mode display. The iPod touch or iPhone automatically
switches to landscape display and offers the Cover Flow browser, as shown
in Figure 15-1.
Slide your finger across the album covers to scroll swiftly through the iPod’s
music library, or you can tap to the right or left of the cover art in the fore-
ground to move forward or backward, respectively. Tap the play button in the
lower left corner to start playing the first song in the foreground album; the
play button turns to a pause button so that you can tap it again to stop play-
back. Tap the “i” button in the lower right side, or tap the foreground cover
art, to list the songs in that album, and then tap a song to start playing it.

2. From the Music menu, choose Playlists.
3. From the Playlists menu that appears, choose a playlist.
Playlists are listed in alphabetical order. Scroll the Playlists menu to
highlight the playlist name and then press the Select button.
A list of songs in the playlist appears.
4. Select a song from the list.
The songs in the playlist are in playlist order (the order defined for the
playlist in iTunes). Scroll up or down the list to highlight the song you
want.
Playing a Song
After scrolling the song list until the song name is highlighted, press either
the Select button or the Play/Pause button on an iPod classic or iPod nano
(or earlier model) to play the selected song. On an iPod touch or iPhone, tap
the song title to play the song. When the song finishes, the iPod plays the
next song in the song list. 
While a song is playing, the artist name and song name appear. On an iPod
touch or iPhone, you see the album cover and the touch buttons for playback
control — Previous/Rewind, Play/Pause, and Next/Fast-forward. The bullet-
list touch button in the upper right corner displays a list of the album’s con-
tents, and the left arrow touch button in the upper left corner returns you to
the previous menu. Slide your finger along the volume slider at the bottom of
the display to change the volume.
Color-display iPods also display the album cover, and you can use the scroll
wheel to adjust the volume. See the later section, “Adjusting and Limiting the
Volume.”
To pause playback, press the Play/Pause button while a song is playing.

Chapter 15: Playing iPod Content

Repeating songs
If you want to drive yourself crazy repeating the same song over and over,
your iPod is happy to oblige. (You might want to try repeating “They’re
Coming to Take Me Away, Ha-Haaa” by Napoleon XIV, a favorite from the old
The Dr. Demento Show radio broadcasts — and perhaps they will come.)
More than likely, you’ll want to repeat a sequence of songs, which you can
easily do.
You can set your iPod classic or iPod nano (or older models) to repeat a
single song by following these steps:
1. Locate and play a song.
2. While the song plays, press the Menu button repeatedly to return to
the main menu and then choose the Settings item.
3. Scroll the Settings menu until Repeat is highlighted.
The Repeat setting displays Off next to it.
4. Press the Select button once (Off changes to One) to repeat one song.
If you press the button more than once, keep pressing until One appears.
You can also press the Previous/Rewind button to repeat a song.
To repeat all the songs in the selected album or playlist, follow these steps
with an iPod classic or iPod nano (or older models):
1. Locate and play a song in the album or playlist.
2. While the song plays, press the Menu button repeatedly to return to
the main menu and then choose the Settings item.
3. Scroll the Settings menu until Repeat is highlighted.
The Repeat setting displays Off next to it.
4. Press the Select button twice (Off changes to All) to repeat all the
songs in the album or playlist.
The iPod touch and iPhone provide touch buttons to control repeating and
shuffling. To access these touch buttons, tap underneath the left arrow
button or the album title while a song is playing (if you are viewing another
menu, tap Now Playing to go directly to the “now playing” display). The
Repeat and Shuffle touch buttons appear, along with the song duration slider,
directly below the top row of buttons as shown in Figure 15-4.

Chapter 15: Playing iPod Content

You can repeat an entire song list by tapping the Repeat touch button (refer
to Figure 15-4). When it’s selected, the Repeat button shows blue highlighting.
Touch the Repeat button again to repeat only the current song — the button
changes to include a blue-highlighted numeral 1. Touch it once more to
return to normal playback.
Shuffling song order
Maybe you want your song selections to be surprising and unpredictable,
and you want your iPod to read your mind, as the Apple ads suggest. You can
shuffle song playback to play in random order, just like an automated radio
station without a disk jockey or program guide. See for yourself whether your
iPod knows how to pick good tunes without your help.
To turn your iPod classic or iPod nano (or older model) into a random song
player, choose Shuffle Songs from the main menu. To turn your iPod touch or
iPhone into a random song player, choose Music from the iPod touch main
menu or iPod from the iPhone main menu, and tap the Songs touch button at
the bottom of the display. The song list appears, with Shuffle at the top of the
list. Tap Shuffle to turn on Shuffle.
Your iPod or iPhone then plays all the songs randomly — yup, no repeats —
until it plays every song.
Although your iPod or iPhone might seem to play favorites, the shuffle algo-
rithm is truly random, according to Apple. When an iPod or iPhone creates a
shuffle, it reorders the songs (like shuffling a deck of cards), and then it plays
them in the new order. Trust us: If you listen for as long as it takes to com-
plete the list, you hear every song just once.
You can also shuffle songs within an album or playlist, which gives you some
control over random playback. For example, you could create a smart playlist
for all jazz songs and then shuffle the songs within that jazz playlist.
Follow these steps to shuffle songs in an album or a playlist with an iPod clas-
sic or iPod nano (or older model):
1. Locate and play a song in the album or playlist.
2. While the song plays, press the Menu button repeatedly to return to
the main menu and then choose Settings.
3. Scroll the Settings menu until Shuffle is highlighted.
The Shuffle setting displays Off next to it.
4. Press the Select button once (Off changes to Songs) to shuffle the
songs in the selected album or playlist.
250
Part III: Playing Your iPod 

The iPod touch and iPhone provide touch buttons to control repeating and
shuffling. To shuffle songs in an album or playlist, start playing a song in the
album or playlist, and then tap underneath the left arrow button or the album
title while a song is playing. The Repeat and Shuffle touch buttons appear,
along with the song duration slider, directly below the top row of buttons
(refer to Figure 15-4). Tap the Shuffle button to shuffle songs within the cur-
rently playing album or playlist.
You can set an iPod touch or iPhone to shuffle any album or playlist before
playing it. First, select the playlist or album, and then choose Shuffle at the
top of the list of songs for that playlist or album.
You can set your iPod to repeat an entire album or playlist but still shuffle the
playing order each time you hear it. Start playing a song in the album or
playlist, and then set your iPod or iPhone to repeat all the songs in the album
or playlist as described in “Repeating songs” in this section. Then set the
iPod or iPhone to shuffle the songs as described above.
Say you want to play albums randomly, but you don’t like when the songs in
an album aren’t played in proper album order. To shuffle all the albums in
your iPod classic or iPod nano (or older models), but play the songs in
normal album order, follow these steps:
1. Press the Menu button repeatedly to return to the main menu and
then choose Settings.
2. Scroll the Settings menu until Shuffle is highlighted.
The Shuffle setting displays Off next to it.
3. Press the Select button twice (Off changes to Albums) to shuffle the
albums without shuffling the songs within each album.
When the iPod is set to shuffle, it won’t repeat a song until it plays the entire
album, playlist, or library.
By default, only songs are included in iPod shuffling. However, you can select
podcast episodes, audio books, and videos in iTunes and set an option to
include them in shuffles. To do this in iTunes
1. Select the video, podcast episode, or audio book episode.
2. Choose File➪Get Info.
3. Click the Options tab.
4. Deselect the Skip When Shuffling option.
The next time you synchronize your iPod, any items with this option
turned off are included in shuffles.
251
Chapter 15: Playing iPod Content

If you want to exclude a song from shuffles, select the song in iTunes, choose
File➪Get Info, click the Options tab, and then select the Skip When Shuffling
option.
Playing Podcasts
Podcasts, naturally, have their own menu on an iPod. Podcasts are organized
by podcast name (which is like an album name), and podcast episodes are
listed within each podcast in the order that they were released (by date).
To play a podcast episode, follow these steps:
1. Choose Music from the iPod main menu, or iPod from the iPhone
menu.
2. Choose Podcasts from the iPod classic or iPod nano Music menu. On
an iPhone or iPod touch, touch the More button, then touch Podcasts.
The More button appears in the lower right corner of the display on an
iPhone or iPod touch when selecting music. After touching the More
button, more choices appear including the Podcasts choice.
3. Choose a podcast from the Podcasts menu that appears.
Podcast names are listed in alphabetical order by first word. Note: Any
leading The is recognized, which is why The Flying Other Brothers-Music
Podcast appears after the Rockument podcast. Scroll the Podcasts menu
until the podcast name is highlighted and then press the Select button.
4. Choose and play an episode from the podcast’s menu.
The podcast’s menu of episodes appears. Scroll the episode list until the
episode name you want is highlighted; then press the Select button to
play the episode on an iPod classic or iPod nano (or older model), or
touch the episode title on an iPod touch or iPhone.
While a podcast episode is playing, the podcast name and episode title
appear. On a color-display iPod, the podcast’s graphic image — similar to an
album cover — appears. To pause playback, press the Play/Pause button
when a podcast episode is playing.
Podcast episodes are automatically set to remember the playback position
when you pause an episode. This feature lets you pause an episode in iTunes
while you synchronize your iPod (as described in Chapter 12). After synchro-
nization, you can continue playing the episode on your iPod from where you
left. This feature also works in the opposite way: If you pause an episode on
your iPod, the podcast episode resumes the playback position so that you
can continue playing it in iTunes (after synchronization) from where you left.
252
Part III: Playing Your iPod 

To disable the playback feature
1. Select a podcast episode in iTunes.
2. Choose File➪Get Info.
3. Click the Options tab.
4. Deselect the Remember Playback Position option.
This option works with any track in your library, letting you resume
playback on any song or video as well.
When you synchronize your iPod, any played episodes are deleted if you set
iTunes to keep only your unplayed episodes. To make sure that a particular
episode stays on your iPod, select it in iTunes, Control-click (Mac) or right-
click (Windows) the episode, and then choose Mark as New. You can also
change your iPod’s synchronization options for podcasts. See Chapter 12 for
details.
Playing Audio Books
Audio books also have their own menu on an iPod. Audio books are orga-
nized by title (which also appears in the Albums menu), and sections, or
episodes, of the audio book are listed in the order that they should be read
(Part 1, Part 2, and so on).
To play an audio book episode, follow these steps:
1. Choose Music from the iPod main menu, or iPod from the iPhone
menu.
2. Choose Audiobooks from the iPod classic or iPod nano Music menu.
On an iPhone or iPod touch, touch the More button, then touch
Audiobooks.
The More button appears in the lower right corner of the display on an
iPhone or iPod touch when selecting music. After touching the More
button, more choices appear including the Audiobooks choice.
3. Choose an audio book episode from the Audiobooks menu.
The audio book episodes are listed in proper order for each book, with
each book title in alphabetical order. Note: Like song titles, any leading
The is recognized, which is why The Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy: The
Tertiary Phase by Douglas Adams would appear below Mao II by Don
DeLillo. Scroll the Audiobooks menu until the episode title is highlighted.
253
Chapter 15: Playing iPod Content

4. Press the Select button on an iPod classic or iPod nano (or older
model) to play the highlighted episode, or tap the episode title on an
iPhone or iPod touch.
While an audio book episode is playing, the book and episode titles appear on
the iPod display. Color-display iPods also show the book’s graphic image —
similar to a book cover. 
To pause the playback, press the Play/Pause button when an audio book
episode is playing.
Audio books are automatically set to remember the playback position when
you pause an episode. This feature lets you pause an episode in iTunes while
you synchronize your iPod. After synchronization, you can continue playing
the episode on your iPod from where you left. This feature also works the
opposite way: If you start playing an episode on your iPod and then pause,
the audio book episode resumes the playback position so that you can con-
tinue playing it in iTunes from where you left.
To disable the playback feature
1. Select the audio book episode in iTunes.
2. Choose File➪Get Info.
3. Click the Options tab.
4. Deselect the Remember Playback Position option.
This option works with any track in your library, letting you resume
playback on any song or video as well.
Playing Movies, TV Shows, and Videos
Fifth- and sixth-generation iPods, the iPod nano, the iPod touch, and the iPhone
can all play videos from your iTunes library if you convert them for iPod use
(see Chapter 11 for details). You can watch your favorite TV show anytime,
anywhere. Check out the NCAA March Madness Basketball Championship
while waiting in line for tickets to the next game. Watch Disney animations
with your children while waiting for the bus. Get your dose of The Daily
Show with Jon Stewart while taking the subway to work. Or watch one of my
favorites, “Mr. Monk and the Airplane” from the Monk TV series, on your
next flight.
Video is incredibly portable on an iPod classic, iPod nano, iPod touch, or
iPhone. People are amazed by the crisp, clear picture quality. And because
videos have their own menu, you can easily distinguish between music
videos, TV shows, movies, and video podcasts.
254
Part III: Playing Your iPod 

To play a video, follow these steps:
1. Choose Videos from the iPod main menu, or iPod from the iPhone
menu.
2. Choose Movies, TV Shows, Music Videos, or Video Playlists from the
Videos menu on an iPod classic or iPod nano (or fifth-generation
models), or scroll the list of videos that appears on an iPod touch or
iPhone.
The Videos menu on an iPod classic, iPod nano, or fifth-generation iPod
offers these genres:
• Movies: The Movies menu lists any videos categorized as Videos.
• TV Shows: The TV Shows menu lists any videos categorized as TV
Shows, sorted alphabetically by show title. Scroll to highlight a
show title and then press the Select button to see a list of the TV
show episodes.
• Music Videos: The Music Videos menu lists any videos categorized
as Music Videos, sorted alphabetically by artist. Scroll to highlight
a music video artist and then press the Select button to see a list of
music videos by that artist.
• Video Playlists: The Video Playlists menu lists any video playlists
that you created in iTunes and that you enabled for synchroniza-
tion with your iPod.
Scroll the menu until the genre of video you want is highlighted and
then press the Select button. A menu or content list appears for each
selection. 
On an iPod touch or iPhone, the video titles are listed in alphabeti-
cal order divided into the following genres:
• Movies: Any videos categorized as Videos.
• TV Shows: Any videos categorized as TV Shows, sorted alphabeti-
cally by show title. Scroll the list and then touch a TV show title to
see a list of the TV show episodes.
• Music Videos: Any videos categorized as Music Videos, sorted
alphabetically by artist. Scroll the list of music video artists and
then touch an artist name to see a list of music videos by that
artist.
• Podcasts: Any videos categorized as Podcast, sorted alphabetically
by podcast name. Scroll the list of podcasts and then touch a pod-
cast title to see a list of the podcast episodes.
If you need to change the genre of an item, see Chapter 9.

3. Press the Select button on an iPod classic or iPod nano (or fifth-gener-
ation iPod) to play the highlighted playlist item, movie, music video,
or TV episode. On an iPod touch or iPhone, touch the title of the item.
The video playback controls work the same way as with songs.
4. Press the Play/Pause button when a video is playing to pause the 
playback.
Videos are automatically set to remember the playback position when
you pause. This feature lets you pause a video or TV episode in iTunes
while you synchronize your iPod. After synchronization, you can con-
tinue playing the video or episode on your iPod from where you left.
This feature also works the opposite way: If you start playing a video on
your iPod and then pause, the video resumes the playback position so
that you can continue playing it in iTunes from where you left.
To disable the playback feature, do the following:
1. Select the video in iTunes.
2. Choose File➪Get Info.
3. Click the Options tab.
4. Deselect the Remember Playback Position option.
This option works with any track in your library, letting you resume
playback on any song as well.
Playing Games on Your iPod
The sixth-generation iPod models and the iPod nano are supplied with three
new games: iQuiz, Klondike, and Vortex. These games, and the games that
you can purchase from the iTunes Store (my faves: Pac-Man, Mini Golf, and
Sudoku), are as sophisticated as those found on handheld, color-display
game machines.
Of the four games supplied with older iPods, three of them — Brick,
Parachute, and Solitaire — are a bit dorky for the information age, but hey,
they’re extras. On the other hand, the fourth, Music Quiz, is a cool way to
test your knowledge of your music library. 
To find the games, choose Extras➪Games. (On older iPods, choose
Extras➪Game.) And of course you can listen to music while you play.
256
Part III: Playing Your iPod 

iQuiz
Choose iQuiz from the Games menu (sixth-generation iPods). The point of
this game is obviously to choose the correct answer before time runs out.
Too many wrong answers and that’s it — game over! The game displays a
timer, the number you’ve answered wrong, and your score, as well as the
number of remaining questions. 
iQuiz is supplied with four question packs, three with preset questions: TV
Show Trivia, Music Trivia, Movie Trivia. The fourth, Music Quiz 2, uses the
music on your iPod to create custom-tailored multiple-choice and true-false
queries. You might hear a snippet from a song and have to answer with the
album it came from, or what year it was released. Or you might need to figure
out if a certain tune came out in a specific year. The quiz may even incorpo-
rate your album art.
Vortex
Choose Vortex from the Games menu (sixth-generation iPods). Inspired by
the original version of Breakout (from Atari), Vortex lets you bash bricks in
three dimensions, using the click wheel to play in 360 degrees. You move
your bat around the edge of the Vortex to block the ball as it smashes bricks
that rotate inside. Clearing the Vortex of bricks enables you to enter the
Vortex and advance to higher levels. As you rotate the click wheel, the bat
moves in the direction of your rotation, and you fire your weapon by pressing
the Select button or double-tapping the click wheel.
Klondike (solitaire)
Rather than playing the card game (’til one, with a deck of 51, with the Statler
Brothers), try Klondike, the iPod version of solitaire. Choose Klondike from
the Games menu (or Solitaire from the Game menu on older iPods) and press
the Select button to start the game. To move cards, scroll the hand pointer
over a card and then press the Select button to select the card. Then scroll
the hand pointer to the new location for the card and press Select to place it
at that position. To deal another round of three cards, scroll the hand pointer
over the card deck in the top-left corner of the display and press the Select
button. After going through an entire deck, the game places the remaining
cards into a new deck so that you can continue dealing cards. The game
improves considerably in a smoke-filled room with take-out pizza nearby;
gangsters are optional.
257
Chapter 15: Playing iPod Content

Brick and Parachute (older iPods)
Brick is like the original version of Breakout (from Atari). Choose Brick from
the Games menu on fifth- and fourth-generation iPods (Game menu on older
iPods) and press the Select button to start the game. Move the paddle from
side to side, along the bottom of the display, with the scroll wheel. You get
a point for each brick you knock out. If you break out — knock out all the
bricks — you move up a level in the game.
Parachute is a crude shoot-’em-up game where you play anti-aircraft gunner.
Choose Parachute from the Games menu on fifth- and fourth-generation iPods
(Game menu on older iPods) and press the Select button to start the game.
With the scroll wheel, you pivot the gun at the bottom. Then press the Select
button to fire at helicopters and paratroopers. Don’t let the paratroopers
reach the ground, or they’ll heave grenades at you. War is hell, ya know.
Music Quiz (older iPods)
Music Quiz (probably the greatest time-waster iPod game of them all) tests
your knowledge of your music library by playing the first few seconds of a
song picked at random from your iPod. Choose Music Quiz from the Games
menu on fifth- and fourth-generation iPods (Game menu on older iPods), put
on your headphones or connect your iPod to speakers, and press the Select
button to start the game. While the song plays, you have ten seconds to pick
the song title from a list of five titles. If you choose the wrong title, the game
displays Incorrect! and moves on to the next song. If you choose the right
title, you gain points and move on to the next one. (“Life’s a Long Song” by
Jethro Tull would be appropriate.)
Games from the iTunes Store
Games that you purchase from the iTunes Store also show up in the Games
menu on sixth- and fifth-generation iPods and the iPod nano. For example,
Pac-Man for the iPod (from Namco Networks America) is an excellent version
of the best-selling, coin-operated game in history. Pac-Man suits the iPod well
because you use the scroll wheel to navigate.
Many popular games are available in iPod format at the iTunes Store; see
Chapter 4 for details.
258
Part III: Playing Your iPod 

Viewing Photos
You might remember the old days when you carried fading, wallet-sized
photo prints that sported creases, rips, and tears the more you showed them
around. You can now dispense with carrying prints because all you need is
your color-display iPod, which can hold up to 25,000 photos. That’s a lot!
Assuming that you’ve already organized your photos into albums (Chapter 11)
and synchronized your iPod with photos (Chapter 12), you can see the photos
on your iPod by following these steps:
1. On the iPod or iPhone, choose Photos from the main menu.
The iPod classic and iPod nano displays the Photos menu with All Photos
and Settings choices at the top, followed by a list of photo albums in
alphabetical order. The iPhone displays the Camera Roll choice at the
top, followed by Photo Library and a list of photo albums. The iPod
touch displays Photo Library and a list of photo albums. Older iPod
models with color displays show a Photos menu with Photo Library and
Slideshow Settings choices at the top, followed by a list of photo albums.
2. On an iPod classic or iPod nano, choose All Photos or an album name;
on an iPod touch or iPhone (or older iPod models), choose either
Photo Library or the album name. 
The All Photos or Photo Library choice displays thumbnail images of all
the photos in your iPod or iPhone. Selecting an album displays thumb-
nail images of only the photos assigned to that album.
3. Use the scroll wheel on an iPod classic or iPod nano (or older iPod) to
highlight the photo thumbnail you want and then press the Select
button to select the photo; on an iPhone or iPod touch, flick your
finger to scroll the thumbnails, and tap a thumbnail to select the photo.
You might have several screens of thumbnails. Use the scroll wheel on
an iPod classic or iPod nano (or older models) to scroll through the
thumbnails or use Next/Fast-Forward and Previous/Rewind to skip to the
next or previous screen. Flick your finger to scroll the thumbnails on an
iPod touch or iPhone. When you select a photo thumbnail, your iPod
displays it.
Setting up a slide show
Slide shows are a far more entertaining way of showing photos because you
can include music as well as transitions between photos. You can display
your slide show on the iPod or on a television. (See Chapter 16 for details on
connecting your iPod to televisions, stereos, video monitors, and video
equipment.) Your slide show settings work with any photo album (or with the
entire photo library) on your iPod.
259
Chapter 15: Playing iPod Content

To set up a slide show with an iPod classic or iPod nano (or fifth-generation
iPod with color display), follow these steps:
1. Choose Photos from the main menu and then choose Settings from the
Photos menu (on fifth-generation iPods, choose Slideshow Settings).
2. Choose Time per Slide from the Settings menu (as shown in Figure
15-5) to set the duration of each slide.
You can select ranges from 2 to 20 seconds. Or, you can select Manual to
set the slide show to advance to the next slide when you click the
Next/Fast-Forward button.
3. Pick your music: Choose Music from the Settings menu and then
choose a playlist.
You can choose any playlist in your iPod for your slide show, including
On-The-Go or Now Playing. iPhoto lets you assign an iTunes playlist to
an iPhoto album, and that assignment is saved in your iPod. If you copy
the playlist to your iPod, it’s automatically assigned to the slide show.
4. Select a transition to use between photos in the slide show; choose
Transitions from the Settings menu.
Wipe Across is my favorite, but you can select Cross Fade, Fade To
Black, Zoom Out, or Wipe Center. Choose Random if you want to use a
different (and random) transition for each photo change. Choose Off for
no transition. After choosing a transition, the Settings menu appears
again.
5. Set the iPod to display the slide show by choosing TV Out from the
Settings menu.
You have three choices for TV Out:

your TV, you can also see the slides as large thumbnails on your
iPod, along with the photo number within the album or library, and
the Next and Previous icons.
• Ask displays a screen requesting that you select TV Off or TV On;
you make the choice each time you play a slide show.
• Off displays the slide show with full-size images on the iPod.
6. (Optional) Select other preferences from the Settings menu:
• Repeat: Repeats the slide show.
• Shuffle Photos: Shuffles photos in the slide show in a random order.
• TV Signal: Changes your television signal to PAL (Phase Alternating
Line) for European and other countries that use PAL as their video
standard. NTSC (National TV Standards Committee, also referred
to humorously as “never the same color”) is the U.S. standard.
To set up a slide show with an iPod touch or iPhone, follow these steps:
1. Choose Settings from the main menu, and then tap Photos at the
bottom of the Settings menu.
The settings for photos menu appears on your iPod touch or iPhone.
2. Touch the Play Each Slide For option to set the duration of each slide.
You can select ranges from 2 to 20 seconds. 
3. Touch the Transition option to pick a transition to use between photos
in the slide show.
Wipe Across is my favorite, but you can select Cube, Dissolve, Ripple, or
Wipe Down. Touch the Photos button to return to the photo settings
menu.
4. Select other preferences as appropriate for your slide show:
• Repeat: Repeats the slide show.
• Shuffle: Shuffles photos in the slide show in a random order.
5. Touch the Settings button to return to the Settings menu, or press the
menu button to return to the main menu.
Playing a slide show
If you want to display the slide show on a television, connect your iPod clas-
sic, iPod nano, or fifth-generation color display iPod to the television first,
before starting the show. See Chapter 16 for details on connecting your iPod
to a television.
261
Chapter 15: Playing iPod Content

To play a slide show, follow these steps:
1. On your iPod, choose Photos from the main menu.
2. Choose an album in the Photos menu, or choose All Photos (or Photo
Library on the iPod touch, iPhone, or older iPods).
Choosing All Photos or Photo Library includes the entire library in the
slide show; choosing an album includes only the photos in that album.
3. To start the show, press the Play/Pause button on an iPod classic or
iPod nano (or older iPod), or touch the Play/Pause button at the
bottom of the thumbnail display on an iPod touch or iPhone.
You can also start a slide show when viewing a single photo by pressing
the Select button on an iPod classic or iPod nano, or touching the
Play/Pause button on an iPod touch or iPhone.
4. If you previously set TV Out to Ask (as described in “Setting up a slide
show” in this section), choose TV On or TV Off for your slide show.
• TV On displays the slide show on a television (through the video-
out connection). You can also see the slides as large thumbnails on
the iPod.
TV Off displays the slide show with full-size images on the iPod.
5. Use the iPod buttons to navigate your slide show.
If you set Time per Slide to Manual, press (or touch) Next/Fast-Forward
to move to the next photo and press (or touch) Previous/Rewind to
return to the previous photo.
If you set Time per Slide to a duration, use Play/Pause to pause and play
the slide show.
6. Press the Menu button to stop the slide show. 
On an iPod classic or iPod nano (or older iPod), pressing the Menu
button returns to the Photos menu. On an iPod touch or iPhone, you
return to the main menu. You can also stop a slideshown on an iPod
touch or iPhone by touching outside the photo image.
Creating an On-The-Go Playlist
If you don’t want to hear the iTunes playlists already in your iPod (or if you
haven’t created playlists yet), you can create temporary — On-The-Go —
playlists. (Note: This particular playlist feature isn’t available in first- and
second-generation iPods.) You can create one or more lists of songs, entire
albums, podcast episodes, audio books, and videos to play in a certain order,
queuing the items right on the iPod. This option is particularly useful for
picking songs to play right before driving a car. (Hel-lo! You shouldn’t be
messing with your iPod while driving.)
262
Part III: Playing Your iPod 

Queued items that you select appear automatically in a playlist, appropri-
ately called On-The-Go, on the Playlists menu. (To navigate the Playlists
menu, see the earlier section, “By playlist.”) This temporary playlist remains
defined in your iPod until you delete it or save it as a new iPod playlist. If you
synchronize your iPod with new music and playlists, the On-The-Go playlist
is copied to your iTunes library and cleared automatically. You can also save
any new playlist you create on your iPod in your iTunes library.
Selecting and playing items 
in an On-The-Go playlist

playlist, select the Cancel option.
Saving an On-The-Go playlist
in your iPod classic or nano
You might want to create more than one On-The-Go playlist in your iPod clas-
sic or iPod nano (or older iPod), and temporarily save them for transferring
to your iTunes library. To temporarily save your On-The-Go playlist, follow
these steps:
1. Select the On-The-Go playlist.
Choose Music from the main menu, scroll the Music menu until Playlists
is highlighted, and then press the Select button. The Playlists menu
appears. Scroll to the On-The-Go item. Press the Select button, and the
list of items in the playlist appears.
2. Scroll to the very end of the list and select the Save Playlist item.
The Save menu appears, showing the Cancel and Save Playlist items.
3. Choose Save Playlist.
The On-The-Go playlist is saved with the name New Playlist 1 (and any
subsequent playlists you save are named New Playlist 2, and so on).
These appear at the very end of the Playlist menu, not in alphabetical
order — just above the On-The-Go Playlist item. If you don’t want to
save the playlist, select the Cancel item.
On-The-Go playlists saved as New Playlist 1, New Playlist 2, and so on, are
stored temporarily in your iPod until you automatically synchronize the iPod
with your iTunes library. The On-The-Go playlist is cleared each time you
save it as a new playlist, so you can start creating another On-The-Go playlist.
Transferring an On-The-Go
playlist to iTunes
Although most transfer operations are one way from iTunes to your iPod, you
can transfer the On-The-Go playlists to your iTunes library — just not the
content itself (which must already be in your iTunes library).
266
Part III: Playing Your iPod 

When you automatically synchronize your iPod (as we describe in Chapter
12), the current and saved On-The-Go playlists (called New Playlist 1, New
Playlist 2, and so on) are copied to your iTunes library, saved as regular
playlists, and cleared from the iPod. The automatic synchronization also
places the newly created playlists on your iPod. Hint: They’ll be in alphabeti-
cal order on the Playlist menu, named On-The-Go 1, On-The-Go 2, and so on.
To change an On-The-Go playlist name, rename it in your iTunes library. The
next time you automatically synchronize your iPod, the playlist names in
your iPod change to match your iTunes library.
When managing music and videos on your iPod manually, you can drag the
On-The-Go playlist and any saved playlists from your iPod library directly to
the iTunes library.
Playing an iPod shuffle
The iPod shuffle is a special iPod with no display or any controls to select
specific songs or albums. The idea behind an iPod shuffle is to load it with
songs in the order you want them to play (like a long playlist) and then play
the songs in that order or in shuffle (random) order.
Apple has introduced two iPod shuffle models but has discontinued the first
model. The current model, shown in its dock in Figure 15-6, offers two
switches on its side for controlling power and playback mode as well as the
familiar Play/Pause, Previous/Rewind, Next/Fast-Forward, and volume control
buttons. The older iPod shuffle offers one three-position switch on the back
for playing songs in order, for shuffling songs, and for turning off the unit. On
the older iPod shuffle, the Play in Order position is in the middle of the
switch, and the Shuffle position is at the bottom.
To play songs in the order they were copied, set the position switch to the
Play in Order position, which is marked by an icon with arrows in a closed
loop. To play songs in random order, set the position switch (see Figure 15-5)
to the Shuffle position — marked by the crossing arrows icon.
To play songs on a shuffle, press the Play/Pause button. To stop (or pause)
playback, press the Play/Pause button again. When you stop playback, the
iPod shuffle status light blinks green for a minute.
To navigate through the songs in your iPod shuffle, press the Previous/Rewind
button (skip backward) or the Next/Fast-Forward button (skip forward).
Press and hold these buttons to skip more than one song forward or back-
ward (as if you were fast-forwarding or rewinding a tape). You can start a
song over by pressing Previous/Rewind while the song is playing.
267
Chapter 15: Playing iPod Content

If you set the position switch to Play in Order, the Previous/Rewind button
skips backward and the Next/Fast-Forward button skips forward in the order
the songs were copied to the iPod shuffle. However, if you set the position
switch to Shuffle, the playing order is randomized first. Then the Previous/
Rewind button skips backward within the shuffle order, and the Next/Fast-
Forward button skips forward within the shuffle order. For example, suppose
your iPod shuffle plays the 14th song, then the 5th song, and then the 20th
song. In that case, pressing the Previous/Rewind button during the 20th song
takes you back to the 5th song, and pressing it again takes you back to the
14th song. From there, pressing the Next/Fast-Forward button skips through
the songs in the same order again: the 14th song, the 5th song, and then the
20th song.
To go immediately to the beginning of an iPod shuffle playlist, press the
Play/Pause button three times quickly (within a second).

Adjusting and Limiting the Volume
Because an iPod or iPhone can be quite loud when set to its highest volume,
we recommend turning down the volume before using headphones. You can
read at the end of this section how to control the volume for an iPod shuffle,
but here’s how to set the volume for an iPod or iPhone.
To adjust volume for an iPod classic or iPod nano (or older iPod), follow
these steps:
1. Play something on the iPod.
2. While the content is playing, change the volume with the scroll wheel.
A volume bar appears in the iPod display to guide you. Scroll with your
thumb or finger clockwise to increase the volume, and counterclockwise
to decrease the volume.
To adjust volume for an iPod touch or iPhone, follow these steps:
1. Play something on the iPod touch or iPhone.
2. While the content is playing, touch the lower portion of the display
and slide your finger on the volume slider.
After touching the lower portion of the display while playing something,
the volume slider with a silver knob appears in the iPod touch or iPhone
at the bottom of the display underneath the playback controls (refer to
Figure 15-4). Slide the knob with your finger to the right to increase the
volume, or to the left to decrease the volume.
You can also limit the highest volume for your iPod or iPhone to be lower
than the actual maximum. This can help protect your hearing while listening
to content from sources with different volume levels. 
To limit the volume to be lower than the actual maximum volume on an iPod
classic or iPod nano, follow these steps:
1. Choose Settings from the main menu.
2. Choose Volume Limit from the Settings menu.
3. Scroll the volume bar with the click wheel to limit the volume.
A volume bar appears in the iPod display to guide you. Scroll clockwise
to increase the volume or counterclockwise to decrease the volume.
While you scroll, a triangle below the volume bar indicates the new limit.
4. Press the Select button to set the limit, or press Play/Pause to option-
ally lock the volume limit.
269
Chapter 15: Playing iPod Content

Press the Select button to accept the new limit without locking it, and skip
the next step; or press the Play/Pause button to lock the volume limit.
5. (Optional) Set the combination lock for locking the volume limit.
If you pressed the Play/Pause button to lock the volume limit, your iPod
displays the combination lock. 
For more details about setting your iPod combination lock, see
Chapter 21.
The combination lock is useful for locking the volume limit so others
can’t change it (such as your children). However, it also means that you
have to enter the combination to unlock the iPod in order to change the
volume limit.
To limit the volume to be lower than the actual maximum volume on an iPod
touch or iPhone, follow these steps:
1. Choose Settings from the main menu.
2. Choose iPod from the Settings menu.
3. Choose Volume Limit from the iPod menu.
A volume slider appears with a silver knob. 
4. Slide your finger on the volume slider to limit the volume.
Slide the knob with your finger to the right to increase the volume, or to
the left to decrease the volume. While you slide your finger, a triangle
below the slider indicates the new limit.
5. Touch the iPod button to set the limit and return to the iPod menu, or
touch the Lock Volume Limit button to optionally lock the volume limit.
Touch the iPod button in the upper left corner to accept the new limit
without locking it, and skip the next step; or touch the Lock Volume
Limit button to lock the volume limit.
6. (Optional) Set the Volume Limit Code for locking the volume limit.
If you touched the Lock Volume Limit button to lock the volume limit,
your iPod touch or iPhone displays four squares for entering a code
number. Touch the calculator-style number pad to type numbers for your
code, and be sure to make up a code that you will remember! (If you don’t
want to enter a code, touch the Cancel button in the upper left corner.)
The lock is useful for locking the volume limit so others can’t change it
(such as your children). However, it also means that you have to enter
the volume limit code to unlock the iPod touch or iPhone in order to
change the volume limit.
To adjust the volume of an iPod shuffle, press the Volume Up (+) or Volume
Down (–) buttons.

Getting Wired for Playback
In This Chapter
 Finding your iPod’s connections
 Connecting your iPod to home stereos
 Connecting to televisions and video equipment
 Playing your iPod through iTunes on any computer
 Using home accessories
T
he sound quality coming from your iPod is excellent, so why not use it
with your home stereo system? Better yet, why not build an excellent
home stereo around your iPod — one that truly provides advantages for iPod
owners? That’s what part of this chapter is about: connecting your iPod to an
audio system for your home, office, patio, den, bathroom, or wherever. The
other part shows you how to connect a color-display iPod to a television,
video monitor, or other video equipment (such as a video projector) to maxi-
mize the quality of the picture. It describes the physical connections needed
for your iPod to show videos and photo slide shows as if they were playing
on a DVD player (only they’re actually playing from the palm of your hand).
You can also play your iTunes content wirelessly, using either AirTunes or 
an Apple AirPort Express wireless network hub connected to a stereo, as
described in Chapter 6. Additionally, you can connect your iTunes library
wirelessly (or over an Ethernet network) to Apple TV, which connects to 
your high-definition or regular television and stereo system, as described 
in Chapter 7.
Making Connections
All iPod models enable you to connect your iPod to headphones or to your
home stereo with standard audio cables, as well as to your computer via
either FireWire or USB cables. Here’s a quick summary:

 USB/FireWire dock connector: Sixth-, fifth-, fourth-, and third-generation
models, including iPod mini and iPod nano, have a dock connection. You
can use the connection to insert your iPod into a dock, or use the iPod
with a dock connector cable, as shown in Figure 16-1. The dock connec-
tor cable has a dock connector on one end (the same type of connection
used in docks) and a FireWire or USB connector (or both FireWire and
USB connectors with a split cable) on the other.
 Headphone/line-out: You can connect headphones or a 3.5mm stereo
mini-plug cable to the headphone/line-out connection. On a color-
display iPod, the headphone/line-out connection also serves as an AV
(audio-video) connection for displaying slide shows and photos.
 Docks: Docks from third parties come in many sizes and shapes. Apple
provides a special dock in the box with iPhones and iPod shuffles; for
other iPods you can use Apple’s optional Universal Dock (available in
the optional iPod AV Connection Kit, which you can find in Apple stores
and in the online Apple Store) with these connections:
• A dock connector for a FireWire or USB cable connection
• A headphone/line-out connection for a stereo mini-plug cable or 
AV cable (or headphones)

Part III: Playing Your iPod 

Older iPod models offer the following connections:
 Headphone/line-out and control socket (third- and fourth-generation
iPods): You can connect headphones or a 3.5mm stereo mini-plug cable to
the headphone/line-out connection. The combination headphone and con-
trol socket connection on top of third- and fourth-generation iPods allows
you to plug in accessories, such as remote control devices and voice
recorders. The headphone/line-out connection on second-generation
models includes an outer ring for connecting the Apple Remote supplied
with those models.
 FireWire (six pin): First- and second-generation iPods have a six-pin,
FireWire-only connection on the top that works with any standard six-
pin FireWire cable.
 Dock: For fourth- and third-generation iPod models, the dock supplied
with the iPod offers two connections: a FireWire connection for the dock
connector cable, and also a headphone/line-out connection for a stereo
mini-plug cable (or headphones).
You can connect the FireWire or USB end of the dock connector cable to the
computer for synchronizing with iTunes, as we describe in Chapter 12, and
playing the iPod through iTunes, as we describe in this chapter. You can also
connect to the power adapter to charge the iPod battery. The FireWire or USB
connection to the computer provides power to the iPod (as long as the com-
puter’s USB hardware supplies power, and the computer is powered on and
not in sleep mode — for information on powering your iPod, see Chapter 1).
Connecting to a Home Stereo
Home stereo systems come in many shapes and sizes, from an audiophile’s
monster component racks to a kid’s itty-bitty boombox. We’re not talking
about alarm clock radios. We’re talking about stereos with speakers that
allow you to add another input device, such as a portable CD player.
Component-style stereo systems typically include a receiver that contains a
preamp/amplifier (with a volume control) and an FM radio tuner. Some sys-
tems separate these functions into separate components, such as a preamp,
an amplifier, and a tuner. To connect your iPod or computer to a home stereo,
look for RCA-type connections that are marked AUX IN (for auxiliary input),
CD IN (for connecting a CD player), or TAPE IN (for tape deck input). All-in-
one stereos and boomboxes typically don’t have connections for audio input
although you can find exceptions. Look at the back and sides of the unit for
any RCA-type connections.
273
Chapter 16: Getting Wired for Playback

You can connect a CD or tape player to most stereos with RCA-type cables —
one (typically red or black) for the right channel, and one (typically white if
the other is black, or white or black if the other is red) for the left channel. All
you need is a cable with a stereo mini-plug on one end and RCA-type connec-
tors on the other, as shown in Figure 16-2. Stereo mini-plugs have two black
bands on the plug, but a mono mini-plug has only one black band.
Follow these steps to connect your iPod to your stereo:
1. Connect the stereo mini-plug to either the headphone/line-out connec-
tion on a dock or the headphone/line-out connection on the iPod,
depending on whether you want to control the volume from your
iPod.
With the dock connection, you have no control over volume on the iPod.
Instead, you use your stereo system or speakers to control the volume.
2. Connect the left and right connectors to the stereo system’s audio
input.
Use whatever connections are available, such as AUX IN, TAPE IN, or 
CD IN.
Don’t use the PHONO IN (phonograph input) connection. On most
stereos, these connections are for phonographs (turntables) and aren’t
properly matched for other kinds of input devices. If you use the PHONO
IN connection, you might get a loud buzzing sound that could damage
your speakers.
If you use your iPod’s headphone/line-out connection, you can control the
volume from the iPod via the scroll wheel; see Chapter 15. This controls the
volume of the signal from the iPod. Stereo systems typically have their own
control to raise or lower the volume of the amplified speakers. For optimal
sound quality when using a home stereo, set the iPod volume at less than half
the maximum output and adjust your listening volume by using your stereo
controls.

Part III: Playing Your iPod 

Connecting to a TV or Video Input
You can connect your fifth-generation iPod to any television, video projector,
or video recorder or player that offers standard RCA video and audio connec-
tions, or an S-video connection.
Apple offers the optional iPod AV Cable, which is a special cable that you can
plug in to the headphone/line-out connection of the iPod. The cable offers
RCA video (yellow) and stereo audio (red and white) connectors as well as an
S-video connector, as shown in Figure 16-3, to plug in to your television or
video equipment.
While Apple warns that you must use the AV Cable supplied with your iPod
(implying others don’t work), Belkin (www.belkin.com) offers its AV Cable
for 4G/5G iPod (Color LCD) for $20, which works fine.

Chapter 16: Getting Wired for Playback

For even better picture quality, use a television or video monitor that sup-
ports component (Y, Pb, and Pr) video, and use your sixth-generation iPod or
iPod nano with the Apple Component AV Cable. The Component AV Cable
connects to your iPod or Universal Dock via the 30-pin dock connector. On
the other end, connect its component cables to the component connections
on your TV, home theater receiver, or stereo receiver, and the audio cables to
the stereo audio connections in your receiver or speaker system. 
If you don’t see a picture on your television, check that your television is 
set to the correct input source — Video In (RCA) or S-video In (if you use an
S-video cable and a fifth-generation iPod dock). You can also use other types
of video equipment. For example, a video recorder that accepts RCA or 
S-video input can record the video, and a video projector can display it on 
a large screen.
Playing an iPod through iTunes
With the exception of content purchased from the iTunes Store, you can’t
copy the content from your iPod into your iTunes library via iTunes, but you
can use iTunes on your computer to play the content directly from the iPod.
You can even connect your friend’s iPod to your computer and include your
friend’s iPod songs in your Party Shuffle. Not only can you do that, but when
you play songs from different iPods or from your library, you can cross-fade
them (see Chapter 6).
If your computer is connected to a home stereo, the iPod content plays
through iTunes and on the stereo. You can connect your computer to a
stereo wirelessly with an FM radio accessory, such as the Aurius from
Engineered Audio (www.engineeredaudio.com, $40), which connects to
your computer with a USB cable and wirelessly transmits your iTunes con-
tent (or any audio and video on your computer) to the FM radio tuner of your
home stereo system.
To play the content on your iPod in iTunes, follow these steps:
1. Connect the iPod to your computer and then press Ô-Option (Mac) or
Ctrl-Alt (Windows) to prevent automatic synchronization.
2. Set the iPod to manually manage music and videos.
To set the iPod to manage music and videos manually, see Chapter 12.
(The iPod synchronizes automatically by default, but you can change
that.)
276
Part III: Playing Your iPod 

3. Select the iPod name in the iTunes Source pane in the Devices section.
After selecting the iPod in the iTunes Source pane, the device summary
page appears in List view or Browse view.
4. Click the triangle next to the iPod name to see its playlists and con-
tents; then select Music (underneath the iPod name).
The list of songs on the iPod appears in the List pane. You can scroll or
browse the iPod’s library just like you can in the main iTunes library.
5. (Optional) View the iPod playlists.
Scroll the iTunes window to view the iPod’s playlists in the Source pane.
6. Select an item in the iPod song list and then click the iTunes Play
button.
What if you want to connect your iPod to a computer other than your own?
Or friends arrive with an iPod filled with songs that you’d like to hear, and
you want to hear them on your stereo system that’s already connected to
your computer?
You can either connect your iPod to another computer or connect someone
else’s iPod to your computer. Either way, iTunes starts and recognizes that
the iPod isn’t matched to the iTunes library (because it’s matched to another
computer’s iTunes library). iTunes then displays a message asking whether
you want to change the link to this iTunes library and replace all existing
songs and playlists; it also asks if you want to change the photos. This is
important — click No for each change request.
Unless you want to change the contents of your iPod to reflect this computer’s
library, click No. If you click Yes, iTunes erases the library of your iPod and
then updates your iPod with the library on that computer, including photos
and videos. If you’re using a public computer with no content in the iTunes
library, you end up with an empty iPod. If you’re using a friend’s computer,
your friend’s library copies to your iPod, erasing whatever was on your iPod.
So don’t click Yes unless you really want to completely change the content on
your iPod. You’ve been warned.
With color-display iPods, you also get a similar warning message about
changing the link to the photo library and replacing all photos in the iPod.
Again, click No to prevent this from happening.
If you connect a Mac-formatted iPod to a Windows computer, you get a warn-
ing message about reformatting it. Don’t do it! Click Cancel. Otherwise, you
reformat the iPod and clear all music from it. Then click the Safely Remove
Hardware icon and safely eject the iPod from the computer. See Chapter 23
for details on how to make a Windows PC recognize a Mac-formatted iPod.
Mac users don’t have this problem — a Mac can recognize and synchronize
with Windows-formatted iPods.

Accessories for the iHome
Many of the thousands of accessories for the iPod are designed for travel.
However, companies also provide docks, speaker systems, and stands for
iPods for when you’re home again.
To see our idea of the best travel accessories, visit this book’s companion
Web site.
For an extremely powerful, single-cabinet, portable speaker system that
offers iPod docking and exceptional sound, the stylish, high-quality iPod Hi-Fi
from Apple (www.apple.com/ipodhifi) is hard to beat. Housed in a single
unit with a dock for the iPod, the iPod Hi-Fi takes up very little space. It runs
on D-cell batteries for boombox portability. And you can use the included
wireless Apple Remote to control playback. When you plug in your fifth- or
sixth-generation iPod or iPod nano, the iPod Hi-Fi adds a Speakers option to
the iPod main menu. Select Speakers to see the Speakers menu, which
includes a Tone Control option offering Normal, Bass Boost, and Treble Boost
settings to tweak the iPod Hi-Fi sound. The Speakers menu also offers a
Backlight option to set your iPod’s backlighting while it’s connected to the
iPod Hi-Fi, and the Large Album Art option to show full-screen art associated
with the content.
If you’re running iPod Software 1.0 on a fifth-generation iPod or fourth-
generation iPod Photo, the Speakers menu offers a Room Size option instead
of Tone Control. You should update your iPod Software for these models, as
we describe in Chapter 23.
What if you have multiple iPods from different generations and need to orga-
nize your docks and cables? The Belkin Tunesync (www.belkin.com) offers
a unique USB cradle that not only offers a place for recharging and syncing

Perhaps the coolest home outfit for your iPod turns your living room into a
juke joint for $700. The Jukebox Station from Saffire-USA (www.saffire-usa.
com) houses a universal docking cradle for any iPod along with an FM radio
and a CD player. It offers an 80-watt stereo amplifier and a five-speaker system
(two magnetically shielded tweeters, two midrange drivers, and a six-inch 
subwoofer).
The Jukebox Station comes with an infrared (IR) remote to control volume
and iPod functions from across the room. It has RCA-type and 3.5mm mini-
plug inputs to accept other music players and sources, an RCA-type output
connection for another stereo or recording device, and a 3.5mm mini-plug
output for headphones. An RCA-type video output is also provided to play
your iPod videos and photo slide shows on a television.
When your iPod is tethered to a dock and connected to your home stereo,
you don’t have to be within reach to change the track or the settings. Instead,
you can control it remotely. The wireless Apple Remote (see the Apple Web
site) provides the usual CD player controls: Play/Pause, Next Track, Previous
Track, and Volume. It works with Apple’s Universal Dock and iPod Hi-Fi. The
Apple Remote is supplied with current Mac models and with Apple TV, and is
also available separately at an Apple Store (including the online store).
Engineered Audio (www.engineeredaudio.com) provides a wireless
remote control — the Aerolink — for $45. It features an operating range
greater than 200 feet. Like its predecessor (the RemoteRemote 2, $40), the
Aerolink works around corners and through walls because it uses radio fre-
quency (RF) rather than IR. With these remote controllers, you can control
your living room iPod from the bedroom, or deejay a party from another
room.

S
ound is difficult to describe. Describing how to adjust sound to your
liking is harder still. Maybe you want more oomph in the lows, or per-
haps you prefer highs that are as clear as a bell. Even if you’ve never mas-
tered a stereo system beyond adjusting the bass, treble, and volume, you can
use this limited knowledge to quickly fine-tune the sound in iTunes by using
the equalizer settings, as you discover in this chapter.
Sound studio engineers try to make recordings for typical listening environ-
ments, so they have to simulate the sound experience in those environments.
Studios typically have home stereo speakers as monitors so that the engi-
neers can hear what the music sounds like on a home stereo. In the 1950s
and early 1960s, when AM radio was king, engineers working on potential AM
radio hits purposely mixed the sound with low-fidelity monaural speakers so
that they could hear what the mix would sound like on the radio. (Thank
goodness that those days are over, and that cars offer higher-quality FM
radio as well as very high-quality audio systems.)
Engineers did this because the quality of the sound is no better than the
speakers you play it on. When you find out how to adjust and fine-tune the
sound coming from your computer running iTunes and out of your iPod, 
use your everyday listening environment as a guide. If you tweak the sound
specifically for your computer speakers or for your home stereo and speak-
ers, though, remember that with an iPod you have other potential listening
environments — different headphones, car stereo systems, portable boom-
boxes, and so on.

Fortunately, iTunes gives you the flexibility of using different equalization set-
tings for different songs, audio books, podcasts, and videos. You can also use
presets on your iPod. In this chapter, you discover how to make presets for
songs in your library so that iTunes remembers them. What’s more, you can
use the standard iTunes presets on your iPod or use other iPod settings in
tandem with the iPod’s equalizer. This chapter shows you how. You also learn
how to modify the starting and stopping points within songs, audio books,
podcast episodes, and videos, and how to split a track.
Adjusting the Sound in iTunes First
Some songs are just too loud. We don’t mean too loud stylistically, as in thrash
metal with screeching guitars; we mean too loud for your ears when you’re
wearing headphones or so loud that the music sounds distorted in your
speakers. And some songs are just too soft; you have to increase the volume
to hear them and then lower the volume to listen to louder songs. To remedy
instances like these, you can set the volume in advance in several ways.
Setting the volume in advance
With songs, audio books, podcast episodes, and videos that you already
know are too loud (or too soft), consider setting the volume for those items
(or even entire albums or podcasts) in advance so that they always play with
the desired volume adjustment.
To adjust the overall volume of a particular item in advance so that it always
plays at that setting, perform the following steps:
1. Click an item to select it.
To set the volume in iTunes for multiple songs, you can select an entire
album in Browse view or you can select all the songs. To set the volume
for a whole podcast, select it instead of individual episodes.
2. Choose File➪Get Info.
The information dialog appears.
3. Click the Options tab.
Drag the Volume Adjustment slider left or right to adjust the volume
lower or higher, as shown in Figure 17-1. You can do this while playing
the file.
284
Part IV: Using Advanced Techniques 

Enhancing the sound
Some home or car stereos offer a sound enhancer button to improve the
depth of the sound. iTunes offers a similar option — Sound Enhancer — that
enhances high and low frequencies. Audiophiles and sound purists would
most likely use the equalizer to boost frequencies, but you can use this brute-
force method to enhance the sound.
To enable Sound Enhancer, follow these steps:
1. Choose iTunes➪Preferences (Mac) or Edit➪Preferences (Windows).
2. In the iTunes Preferences dialog that appears, click the Playback tab.
The Playback preferences appear, as shown in Figure 17-2.
3. Adjust the Sound Enhancer slider:
• Increase the sound enhancement. Dragging the Sound Enhancer
slider to the right (toward High) is similar to pressing the loudness
button on a stereo or the equivalent of boosting the treble (high)
and bass (low) frequencies in the equalizer. (See the upcoming 
section, “Equalize It in iTunes.”)
• Decrease the high and low frequencies. Drag the slider to the left
toward Low.
Figure 17-1:
Adjust the
volume
setting for a
song here.
285
Chapter 17: Fine-Tuning the Sound

The middle setting is neutral, adding no enhancement — the same as
disabling Sound Enhancer by clearing its check box.
Sound-checking the iTunes library
Because music CDs are manufactured inconsistently, discrepancies occur in
volume. Some CDs play louder than others; occasionally, even individual
tracks on a CD might vary.
You can standardize the volume level of all the songs in your iTunes library
with the Sound Check option. (Think of musicians, who do sound checks to
check the volume of microphones and instruments and the effect on the lis-
tening environment.) The aptly named Sound Check option in iTunes allows
you to do a sound check on your tunes to bring them all into line, volume-
wise. This option has the added benefit of applying the same volume adjust-
ment when you play the songs back on your iPod, as described in the
upcoming section, “Sound-checking the iPod.”
Sound Check scans the audio files, finds each track’s peak volume level, and
then uses this peak volume information to level the playing volume of tracks
so that they have the same peak volume. The sound quality isn’t affected, nor
is the audio information changed: The volume is simply adjusted at the start
of the track to be in line with other tracks.
Figure 17-2:
Use the
Sound
Enhancer.
286
Part IV: Using Advanced Techniques 

To enable Sound Check, follow these steps:
1. Drag the iTunes volume slider to set the overall volume for iTunes.
The volume slider is located in the top-left corner of the iTunes window,
to the right of the Play button.
2. Choose iTunes➪Preferences (Mac) or Edit➪Preferences (Windows).
3. In the iTunes Preferences dialog that appears, click the Playback tab.
The Playback preferences appear; refer to Figure 17-2.
4. Select the Sound Check check box.
iTunes sets the volume level for all songs according to the level of the
iTunes volume slider.
5. Click OK.
The Sound Check option sets a volume adjustment based on the volume
slider on all the songs so that they play at approximately the same
volume.
The operation runs in the background while you do other things. If you quit
iTunes and then restart it, the operation continues where it left off when you
quit. You can switch Sound Check on or off at any time.
Sound-checking the iPod
You can take advantage of volume-leveling in your iTunes library with the
Sound Check option and then switch Sound Check on or off on your iPod by
choosing Sound Check from the iPod Settings menu.
This feature is useful especially when using your iPod in a car or when jog-
ging while listening to headphones because you don’t want to have to reach
for the volume on the iPod or on the car stereo every time it starts playing a
song that’s too loud.
The Sound Check option on your iPod works only if you’ve also set the Sound
Check option in your iTunes library. If you need to enable this setting in
iTunes, check out the preceding section.
On your iPod, choose Settings➪Sound Check➪On from the main menu to
enable Sound Check. To disable it, choose Settings➪Sound Check➪Off.

Chapter 17: Fine-Tuning the Sound

Equalize It in iTunes
To open the iTunes equalizer, choose View➪Show Equalizer. The iTunes
equalizer allows you to fine-tune sound spectrum frequencies in a more pre-
cise way than with the typical bass and treble controls you find on home
stereos and powered speakers. (See the sidebar on equalizers, elsewhere in
this chapter.) You can use the equalizer to improve or enhance the sound
coming through a particular stereo system and speakers. With the equalizer
settings, you can customize playback for different musical genres, listening
environments, or speakers.
If you want to pick entirely different equalizer settings for car speakers, home
speakers, and headphones, you can save your settings, as described in the
upcoming section, “Saving your own presets.”
Adjusting the preamp volume
The preamp in your stereo is the component that offers a volume control that
applies to all frequencies equally.
Volume knobs generally go up to 10 — except, of course, for Spinal Tap’s
Marshall preamps, which go to 11.
The iTunes equalizer, as shown in Figure 17-3, offers a Preamp slider on the
far-left side. You can increase or decrease the volume in 3 decibel (dB) incre-
ments up to 12 dB. Decibels are units of measure for the intensity (or volume)
of the frequencies. You can adjust the volume while playing the music to hear
the result right away.
If you want to make any adjustments to frequencies, you might need to adjust
the preamp volume first if volume adjustment is needed and then move on to
the specific frequencies.

288
Part IV: Using Advanced Techniques 

Adjusting frequencies
You can adjust frequencies in the iTunes equalizer by clicking and dragging
sliders that look like mixing-board faders.
The horizontal values across the equalizer represent the spectrum of human
hearing. The deepest frequency (“Daddy sang bass”) is 32 hertz (Hz); the
midrange frequencies are 250 Hz and 500 Hz; and the higher frequencies go
from 1 kilohertz (kHz) to 16 kHz (treble).
The vertical values on each bar represent decibels. Increase or decrease the
frequencies at 3 dB increments by clicking and dragging the sliders up and
down. You can drag the sliders to adjust the frequencies while the music is
playing so that you can hear the effect immediately.
Using the iTunes presets
iTunes offers presets, which are equalizer settings made in advance and saved
by name. You can quickly switch settings without having to make changes to
each frequency slider. iTunes comes with more than 20 presets of the most
289
Chapter 17: Fine-Tuning the Sound
What’s the frequency, Kenneth? 
The equalizer opportunity
The Beach Boys were right when they sang
“Good Vibrations” because that’s what music 
is — the sensation of hearing audible vibrations
conveyed to the ear by a medium, such as air.
Musicians measure pitch by the frequency of
vibrations. The waves can oscillate slowly and
produce low-pitched sounds, or they can oscil-
late rapidly and produce high-pitched sounds.
Amplitude is a measurement of the amount of
fluctuation in air pressure — therefore, ampli-
tude is perceived as loudness.
When you increase the bass or treble on a
stereo system, you’re actually increasing the
volume, or intensity, of certain frequencies
while the music is playing. An equalizer lets you
fine-tune the sound spectrum frequencies in a
more precise way than with bass and treble
controls. It increases or decreases specific fre-
quencies of the sound to raise or lower highs,
lows, and midrange tones. The equalizer adjusts
the volume with several band-pass filters all
centered at different frequencies, and each
filter offers controllable gain (the ability to boost
the volume).
On more sophisticated stereo systems, an
equalizer with a bar graph display replaces the
bass and treble controls. An equalizer (EQ in
audio-speak) enables you to fine-tune the spe-
cific sound spectrum frequencies, which gives
you far greater control than merely adjusting
the bass or treble controls.

commonly used equalizer settings, including ones for specific music genres,
such as classical and rock. You can assign these presets (or your own pre-
sets) to a specific item or set of items (songs, audio books, podcast episodes,
and videos) in your iTunes library.
These preset settings copy to your iPod along with the content when you
update your iPod.
To choose an equalizer preset, click the Equalizer’s pop-up menu as shown in
Figure 17-4, which by default is set to Manual (refer to Figure 17-3). If some-
thing is playing, you hear the effect in the sound immediately after choosing
the preset.
Saving your own presets
You don’t have to settle for the built-in equalizer presets — create your own!
(Unfortunately, you can’t transfer custom presets to an iPod as of this writing.)
Follow these steps to save your own presets to the iTunes equalizer:
1. Make the frequency changes that you want by dragging the individual
sliders up and down.
The pop-up menu automatically switches to Manual.
Figure 17-4:
Choose a

2. Choose Make Preset from the pop-up menu (refer to Figure 17-4) to
save your changes.
The Make Preset dialog appears, as shown in Figure 17-5.
3. Enter a descriptive name for your preset in the New Preset Name text
box and then click OK.
The name appears in the pop-up menu from that point — your very own
preset.
You can rename or delete any preset, including those supplied with iTunes
(which is useful if you want to recall a preset by another name). Choose the
Edit List option from the pop-up menu. The Edit Presets dialog opens, as
shown in Figure 17-6. Click Rename to rename a preset, click Delete to delete
a preset, and then click Done when you finish editing the list.
Assigning equalizer presets
One reason why you go to the trouble of setting equalizer presets is to assign
them to your iTunes content. The next time you play the item, iTunes uses
the equalizer preset that you assigned.

Chapter 17: Fine-Tuning the Sound

When you transfer content to your iPod, the standard iTunes presets transfer
with it; you can choose whether to use these assignments when playing the
content on your iPod. However, custom presets don’t transfer to the iPod.
Assign an equalizer preset to a content item or set of items by following 
these steps:
1. Choose View➪View Options.
The View Options dialog appears, as shown in Figure 17-7.
2. Select the Equalizer check box and then click OK.
The Equalizer column appears in the List pane in the iTunes 
window.
You can combine Steps 1 and 2 by Control-clicking (Mac) or right-
clicking (Windows) on any column heading in List view and then 
choosing Equalizer.
3. Locate an item and scroll the list horizontally (if necessary) to see 
the Equalizer column, as shown in Figure 17-8.
4. Choose a preset from the pop-up menu in the Equalizer column.
The Equalizer column has a tiny pop-up menu that allows you to assign
any preset to a song, audio book, podcast episode, or video.

Equalize It in Your iPod
You leave the back-road bliss of the country to get on the freeway, and now
the music in your car doesn’t have enough bass to give you that thumping
rhythm you need to dodge other cars. What can you do? Without endanger-
ing anybody, you can pull over and then select one of the iPod equalizer 
presets, such as Bass Booster.
Yes, your iPod also has a built-in equalizer. Similar to the iTunes equalizer,
the iPod built-in equalizer modifies the volume of the frequencies of the
sound. And although you don’t have sliders like the iTunes equalizer, you 
do get the same long list of presets (except for Loudness) to suit the type 
of music or environment.
The iPod equalizer uses a bit more battery power when it’s on, so you might
have less playing time.
You can also use the iTunes equalizer to improve or enhance the sound,
assigning presets to each song and then updating your iPod.
Choosing an equalizer preset on your iPod
To select an iPod equalizer preset, choose Settings➪EQ from the main menu.
The equalizer is set to Off until you select one of the presets.
Figure 17-8:
Select a

scroll the
List pane to

293
Chapter 17: Fine-Tuning the Sound

Each equalizer preset offers a different balance of frequencies designed to
enhance the sound in certain ways. For example, Bass Booster increases the
volume of the low (bass) frequencies; Treble Booster does the same to the
high (treble) frequencies.
To see what a preset actually does to the frequencies, open the iTunes equal-
izer and then select the same preset. The faders in the equalizer show you
exactly what the preset does.
The Off setting disables the iPod equalizer — no presets are used, not even
ones you assigned in iTunes. You have to choose an equalizer preset to
enable the iPod equalizer.
Applying the iTunes equalizer presets
After assigning a standard preset to a content item in iTunes, enable the iPod
equalizer by choosing any equalizer setting (other than Off) so that the iPod
uses the item’s equalizer preset for playback. To assign standard presets to
items with the iTunes equalizer, see the earlier section, “Assigning equalizer
presets.”
No matter what equalizer preset you choose on your iPod, any item that has
an assigned preset uses the assigned preset. That’s right — the assigned
equalizer preset from iTunes takes precedence over the preset in the iPod.
If you want items that have assigned presets to play with those presets while
the rest of the content plays without any equalizer adjustment, choose the
Flat EQ preset in your iPod.
If you know in advance that you need to use specific presets for certain
songs, assign standard presets to the songs in iTunes before copying the
songs to the iPod (but not custom presets, which don’t transfer to the iPod).
If, on the other hand, you don’t want the songs fixed to a certain preset, don’t
assign presets to the songs in iTunes. You can then experiment with the pre-
sets in the iPod to get better playback in different listening environments.
You can temporarily play an item with an assigned preset via one of your
iPod’s other equalizer settings. Start playing the item on your iPod, and while
the item is playing, press the Menu button until you return to the main menu.
Choose Settings➪EQ and then select a setting you want to try. The content
plays to the end with the new equalizer setting. The next time that item is
played, it uses the assigned preset as usual.
294
Part IV: Using Advanced Techniques 

Modifying Content in iTunes
Although iTunes was never meant to be a media-editing application, it does
offer a simple control over the starting and stopping points for playing back
media. You can use this feature to cut unwanted intros and outros of a song,
such as announcers and audience applause, or to skip opening credits or
commercials of movies. You can also use it in conjunction with the Convert
feature to split an item (or, in the parlance of record label executives and
artists, split a track).
To do more significant modifications or editing, use the recording and editing
applications described on this book’s companion Web site.
Setting the start and stop points
iTunes can play only a portion of a song, video, audio book, or podcast
episode — that is, if you specify start and stop times for the item. To set the
start and/or stop points, select the item, choose File➪Get Info, and then click
Options, as shown in Figure 17-9.
Figure 17-9:
Set the start
time.
295
Chapter 17: Fine-Tuning the Sound

Click inside the Start Time field to set the start time; in Figure 17-9, we set the
Start Time to 0:30 (30 seconds). Then click inside the Stop Time field to set
the stop time. The start and stop times are in minutes, seconds, and hun-
dredths of a second: for example, 8:15.93 is 8 minutes and 15.93 seconds.
To determine with accuracy the time for the start and stop points, play the
file and look in the Status pane at the top-center part of the iTunes window
for the Elapsed Time. You can drag the slider in the Status pane to move
quickly and find the exact times for the start and stop points you want to set.
Note: If you click Elapsed Time in the Status pane, it toggles to Remaining
Time; click it again for Total Time, and click it once more to see Elapsed 
Time again.
iTunes plays only the part of the content between the start and stop times.
You can use this feature to your advantage because when you convert a song
to another format (such as AIFF to MP3), iTunes converts only the part of the
song between the start and stop times.
Splitting a track
You might have a CD that was created with all the songs combined into one
track, or you might have recorded an entire side of a record or cassette tape
onto one sound file. Either way, you probably want to separate the songs into
tracks in iTunes.
The best way to split a long track is to open the sound file in a sound-editing
program that lets you select sections and them save them separately.
To learn more about using sound recording and editing applications, see this
book’s companion Web site.
However, you can also separate a track into smaller tracks in iTunes as long
as you use the AIFF format at first. Follow these steps:
1. Before ripping a CD or importing a sound file, set the encoder in your
importing preferences to AIFF.
See Chapter 5 to find out how to import music with an AIFF encoder.
2. Rip the CD track into iTunes or import an AIFF sound file into iTunes.
Because you set the importing preferences to AIFF, the CD track is
imported into iTunes as AIFF at full quality. You want to do this step
because you’re going to convert it in iTunes, and you need the uncom-
pressed version to convert. Use a song name to identify this track as 
a long track with multiple tracks — for example, call it something like
side one.
296
Part IV: Using Advanced Techniques 

3. Change your importing preferences to AAC or MP3.
See Chapter 19 for more about changing your importing preferences and
converting songs.
4. Select the song in iTunes and then choose File➪Get Info.
The song information dialog appears.
5. Click Options to show the Start Time and Stop Time fields.
You can set the start and stop times for the song (refer to Figure 17-9).
6. Define the Start Time and Stop Time for the first song in the long track
and then click OK.
Play the song and look in the Status pane at the top-center part of the
iTunes window for the Elapsed Time. You can drag the slider in the
Status pane to move quickly through the song and find the exact times
for the start and stop points you want to set. For example, if the first
song is exactly 3 minutes and 12 seconds, define the first section to start
at 0:00 and stop at 3:12. After setting the start and stop times, click OK
to close the song information window.
7. Convert the defined segment of the long track from AIFF to AAC or MP3.
For example, select the long track (side one) and then choose
Advanced➪Convert Selection to AAC (or Advanced➪Convert Selection
to MP3 if you chose the MP3 encoder in Step 3). iTunes converts only
the section of the song defined by the Start Time and Stop Time fields
that you set in Step 6, and creates a new song track in the AAC or MP3
format (depending on your choice in Step 3). iTunes converts the
uncompressed AIFF segment into the compressed AAC or MP3 format.
8. Change the song name of the newly converted track to the actual 
song name.
The converted section of the long track still has the same name (side
one). Change its name by clicking inside the song name in the iTunes
song list or by choosing File➪Get Info, clicking the Info tab, clicking in
the Name field, and entering the new name. You can also enter a track
number in the Track field.
9. Repeat Steps 4–8 for each song segment.
Repeat these steps, selecting the long track (side one) each time and set-
ting a new start and stop time for each new song, converting the song to
MP3 or AAC, and then changing each newly converted song’s name.
10. When you finish, delete the long track in AIFF format.
Delete the long track (side one) by selecting it and pressing
Delete/Backspace. You don’t need it anymore if you converted all the
segments to separate songs.

Decoding Audio Encoding
In This Chapter
 Discovering what MP3, AAC, and Lossless audio encoders do to your music
 Minimizing audio quality tradeoffs when using encoders
 Understanding how encoders use compression
 Choosing the appropriate encoder and import settings
T
he more you discover more about digital audio technology, you find that
you have more decisions to make about your music than you previously
thought. This chapter is here to help you make those decisions. For example,
you might be tempted to trade quality for space, importing music at average-
quality settings that allow you to put more songs on your hard drive and iPod
than if you chose higher-quality settings. This choice might make you happy
today, but what about tomorrow, when iPods and hard drives double or triple
in capacity?
On the other hand, you might be very picky about the sound quality. With an
eye toward future generations of iPods and inexpensive hard drives, maybe
you decide to trade space for quality, importing music at the highest-possible
quality settings and then converting copies to lower-quality, space-saving
versions for iPods and other uses. Of course, you’d need more hard drive
space to accommodate the higher-quality versions.
This chapter explains which music encoding and compression formats to use
for higher quality as well as which ones to use for cramming more songs onto
your hard drive.
Trading Quality for Space
The encoding format and settings that you choose for importing music when
ripping a CD affect sound quality, iPod space, and computer hard drive
space. The format and settings you choose might also affect whether the
music files can play on other types of players and computers.

Audio compression methods best for reducing space have to throw away
information. In technospeak, such compression methods are lossy (the oppo-
site of lossless) compression algorithms. For example, AAC and MP3 encoding
formats compress the sound via lossy methods. Lossy compression algo-
rithms reduce the sound quality by throwing away information to make 
the file smaller, so you lose information and some quality in the process.
Comparatively, the Apple Lossless encoder compresses sound files without
any loss in quality or information, but the resulting file is only a bit smaller
than the uncompressed version. The main reason to use Apple Lossless is 
to maintain quality for burning CDs while also playing the songs on iPods.
Because AIFF and WAV encoders don’t compress the sound, they are the best
choices when burning CDs.
With lossy compression formats, such as MP3 or AAC, the amount of com-
pression depends on the bit rate that you choose as well as the encoding
format and other options. Bit rate determines how many bits (of digital music
information) can travel during playback in a given second. Measured in kilo-
bits per second (Kbps), a higher bit rate (such as 320K) offers higher quality
than a bit rate of 192K because the sound isn’t compressed as much. Thus,
the resulting sound file is larger, taking up more iPod and hard drive space.
Using more compression (a lower bit rate) means that the files are smaller,
but the sound quality is poorer. Using less compression (a higher bit rate)
means that the sound is higher in quality, but the files are larger. Here’s the
deal: You can trade quality for space and have more music of lower quality,
or you can trade space for quality and have less music of higher quality.
Power consumption is also an issue with the iPod when making compression
choices. Playing larger files takes more power because the hard drive inside
the iPod has to refresh its memory buffers frequently to process information
as the song plays. You might even hear hiccups in the sound.
We prefer a higher-quality sound overall, and we typically don’t use the
lower-quality settings for encoders except for voice recordings and music
recorded in ancient times (cough: before 1960). (Older recordings are already
low in quality, so you don’t hear that much of a difference when they’re com-
pressed.) And because we can hear differences in music quality at the higher
compression levels, we just buy another hard drive for storage to accommo-
date larger files.
Choosing an iTunes Encoder
Your iPod music software gives you a choice of encoders. This choice is per-
haps the most important to make before starting to rip music CDs and build-
ing your library. Here, we leapfrog years of technospeak about digital music
file formats and get right to the ones that you need to know.

Part IV: Using Advanced Techniques 

If you’re using MusicMatch Jukebox, visit this book’s companion Web site to
choose an appropriate encoder.
Choose iTunes➪Preferences (Mac) or Edit➪Preferences (Windows), click 
the Advanced tab, and then click the Importing tab to see the Importing 
preferences. You can choose one of five encoders from the Import Using 
pop-up menu:
 AAC: All music purchased from the iTunes Store comes in MPEG-4
Advanced Audio Coding (AAC) format. (MPEG — the Moving Picture
Experts Group — is a committee that recognizes compression standards
for video and audio.) AAC is a higher-quality format than MP3 at the
same bit rate, meaning that AAC at 128 Kbps is higher quality than MP3
at 128 Kbps. We recommend using AAC for most import operations
except when ripping your CDs to burn new audio CDs.
We think the AAC encoder offers the best tradeoff of space and quality
for iPod users. It’s suitable for burning to an audio CD (although not as
good as AIFF or Apple Lossless), and it’s excellent for playing songs on
an iPod or from a hard drive. However, it is not suitable for burning MP3
CDs or for playing songs on players other than iPods.
 AIFF: Audio Interchange File Format is the standard digital format for
uncompressed sound on a Mac, and it provides the highest-quality digi-
tal representation of sound. Similar to a WAV encoder for Windows, an
AIFF encoder uses a platform-specific version of the original Pulse Code
Modulation (PCM) algorithm required for compliance with audio CDs.
Use AIFF if you plan to burn songs onto an audio CD or to edit the songs
with a digital sound-editing program. Mac-based sound-editing programs
import and export AIFF files, and you can edit and save in AIFF format
repeatedly with absolutely no loss in quality. The downside is that AIFF
files take up enormous amounts of hard drive and iPod space — 10MB
per minute — because they’re uncompressed. Don’t use AIFF for songs
that you want to play on an iPod. Use the Apple Lossless encoder, AAC,
or MP3 instead.
 Apple Lossless: The Apple Lossless encoder is a compromise between
the lower-quality encoding of AAC or MP3 (which results in lower file
sizes) and the large file sizes of uncompressed, high-quality AIFF or WAV
audio. The Apple Lossless encoder provides CD-quality sound in a file
size that’s about 60 to 70 percent of the size of an AIFF- or WAV-encoded
file. The virtue of this encoder is that you can use it for songs that you
intend to burn onto audio CDs and for playing on iPods. The files are just
small enough that they don’t hiccup on playback, but they’re still much
larger than their MP3 or AAC counterparts.
301
Chapter 18: Decoding Audio Encoding

Using the Apple Lossless encoder is the most efficient method of storing
the highest-quality versions of your songs. You can burn the songs to CD
without any quality loss and still play them on your iPod. You can’t store
as many songs on your iPod as with AAC or MP3, but the songs that you
do store have the highest-possible quality.
 MP3: The MPEG-1, Layer 3 format (also known as MP3) is supported by
most computers and some CD players. Use the MP3 format for songs
that you intend to use with MP3 players other than your iPod (which
also plays MP3 songs, obviously). Or, use MP3 with applications that
support MP3, or when burning to an MP3 CD. (AIFF, WAV, or Apple
Lossless formats are better for regular audio CDs.) The MP3 format
offers quite a few compression and quality settings, so you can fine-tune
the format, sacrificing hard drive (and iPod) space while improving the
quality. Use MP3 format for a song that you intend to use with MP3 play-
ers, MP3 CDs, and applications that support MP3.
 WAV: Waveform Audio File Format is a digital audio standard that
Windows PCs can understand and manipulate. Like AIFF, WAV is uncom-
pressed and provides the highest-quality digital representation of the
sound. Similar to what the AIFF encoder does for a Mac, a WAV encoder
uses a Windows-specific version of the original PCM algorithm required
for compliance with audio CDs.
Use WAV if you plan to burn a song to an audio CD or use the song with
Windows-based digital sound-editing programs, which import and
export WAV files. (AIFF and WAV files are the same except that AIFF
works with Mac applications, and WAV works with Windows applica-
tions.) WAV files take up enormous amounts of hard drive and iPod
space — 10MB per minute — because they’re uncompressed. Don’t use
WAV for songs that you want to play on an iPod: Use the Apple Lossless
encoder, AAC, or MP3 instead.
If you want to share your music with someone who uses an MP3 player other
than an iPod, you can import or convert songs with an MP3 encoder. As an
iPod user, you can use the higher-quality AAC encoder to produce files that
are either the same size as their MP3 counterparts but higher in quality, or
the same quality but smaller in size.
For the best possible quality, consider not using compression at all (like with
AIFF or WAV) or using Apple Lossless. You can import music at the highest
quality, burn it to audio CDs, and then convert it to a lesser-quality format for
use on an iPod or other devices. If you use Apple Lossless for songs, you can
use those songs on an iPod, but they take up much more space than AAC- or
MP3-encoded songs. We describe how to convert music in Chapter 19.

Chapter 18: Decoding Audio Encoding
The past, present, and future of music
Our suggestions for encoder choice and import-
ing preferences for ripping CDs are mostly sub-
jective. Your listening pleasure depends entirely
on your taste and how the song was recorded.
Some people can hear qualitative differences
that others don’t hear or don’t care about. Some
people can also tolerate a lower-quality sound
in exchange for the convenience of carrying
more music on their iPods. And sometimes the
recording is so primitive sounding that you can
get away with using lower-quality settings to
save more hard drive space.
Formats for recording sound have changed
considerably from brittle 78 rpm records of the
early 1900s and the scratchy 45 rpm and 33 rpm
records of the mid-1900s to today’s CDs.
Consumers had to be on the alert then, as you
do now, for formats that die off as better ones
come along. Think of the ill-fated 8-track car-
tridge or the legendary quadraphonic LP. You
want your digital music to last forever yet still
play at high quality — and not get stuck with
technology that doesn’t evolve with the times.
Digital music has evolved beyond the commer-
cial audio CD, and computers haven’t yet
caught up to some of the latest audio formats.
For example, iTunes can’t yet import sound from
these formats:
 DVD-audio: DVD-audio is a relatively new
digital audio format developed from the
DVD video format. DVD-audio is based on
PCM recording technology but offers
improved sound quality. Neither iTunes nor
MusicMatch Jukebox support the DVD-
audio format, but you can import a digital
video file containing DVD-audio sound into
iMovie, extract the sound, and export the
sound in AIFF or WAV format, which you
can use with iTunes. You can also use Toast
8 Titanium from Roxio (www.roxio.com)
to import and burn DVD-audio. You can
maintain its sampling frequency of 48 kHz
(which is higher than the 44.1 kHz sampling
rate of audio CDs) by setting the Sample
Rate pop-up menu in the custom settings
for AIFF or WAV to 48.0 kHz.
 Super Audio CD (SACD): Super Audio CD is
a new format developed from the past audio
format for CDs. The SACD format is based
on Direct Stream Digital (DSD) recording
technology that closely reproduces the
shape of the original analog waveforms to
produce a more natural, higher-quality
sound. Originally developed for the digital
archiving of priceless analog masters
tapes, DSD is based on 1-bit, sigma-delta
modulation and operates with a sampling
frequency of 2.8224 MHz (64 times the 44.1
kHz used in audio CDs). Philips and Sony
adopted DSD as the basis for SACD, and the
format is growing in popularity among
audiophiles. However, neither iTunes nor
MusicMatch Jukebox supports SACD. If
you buy music in the SACD format, choose
the hybrid format that offers a conventional
CD layer and a high-density SACD layer. You
can then import the music from the conven-
tional CD layer.
You might also want to take advantage of the
compression technology that squeezes more
music onto your iPod. Although the Apple-
supported AAC format offers far better com-
pression and quality than MP3 format (at the
same bit rates), the MP3 format is used more,
supported by other players and software pro-
grams as well as iPods and iTunes. Sticking with
AAC or Apple Lossless as your encoder might
make you feel like your songs are stuck inside
iTunes with the MP3 blues again. However, with
iTunes and your iPod, you can mix and match
these formats as you please.

Manic Compression Has 
Captured Your Song
Every person hears the effects of compression differently. You might not hear
any problem with a compressed song that someone else says is tinny or lack-
ing in depth.
Too much compression can be a bad thing. Further compressing an already-
compressed music file — say, by converting a song — reduces the quality 
significantly. Not only that, but after your song is compressed, you can’t
uncompress the song to its original quality. Your song is essentially locked
into that quality, at best.
The lossy-style compression of the MP3 and AAC formats loses information
each time you use it, which means that if you compress something already
compressed, you lose even more information. This is bad. Don’t compress
something that’s already compressed from a lossy method.
The Apple Lossless encoder doesn’t use a lossy method, which is why it’s
called lossless — information is not thrown away. While Lossless compresses
to about 60–70 percent of the original sound file, that’s not enough of a reduc-
tion in space for most people; MP3 and AAC compress sound files to about 10
percent of the original size.
MP3 and AAC use two basic lossy methods to compress audio:
 Removing non-audible frequencies: The compression removes what
you supposedly can’t hear (although this subject is up for debate). For
example, if a background singer’s warble is totally drowned out by the
intensity of a rhythm guitar chord, the compression algorithm loses the
singer’s sound while maintaining the guitar’s sound.
 Removing less important signals: Within the spectrum of sound fre-
quencies, some frequencies are considered to be less important in 
terms of rendering fidelity, and most people can’t hear some frequen-
cies. Removing specific frequencies is likely to be less damaging to your
music than other types of compression, depending on how you hear
things. In fact, your dog might stop getting agitated at songs that contain
ultra-high frequencies that only dogs can hear (such as the ending of
“Day in the Life” by The Beatles).
Selecting Import Settings
AAC and MP3 formats compress sound at different quality settings. iTunes
lets you set the bit rate for importing, which determines the audio quality.
304
Part IV: Using Advanced Techniques 

You need to use a higher bit rate (such as 192 Kbps or 320 Kbps) for higher
quality, which — all together now! — increases the file size.
Variable Bit Rate (VBR) encoding is a technique that varies the number of bits
used to store the music, depending on the complexity of the sound. Although
the quality of VBR is endlessly debated, it’s useful when set to the highest
setting because VBR can encode at up to the maximum bit rate of 320 Kbps in
those rare cases where the sound requires it, but it keeps the majority of the
sound at a lower bit rate.
iTunes also lets you control the sample rate during importing, which is the
number of times per second the sound waveform is captured digitally (sam-
pled). Higher sample rates yield higher-quality sound and large file sizes.
However, never use a higher sample rate than the rate used for the source.
CDs use a 44.100 kHz rate, so choosing a higher rate is unnecessary unless
you convert a song that was recorded from Digital Audio Tape (DAT), DVD, or
directly onto the computer at a high sample rate, and you want to keep that
sample rate.
Another setting to consider during importing is the Channel choice. Stereo,
which offers two channels of music for left and right speakers, is the norm for
music. However, mono — monaural or single-channel — was the norm for
pop records before the mid-1960s. (Phil Spector was known for his high-
quality monaural recordings. And early Rolling Stones records are also
recorded in mono.) Monaural recordings take up half the space of stereo
recordings when digitized. Most likely, you want to keep stereo recordings 
in stereo and mono recordings in mono.

Changing Encoders and 
Encoder Settings
In This Chapter
 Changing settings for the encoders in iTunes
 Changing your importing preferences in iTunes
 Converting songs to a different encoding format in iTunes
You might want to change your import settings before ripping CDs
depending on the type of music, the source of the recording, or other
factors, such as whether you plan to copy the songs to your iPod or burn an
audio or MP3 CD. Encoders offer general quality settings, but you can also
customize encoders and change those settings to your liking. Whether you
use iTunes or MusicMatch Jukebox, the software remembers your custom
settings until you change them again.
If you’re using MusicMatch Jukebox, visit this book’s companion Web site to
find out what type of encoders it offers.
This chapter provides the nuts and bolts for changing your import settings to
customize each type of encoder, importing sounds other than music, and con-
verting songs from one format to another. With the choice of settings for music
encoders, you can impress your audiophile friends — even those who doubted
that your computer could reproduce such magnificent-sounding music.
You can also convert songs to another format, as we describe in the later sec-
tion, “Converting Songs to a Different Encoder Format in iTunes.” However,
you can’t convert copy-protected songs that you buy from the iTunes Store
to another file format because they’re encoded as protected AAC files. (If you
could, they wouldn’t be protected, would they?) You can convert and share
the unprotected AAC music available in the iTunes Plus section of the store
(as we describe in Chapter 7), but if you convert a compressed song into
another compression format you will lose audio quality, as we describe in
Chapter 18. You also can’t convert Audible audio books and spoken-word
content to another format; you can burn them to an audio CD and re-import
them, but that might cause a noticeable drop in quality.

Customizing the Encoder 
Settings in iTunes
To change your encoder settings, quality settings, and other importing 
preferences before ripping an audio CD or converting a file in iTunes, follow
these steps:
1. Choose iTunes➪Preferences (Mac) or Edit➪Preferences (Windows),
click the Advanced tab, and then click the Importing tab.
The Importing preferences appear, allowing you to make changes to the
encoding format and its settings.
2. From the Import Using pop-up menu, choose the encoding format that
you want to convert the song into and then select the settings for that
format.
The Setting pop-up menu will differ depending on your choice of
encoder from the Import Using pop-up menu. See the sections on each
encoding format later in this chapter for details on settings.
3. Click OK to accept changes.
After changing your importing preferences — and until you change 
them again — iTunes uses these preferences whenever it imports or
converts songs.
AAC, MP3, AIFF, and WAV encoders let you customize the settings. The Apple
Lossless encoder is automatic and offers no custom settings.
Changing AAC encoder settings
We recommend using the AAC encoder for most types of music — except
songs that you intend to burn to an audio CD or an MP3 CD — because AAC
offers the best trade-off of space for hard drives and iPods as well as quality.
The Setting pop-up menu for the AAC encoder offers four choices: High
Quality (128 kbps), Higher Quality (256 kbps), Spoken Podcast, and Custom,
as shown in Figure 19-1. The Spoken Podcast setting is useful for converting
podcasts exported from GarageBand (or a similar audio-editing application)
into iTunes. We recommend using the Higher Quality setting for most music
you rip from CDs. For very intense music (such as complex jazz or classical
music, recordings with lots of instruments, or your most favorite songs), you
might want to fine-tune the settings. To customize your AAC encoder set-
tings, choose Custom from the Setting pop-up menu to see the AAC Encoder
dialog, as shown in Figure 19-2.
308
Part IV: Using Advanced Techniques 

The custom settings for AAC (see Figure 19-2) allow you to change the following:
 Stereo Bit Rate: This pop-up menu allows you to select the bit rate,
which is measured in kilobits per second (Kbps). Using a higher bit rate
gives you higher quality but also increases file size. The highest-quality
setting for this format is 320 Kbps; 256 Kbps, considered higher quality,
is the bit rate for the unprotected songs that Apple provides in its
iTunes Plus store.
 Sample Rate: This pop-up menu enables you to select the sample rate,
which is the number of times per second that the sound waveform is
captured digitally (sampled). Higher sample rates yield higher-quality
sound and larger file sizes. However, never use a higher sample rate 
than the rate used for the source. CDs use a 44.1 kilohertz (kHz) rate.
 Use Variable Bit Rate Encoding (VBR): This option helps keep down file
size, but quality might be affected. VBR varies the number of bits used 
to store the music depending on the complexity of the sound. iTunes
encodes up to the maximum bit rate of 320 Kbps in sections of songs
Figure 19-1:

309
Chapter 19: Changing Encoders and Encoder Settings

where the sound is complex enough to require a high bit rate. Meanwhile,
iTunes keeps the rest of the song at a lower bit rate to save file space.
The lower limit is set by the rate that you choose from the Stereo Bit Rate
pop-up menu. If you chose the VBR option, the highest rate you can set
(which is the lower limit of VBR) is 256 Kbps, and other rates that don’t
work with VBR are grayed out.
 Channels: From this pop-up menu, you can choose how you want music
to play through the speakers: in stereo or in mono. Stereo, which offers
two channels of music for left and right speakers, is the standard for
music. Monaural (mono) offers only one channel but takes up half the
space of stereo recordings when digitized. If the recording is in stereo,
don’t choose mono because you lose part of the sound. (You might lose
vocals or guitar riffs, depending on the recording.) Select Auto to have
iTunes use the appropriate setting for the music.
 Optimize for Voice: This option filters the sound to favor the human
voice. Podcasters can use this option, along with the AAC encoder, to
convert audio recordings into a podcast format optimal for iTunes.
We recommend choosing the highest bit rate (320 Kbps) from the Stereo Bit
Rate pop-up menu, leaving VBR off, and leaving the other two pop-up menus
set to Auto.
Changing MP3 encoder settings
We prefer using AAC encoding for music that we play on our iPods, but as of
this writing, many MP3 players don’t support AAC. The iPod supports both
AAC and MP3 formats. You might want to use MP3 encoding for other rea-
sons, such as acquiring more control over the compression parameters and
gaining compatibility with other applications and players that support MP3.

310
Part IV: Using Advanced Techniques 

The MP3 encoder offers four choices for the Setting pop-up menu on the
Importing preferences tab:
 Good Quality (128 Kbps): This bit rate is certainly fine for audio books,
comedy records, and scratchy records. You might even want to use a
lower bit rate for voice recordings.
 High Quality (160 Kbps): Most people consider this bit rate high enough
for most popular music, but we go higher for our music.
 Higher Quality (192 Kbps): This bit rate is high enough for just about all
types of music.
 Custom: To fine-tune MP3 encoder settings, select the Custom setting.
Customizing your MP3 settings increases the sound quality and keeps
the file size small.
The MP3 encoder offers many choices in its custom settings dialog (see
Figure 19-3).
 Stereo Bit Rate: This pop-up’s menu choices are measured in Kbps.
Choosing a higher bit rate gives you higher quality but also increases file
size. The most common bit rate for MP3 files that you find on the Web is
128 Kbps. Lower bit rates are more appropriate for voice recordings or
sound effects.
We recommend at least 192 Kbps for most music. We use 320 Kbps, the
maximum setting, for songs that we play on our iPods.
 Use Variable Bit Rate Encoding (VBR): This option helps keep down file
size, but quality might be affected. VBR varies the number of bits used
to store the music depending on the complexity of the sound. For MP3,
the VBR option includes a Quality pop-up menu right below the option.
Figure 19-3:
Customize
the settings
for the MP3
encoder.
311
Chapter 19: Changing Encoders and Encoder Settings

If you choose Highest from the Quality pop-up menu for VBR, iTunes
encodes up to the maximum bit rate of 320 Kbps in sections of 
songs where the sound is complex enough to require a high bit rate.
Meanwhile, iTunes keeps the rest of the song at a lower bit rate to save
file space. The lower limit is set by the rate that you choose from the
Stereo Bit Rate pop-up menu.
Some audiophiles swear by VBR, but others don’t ever use it. We use 
it only when importing at low bit rates, and we set VBR to its highest-
quality setting.
Your iPod can play VBR-encoded MP3 music, but other MP3 players
might not support VBR.
 Sample Rate: From this pop-up menu, you can choose the sample rate
(how many times per second the sound waveform is captured digitally).
Higher sample rates yield higher-quality sound and larger file sizes.
However, never use a higher sample rate than the rate used for the
source: For example, CDs use a 44.1 kHz rate.
 Channels: From this pop-up menu, choose how you want music to 
play through the speakers: in stereo or in mono. Stereo, which offers 
two channels of music for left and right speakers, is the standard for
music. Mono recordings take up half the space of stereo recordings
when digitized. Choose Auto to have iTunes use the appropriate 
setting for the music.
 Stereo Mode: From this pop-up menu, choose Normal or Joint Stereo.
Normal mode is just what you think it is — normal stereo. Choose the
Joint Stereo setting to make the file smaller by removing information
that’s identical in both channels of a stereo recording, using only one
channel for that information while the other channel carries unique
information. At bit rates of 128 Kbps and lower, this mode can actually
improve the sound quality. However, we typically don’t use Joint Stereo
mode when using a high-quality bit rate.
 Smart Encoding Adjustments: Selecting this option tells iTunes to ana-
lyze your MP3 encoding settings and music source, changing your set-
tings as needed to maximize the quality of the encoded files.
 Filter Frequencies Below 10 Hz: Selecting this option filters low fre-
quencies. Frequencies lower than 10 hertz (Hz) are difficult to hear, 
and most people don’t notice that they’re missing. Filtering inaudible 
frequencies helps reduce the file size with little or no perceived loss in
quality. However, we think that selecting this option and removing the
low-frequencies detracts from the overall feeling of the music; thus, we
prefer not to filter frequencies.
312
Part IV: Using Advanced Techniques 

Changing AIFF, WAV, and Apple 
Lossless encoder settings
We recommend using AIFF, WAV, or Apple Lossless encoders for songs from
audio CDs that you intend to burn. You get the best possible quality with
these encoders because the music isn’t compressed with a lossy algorithm.
The Apple Lossless encoder (which is automatic and offers no settings to
change) reduces the file size to about 60 to 70 percent of the AIFF or WAV 
versions. However, AIFF or WAV files are preferable for use with digital sound-
editing programs, and they offer settings that you can change, such as the
number of channels (stereo or mono) and the sampling rate.
Although AIFF and WAV formats have technical differences, here’s the only
major difference in storing and playing music: AIFF is the standard for Macs
and their applications, and WAV is the standard for PCs and their applications.
You can import music with an AIFF or a WAV encoder at the highest-possible
quality and then convert the music files to a lesser-quality format for use on
your iPod.
AIFF- and WAV-encoded files take up huge amounts of hard drive space
(about 10MB per minute). Although you can play these file types on an iPod,
they take up way too much space and battery power to be convenient for
anyone but the most discerning audiophile who can afford multiple iPods.
You can handle these large files by adding another hard drive or by backing
up portions of your music library onto other media, such as DVD-R (which
can hold 4.38GB). The high quality of AIFF- and WAV-encoded files ensures an
excellent listening experience through a home stereo. However, if multiple
hard drives and backup scenarios sound like unwanted hassles, use AAC 
or MP3 encoding to compress files so that they take up less space on your
hard drive.
The AIFF and WAV encoder dialogs offer similar custom settings; the AIFF
Encoder dialog is shown in Figure 19-4. The pop-up menus offer settings for
Sample Rate, Sample Size, and Channels. If you choose Auto for all three,
iTunes automatically detects the proper sample rate, size, and channels 
from the source. If you choose a specific setting — such as Stereo, from the
Channels pop-up menu — iTunes imports the music in stereo, regardless of
the source. Audio CDs typically sample at a rate of 44.1 kHz, with a sample
size of 16 bits, and with stereo channels.
The Sample Rate pop-up menu for AIFF and WAV encoders offers more
choices than AAC, down to a very low sample rate of 8 kHz, which is suitable
only for voice recordings.
313
Chapter 19: Changing Encoders and Encoder Settings

Importing Voice and Sound 
Effects in iTunes
Audio books from Audible (www.audible.com) and from the iTunes Store
are available in a special format that doesn’t require any further compres-
sion. However, you can also import audio books, spoken-word titles, comedy
CDs, and other voice recordings in MP3 format.
If the recording has any music or requires close listening to stereo channels
(such as a Firesign Theatre or Monty Python CD), treat the entire recording
as music and skip this section. (“Nudge, nudge. Wink, wink. Sorry! Everything
you know is wrong!”)
By fine-tuning the import settings for voice recordings and sound effects, you
can save a significant amount of space without reducing quality. We recom-
mend the following settings, depending on your choice of encoder:
 AAC: AAC allows you to get away with an even lower bit rate than MP3
to achieve the same quality, thereby saving more space. We recommend
using a bit rate as low as 80 Kbps for sound effects and voice recordings.
Use the Optimize for Voice option to filter the sound to favor the human
voice.
 MP3: Use a low bit rate (such as 96 Kbps). You might also want to reduce
the sample rate to 22.05 kHz for voice recordings. Filter frequencies lower
than 10 Hz because voice recordings don’t need such frequencies.

Converting Songs to a Different 
Encoder Format in iTunes
Converting a song from one format to another is useful if you want to use 
one format for one purpose (such as burning the song to a CD) and a second
format for another task (such as playing the song on your iPod). Changing
formats is also useful for converting uncompressed songs or podcasts that
were created in GarageBand (or a similar audio-editing application) and
exported or copied to iTunes.
Converting a song from one compressed format to another is possible (say,
from AAC to MP3), but you might not like the results. When you convert a
compressed file to another compressed format, you are compressing further
an already-compressed file, reducing the quality of the sound. You get the best
results by starting with an uncompressed song that was imported in AIFF or
WAV format and then converting that song to compressed AAC or MP3 format.
You can tell the format of a song by selecting it, choosing File➪Get Info, and
then clicking the Summary tab. You might want to keep track of formats by
creating version-specific playlists — say, a CD-AIFF–version playlist and an
iPod-MP3–version playlist.
To convert a song to a different encoding format, follow these steps:
1. Choose iTunes➪Preferences (Mac) or Edit➪Preferences (Windows),
click the Advanced tab, and then click the Importing tab.
The Importing preferences appear, allowing you to make changes to the
encoding format and its settings.
2. From the Import Using pop-up menu, choose the encoding format into
which that you want to convert the song.
3. In the Custom Settings dialog that appears, select the settings for that
encoder.
For example, if you’re converting songs in the AIFF format to the MP3
format, choose MP3 Encoder from the Import Using pop-up menu and then
select the settings that you want in the MP3 Encoder dialog that appears.
4. Click OK to accept the settings for your chosen format.
5. In the iTunes window, select the song(s) that you want to convert and
then choose Advanced➪Convert Selection to encoder.
The encoding format that you choose in Step 2 (MP3, AAC, AIFF,
Lossless, or WAV) appears in place of encoder on the menu.
When the conversion is complete, a new version of the song appears in
your iTunes library (with the same artist and song name, so it’s easy to
find). iTunes doesn’t delete the original version — both are stored in
your music library.

If you convert songs obtained from the Internet, you might find MP3 songs
with bit rates as low as 128 Kbps. Choosing a higher stereo bit rate doesn’t
improve the quality — it only wastes space.
The automatic copy-and-convert operation can be useful for converting an
entire music library to another format. Press Option (Mac) or Alt (Windows)
and choose Advanced➪Convert Selection to encoder. All the songs copy and
convert automatically. If you have a library of AIFF tunes, you can quickly
copy and convert them to AAC or MP3 in one step and then assign the AIFF
songs to the AIFF-associated playlists for burning CDs, and MP3 or AAC songs
to MP3 or AAC playlists that you intend to copy to your iPod.

You can truly go anywhere with an iPod. If you can’t plug your iPod into a
power source while it’s playing, you can use the battery for quite a while
before having to recharge. You can find all the accessories that you need to
travel with an iPod in the Apple Store at www.apple.com.
Put on “Eight Miles High” by the Byrds while cruising in a plane at 40,000 feet.
Watch the “Lust for Life” music video by Iggy Pop on a bus heading out of
Detroit. Ride the rails listening to “All Aboard” by Muddy Waters, followed by
“Peavine” by John Lee Hooker. Or cruise on the Autobahn in Germany with
Kraftwerk. The iPod provides high-quality sound and excellent picture quality
no matter how turbulent the environment.
In addition to their hard drives, iPods use a memory cache. The cache is
made up of solid-state memory, with no mechanical or moving parts, so
movement doesn’t affect playback. The iPod plays sound from the memory
cache rather than the hard drive. The iPod nano and iPod shuffle are entirely
solid-state memory, which completely eliminates skipping. With skip protec-
tion, you don’t have to worry about tremors, potholes, or strenuous exercise
causing the audio to skip. Skip protection works by preloading up to 20 min-
utes of sound to the cache at a time (depending on the iPod model).

Connecting Headphones 
and Portable Speakers
Apple designed the iPod to provide excellent sound through headphones.
From the headphone/line-out connection, though, the iPod can also play
music through portable speaker systems. The speaker systems must be self-
powered or able to work with very little power (like headphones) and allow
audio to be input via a 3.5mm, stereo mini-plug connection.
The iPod includes a small amplifier powerful enough to deliver audio through
the headphone/line-out connection. All current models, including the iPod
shuffle, have a frequency response of 20 to 20,000 Hz (hertz), which provides
distortion-free music at the lowest or highest pitches. (In this case, Hertz 
has nothing to do with rental cars. A hertz is a unit of frequency equal to 
one cycle per second.) At pitches that produce frequencies of 20 cycles per
second or 20,000 cycles per second, the iPod responds with distortion-free
sound.
If headphones aren’t your thing, you can even wear an iPod shuffle inside a
headband (and keep it relatively dry no matter how much you, um, create
your own moisture). Thanko (www.thanko.jp) offers the Vonia sports head-
band that uses bone conduction — a hearing aid technology that conducts
“Good Vibrations” through the bones of your skull, directly into your inner
ear. The sound can be surprisingly clear and crisp although it won’t be in
stereo because the sound seems to come from inside your head.
Portable speaker systems typically include built-in amplifiers and a volume
control, and they offer a stereo mini-plug that you can attach directly to the
iPod headphone/line-out connection or to the dock headphone/line-out con-
nection. To place the external speakers farther away from the iPod, use a
stereo mini-plug extension cable, which are available at most consumer elec-
tronics stores. These cables have a stereo mini-plug on one end and a stereo
mini-socket on the other.
Portable speaker systems typically have volume controls. Set your iPod
volume to half and then raise or lower the volume of your speaker system.
When you travel, take an extra pair of headphones (or earbuds) and a splitter
cable, which are available in any consumer electronics store. The Monster
iSplitter is available in the Apple Store. That way, you can share music with
someone on the road.
320
Part V: Have iPod, Will Travel 

Portable speaker systems, such as the iBoom from DLO (www.dlo.com), and
the Bose iPod Speaker Dock (www.bose.com), provide a dock connection 
for playing audio. For a portable stereo system that offers big sound on a
rechargeable battery and is perfect for environments like the beach or a boat,
check out the i-Fusion from Sonic Impact (www.si-technologies.com).
(See Figure 20-1.) It includes universal adapters for all dockable iPod models
and an audio input connection for connecting your computer or an audio
player. The double-duty case is a durable cover that acts as a speaker cabinet
to give the speakers better bass response.
Playing Car Tunes
We always wanted a car that we could fill up with music just as easily as fill-
ing it up with gasoline, without having to carry dozens of cassettes or CDs.
With an iPod, an auto-charger to save on battery power, and a way to connect
the iPod to your car’s stereo system, you’re ready to pump music. (Start your
engine and queue up “Getting in Tune” and then “Going Mobile” by The Who.)
You can even go one step further and get a new BMW, Toyota, or similarly
equipped car that offers an iPod dock cable installed and integrated into the
car’s stereo system so that you can control the iPod from your car stereo —
including controls on the steering wheel.

Chapter 20: Going Mobile

Here’s how to link your iPod to a car stereo:
 Buy a car that offers an iPod-ready stereo. BMW, Mercedes-Benz,
Toyota, Honda, and many other auto companies offer models that are
iPod ready.
 Use your cassette player. Use a standard cassette adapter and an iPod
power adapter for your car’s lighter socket. This method works even
with rental cars (as long as they’re supplied with cassette players). For a
semi-permanent installation, you can add a car mount to keep your iPod
secure. Cassette adapters offer medium quality that’s usually better than
wireless adapters.
 Use your radio and a wireless adapter. Use a wireless adapter that
plays your iPod as if it were a station on your FM radio dial. Some car
mounts offer built-in wireless adapters. This might be your only inexpen-
sive choice if you don’t have a cassette deck. Note: Wireless adapters
might not work well in cities where FM stations crowd the radio dial.
 Install an iPod interface. Install an iPod interface for your car stereo
that offers high-quality, line-in audio input and power. After you install
this interface, thread the iPod cable into the glove box so that you can
plug the cable into your iPod, hide the iPod in the glove box, and control
the iPod from your car stereo’s head unit. This method offers the best
sound quality. As of this writing, Toyota is rolling out an integration kit
for plugging an iPod into the car glove box and using either the steering
wheel or usual audio system controls.
Unfortunately, not many car stereos offer a mini-socket for audio input. As 
of this writing, the few accessories that integrate directly with car stereos
require custom car installations. Most connection standards are based on
specific car models or stereo models. But stay iTuned, though, because stan-
dard car docks are on the horizon.
Using cassette and power 
adapters for your car
Until you get an iPod-ready car, a car stereo with a mini-socket for stereo
audio input (also called stereo-in connection), or an iPod connection — or get
one installed — you can use a cassette-player adapter to connect with your
car stereo or a wireless device. We describe wireless connectivity later in 
the section, “Connecting by Wireless Radio.” These solutions provide lower
sound quality than iPod interface installations or stereo-in connections but
are inexpensive and work with most cars.
322
Part V: Have iPod, Will Travel 

Many car stereos have a cassette player, and you can buy a cassette adapter
from most consumer electronics stores or from the Apple Store (such as the
Sony CPA-9C Car Cassette Adapter). The cassette-player adapter looks like a
tape cassette with a mini-plug cable (which sticks out through the slot when
you’re using the adapter).
You can connect the mini-plug cable directly to the iPod, to the auto-charger
if a mini-socket is offered, or to the Apple Remote that in turn is connected to
the iPod. Then insert the adapter into the cassette player, being careful not to
get the cable tangled up inside the player.
One inherent problem with this approach is that the cable that dangles from
your cassette player looks unsightly. You also might have some trouble eject-
ing the adapter if the cable gets wedged in the cassette player door. Overall,
though, this method is the best for most cars because it provides the best
sound quality.
Although some new vehicles (particularly SUVs and cars such as the Toyota
Matrix mini-station wagon) offer 110-volt power outlets you can use with your
Apple-supplied battery charger, most cars offer only a lighter/power socket
that requires a power adapter to use with your iPod. Be careful to pick the
right type of power adapter for your car’s lighter/power socket.
Belkin (www.belkin.com) offers the Auto Kit for $49.95, and it includes a car
power adapter with a convenient socket for a stereo mini-plug cable (which
can connect directly to a car stereo if the stereo has a mini-socket for audio
input). The adapter includes a volume-adjustable amplifier to boost the
sound coming from the iPod before it goes into the cassette adapter or car
stereo.
Even with a cassette adapter and power adapter, you have at best a clumsy
solution that uses one cable (power) from a power adapter to the iPod and
another cable (audio) to your car stereo cassette adapter. Attached to these
wires, your iPod needs a secure place to sit while your car moves because
you don’t want it bouncing around.
You can fit your iPod securely in position in a car without getting a custom
installation. The TuneDok ($29.95) from Belkin (www.belkin.com) holds
your iPod securely and fits into your car’s cup-holder. The TuneDok ratchet-
ing neck and height-adjustment feature lets you reposition the iPod to your
liking. The cable-management clip eliminates loose and tangled cables, and
the large and small rubber base and cup fits most cup holders.
MARWARE (www.marware.com) offers an inexpensive solution for both car
use and personal use. The $5.95 Car Holder, available when you select a MAR-
WARE Sportsuit case, attaches to the dashboard of your car and lets you
attach an iPod that’s wearing one of the MARWARE Sportsuit covering cases.
(See “Dressing Up Your iPod for Travel,” later in this chapter.) The clip on the
back attaches to the Car Holder.
323
Chapter 20: Going Mobile

ProClip (www.proclipusa.com) offers mounting brackets for clip-on
devices. The brackets attach to the dashboard and can be installed in sec-
onds. After you install the bracket, you can use different custom holders for
the iPod models or for cell phones and other portable devices.
Integrating an iPod with your car stereo
Premium car manufacturers are introducing cars that are iPod-ready: includ-
ing an iPod interface for the car stereo system. For example, BMW offers 
such a model with audio controls on the steering wheel. Mercedes-Benz,
Volvo, Mini-Cooper, Nissan, Alfa Romeo, and Ferrari all also offer iPod-ready
models. In addition, car stereo manufacturers (such as Alpine and Clarion)
offer car audio systems with integrated iPod interfaces; see Figure 20-2. Many
of these installations use the multiple CD changer interface of the car stereo
for attaching separate CD changer units, substituting the iPod for the CD
changer unit.
Figure 20-2:

324
Part V: Have iPod, Will Travel 

If you can’t afford an iPod-ready car, you can opt for a custom installation of
an iPod interface for your existing car stereo and car power (such as using a
custom cable interface for a CD changer, which a skilled car audio specialist
can install into your dashboard). For example, you can order a professional
installation with the Dension ICE-Link, which adds line-level audio output and
recharging capability to almost any vehicle. It uses the CD-changer connec-
tions in car CD players to directly connect your iPod into the car’s audio
system. Dension (www.dension.com) assumes that the buyer is a profes-
sional installer. Although you can install it yourself (especially if you already
have a CD changer unit in your trunk), most installations require taking apart
the dashboard and installing the ICE-Link behind your CD stereo. ICE-Link can
be combined with almost any iPod mount.
If your car stereo doesn’t offer a CD changer interface, you might want to
have a new car stereo professionally installed that offers a CD changer inter-
face or iPod capability — such as the Alpine CDA-9887 (www.alpine-usa.
com/driveyouripod). With an integrated iPod setup, you can control the
iPod from the car stereo’s head unit or steering wheel controls. The car
stereo provides power to the iPod to keep it fully charged.
Connecting by Wireless Radio
A wireless music adapter lets you play music from your iPod on an FM radio
with no connection or cable although the sound quality might suffer a bit
from interference. We always take a wireless adapter with us whenever we
rent a car because even if a rental car has no cassette player (ruling out the
use of our cassette adapter), it probably has an FM radio.
You can use a wireless adapter in a car, on a boat, on the beach with a
portable radio, or even in your home with a stereo system and tuner. We even
use it in hotel rooms with a clock radio.
To use a wireless adapter, follow these steps:
1. Set the wireless adapter to an unused FM radio frequency.
Some adapters offer only one frequency (typically 87.9 MHz). Others
offer you a choice of several frequencies: typically 88.1, 88.3, 88.5, and
88.7 MHz. Some even let you pick any FM frequency. If given a choice,
choose the frequency and set the adapter according to its instructions.
Avoid FM stations at specific frequencies that would interfere with your
iPod signal.
325
Chapter 20: Going Mobile

2. Connect the wireless adapter to the iPod headphone/line-out connec-
tor or to the line-out connector on the iPod dock.
The wireless adapter acts like a miniature radio station, broadcasting to
a nearby FM radio. (Sorry, you can’t go much farther than a few feet, so
no one else can hear your Wolfman Jack impersonation.)
3. Tune to the appropriate frequency on the FM dial.
Tune any nearby radio to the same FM frequency that you choose in
Step 1.
You need to set the adapter close enough to the radio’s antenna to work,
making it impractical for home stereos. You can get better quality sound by
connecting to a home stereo with a cable.
Don’t be surprised if the wireless adapter doesn’t work as well in cities
because other radio stations might cause too much interference.
Here are a few wireless adapters that we recommend:
 TRAFFICJamz ($34.99) from Newer Technology (www.newertech.com)
is both a charger and a transmitter that works with all model iPods.
 iTrip ($49.95) from Griffin Technology
(www.griffintechnology.com) offers selectable LX or DX modes of
broadcasting. Even in large cities with lots of radio stations crowding the
dial, iTrip DX Mode delivers a background noise level below that of a
cassette tape adapter.
 TuneCast II Mobile FM Transmitter ($39.99) from Belkin (www.belkin.
com) is particularly convenient in a car because it includes a 14-inch
cable that delivers power when used with the Belkin Mobile Power Cord
for iPod. That way, you can preserve your batteries for when you’re not
near an alternate source. It offers four programmable memory slots for
saving the clearest radio frequency wherever you go.
 Monster iCarPlay Wireless ($69.95) from Monster Cable (www.monster
cable.com) offers a power adapter as well as excellent quality playback
for a wireless radio unit. You can select radio frequencies of 88.1, 88.3,
88.5, 88.7, 88.9, 89.1, 89.3, or 89.5 MHz. Although a bit more expensive,
we prefer it for its sound quality.
 DLO TransPod FM ($49.99) from Digital Lifestyle Outfitters (www.dlo.
com) is an excellent all-in-one wireless FM transmitter, mounting system,
and power adapter for using your iPod in a car. It also costs less than
purchasing all three items separately.

Dressing Up Your iPod for Travel
The simple protective carrying case supplied with some iPod models is just
not as stylin’ as the myriad accessories that you can get for dressing up your
iPod for travel. You can find different types of protective gear, from leather
jackets to aluminum cases, in many different styles and colors. Apple offers
access to hundreds of products from other suppliers on its accessories pages
(www.apple.com/ipod/accessories.html). Some are designed primarily
for protecting your iPod from harm; others are designed to provide some
measure of protection while also providing access to controls.
On the extreme end of the spectrum are hardened cases that are ready for
battlefields in deserts or jungles — the Humvees of iPod protective gear, if
you will. Matias Armor ($39.95) by Matias Corporation (http://matias.
ca/armor) is a sturdy case that fits all iPod models and offers possibly the
best protection against physical trauma on the market. Your iPod rests within
a hard, resilient metal exoskeleton that can withstand the abuse of bouncing
down a flight of metal stairs without letting your iPod pop out. Of course, the
very same feature that prevents your iPod from popping out also makes the
iPod Armor difficult to open to get access to your iPod. This is not a case to
use while listening to music.
Business travelers can combine personal items into one carrying case. The
iPod Leather Organizer (about $15) from Belkin (www.belkin.com) is made
from fine-grain leather that even Ricardo Montalban would rave about. The
case holds personal essentials, such as business and credit cards, in four
convenient slots. A handy mesh pocket keeps earphones easily accessible,
and a billfold holds money and receipts.
On the sporty side, MARWARE (www.marware.com) offers the Sportsuit
Convertible case ($34.95) with a patented belt-clip system, offering inter-
changeable clip options for use with the MARWARE Car Holder or with an
armband or belt. The neoprene case has vulcanized rubber grips on each
side and bottom for a no-slip grip as well as plastic inserts for impact protec-
tion, offering full access to all iPod controls and connections while the iPod is
in the case. There’s even space inside the lid to store earbuds.
If you like to carry a backpack with everything in it, consider getting the very
first backpack ever designed to control an iPod within it: The Burton Amp
Pack (http://lonelyplanet.altrec.com/shop/detail/24004),
priced at $199.95, lets you switch songs on your iPod by pressing a button on
the shoulder strap. Constructed from ballistic nylon, the Amp Pack offers a
secure iPod storage pocket, a headphone port located on a shoulder strap,
an easy-access side entry laptop compartment, and padded ergonomic shoul-
der straps with a soft, flexible control pad built in to a strap. It’s perfect for
listening to Lou Reed while hanging on to a pole in a subway car, or the
327
Chapter 20: Going Mobile

Hollies while navigating your way to the back of the bus. Other backpacks
that can host iPods include the Thundervolt from JanSport (www.jansport.
com) and the aptly named G-Tech Psycho (www.g-techworld.com).
Using Power Accessories
If you want to charge your iPod battery when you travel abroad, you can’t
count on finding the same voltage as in your home country. However, you still
need to use your Apple power adapter to recharge your iPod. Fortunately,
power adapters are available in most airports, but the worldly traveler might
want to consider saving time and money by getting a travel kit of power
accessories.
We found several varieties of power kits for world travel in our local interna-
tional airport. Most kits include a set of AC plugs with prongs that fit different
electrical outlets around the world. You can connect your iPod power
adapter to these adapters. The AC plugs typically support outlets in North
America, Japan, China, the United Kingdom, Continental Europe, Korea,
Australia, and Hong Kong. You should also include at least one power acces-
sory for use with a standard car lighter, such as car chargers from Belkin
(www.belkin.com), Kensington (www.kensington.com), or Newer
Technology (www.newertech.com).
One way to mitigate the battery blues is to get an accessory that lets you use
replaceable alkaline batteries — the kind that you can find in any conve-
nience store. The TunePower Rechargeable Battery Pack for iPod ($79.99)
from Belkin (www.belkin.com) lets you power your iPod with standard AA
alkaline replaceable batteries even when your internal iPod battery is
drained.
Another way to supply power to your iPod on the road is to use your
FireWire-equipped or USB 2.0–equipped laptop to supply the power (make
sure that you use FireWire or USB 2.0 hardware that provides power; see
Chapter 1) and then use a power adapter with your laptop. You can use, for
example, the Kensington Universal Car/Air Adapter for Apple to plug a Mac
PowerBook or iBook into any car cigarette lighter or EmPower-equipped air-
line seat. (The EmPower in-seat power system can provide either 110-volt AC
or 15-volt DC power in an aircraft seat for passenger use.) Then connect the
iPod to the laptop with a FireWire cable.

Chapter 21: Sleeping with Your iPod or iPhone

With fifth-generation iPod models, you can set an alarm for each clock. (To
create multiple clocks, see “Displaying multiple clocks,” earlier in this chap-
ter.) To set an alarm for a fifth-generation iPod, follow these steps:
1. Choose Extras➪Clock from the main menu.
In current fifth-generation iPods and iPod nano, the clock has a face with
hands. You see any multiple clocks you created and a New Clock.
In third- and fourth-generation models, the clock is digital, and a menu
appears with Alarm Clock, Sleep Timer, and Date & Time options.
2. In fifth-generation iPods, select a clock and then choose Alarm Clock
from the clock’s menu; in older iPods, choose Alarm Clock from the
clock’s menu.
The Alarm Clock menu appears.
3. Highlight the Alarm option and press the Select button.

336
Part V: Have iPod, Will Travel 

If you set an alarm for a new clock you created (see “Displaying multiple
clocks” earlier in this chapter), the alarm goes off at the proper time for that
time zone (based on the time kept by your iPod).
For example, you can keep your iPod set to Eastern U.S. time while you’re in
Los Angeles but use the Los Angeles clock to set your morning alarm.
Setting the sleep timer
Just like when using a clock radio sleep timer, you can set your iPod or
iPhone to play music for a while before going to sleep. Although you can dis-
play multiple clocks on the iPhone, iPod touch, sixth- and fifth-generation
iPods and iPod nano, you can set only one sleep timer.
To set the timer on the iPhone or iPod touch, select Clock from the main
menu and touch the Timer button along the bottom of the display. The timer
wheel appears with the Start button. Use your finger to scroll the timer wheel
to set the timer in hours and minutes. Then touch the When Timer Ends
button, and touch Sleep iPod to put the iPod touch or iPhone to sleep when
the timer ends (you can also choose to play a sound). Touch Set in the upper
right corner of the display to set the Sleep iPod option (or Cancel in the
upper left corner to cancel). Finally, touch Start to start the timer.
To set the sleep timer on an iPod classic or iPod nano, choose Extras from
the main menu, then select Alarms--Sleep Timer. To set the sleep timer on a
fifth-generation iPod, select a clock and then choose Sleep Timer from the
clock’s menu. 
A list of intervals appears, from 0 (Off) up to 120 minutes (2 hours). You can
select a time amount or the Off setting (at the top of the list) to turn off the
sleep timer. After the iPod shuts itself off or you turn it off, the preference for
the Sleep Timer is reset to the default status, Off.
To turn off the iPod, press the Pause button. If you don’t press Pause, it
remains idle for a few minutes and then shuts itself off.
Using the stopwatch
Sixth- and fifth-generation iPods, iPod nano, iPod touch, and iPhone models
feature a stopwatch with a lap timer, which is useful when timing exercises,
jogging, race laps, how long it takes the bus to travel across town, or how
long your friend takes to recognize the song you’re playing. Whatever you
want to measure with time, the stopwatch is ready for you.
337
Chapter 21: Sleeping with Your iPod or iPhone

You can use the iPod’s menus, and also play music, audio books, and pod-
casts, while running the stopwatch. When you play video, the stopwatch con-
tinues to count as usual; when you press Menu to switch to the stopwatch
display, the video automatically pauses.
To use the stopwatch on an iPod touch or iPhone, follow these steps:
1. Select Clock from the main menu and touch the Stopwatch button
along the bottom of the display. 
A stopwatch appears with Start and Reset buttons and 00:00.00 (min-
utes, seconds, and fractions of second) as the stopwatch counter. 
2. Touch the Start button to start counting.
The stopwatch starts counting immediately, the left button changes to
Stop, and the right button changes to Lap.
3. (Optional) Touch the Lap button to mark each lap.
Touch the Lap button to record each lap. Repeat this step for each lap.
4. Touch the Stop button to stop counting.
The counter stops counting. The left button changes to Start, and the
right button changes to Reset. You can resume the count from where
you left off by touching Start, or start the count again from zero by
touching Reset.
To use the stopwatch on a sixth-generation iPod or iPod nano, follow these
steps:
1. Choose Extras➪Stopwatch from the main menu.
A stopwatch appears with the play/pause icon.
2. Press the Select button to start counting.
The stopwatch starts counting immediately. 
3. (Optional) Press the Select button to mark each lap.
Press the Select button to record the current lap time while counting
resumes accurately for the next lap. Repeat this step for each lap.
4. Press the Play/Pause button to stop counting.
The counter stops counting and the Stopwatch menu appears. The
menu now includes the Current Log option to show the lap timings for
the stopwatch session. Also included are previous stopwatch session
logs. The iPod saves the stopwatch results in a session log for conve-
nience, so you don’t have to write them down.
338
Part V: Have iPod, Will Travel 

5. Select Resume to resume counting, or New Timer to start a new stop-
watch session.
You can resume the stopwatch session from where you left off, or start a
new stopwatch session.
6. (Optional) Read your stopwatch logs by choosing Current Log or the
date of a previous log in the Stopwatch menu.
7. (Optional) Delete your stopwatch logs by choosing Clear Logs in the
Stopwatch menu.
To use the stopwatch on a fifth-generation iPod, follow these steps:
1. Choose Extras➪Stopwatch➪Timer from the main menu.
A stopwatch appears with Start and Clear buttons and 00:00:00.00
(hours, minutes, seconds, and fractions of second) as the stopwatch
counter. Underneath is a lap counter with its own time in smaller digits.
2. Scroll to highlight the Start button and then press the Select button to
push the Start button.
The stopwatch starts counting immediately with both the main and lap
counters. After these counters begin, the left button changes to Pause,
and the right button changes to Lap.
The stopwatch stops if the counter reaches 24 hours, you connect your
iPod to your computer, or you allow your iPod to lapse into hibernation.
3. (Optional) Enable the Lap button to mark each lap.
Scroll to highlight the Lap button and then press the Select button. The
current lap time is recorded, the lap time is reset to zero, and counting
resumes accurately. However, your iPod displays the total lap time for
about five seconds so that you can quickly view it before it changes to
reflect the actual count. Repeat this step for each lap.
4. Select Pause to pause.
Scroll to highlight the Pause button and press Select to push the Pause
button. Both the main counter and the lap counter stop counting. The
left button changes to Resume, and the right button changes to Done.
5. Click Resume to resume counting, or click Done to finish counting.
The iPod saves the main counter and lap counter results in a session log
for convenience, so you don’t have to write them down. You can read
how to retrieve these logs in the following set of steps.
After clicking Done, the stopwatch display still shows the final results.
The buttons revert to Start and Clear.
6. To reset the stopwatch counters, select the Clear button.
Scroll to highlight the Clear button and then press the Select button.
339
Chapter 21: Sleeping with Your iPod or iPhone

Each time you click the Done button, the stopwatch saves the results of the
counters in a session log. Your iPod can store up to five session logs, but it
deletes the oldest log when it records a sixth session. To view your session
logs, follow these steps:
1. Choose Extras➪Stopwatch to see the list of session logs under the
Timer option.
2. Scroll to highlight the session log you want to see and then press the
Select button to see it.
The session log includes the date and time of the session, the total time,
the shortest and longest lap times, the average lap time, and a list of
each individual lap time. You can scroll the session log to see all of it.
To delete a session log, select it and choose Delete.
Choosing Display Settings
Your future might be so bright that you gotta wear shades, but your iPod or
iPhone display might not be bright enough. From the Settings menu you can
change the timer for the backlight on iPod classic and iPod nano models, set
the brightness of the display on all models, and also set the contrast of black-
and-white displays. (Color-display iPod models such as the sixth-generation
iPod classic, iPod touch, iPod nano, and iPhone offer only a brightness con-
trol.) Choose the Settings menu from the main menu.
Backlight timer
An iPod display’s backlight turns on when you press a button or use the
scroll wheel, and then it turns off after a short amount of time (on iPod touch
and iPhone models the display itself turns on when you press a button, and
turns off after a short period of time.) On third-generation iPods, the back-
light also lights up the iPod buttons.
You can set the backlight on iPods (except the iPod touch) to remain on for a
certain interval of time. Choose Settings➪Backlight from the main menu. A
menu appears, giving you the options of 2 seconds, 5 seconds, 10 seconds, 15
seconds, 20 seconds, 30 seconds, and Always On. Select one by scrolling to
highlight the selection and then press the Select button.
Using the backlight drains an iPod battery; the longer you set the interval,
the more frequently you need to recharge the battery.
340
Part V: Have iPod, Will Travel 

To set the backlight to always be on, choose Always On. If you want the back-
light to always be off, choose Always Off. If you set it to always be off, the
backlight doesn’t turn on automatically when you press any button or use
the scroll wheel.
Don’t be alarmed if your backlight turns itself on at midnight for a brief flash.
The iPod is just setting its internal clock. If you find this annoying, turn off
the Backlight Timer.
Brightness and contrast
To adjust the brightness for an iPod or iPhone, choose Settings➪Brightness
from the main menu. The Brightness screen appears with a slider that shows
the brightness setting, which ranges from low (a quarter-moon icon on an
iPod nano or iPod classic, or a dim sun on an iPhone or iPod touch or older
iPod model) to high (a bright sun icon). 
On an iPod nano or iPod classic (or older iPod), scroll clockwise to increase
the brightness (toward the bright sun) and counterclockwise to decrease the
brightness (toward the moon or dim sun). 
On an iPod touch or iPhone, slide the brightness slider’s knob with your
finger to the right to increase the brightness (toward the bright sun) and to
the left to decrease the brightness (toward the dim sun).
You can also set the contrast of black-and-white iPod displays to make the
black characters appear sharper against the display background. (This fea-
ture isn’t provided in color-display iPod models.)
To adjust the contrast, choose Settings➪Contrast from the main menu. The
Contrast screen appears with a slider that shows the contrast setting, which
ranges from low contrast (a black-and-white dot) to high contrast (a full black
dot). Scroll clockwise to increase the contrast (toward the black dot) and
counterclockwise to decrease the contrast (toward the black-and-white dot).
You might need to adjust the contrast of a black-and-white iPod if a sharp
temperature difference freezes or bakes your iPod. If you leave your iPod in
your car overnight in the cold or in direct sunlight, the contrast can change
so much that you can’t see your iPod display. Slowly, allow the iPod to warm
up (don’t use the oven or microwave) or cool down. Then adjust the contrast.
If you accidentally set the contrast too dark or too light, you can reset it to
the halfway point between too dark and too light by pressing and holding the
Menu button for at least four seconds.
341
Chapter 21: Sleeping with Your iPod or iPhone

Checking Your Calendar
Your iPod or iPhone can accept calendars from calendar applications, such
as iCal (Mac) or Outlook (Windows). You can view these calendars (or a
blank calendar if you haven’t updated your iPod or iPhone with your calen-
dar files). Choose Calendar from the main menu on an iPhone or iPod touch,
or choose Extras➪Calendars on an iPod classic, iPod nano, or older iPod.
The iPhone and iPod touch merge all your specific synchronized calendars
into one calendar. Touch the Today button in the upper left corner of the dis-
play to see the calendar for today. Touch the List, Day, or Month buttons to
change the calendar view to a list, a full day, or a month respectively. Touch
any day to see the events on that day, and touch the plus (+) button in the
upper right corner of the display to add a new event.
On an iPod classic, iPod nano, or older iPod, you can choose a specific calen-
dar by name or choose All for a merged view of all your calendars. Select a
calendar and then scroll the click wheel to go through the days of the calen-
dar. Select an event to see its details. Press the Next and Previous buttons to
skip to the next or previous month. To see your To-Do list, choose
Extras➪Calendars➪To Do’s.
If your calendar events use alarms, you can turn on your iPod calendar
alarms. Choose Extras➪Calendars➪Alarms. Select Alarms once to set the
alarm to Beep, select Alarms twice to set it to None (so that only the message
for the alarm appears), or select it a third time to set it to Off. (The Alarms
choices cycle from Beep to None to Off and then back to Beep.)
Calendars on your iPod or iPhone are far more useful if you synchronize your
personal information; turn to Chapter 23 to see how.
Sorting Your Contacts
The bits of information that you’re most likely to need on the road are phone
numbers and addresses. An iPod or iPhone can store contacts right alongside
your music. To see how to put your personal contacts into your iPod or
iPhone, check out Chapter 23.
The contact list is sorted automatically, and the iPod or iPhone displays
contact names in alphabetical order. You can change how the contacts sort
so that you don’t have to look up people by their first names (which can be
time-consuming with so many friends named Elvis). The sort operation uses
the entire name, but you decide whether to use the first name or the surname
first.
342
Part V: Have iPod, Will Travel 

On sixth-generation iPod classic and iPod nano models and the iPod touch,
choose Settings➪Sort By. (On fifth-generation and older iPods, choose
Settings➪Contacts➪Sort.) Press the Select button in the scrolling pad (or use
your finger with an iPod touch) for each option:
 First (First Last on older iPods): Sorts the contact list by first name, fol-
lowed by the last name, so that Mick Jagger sorts under Mick (after Mick
Abrahams but before Mick Taylor). 
 Last (Last, First on older iPods): Sorts the contacts by last name, fol-
lowed by the first name, so that Brian Jones sorts under Jones. (Jones,
Brian appears after Jones, Alice but before Jones, Norah.)
On iPhone models, choose Settings➪Phone➪Sort Order, then touch one of
these options:
 First, Last: Sorts the contact list by first name, followed by the last
name. 
 Last, First: Sorts the contacts by last name, followed by the first name.
On fifth-generation and older iPod models and the iPhone, you can display
contacts by last or first name. On a fifth-generation or older iPod, choose
Settings➪Contacts➪Display and then press the Select button in the scrolling
pad for each option; on an iPhone, choose Settings➪Phone➪Display Order,
then touch one of these options:
 First Last: Displays the contacts list by first name and then last name, as
in Ringo Starr.
 Last, First: Displays the contacts list by last name followed by a comma
and the first name, as in McCartney, Paul.
Setting the Combination Lock
If you think your iPod or iPhone might fall into the wrong hands, consider set-
ting a combination lock, which is available in sixth- and fifth-generation
iPods, the iPod nano, the iPod touch, and the iPhone. You can set a four-digit
combination that locks the navigation controls, preventing anyone else from
selecting content. Note: The lock works only when your iPod or iPhone is not
attached to a computer.
If you’re playing music when you lock your iPod or iPhone, the music contin-
ues playing — and you can even use the Play/Pause button to pause and
resume playback — but you can’t navigate the iPod or iPhone until you pro-
vide the combination. You also can’t change the volume.
343
Chapter 21: Sleeping with Your iPod or iPhone

To conserve power, you can force your iPod to go to sleep by pressing the
Play/Pause button, but it won’t unlock. When it awakes, it remembers every-
thing — including its combination.

1. Choose Settings➪General➪Passcode Lock from the main menu.
The Set Passcode display appears.
2. Enter a four-number passcode by touching numbers in the calculator-
style keypad.
You can touch the Cancel button to cancel, or enter the four numbers to
set the passcode.
3. Enter the same passcode number again to confirm the passcode.
After entering the passcode again, the Passcode Lock menu appears
with the Turn Passcode Off, Change Passcode, and Require Passcode
options.
4. Touch General to return to the General menu.
Before doing so, you can turn the passcode off, change it, or set the
Require Passcode option to Immediately, After 1 minute, or after several

wheel.
While you scroll with your iPod, the first digit of the combination
changes. You can also press the Previous/Rewind or Next/Fast-Forward
button to scroll through numbers.
3. Press the Select button to pick a number.
This sets your choice for the first number and moves on to the next
number of the combination.
4. Scroll to select each number of the combination and then press the
Select button to set the number.
Repeat this step for each number of the combination. When you pick the
last number, the message “Confirm Combination” appears. Repeat steps

and return to Step 2. To unlock the iPod after locking it, press any button
and then repeat steps 2 and 3 to enter each number of the combination. 
Don’t forget this combination! Use a four-digit number that is easy to commit
to memory.
To lock your iPod with this combination, follow these steps:
1. (Optional) Start playing music before locking the iPod.
2. Choose Extras➪Screen Lock.
The iPod displays the Lock or Reset options.
3. Choose Lock.
When it’s locked, a lock icon appears on your iPod even while music is playing. 
To unlock a locked iPod or iPhone, you must do one of the following:
 Enter the same combination. After correctly entering the combination,
the iPod unlocks and returns to the last viewed screen.
 Attach the iPod to the computer you used to update the iPod with
iTunes. When you disconnect it after iTunes updating, the iPod is no
longer locked.
 Restore your iPod to its original factory settings. As we describe in
Chapter 24, this erases everything in the process. This is, of course, a
measure of last resort.
Don’t bother to call Apple to see whether the company can unlock your iPod
for you. If you can’t attach it to the proper computer or enter the correct com-
bination, your only recourse is to restore the iPod to its factory conditions.
To set the combination lock on fifth-generation iPod models, follow these
steps:
1. Choose Extras➪Screen Lock.
The Screen Lock menu appears.
2. From the Screen Lock menu that appears, choose Set Combination.

1. (Optional) Start playing music before locking the iPod.
2. Choose Extras➪Screen Lock➪Turn Screen Lock On.
The iPod displays this message:
If you forget the code, connect iPod to your computer
to unlock it.
Underneath the message are the Lock and Cancel choices.
3. Choose Lock.
When it’s locked, an Enter Code display appears on your iPod even while
music is playing. A key in the upper-right corner indicates that your iPod is
locked.
To change the combination lock for a fifth-generation iPod, choose
Extras➪Screen Lock➪Change Combination. The Enter Old Code display
appears for you to enter the original combination. After entering it correctly,
the Enter New Code display appears, and you can enter a new combination.
If you frequently turn your Screen Lock on and off, you might want to add it
to your iPod main menu for fast access. See “Customizing the Menu and
Settings,” later in this chapter.
Speaking into Your iPod
If you record conversations and interviews on the road, throw out your
antiquated tape recorder. Your iPod can record hundreds of hours of voice-
quality memos, meetings, notes, and interviews with a touch of a button. All
you need is an accessory for your iPod model designed for voice recording,
such as the MicroMemo from XtremeMac ($59.95; www.xtrememac.com) for
sixth- and fifth-generation iPods. For third- and fourth-generation iPod models,
check out the tiny Belkin iPod Voice Recorder (about $30; www.belkin.com)
or the Griffin iTalk Voice Recorder (about $40; www.griffin
technology.com).
346
Part V: Have iPod, Will Travel 

The voice memos are stored on your iPod, where you can review them imme-
diately via the built-in speaker of the accessory, headphones, or speakers.
Even better, the voice memos are automatically transferred to your iTunes
library for archiving or reviewing on your computer.
The MicroMemo plugs in to the dock connector on your sixth- or fifth-
generation iPod and includes a flexible, detachable microphone (you can also
use any other input device with a 3.5mm connector) and a built-in speaker.
The Belkin iPod Voice Recorder and the Griffin iTalk Voice Recorder attach to
the remote connector on the top of full-size third- and fourth-generation
iPods (updated by version 2.1 of the iPod software or newer). Sorry, you can’t
use voice recorders with the iPod nano, iPod mini, or iPod shuffle.
Recording voice memos
To record voice memos, connect the voice recorder to the iPod and choose
Extras➪Voice Memos➪Record Now. The iPod displays the Record screen.
Press the Play/Pause button to begin recording and then point the voice
recorder microphone toward the sound source. (With the Belkin iPod Voice
Recorder, a green LED turns on when recording.) Pause the recording by
pressing the Play/Pause button again.
When you finish recording, press the Menu button. The audio files for voice
memos are stored on your iPod in the Recordings folder, using the date and
time of the recording as the filename.
Playing back voice memos
To play a voice memo, choose Extras➪Voice Memos and choose the voice
memo from the list. (The Voice Memos menu doesn’t appear unless the voice
recorder is connected.) Then choose Play or press the Play/Pause button.
The voice memo plays just like any other song on your iPod: Press Play/
Pause to pause playback and press it again to resume. You can hear the play-
back in the voice recorder’s tiny speaker; attach headphones to your iPod; or
connect your iPod to a home stereo, car stereo, or self-powered speakers.
You can play music through the voice recorder speaker by connecting the
accessory to your iPod and playing. This trick comes in handy if you set your
iPod as an alarm clock to play a music playlist; you can hear music when you
wake up without having to connect the iPod to speakers. See the earlier sec-
tion, “Setting the alarm clock.”

Chapter 21: Sleeping with Your iPod or iPhone

Managing voice memos in iTunes
Just like your music, your voice memos synchronize automatically with your
iTunes library if you set your iPod to update automatically. (See Chapter 12
to find out how to set your iPod to update automatically.) iTunes stores the
voice memos in the library and creates a Voice Memos playlist so that you
can find them easily.
If you update your iPod manually, you can drag voice memo files directly
from the Recordings folder to your hard drive or drag and drop them over
the iTunes window. Note: The iPod must already be enabled as a hard drive.
(Check out Chapter 22 to see how to enable your iPod as a hard drive.)
Voice memos are stored as WAV files. If you want to archive them in a format
that takes up less hard drive space, convert them by using an AAC or MP3
encoder, as we describe in Chapter 19.
Customizing the Menu and Settings
When traveling or using your iPod in situations or environments where porta-
bility is important, you might want to customize your iPod menu and display
to make doing things easier, such as selecting certain albums, displaying the
time, setting the screen lock, displaying menus with backlighting turned on
longer than usual, and so on.
The Settings menu in the iPod main menu offers ways to customize your iPod
experience by changing the main menu to have more choices. Choose
Settings➪Main Menu from the main menu. The iPod displays a list of menus;
each menu is set to either On or Off. On means that the menu appears in the
iPod main menu; Off means that the menu doesn’t appear in the main menu.
Don’t worry; the menus are still where they are supposed to be. Turning one
to On simply adds it to the main menu as well.
For example, to put the Screen Lock option on the iPod main menu, choose
Settings➪Main Menu, scroll to the Screen Lock option, and select it to add it
to the main menu. Select it again to remove it from the main menu.
Other ways to customize your experience include setting the Clicker sound
and setting the language to use for the menus. The options in the Settings
menu are
348
Part V: Have iPod, Will Travel 

 About: This option displays information about the iPod, including the
number of songs, videos, and photos; how much space is used; how
much space is available; the software version in use; and the serial and
model numbers.
 Main Menu: This option allows you to customize the main menu on
iPods that use iPod software 2.0 or newer. For example, you can add
items from other menus, such as Artists or Songs from the Music menu
(Browse menu in older iPods) to the main menu.
 Backlight: Use this option to set the backlight to remain on for a certain
amount of time by pressing a button or using the scroll wheel. Specify 2
seconds, 5 seconds, and so on. You can also set it to always be On.
Using backlight drains an iPod battery. The longer you set the interval,
the more you need to recharge the battery.
 Audiobooks: Use this option to set audio books to play at normal speed,
slower, or faster.
 Clicker: When this setting is On, you hear a click when you press a
button; when it’s Off, you don’t hear a click. With color-display, fourth-
generation iPod models, the Clicker can be set to Speaker (the iPod
speaker), Headphones, Both, or Off.
 Language: This option sets the language used in all the menus. See
Chapter 1 for how to set the language.
 Legal: This option displays the legal message that accompanies Apple
products.
 Reset All Settings: This option resets all the items on the Settings menu
in your iPod, returning them to their original state. However, your music
and data files on the iPod are not disturbed. This is not the same as
resetting (and restarting) the iPod software itself; choosing Reset All
Settings simply returns all settings to their defaults. See Chapter 24 for
how to reset the iPod itself.

Chapter 22
Using Your iPod as a Hard Drive
In This Chapter
 Enabling your iPod to work as a hard drive
 Opening and copying files to iPod folders
 Copying notes and text files to your iPod
 Adding text guides, news feeds, and electronic books to your iPod
You have a device in your pocket that can play music and videos, sort
your contacts, remind you of events, wake you up in the morning, and
tuck you in at night. Did you also know that you can use your iPod to keep a
safe backup of your most important files?
You read that right. Windows and Mac users can put their most important
files on an iPod and use it just like a hard drive. You can also copy applica-
tions and utility programs or even copy your entire User folder to your iPod
(if you have enough room after putting music on it). The handy iPod shuffle,
which plugs directly into a USB connection, is designed to double as a USB
flash memory drive for portable file storage.
You can also use software such as Jax from JoeSoft (www.joesoft.com) to
add travel directions, weather forecasts, stock quotes, movie listings, and
even gas prices to your iPod as text — as well as local news from selected
news readers.
To learn more about backing up data on your iPod, including putting versions
of the Mac OS X or Linux on your iPod, visit this book’s companion Web site.
Enabling an iPod as a Hard Drive
You can use any iPod, including an iPod shuffle, as an external hard drive (or
in the case of iPod shuffle or iPod nano, as a flash memory drive). And like
any hard drive, you can transfer files and applications from your computer to
your iPod and take them with you. An iPod is smart enough to keep your files

separate from your content libraries so that you don’t accidentally erase
them when you update your iTunes library and photo library. And because
your iPod is with you, it’s as safe as you are.
As shipped, an iPod is formatted as a Macintosh hard drive and can be 
connected to any Mac. When you connect it to Windows, an iPod is reformat-
ted as a Windows hard drive. You can then connect it to any Windows PC or
any Mac.
If you format an iPod for Windows first, you can transfer files between Mac
and Windows computers. A Mac can use Windows-formatted hard drives, but
Windows can’t use Mac-formatted hard drives. To reformat an iPod, restore it
to its original factory conditions (which erases all content and data), and
then reconnect it on a Windows computer to set it up, as described in
Chapter 2.
We don’t recommend using an iPod regularly as a hard drive to launch appli-
cations because iPods are designed for sustained playback of music and
video. You can eventually burn out the device by using it to launch applica-
tions. Instead, use its external hard drive capabilities for backing up and
copying files. Copy applications to a hard drive before launching them.
To use your iPod shuffle as an external flash memory hard drive and manage
space on the iPod shuffle (allocating music and data space), see Chapter 12.
To use your full-size iPod, iPod mini, or iPod nano as an external hard drive,
follow these steps:
1. Connect your iPod to your computer.
2. Select the iPod name in the iTunes Source pane.
The iPod summary page appears, as shown in Figure 22-1.
3. Select the Enable Disk Use option and then click Apply.
The Enable Disk Use option is available if your iPod is set to automati-
cally synchronize music or videos with your iTunes library. If you
already set your iPod to manually manage music and videos (see
Chapter 12), this option is grayed out because it isn’t needed, as setting
the iPod to manually manage content already enables you to use it as a
hard drive.
After enabling your iPod for disk use, you must always remember to properly
eject your iPod before disconnecting it from your computer. Click the Eject
button next to the iPod name in the iTunes Source pane to eject the iPod.
352
Part V: Have iPod, Will Travel 

If iTunes isn’t running, an alternate way to eject a disk-enabled iPod on a Mac
is to use the Finder to drag the iPod icon to the Trash icon, which turns into
an Eject button when you drag the iPod icon onto it. Or, just right-click the
iPod name or icon and then choose Eject from the shortcut menu.
An alternate way to eject a disk-enabled iPod on a Windows PC is to right-
click the iPod name or icon and then choose Eject from the shortcut menu.
After ejecting an iPod, wait until its display shows either the OK to
disconnect message on older models or the main menu on newer models.
You can then disconnect the iPod from its dock or disconnect the dock from
the computer. Don’t ever disconnect an iPod before ejecting it. You might
have to reset your iPod.
Opening iPod Folders
On a Windows PC, you can use My Computer or Windows Explorer to open
iPod folders, view their contents, and transfer data to and from the iPod. If
you open the My Computer window, the iPod appears as an external hard
drive, as shown in Figure 22-2. Windows automatically assigns the iPod hard
drive to a Windows drive letter. (The iPod in the figure is named Journeyman
and is assigned to Drive E.)
Figure 22-1:
Enable an
iPod as a
hard drive.
353
Chapter 22: Using Your iPod as a Hard Drive

The iPod hard drive opens up to show several folders, including Calendars,
Contacts, and Notes (see Figure 22-3). You might also have other folders,
depending on the iPod model; for example, a fifth- or sixth-generation video
iPod includes a Photos folder. You can add new folders, rename your new
folders, and generally use the iPod as a hard drive.
Don’t rename the folders already provided on your iPod because they link
directly to functions on the iPod. For example, the Calendars folder links to
the Calendar menu on the iPod.
You can drag files or folders to the iPod window. To keep data organized,
create new folders on your iPod and then copy files and folders to the newly
created folders. To copy files and folders in Windows, use the drag-and-drop
method in the My Computer window or Windows Explorer, or copy and paste
the files or folders. On a Mac, use the Finder to drag files and folders to the
newly created folders on your iPod.

Part V: Have iPod, Will Travel 

To delete files and folders from an iPod, select the filenames or folders and
then press Backspace or choose File➪Delete from the Windows Explorer
menu, just like you do with your internal hard drive. On a Mac, select the 
filenames or folders and choose File➪Move to Trash, or drag them to the
Trash icon.
Don’t use a hard drive reformatting utility to erase or format your iPod’s hard
drive. If you erase your iPod’s hard drive this way, it might be unable to play
music and videos.
Here how to see how much free space is left on your iPod. On a Mac, use the
Finder to select the iPod icon on the Desktop and then choose File➪Show
Info. You can also choose Settings➪About from the iPod main menu. Use 
your Windows PC to select the iPod icon in My Computer and then choose
File➪Properties.
We don’t recommend using an iPod regularly as a hard drive to launch appli-
cations because iPods are designed for sustained playback of music and
video. You can eventually burn out the device by using it to launch applica-
tions. Instead, use its external hard drive capabilities for backing up and
copying files. Copy applications to a hard drive before launching them.
Adding Notes and Text
You can add text notes to your iPod so that you can view them on the iPod
display — all sorts of notes, such as driving directions, weather, or even
news. If you use your iPod only for music, you might want notes about the
music. This feature works with iPods that run iPod software 2.0 or newer
(including iPod mini and all iPods that use the dock connector).
Using the Notes folder
In a perfect world, you could rip audio CDs and also capture all the informa-
tion in the liner notes — the descriptions of who played which instruments,
where the CD was produced, and other details. Then, while sharing your iPod
music with others, you could view the liner notes on the iPod screen when-
ever a question arises about the music.
You can almost achieve the same result by typing some of the liner notes (or
any text you want) into a word-processing program, such as TextEdit (Mac) or
Notepad (Windows). You can then save the document as a text-only file (with
the .txt filename extension) and drag it to the Notes folder of your iPod.
355
Chapter 22: Using Your iPod as a Hard Drive

You must save documents as text-only files to view them on an iPod. If you
use a word processor, such as Microsoft Word, choose File➪Save As and
choose Text Only (or Text Only with Line Breaks) from the Save As Type pop-
up menu in Windows or from the Format pop-up menu on a Mac. Notes text
files can be up to 4K in size — roughly two or three printed pages of informa-
tion. You can transfer up to 1,000 notes.
Text files in the Notes folder are organized by filename. You can view these
notes files by choosing Extras➪Notes. Make sure that your notes have
descriptive filenames so that you can easily scroll the list of notes files to 
find the notes you want.
Your iPod can also display a folder hierarchy in the Notes folder, allowing you
to organize your notes by creating folders (using the Finder with your iPod
mounted as a hard drive) and putting notes files within the folders in the
Notes folder.
Notes can include basic HTML tags (used on Web pages), such as paragraph
markers (<P> and </P>) and line breaks (<BR>). HTML tags can define links to
other notes text files and to audio files. Software companies, such as Talking
Panda (http://talkingpanda.com), have created textual guides you can
install in the iPod Notes folder that use these tags and links to present text on
the iPod screen and play audio files. You can find out how to develop your own
HTML tags by downloading Using iPod as a Tour Guide from the following site:
http://developer.apple.com/hardwaredrivers/ipod/iPodNoteReaderGuide.pdf
To navigate the Notes section of your iPod, use the iPod controls as follows:
 Press the Select button to open a note from its folder, just like playing a
song in an album.
 Use the scroll wheel to navigate the list of notes in a folder as well as
text in a note.
 When you scroll through text, iPod jumps from link to link, highlighting
each link. When a link is already highlighted, press the Select button to
follow the link. To go back to the previous link, press the Menu button.
 To go up to the folder that contains the note text file, press the Menu
button to go back through the links until the iPod displays the folder.
Adding guides, books, and news feeds
Do you want the latest news, weather, sports scores, or driving directions
available at the touch of a button of your iPod? How about lessons on speak-
ing French, German, Italian, Spanish, or other languages? Enterprising soft-
ware entrepreneurs have filled the vacuum left by Apple with accessories
that provide displayable text on your iPod screen, such as the following:
356
Part V: Have iPod, Will Travel 

 VoodooPad (www.flyingmeat.com/voodoopad) for Mac OS X lets
you save linked pages as Word documents, Rich Text Format (RTF) files,
or HTML to view in a Web browser. After you’re inside iPod Notes,
VoodooPad-linked words show up for you to click, and you can go from
page to page just like you were using VoodooPad — only with an iPod
scroll wheel instead of a mouse.
 Jax for iPod (www.joesoft.com) for Mac OS X offers synchronized
feeds for news, weather forecasts, movie listings, stock quotes, horo-
scopes, sections of Web pages, and directions.
 NewsLife (www.thinkmac.co.uk/newslife), also for Mac OS X, lets
you keep tabs on world news Web sites and blogs and also lets you
transfer entire Web pages.
 iLingo (http://talkingpanda.com/ilingo.php) for Mac or
Windows offers language lessons, with over 400 essential words and
phrases of your chosen language, organized as Notes folders and files. It
also includes audio files created by native speakers that provide proper
pronunciation for all included phrases.
 iBar (http://talkingpanda.com/ibar.php) for Mac or Windows
offers drink recipes with ingredients, instructions for mixing and proper
garnishing, and advice on appropriate serving glassware. Many recipes
are linked to audio anecdotes about the origin of specific cocktails as
well as instructions on how to mix them.
 EphPod 2 (www.ephpod.com) for Windows lets you update your iPod
with news, weather, and other information updates.
 Book2Pod (www.tomsci.com/book2pod) is a shareware program 
for a Mac that allows you to read entire books on your iPod display.
iPodLibrary (www.sturm.net.nz) is a similar shareware program 
for Windows.
 Mac users can also take advantage of the Notes folder and other iPod
features by using some of the handy AppleScripts provided for iTunes
and the iPod, which you can download from the Apple site (www.
apple.com/applescript/ipod).

Synchronizing Personal Info 
with Your iPod or iPhone
In This Chapter

 Exporting calendars and contact information
 Using utilities to copy content
W
e chose iPods for music and videos, but we also find it useful while trav-
eling for viewing the personal information — contacts, appointments,
events, and To-Do tasks — that we manage on our computers. And of course, an
iPhone lets you dial your contact phone numbers as well as keep track of your
personal info. The big difference with an iPhone is that you can add personal
info on-the-go, and synchronize that information back with your computer.
iPods accepts industry-standard iCalendar and vCalendar files for calendars
and To-Do lists, which you can export from most applications that offer 
calendars and To-Do lists. It also accepts industry-standard vCards (virtual
business cards), which are records containing contact information for
people, including street and e-mail addresses, phone numbers, and so on.
If you’re a Mac user, you have it easy: You can use the free iCal and Address
Book applications that come with Mac OS X. If you’re a Windows user, you
can choose between Microsoft Outlook (and its accompanying Address
Book) and Outlook Express. In either case, you can automatically synchro-
nize the information with your iPod or iPhone calendar and contact list with
iTunes. iPods offer one-way synchronization from computer to iPod, while
the iPhone offers two-way synchronization so that information you add to
your iPhone is copied back to your computer.
If you don’t mind updating your iPod manually with contacts and calendar
information, you have even more choices in applications as long as you use
standard formats that work with the iPod. You also have choices of third-
party utilities for putting the information on an iPod as well as the tried-and-
true technique of exporting (or dragging) information to your iPod.

You probably already know how to manage your calendar activities and your
contacts on your computer. In fact, you’re probably knee-deep in vCards
(virtual business cards) for your Address Book, and the calendars in your
vCalendar files look like they were drawn up in the West Wing. If not, visit this
book’s companion Web site to learn more about adding and editing contacts
and calendar information on your Mac or Windows computer.
Synchronizing Contacts and Calendars
To synchronize your iPod or iPhone with contacts and calendars, follow
these steps:
1. Connect your iPod or iPhone to your computer.
iTunes launches automatically (if it isn’t running already).
2. Select the iPod or iPhone name in the iTunes Source pane in the
Devices section.
If iTunes launched automatically, the iPod or iPhone should already be
selected; if it isn’t, select it. The iPod or iPhone summary page appears
to the right of the Source pane.
3. Click the Contacts tab for an iPod or the Info tab for an iPhone.
The Contacts and Calendars synchronization options page appears for
an iPod, as shown in Figure 23-1. The Info page appears for an iPhone, as
shown in Figure 23-2, offering not only Contacts and Calendars but also,
if you scroll the page, Mail Accounts, Web Browser information, and
Advanced sync options.
4. Select the option to synchronize contacts.
On a Mac, select the Sync Address Book Contacts check box (refer to
Figure 23-1 for an iPod or Figure 23-2 for an iPhone). For color-display
iPods you can also select the option to Include Contacts’ Photos (these
are copied automatically with the iPhone). The iPhone Info page also
lets you sync with Yahoo! Address Book contacts.
On a Windows PC, select the Sync Contents From option and choose
Windows Address Book or Microsoft Outlook from the drop-down menu,
as shown in Figure 23-3.
5. Select the All Contacts option. (Alternatively, select the Selected
Groups option and choose which groups to synchronize.)
You can synchronize all contacts (as in Figure 23-2 and Figure 23-3) or
just selected groups of contacts (such as the iPod_contacts group, as
shown in Figure 23-1). To choose groups, select the check box next to
each group in the list; scroll the list to see more groups.

Calendars option (Mac) or the Sync Calendars from Microsoft Outlook
option (Windows PC).
7. Select the All Calendars option. (Alternatively, select the Selected
Calendars option and choose the calendars to synchronize.)
You can synchronize all calendars or just those you select. To choose
specific calendars, select the check box next to each calendar in the list.
The iPhone provides the Do Not Sync Events Older Than xx Days option,
in which you can set the xx number of days.
8. Click Apply to apply the changes. (Alternatively, click Cancel to
cancel the changes.)
iTunes starts to synchronize your iPod or iPhone. Wait until it finishes
synchronization before ejecting and disconnecting your iPod or iPhone.
The iTunes status pane (at the top) displays the message Sync is
Complete.
9. After iTunes finishes synchronizing, eject the iPod or iPhone by click-
ing the Eject button, and then disconnect your iPod or iPhone.
Remember to wait for the OK to disconnect message or the iPod
main menu before disconnecting your iPod.

After setting the synchronization options, every time you connect your iPod
or iPhone, iTunes automatically synchronizes your device with your calen-
dars and contacts.
If you select a calendar or a group of contacts to be synchronized and later
want to remove that particular calendar or group of contacts, deselect the
calendar (see the preceding Step 7) or the group (see the preceding Step 5)
and then click Apply to resynchronize. iTunes synchronizes only the group of
contacts and calendars selected, removing from an iPod or iPhone any that
aren’t selected.
After you synchronize and otherwise finish using your iPod with your com-
puter, be sure to eject the device. If you forget this, the iPod hard drive might
become unresponsive, and you might need to reset the device.
Adding Calendars Manually to an iPod
If you use an iPod as a hard drive, you can copy calendar files directly to 
the Calendars folder on your iPod (you can’t copy manually to an iPhone).
You can copy industry-standard iCalendar or vCalendar files, which many
applications (including Microsoft Entourage, Outlook, and Palm Desktop) 
can export.
In most cases, you can drag an iCalendar file (with an .ics filename exten-
sion) or a vCalendar file (with a .vcs filename extension) to your iPod
Calendars folder. To save calendar information in the iCalendar format from
Outlook, you must save each appointment separately as an ICS (iCalendar)
file. Follow these steps:
1. Select the appointment in the calendar view or open the appointment
by double-clicking it.
2. Choose File➪Save As.
3. Choose iCalendar from the Save As Type pop-up menu and then
choose a destination for the ICS file.
The destination can be either a folder on your hard drive or the iPod
Calendars folder. If you choose a folder on your hard drive, be sure to
copy the files to the iPod Calendars folder.
4. Click Save.
View your calendars on an iPod by choosing Extras➪Calendars➪All. Select a
calendar and then use the scroll wheel to scroll through the days of the cal-
endar, or select an event to see its details. Press the Next and Previous but-
tons to skip to the next or previous month. To see your To-Do list, choose
Extras➪Calendars➪To Do.
363
Chapter 23: Synchronizing Personal Info with Your iPod or iPhone

Although using automatic synchronization removes any calendar that isn’t
set to be synchronized, you can also remove a calendar manually. To remove
a calendar from your iPod, connect the iPod to your computer and enable 
the iPod as a hard drive (see Chapter 22). You can then open the Calendars
folder on the iPod and delete the calendar file. You can also copy calendar
files from the iPod to your hard drive.
Adding Contacts Manually to an iPod
If you use an iPod as a hard drive, you can copy contacts in vCard files
directly to the Contacts folder on your iPod (you can’t copy manually to 
an iPhone).
A vCard, or virtual business card, is a standard format for exchanging personal
information. An iPod sorts and displays contacts in the vCard format, and
you can use separate vCard files for each person or use a group vCard file
that contains records for many people.
After enabling your iPod as a hard drive (see Chapter 22), you can export
your contacts as vCards directly into the Contacts folder of your iPod. In
most cases, you can drag vCard-formatted contacts from the application’s
address book to an iPod Contacts folder.
You can copy one card, a group of cards, or even the entire list as a vCard file
(with a .vcf filename extension) by dragging the vCard file into the Contacts
folder. Contacts must be in the vCard format to use with an iPod.
You can use address book applications such as Outlook to export vCard files
directly to your iPod. For example, in Outlook, you can export a vCard file for
a contact directly into your iPod Contacts folder by following these steps:
1. Choose File➪Export to vCard.
2. Choose the iPod as the destination drive from the Save In pop-up
menu.
3. Select the Contacts folder to save the contacts file.
Using Utilities to Copy Files and Music
The iPod and iPhone have spawned a thriving industry of third-party acces-
sories and products. Some of the most useful products are utility programs
that expand the capabilities of an iPod or your ability to synchronize or oth-
erwise copy information to (and from) an iPod. Full-featured programs have
364
Part V: Have iPod, Will Travel 

even been designed as replacements for iTunes. With so many programs to
check out, you might be overwhelmed. We selected some of the best pro-
grams for Mac and Windows (as of this writing).
Keep in mind that with programs that allow music copying functions, copying
copyrighted material to other computers without permission is illegal. Don’t
steal music (or anything else, for that matter).
Mac utilities
Third-party offerings for Mac have focused on extending the capabilities of 
an iPod, such as copying music from an iPod to a computer and updating an
iPod with contacts and calendar information. Take a glance at the following
examples:
 iPDA (www.zapptek.com/ipda): With this software, you can transfer
personal information to your iPod from Entourage, Mail, Address Book,
and iCal. You can even download weather forecasts and news headlines
directly to your iPod.
 iPod Access (www.findleydesigns.com/ipodaccess): This compre-
hensive utility lets you transfer songs from an iPod to a Mac (Windows
version also available) with song information and iTunes ratings. Loaded
with features, iPod Access supports On-The-Go playlists and playing
music and video directly from an iPod. It’s available for $19.99 from
Findley Designs, Inc.
 Senuti (www.fadingred.org/senuti): This program lets you copy
songs to your computer from your iPod. You can search for songs and
even play songs directly from your iPod with the program. Senuti reads
the playlists on your iPod and lets you to transfer them to your com-
puter. You can also automatically add songs to your iTunes library.
 iPodRip (www.thelittleappfactory.com/application.php?app=
iPodRip): This third-party utility, available from The Little App Factory
for $14.95, lets you transfer music from your iPod to your iTunes library
and listen to music on your iPod through your computer (saving hard
drive space). It supports all iPod song formats, including MP3, AAC,
Protected AAC, and Audible.com books.
 YamiPod (www.yamipod.com/main/modules/home): Yet Another
Manager for iPod (YAMiPod, get it?) is a freeware application that lets
you copy music files from your iPod to your computer and vice versa. It
can copy playlists, really simple syndication (RSS) news feeds, and pod-
casts; and synchronize your iPod with computers running Mac OS X,
Windows, or Linux. You can run it directly from your iPod.
365
Chapter 23: Synchronizing Personal Info with Your iPod or iPhone

Windows utilities
Many third-party programs exist for Windows, and they do everything from
extending the capabilities of an iPod and updating contacts and calendar
information to replacing the need for MusicMatch Jukebox and iTunes.
 iPodSync (www.ipod-sync.com): Keep Outlook calendars, contacts,
tasks, and notes synchronized between Windows and an iPod. iPodSync
exports industry standard vCards for contacts and uses the iCalendar
format for appointment information. iPodSync can even synchronize
Outlook notes and tasks.
 EphPod 2 (www.ephpod.com): This utility lets you update your iPod
with contacts from Outlook. It’s a full-featured Windows application that
you can use in place of MusicMatch Jukebox or iTunes. It supports stan-
dard Winamp (M3U) playlists and can synchronize an iPod with a library
of music files. It imports Outlook contacts and also lets you create and
edit your own contacts. EphPod can also download the latest news,
weather, eBooks, and movie listings to an iPod.
 Outpod (http://outpod.stoer.de):This utility lets you export con-
tact and calendar information in bulk from Microsoft Outlook to vCard
and vCalendar files, which you can then drag to an iPod, as we describe
in the earlier sections, “Adding Calendars Manually to an iPod” and
“Adding Contacts Manually to an iPod.”
 Winamp ipod plug-in (http://mlipod.sourceforge.net): Also
known as ml_ipod, this plug-in for Winamp lets you manage your iPod
from within the Winamp media library. It supports all iPod models, from
the classic first generation to the iPod mini, photo, nano, and shuffle.
Because iPod support is built into Winamp version 5.2 and newer,
ml_ipod is an alternative for older versions of Winamp.
 XPlay 2 (www.mediafour.com/products/xplay): This utility, from
Mediafour Corp., provides read and write access to your iPod hard drive
for documents and data files, plus the ability to organize your music
from the Explorer-based XPlay interface or from Windows Media Player.
It’s an alternative to MusicMatch Jukebox or iTunes. XPlay makes your
iPod appear as a normal drive under Windows for sharing data files. It
also makes your songs, playlists, artists, and albums appear in custom
folders in Explorer so they’re easy to access and manipulate as well as
organized similarly to how an iPod organizes them.
 YamiPod (www.yamipod.com/main/modules/home): Yet Another
Manager for iPod (YAMiPod, get it?) is a freeware application that lets
you copy music files freely from your iPod to your computer and vice
versa. It can copy playlists, RSS news feeds, and podcasts; and synchro-
nize your iPod with computers running Mac OS X, Windows, or Linux.
You can run it directly from your iPod.

Updating and Troubleshooting
In This Chapter
 Troubleshooting iPod and iPhone problems
 Resetting your iPod or iPhone
 Updating iPod and iPhone software
 Restoring an iPod or iPhone to its factory condition
 Updating Apple TV software
T
his chapter describes some of the problems that you might encounter
with your iPod or iPhone and how to fix them. If your iPod or iPhone fails
to turn on or your computer fails to recognize it, you can most likely find a
solution here.
This chapter also covers updating the firmware and software on your iPod 
or iPhone and restoring your iPod or iPhone to its factory default condition.
(Firmware is software encoded in hardware.) That last option is a drastic
measure that erases any music or information on the device, but it usually
solves the problem if nothing else does.
Taking Your First Troubleshooting Steps
Problems can arise with electronics and software that can prevent an iPod or
iPhone from turning on at all or from turning on properly with all its content
and playlists. You can also have problems in the connection between your
iPod or iPhone and your computer.
Checking the Hold switch
If your iPod refuses to turn on, check the position of the Hold switch on 
top of the iPod. The Hold switch locks the iPod buttons so that you don’t
accidentally activate them. Slide the Hold switch away from the headphone

connection, hiding the orange layer, to unlock the buttons. (If you see the
orange layer underneath one end of the Hold switch, the switch is still in the
locked position.)
Checking the power
Got power? The battery might not be charged enough. If the battery is too
low for normal operation, the iPod or iPhone doesn’t turn on. Instead, a low
battery screen appears for about three seconds and then disappears. At that
point, your only choice is to connect the iPod or iPhone to an AC power
source, wait for a moment, and then turn the power on by pushing any
button on the iPod or the Home button on the iPhone. If your source of AC
power is your computer, make sure that the computer is on and not set to go
to sleep. The battery icon in the upper right of the display indicates whether
the iPod or iPhone battery is full or recharging. For more information about
maintaining a healthy battery, see Chapter 1.
If your iPod shuffle doesn’t turn on or respond, recharge its battery by con-
necting it to the USB connection on your computer.
Resetting an iPod
This operation resets the operating system of an iPod and restarts the
system. Sometimes when your iPod gets confused or refuses to turn on, you
can fix it by resetting it.
For fifth- or sixth-generation video iPods, iPod nano, fourth-generation
iPods, iPod mini, iPod U2 Special Edition, and color-display iPods, follow
these steps:
1. (Optional) Connect the iPod to a power outlet by using the AC power
adapter.
You can reset your iPod without connecting it to power if it has enough
juice in its battery. However, if you have access to power, it makes sense
to use it because the reset operation uses power.
2. Toggle the Hold switch.
Push the Hold switch to hold (lock) and then set it back to unlock.
3. Press the Menu and Select buttons simultaneously and hold for at
least six seconds or until the Apple logo appears; then release the 
buttons when you see the Apple logo.
The appearance of the Apple logo signals that your iPod is resetting
itself, so you no longer have to hold down the buttons.
368
Part V: Have iPod, Will Travel 

Release the Menu and Select buttons as soon as you see the Apple logo. If
you continue to press the buttons after the logo appears, the iPod displays
the low battery icon, and you must connect it to a power source before using
it again.
For first-, second-, and third-generation iPod models, follow these steps:
1. (Optional) Connect the iPod to a power outlet by using the AC power
adapter.
2. Toggle the Hold switch.
Push the Hold switch to hold (lock) and then set it back to unlock.
3. Press the Menu and Play/Pause buttons simultaneously and hold for
at least five seconds until the Apple logo appears; then release the
buttons when you see the Apple logo.
The appearance of the Apple logo signals that your iPod is resetting
itself, so you no longer have to hold down the buttons.
To reset your iPod shuffle, disconnect it from a computer and switch the
slider on the back to the Off position. The green stripe under the switch
should not be visible. Wait five seconds and then switch the slider back to
the Shuffle Songs or Play in Order position.
After resetting, everything should be back to normal, including your music
and data files.
Resetting an iPhone or iPod touch
Sometimes when your iPhone or iPod touch gets confused or refuses to turn
on, you can fix it by resetting it and restarting the system.
The iPhone and iPod touch run applications. If your iPhone or iPod touch
freezes while running an application (such as Safari), press and hold the
Home button below the screen for at least six seconds, until the application
quits. If the iPhone or iPod touch still doesn’t respond, turn it off by pressing
the Sleep/Wake (On/Off) button on the top, and then press the same button
again to turn it back on.
If that doesn’t work, press and hold the Sleep/Wake button on the top for a
few seconds until a red slider appears on the screen, and then slide the slider
with your finger. Then press and hold the Sleep/Wake button until the Apple
logo appears.
369
Chapter 24: Updating and Troubleshooting

Finally, if none of these options work, reset the iPhone or iPod touch by
pressing and holding the Sleep/Wake button and the Home button at the
same time for at least ten seconds, until the Apple logo appears.
After resetting, everything should be back to normal, including your music
and data files.
You can get more information, updated troubleshooting instructions, and
links to the iPhone repair site by visiting the Apple support site for the
iPhone (www.apple.com/support/iphone).
Draining the battery
Certain types of battery-powered devices sometimes run into problems if the
battery hasn’t drained in a while. In rare cases, an iPod or iPhone might go
dark. Try resetting the iPod or iPhone first. If the device still doesn’t work,
disconnect it from any power source and leave it disconnected for approxi-
mately 24 hours. After this period, connect it to power and reset.
Try to keep your iPod or iPhone at room temperature — generally near 68°
Fahrenheit (F)/20° Celsius (C). However, you can use the iPod or iPhone any-
where between 50–95° F (10–35° C). If you left the iPod or iPhone in the cold,
let it warm up to room temperature before waking it from sleep. Otherwise, a
low-battery icon might appear, and the iPod or iPhone won’t wake up prop-
erly. If the iPod or iPhone doesn’t wake from sleep after warming up, reset the
device as we describe in the preceding section.
Hitting the iPod panic button (Disk Mode)
Hitting the panic button, even if there is one, is never a good idea. However, 
if all you see on your iPod display is the Apple logo and iPod name, and the
device seems to be restarting over and over, try force-enabling your iPod as 
a hard drive. (This is also known as putting your iPod into Disk Mode, which
works for iPods only — not iPhones.)
For current fifth- or sixth-generation video iPods, iPod nano, fourth-generation
iPods, iPod mini, iPod U2 Special Edition, and color-display iPods, follow
these steps:
1. Be sure your iPod is charged with power.
If your iPod needs to be recharged, connect it to a power source as
described in Chapter 1.
370
Part V: Have iPod, Will Travel 

2. Reset the iPod.
If you don’t know how to reset your iPod, see the “Resetting an iPod”
section, earlier in this chapter.
3. When the Apple icon appears on the display, immediately press and
hold the Select and Play/Pause buttons until OK to disconnect and
Disk Mode appears on the iPod display.
4. If your iPod isn’t connected to your computer, disconnect the iPod
from the power adapter and connect it to your computer.
You can now use iTunes to update the iPod software or restore the iPod.
See “Updating Your iPod, iPhone, or Apple TV,” later in this chapter.
If the OK to disconnect and Disk Mode messages don’t appear, repeat
Steps 2 and 3. (You might need to press the buttons more quickly.) If the mes-
sage still doesn’t appear after repeating these steps, the iPod might need to
be repaired.
For first-, second-, and third-generation iPod models, follow these steps:
1. Connect the iPod to your computer’s FireWire or powered USB con-
nection, or to an AC power adapter.
This procedure doesn’t work with older USB connections that don’t pro-
vide power. Make sure the computer is on and isn’t set to go to sleep.
2. Reset the iPod.
If you’re not sure how to reset your iPod, see the “Resetting an iPod”
section earlier in this chapter.
3. When the Apple icon appears on the display, immediately press and
hold the Previous and Next buttons until the Do not disconnect
message or FireWire icon appears.
4. If your iPod isn’t connected to your computer, disconnect the iPod
from the power adapter and connect it to your computer.
Some iPods show the message OK to Disconnect before you connect
it to the computer. This changes to the Do not disconnect message
after you connect it.
You can now use iTunes to update the iPod software or restore the iPod.
See “Updating Your iPod, iPhone, or Apple TV,” later in this chapter.
If the Do not disconnect message or FireWire icon doesn’t appear, repeat
Steps 2 and 3. (You might need to press the buttons more quickly.) If the mes-
sage or FireWire icon still doesn’t appear, the iPod might need to be repaired.
371
Chapter 24: Updating and Troubleshooting

After using the iPod in Disk Mode, you need to reset the iPod (as described 
in “Resetting an iPod” earlier in this chapter) to return your iPod to normal
operation.
You can get more information, updated troubleshooting instructions, and
links to the iPod repair site by visiting the Apple support site for the iPod
(www.apple.com/support/ipod).
Updating Your iPod, iPhone, or Apple TV
When you turn on your iPod or iPhone, built-in startup diagnostic software
checks the device’s software for problems and attempts to repair the soft-
ware if necessary. If the iPod or iPhone finds an issue while it’s on, it automat-
ically uses internal diagnostics to repair any damage. You might see a disk
scan icon on your iPod or iPhone screen after turning it on, indicating that a
problem was fixed. If you see this indicator, update your iPod or iPhone soft-
ware with iTunes.
iTunes updates the software that controls the iPod or iPhone without affect-
ing the music or data stored on an iPod drive.
If you use MusicMatch Jukebox rather than iTunes on your Windows PC, skip
this section and see this book’s companion Web site.
Make sure that you use the newest version of iTunes. To check for the avail-
ability of an updated version for Windows, choose Help➪Check for iTunes
Updates.
If you use a Mac and you enabled the Software Update option in your System
Preferences, Apple automatically informs you of updates to your Apple soft-
ware for the Mac, including iTunes, iCal, and Address Book. All you need to
do is select which updates to download and then click the Install button to
download them. iTunes includes updates for all generations of iPods and can
detect which model iPod you have.
Checking the software version
To determine which version of iPod software is installed on your iPod, choose
Settings➪About from the iPod main menu. (With first- and second-generation
iPods, choose Settings➪Info.) Similarly, on an iPhone, choose Settings from
the Home menu, then General from the Settings menu, and then About from
the General menu. Next to the word Version is information that describes
the software version installed.
372
Part V: Have iPod, Will Travel 

You can also determine the software version on your iPod or iPhone by using
iTunes. Connect the iPod or iPhone to your computer and select the iPod or
iPhone in the iTunes Source pane (in the Devices section). The device’s sum-
mary page appears to the right of the Source pane, and the software version
appears next to the Software Version heading at the top of the page.
Updating with newer software
iTunes tells you whether your iPod or iPhone has the newest software installed.
Connect the iPod or iPhone to your computer and select it in the iTunes Source
pane (in the Devices section). The iPod or iPhone summary page appears to the
right of the Source pane, and the Version section of the page tells you whether
your iPod or iPhone software is up to date and when iTunes will check for new
software. (See Figure 24-1.) You can check for new software at any time by click-
ing the Check for Update button on the Summary page.
Some iPod models need to be disconnected from the computer temporarily
and connected to a power source to finish the process of updating the soft-
ware. Follow the instructions to disconnect your iPod and connect it to an 
AC power adapter, if required.
Figure 24-1:
Use iTunes
to update 
or restore
your iPod.

Chapter 24: Updating and Troubleshooting

Restoring to factory conditions
Restoring an iPod or iPhone erases the hard drive and returns the device to
its factory settings, so make sure that you back up any important data that
you keep stored on the device. To replace content that was erased by the
restore operation, synchronize your iPod or iPhone from your computer’s
iTunes library, as we describe in Chapter 12.
To restore an iPod or iPhone, follow these steps for both the Mac and
Windows versions of iTunes:
1. Connect the iPod or iPhone to your computer.
iTunes opens automatically.
2. Select the iPod or iPhone in the Source pane in the Devices section.
The device’s Summary page appears to the right of the Source pane,
replacing the browse/list view.
3. Click the Restore button.
An alert dialog appears to confirm that you want to restore the device.
4. Click the Restore button again to confirm the restore operation.
A progress bar appears, indicating the progress of the restore operation.
5. For some iPod models, follow the instructions to disconnect your iPod
and connect it to an AC power adapter, if required.
You might need to disconnect an iPod temporarily and connect it to an
AC power adapter after the restore operation and during the process of
updating the software. If you see a message asking you to disconnect the
iPod, follow the instructions displayed with the message. You might also
need to reconnect the iPod to the computer after this process.
iTunes notifies you when the restore is finished.
6. Synchronize your iPod or iPhone with content from your iTunes
library.
Synchronize your iPod or iPhone with the content in your library, or
manually manage your content, as we describe in Chapter 12. You can
also copy data to the iPod while it’s mounted as a hard drive (but not to
an iPhone); see Chapter 22.
7. When you finish synchronizing the iPod or iPhone with content and
data, eject the device by clicking the Eject button.

Updating an Apple TV
Apple TV can access the Internet through your wireless or Ethernet network,
so the device can automatically check whether new software is available.
Apple TV checks the Apple update server on a weekly schedule. When Apple
TV detects an update, it downloads the update automatically and displays on
your TV the message “An update is available for your Apple TV, do you want
to install it now?” Apple TV then displays on your TV two choices: Update
Now, or for you procrastinators out there, Update Later. Choose either option
using your Apple Remote.
You don’t have to wait for Apple TV to check for an update. You can update
Apple TV at any time by choosing Settings➪Update Software from the Apple
TV main menu using your Apple Remote. To check the software version run-
ning in Apple TV, choose Settings➪About.

U
nfortunately, humans — as well as the machines that they make — 
are not perfect. Even though we think that the iPod comes as close to
perfection as possible, at some point, your iPod isn’t going to work like you
expect it to. When that happens, turn to this chapter. Here, we show you how
to fix the most common iPod problems.
How Do I Get My iPod to Wake Up?
If your iPod doesn’t turn on, don’t panic — at least not yet. Try the following
suggestions to get your iPod to respond:
 Check the Hold switch position on top of the iPod. The Hold switch
locks the iPod buttons so you don’t accidentally activate them. Slide the
Hold switch away from the headphone connection, hiding the orange
layer, to unlock the buttons.
 See whether the iPod has enough juice. Is the battery charged?
Connect the iPod to a power source and see whether it works.
 Reset your iPod if the iPod still doesn’t turn on. See Chapter 24 for
resetting instructions.
If your iPod shuffle doesn’t turn on or respond, recharge its battery by con-
necting it to the USB connection on your computer. If the iPod shuffle status
light blinks orange when you press a button, the buttons are disabled. Press
and hold the Play/Pause button for at least three seconds or until the status
light blinks green.

How Do I Get My Battery to Last Longer?
You can do a lot to keep your battery going longer (much to the envy of your
friends), including the following:
 Press the Play/Pause button to pause (stop) playback. Don’t just turn
off your car or home stereo or remove your headphones because if you
don’t also pause playback, your iPod continues playing until the playlist
or album ends. When playback is paused, the power-save feature turns
off the iPod after two minutes of inactivity.
 Press and hold the Play/Pause button to turn off the iPod when you’re
not using it. Rather than waiting for two minutes of inactivity for the
power-save feature to turn off the iPod, turn it off yourself to save bat-
tery time.
 Turn off backlighting. If you don’t need to use backlighting, turn it off
because it drains battery power if the iPod is not plugged into a power
source.
 Set the Hold switch to lock when you’re not using your iPod. Keep
your iPod controls locked so that they don’t accidentally get turned on
when you’re not using your iPod.
 Avoid changing tracks by pressing the Previous/Rewind or Next/
Fast-Forward buttons. The iPod uses a memory cache to load and play
songs. If you frequently change tracks by pressing the Previous or Next
buttons, the cache has to turn on the hard drive to load and play the
songs, which drains the battery.
 Use compressed AAC or MP3 files. Playing larger, uncompressed AIFF
or WAV files takes more power because the hard drive inside the iPod
has to refresh its memory buffers more frequently to process more infor-
mation as the song plays. Playing Apple Lossless files, even though
they’re compressed, also depletes battery power a bit more than playing
AAC or MP3 files.
How Do I Keep My Scroll Wheel 
from Going Crazy?
Occasionally, an iPod scroll wheel stops working properly. If the scroll wheel
doesn’t scroll, try resetting the iPod, as described in Chapter 24. Remember:
Resetting the iPod doesn’t change an iPod’s contents. After resetting, the
iPod should work properly.
380
Part VI: The Part of Tens 

Second- and third-generation iPods use a nonmoving scroll wheel that works
like a trackpad (also sometimes called a touchpad) of a laptop computer.
Although the trackpad-style scroll wheel is far better than the first-generation
moving wheel (which could be hampered by sand or dirt, and had moving
parts that could be damaged), it has problems of its own: It goes crazy some-
times, and it can be very sensitive (not necessarily to criticism, but to the
touch of your finger).
The trackpad-style scroll wheel translates the electrical charge from your
finger into movement on the iPod display. If you accidentally use more than
one finger, the scroll wheel might misread the signal and skip over selections
or go backward while scrolling forward, and so on. Maintenance tip: If the
scroll wheel has excessive moisture on it from humidity or a wet hand, wipe
the wheel with a soft, dry cloth.
Don’t use pencil erasers, pen caps, or other types of pointers to scroll the
scroll wheel. (They won’t work with trackpad-style scroll wheels, and using
these might damage other types of scroll wheels.) And don’t scroll with fin-
gers sporting rings or a hand with a heavy bracelet or similar jewelry
because these metals can throw off the sensors in the scroll wheel.
How Do I Get My Computer 
to Recognize My iPod?
If you can’t get your computer to recognize your iPod, follow the first trou-
bleshooting steps outlined in Chapter 24. If these steps don’t fix the problem,
make sure that your iPod is securely connected to your computer’s USB 
connection (or FireWire connection in older models), and that it is the only
device using that connection. (If you use a hub to share devices, try not using
the hub to see whether it works without the hub.)
If you’re using MusicMatch Jukebox, go to this book’s companion Web site for
more troubleshooting tips.
Also, make sure that your USB or FireWire cable is in good condition for con-
necting to your computer. For iPods that work with either FireWire or USB,
try one type of connection or the other; if one connection type works but not
the other, the problem is probably not in your iPod. Try connecting your iPod
to another computer by using the same type of connection to see whether
the same problem occurs. (Your computer might be to blame.)
381
Chapter 25: Ten iPod Problems and Solutions

If the same type of connection (FireWire or USB) to the other computer
works, the problem is most likely your computer’s connection or software. If
the same type of connection doesn’t work, the problem is most likely your
cable or connection. You can try a new cable to see whether that works, or
try the same type of connection with a different computer. Even if these sug-
gestions seem obvious, doing them in the correct order can help you diag-
nose the problem.
What Are These Strange 
Icons on My iPod?
If you see an icon of a circle with a diagonal line across it, you should also see
the words Do not disconnect. Don’t do anything until the iPod finishes its
update and displays the main menu or the OK to disconnect message. If
this symbol stays on for a very, very long time (like, 20 minutes), try resetting
the iPod, as described in Chapter 24.
Other strange icons might appear. When you turn on your iPod, built-in diag-
nostic software checks the iPod hard drive. If the iPod finds a problem when
it’s turned on, it automatically uses internal diagnostics to check for and
repair any damage. You might see a disk folder icon on your iPod screen after
turning it on, indicating that a problem was fixed. If this happens, restore
your iPod to its factory condition (see Chapter 24) and reload content into it.
If the iPod displays any other strange icon, such as a backward Apple logo, a
disk icon with a flashing question mark, or the dreaded disk-with-magnifying
glass icon, the device might need to be repaired. If you get the “sad iPod”
icon (with a frown and asterisks for eyes) or the folder icon with an exclama-
tion point, try the troubleshooting steps in Chapter 24. If nothing seems to
work, the iPod probably needs to be repaired. You can arrange for repair by
visiting the Apple support site for the iPod
(www.apple.com/support/ipod).
How Do I Restore My iPod 
to Its Factory Condition?
Restoring an iPod erases its hard drive and returns the device to its factory
condition. Accordingly, make sure that you back up any important data
stored on your iPod. You can use iTunes to restore your iPod, as we describe
in Chapter 24. When finished, add music back to your iPod from the iTunes
library or from your MusicMatch Jukebox library and then resynchronize
your iPod with calendar and contact information.
382
Part VI: The Part of Tens 

If you’re using MusicMatch Jukebox, check out this book’s companion Web
site to find out how to fill your iPod with music.
How Do I Update My iPod Software?
To determine which software version is installed on your iPod, press the
Menu button until you see the iPod main menu. Then choose Settings➪
About; in earlier versions, choose Settings➪Info. Look at the version number
that describes the software version installed on your iPod. You can use
iTunes to check which software version you’re using and to update or restore
your iPod (see Chapter 26).
How Do I Synchronize My iPod 
When My Library Is Larger 
Than My iPod’s Capacity?
If you have less space on your iPod than content in your iTunes library, you
can synchronize selected content only, or manually manage music and videos
on your iPod. You can also select specific photo albums or videos, or select
to specific playlists, rather than copying everything.
When you synchronize by playlist, you can create playlists exclusively for
your iPod. You can also limit a smart playlist to a certain size: for example,
3.7GB (for a 4GB iPod nano).
By combining the features of smart playlists (Chapter 10) and synchronizing
by playlist (Chapter 12), you can control how much of your iTunes library
content is copied to and deleted from your iPod. You can even create multiple
iTunes libraries — including sublibraries, based on your complete library —
that you can set up for automatically synchronizing different iPods, as we
describe in Chapter 13.
You can also keep your iPod synchronized to a subset of your library based
on ratings. iTunes creates a new playlist specially designed for updating your
iPod automatically — a smart playlist named “your iPod name Selection.”
iTunes decides which songs and albums to include in this playlist by using
the ratings that you can set for each song in the iTunes song information, as
we describe in Chapter 9.
383
Chapter 25: Ten iPod Problems and Solutions

How Do I Cross-Fade Music 
Playback with My iPod?
You can fade the ending of one song into the beginning of the next one to
slightly overlap songs, just like a radio DJ, when you use iTunes. The cross-
fade setting is the amount of time between the end of the fade-out from the
first song and the start of the fade-in to the second song.
To cross-fade songs on your iPod, you have to play your iPod songs through
iTunes on your computer. Connect your iPod to your computer and then con-
nect your computer to a stereo or connect speakers (or headphones) to your
computer. Press Ô-Option (Mac) or Ctrl-Alt (Windows) when you launch
iTunes; then select iPod in the iTunes Source pane.
If you’re playing songs on an iPod that’s connected to your computer and
also playing songs from your iTunes library (or even on a second iPod, both
connected to your computer), your songs cross-fade automatically.
You can change this cross-fade setting by choosing iTunes➪Preferences
(Mac) or Edit➪Preferences (Windows) and then clicking the Playback tab.
You can then increase or decrease the amount of the cross-fade with the
Crossfade Playback option.
How Do I Decrease Distortion 
or Set a Lower Volume?
iPod models designed for the United States have a powerful 60-milliwatt
amplifier to deliver audio signals through the headphone connection. The
amplifier has a frequency response of 20 hertz (Hz) to 20 kilohertz (kHz),
which provides distortion-free music at the lowest or highest pitches, but 
the amplifier might cause distortion at maximum volume depending on the
recorded material — and potential ear drum damage.
For optimal sound quality, set the iPod volume to no more than three-quar-
ters of the maximum volume and adjust your listening volume by using the
volume control or equivalent on your car stereo or portable speaker system.
(If no volume control exists, you have no choice but to control the volume
from the iPod.) By lowering the iPod from maximum volume, you give your
ears a break and also prevent over-amplification, which can cause distortion
and reduce audio quality. See Chapter 15 for details on how to set the iPod
volume limit and adjust the iPod volume.

Eleven Tips for the Equalizer
In This Chapter
 Adjusting the equalizer on your home stereo
 Taking advantage of the iPod equalizer preset
 Getting rid of unwanted noise
You play your iPod in many environments, but the song that sounds like
music to your ears in your car might sound like screeching hyenas when
you’re on a plane. In this chapter, we show you how to fix most sound prob-
lems that occur with iPods. Soon, you’ll be cruising to the beat all the time —
no matter where you are.
Setting the Volume to the Right Level
Before using the iPod equalizer to refine the sound, make sure the volume 
of the iPod is set to no more than about half or three-quarters of its max so
you don’t introduce distortion. (See Chapter 15 for details on how to set the
volume limit and also adjust volume.) Then set your speaker system or home
stereo volume before trying to refine the sound with equalizers.
Adjusting Another Equalizer
When you have the iPod connected to another system with an equalizer, try
adjusting that equalizer:
 Home stereo system: Refine the sound with your home stereo equalizer
because that might offer more flexibility and can be set precisely for the
listening environment.
 Car stereos: The same rule applies as with your home stereo: Adjust the
car stereo equalizer when you begin to listen to music on your iPod —
before adjusting your iPod equalizer.

Setting Booster Presets
When playing music with your iPod through a home stereo or speakers 
(without a built-in equalizer) in a heavily draped and furnished room, try
using the iPod Treble Booster equalizer preset or create your own equalizer
preset (see Chapter 17) that raises the frequencies above 1 kilohertz (kHz).
Boosting these higher frequencies makes the music sound naturally alive.
Reducing High Frequencies
When using your iPod to play music through a home stereo (without a built-
in equalizer) in a room with smooth, hard walls and concrete floors, you
might want to use the iPod Treble Reducer equalizer preset, which reduces
the high frequencies to make the sound less brittle.
Increasing Low Frequencies
If you use high-quality, acoustic-suspension compact speakers, you might
need to add a boost to the low frequencies (bass) with the Bass Booster
equalizer preset so that you can boogie with the beat a little better. The 
Small Speakers equalizer preset also boosts the low frequencies and lowers
the high frequencies to give you a fuller sound.
Setting Presets for Trucks and SUVs
We use our iPods in different types of cars: a sedan and a 4-wheel-drive truck.
Trucks need more bass and treble, and the Rock equalizer preset sounds
good for most of the music that we listen to. We also recommend using the
Bass Booster equalizer preset when using your iPod in a truck if the Rock
preset doesn’t boost the bass enough. In a sedan, the iPod sounds fine with-
out any equalizer adjustment.
Setting Presets When You’re 
Eight Miles High
When using your iPod on an airplane where jet noise is a factor, try using the
Bass Booster equalizer preset to hear the lower frequencies in your headphones
386
Part VI: The Part of Tens 

and compensate for the deficiencies of headphones in loud environments. You
might want to use the Classical equalizer preset, which boosts both the high
and low frequencies for extra treble and bass. Try the Bose QuietComfort 3
Acoustic Noise Canceling headphones (www.bose.com) for plane travel — 
they work great!
If you’re in an unpressurized environment at or above 10,000 feet — such as 
on a mountain peak — don’t try to use a full-size iPod. Leave it turned off. Like
many laptops, iPods that use hard drives can fail if operated at altitudes above
10,000 feet. The drive heads float above the recording surface on a small cush-
ion of air produced by the spinning platters. If the air is too thin to create this
cushion, the heads may contact the surface, possibly even damaging it.
Reducing Tape Noise and Scratch Sounds
To reduce the hiss of an old recording or the scratchy sound of songs
recorded from a record, reduce the highest frequencies with the Treble
Reducer equalizer preset.
Reducing Turntable Rumble and Hum
To reduce the low-frequency rumble in songs recorded from a turntable or
recorded with a hum pickup, choose the Bass Reducer equalizer preset.
Reducing Off-Frequency Harshness 
and Nasal Vocals
To reduce a particularly nasal vocal sound reminiscent of Donald Duck
(caused by off-frequency recording of the song source, making the song 
more harsh-sounding), try using the R&B equalizer preset, which reduces 
the midrange frequencies while boosting all the other frequencies.
Cranking Up the Volume to Eleven
If you want that larger-than-life sound, use the Loudness preset and then jack
up the Preamp slider to the max, turn your stereo all the way up, and put
your fingers in your ears to protect them. Then consult the DVD This Is Spinal
Tap or the Spinal Tap fan site at http://spinaltapfan.com.

Earlier iPod Models 
and Connections
In This Chapter
 Comparing earlier iPod models
 Using USB and FireWire Connections
T
he iPod family has grown by six generations as of this writing. Today’s
iPod and iPhone works with iTunes on either Windows computers or
Macs, but that wasn’t always the case. The first-generation iPods worked only
with Macs. In 2002, Apple introduced the second generation — one version
for Windows and another for the Mac, using the same design for both. For the
third generation (2003), Apple changed the design once again.
Third-, fourth-, and fifth-generation iPods — as well as offshoots, such as 
iPod mini, iPod nano, and iPod shuffle — work with either Windows or Mac
and come in a variety of hard drive or flash memory sizes. One way to tell
what kind of iPod you have is by its navigational controls. By design, you can
hold an iPod in your hand while you thumb the scroll wheel (my generic term
for scroll wheel, scroll pad, touch wheel, or click wheel). The LCD screen on
full-size models offers backlighting so that you can see it in the dark. The
iPhone lets you tap the sensitive display with your finger to select items and
functions, and flick with your finger to scroll or move the display.
For a nifty chart that shows the differences between iPod models, see
the Identifying Different iPod Models page on the Apple iPod Web site
(http://docs.info.apple.com/article.html?artnum=61688).
Second-generation and third-generation iPod models can be synchronized
with a Windows PC using Musicmatch Jukebox version 7.5, which was pro-
vided on CD-ROM with some second-generation models before iTunes
became available for Windows. However, a newer version of this software,
renamed Yahoo! Music Jukebox, does not work directly with iPods. 

First-Generation iPods
Apple doesn’t sell first-generation iPods anymore, but you might see a few on
eBay. More likely, their proud owners are Mac users who still find them
useful. Despite its original price tag ($399), which was pricey compared with
other MP3 players, the first 5GB iPod (with 5GB of storage space) was an
unqualified success when it was introduced in October 2001. Apple sold more
than 125,000 units within 60 days. “Listening to music will never be the same
again,” Apple CEO Steve Jobs told the press at the introduction of the first
iPod, and he was right. Months later, Apple introduced the 10GB model.
First-generation iPods work only with Macs, connecting to a Mac with a stan-
dard FireWire/IEEE 1394 cable. The first generation offers a distinctive scroll
wheel that physically turns with your finger as you use it. These early iPods
are hefty at 6.5 ounces and have a stainless-steel back and dual-plastic top
casing.
FireWire is called IEEE 1394 by the engineers who designed it and DV terminal
by camcorder manufacturers that use it, except Sony, which calls it i.Link.
These models don’t offer all the features of newer generations and can’t be
used with accessories that are designed for newer generations. For example,
you can’t expect these older models to use extensions such as voice
recorders and memory card readers. First-generation models can’t be
updated to version 2 or newer versions of the iPod software, so they also lack
support for features such as adding notes to the iPod and setting up an on-
the-go playlist. However, battery life is comparable to newer models, offering
up to eight hours before requiring a recharge. (For more about battery life,
see Chapter 1 of the book.)
The main menu for first--generation iPods offers the following selections:
 Playlists: Select a playlist to play.
 Browse: Select music by playlist, artist, album, song, genre, or com-
poser; or select an audio book.
 Extras: View and set the clock and alarm clock, view contacts, view your
calendar, view notes, and play games.
 Settings: Set display settings, menu settings, the backlight timer, the
clicker, and the date and time.
 Backlight: Turn on or off the backlighting for the iPod display.
 Now Playing: This selection appears only when a song is playing — it
takes you to the Now Playing display.

iPod & iTunes For Dummies, 5th Edition 

Second-Generation iPods
Apple introduced a second-generation design in the form of two models: the
20GB iPod for the Mac and the 10GB for Windows. The Windows model of the
second generation shipped with Musicmatch Jukebox — see Bonus Chapter 2
for more details on using MusicMatch. Apple doesn’t sell these anymore
either, but you might find a used one on the Internet.
Second-generation models use an innovative solid-state touch wheel that
doesn’t physically turn as you use it; instead, it responds to finger pressure.
These models use a FireWire connection to connect to the computer with a
six-pin FireWire cable.
Second-generation models can’t be updated to version 2 or newer versions of
the iPod software, so they don’t offer all the features of the third, fourth, and
fifth generation and can’t be used with dock-connector and voice recorder
accessories designed for newer models. Although standard FireWire acces-
sories (such as power adapters for automobiles) are available for these
models, digital camera accessories such as memory card readers are not
available as of this writing.
The main menu for second-generation iPods offers the following selections:
 Playlists: Select a playlist to play.
 Browse: Select music by playlist, artist, album, song, genre, or com-
poser; or select an audio book.
 Extras: View and set the clock and alarm clock, view contacts, view your
calendar, view notes, and play games.
 Settings: Set display settings, menu settings, the backlight timer, the
clicker, and the date and time.
 Backlight: Turn on or off the backlighting for the iPod display.
 Now Playing: This selection appears only when a song is playing — it
takes you to the Now Playing display.
Third-Generation iPods
The third-generation models include the 10GB, 15GB, and 30GB models intro-
duced in 2003, and the 20GB and 40GB models introduced later in that same
year. All have been discontinued. All third-generation models share the same
basic features and work with Mac or Windows, and Apple continually pro-
vides software updates for these models.
BC3
Bonus Chapter 1: Earlier iPod Models and Connections

Models of the third generation are thinner than the second generation and
use touch-sensitive buttons with audible feedback (replacing the pressure-
sensitive buttons of the second generation that offer tactile feedback). The
touch-sensitive buttons above the scroll wheel perform simple functions
when you touch them. 
Third-generation models also use a dock connector to connect to a computer
or power supply; see Figure B1-1. The dock keeps your iPod in an upright
position while connected and lets you connect a home stereo or headphones.
This makes the dock convenient as a base station when you’re not traveling
with your iPod because you can slip the iPod into the dock without connect-
ing cables.
The dock didn’t come standard with the 15GB model, but you can order it as
an extra from the Apple Store.
The (typically) supplied cables connect to the dock on one end (or to an
iPod itself if you don’t use a dock) and connect to a computer or power
supply on the other end, using standard FireWire or USB 2.0 connections.
USB (Universal Serial Bus) is a widely used hardware interface for attaching
peripheral devices. Nearly all PCs and all Macs offer USB 2.0 connections, but
some offer only USB 1.0, which you can use to synchronize or transfer con-
tent to your iPod but not to provide power to the iPod.

Some third-generation models included a FireWire cable but didn’t include
the USB cable in the box. You can order one from the Apple Store for about
$20.
Third-generation full-size iPod models don’t support USB 2.0 on the Mac; you
must use FireWire.
Third-generation models offer the following menu selections:
 Music: Select music by playlist, artist, album, song, genre, or composer;
or select an audio book.
 Playlists: Select a playlist to play.
 Extras: View and set the clock and alarm clock; view contacts, your cal-
endar, or notes; and play games.
 Settings: Set display settings, menu settings, the backlight timer, the
clicker, and the date and time.
 Backlight: Turn on or off the backlighting for the iPod display.
 Now Playing: This selection appears only when a song is playing — it
takes you to the Now Playing display.
iPod mini
iPod mini, an offshoot of the third generation, is small enough to fit in a shirt
pocket; see Figure B1-2. Its smooth, ultra-thin, anodized aluminum case came
in five different colors. Apple has phased out iPod mini (replaced essentially
by iPod nano). The original model houses a 4GB drive that can hold about
1,000 songs — as much as the original 5GB model. Newer models sport a 6GB
drive that holds about 1,500 songs.
iPod mini can fit more songs in the same amount of space because Apple
introduced a better compression format — namely, Advanced Audio Coding
(AAC) — in second-generation models. The AAC format can also be used in
older models. When Apple introduced AAC, the capacity of all models
increased. See Chapter 18 of the book for more information about AAC.
Besides its smaller size (and therefore, smaller dock), another of iPod mini’s
distinguishing characteristics is the click wheel, which offers the same func-
tions as the third-generation iPod touch wheel but is more suitable for such a
small device. The click wheel combines the scroll wheel and buttons, with
pressure-sensitive buttons underneath the top, bottom, left, and right areas
of the circular pad of the wheel.

Bonus Chapter 1: Earlier iPod Models and Connections

iPod mini has the same features as full-size third-generation iPods except that
it uses a different set of accessories because of its size, and it offers up to 18
hours of battery time between charges. 
The main menu for the iPod mini offers the following selections:
 Playlists: Select a playlist to play.
 Browse: Select music by playlist, artist, album, song, genre, or com-
poser; or select an audio book.

Fourth-Generation and
Color-Display iPods
In 2004, Apple introduced a fourth-generation iPod that uses the same click
wheel and buttons that iPod mini uses. Fourth-generation iPod software
includes the ability to randomly shuffle song playback with the press of a
button, and to charge up the iPod through the USB connection to your com-
puter. The fourth-generation iPods were at first available in 40GB and 20GB
models with black-and-white displays. Later in 2004, Apple offered 30GB and
60GB models with color displays that can store photos and display slideshows.
The fifth-generation models have replaced the fourth generation, but you can
find these in some stores and used ones on the Internet.
The fourth-generation units with black-and-white displays offer up to 12
hours of battery time between charges. You can play up to 15 hours of contin-
uous music on a color-display iPod between charges or up to five hours of
continuous slideshows with music. The battery is the same type as used in
other models; the improvement is in how the software manages power in the
iPod. Like third-generation iPods, the fourth generation also uses a dock con-
nector to connect the iPod to a computer or power supply, and the dock
itself is available separately from the Apple Store. The fourth-generation
iPods connect to computers by using either FireWire or USB connections.
Fourth-generation iPod models differ from earlier models by offering a top-
level Music choice on the main menu and the ability to create multiple on-
the-go playlists. You can also play audio books at slower or faster speeds
while maintaining natural-sounding pitch.
The iPod color-display models of the fourth generation, including the earliest
model known as iPod photo, let you store and view color digital photos as well
as store and play sound. These models also do everything a fourth-generation
iPod can do and use the same accessories. Apple offered a 20GB model and a
60GB model that can hold up to 15,000 songs and full-color album cover art
(or as many as 25,000 photos).
The 60GB iPod with color display uses the same click wheel and buttons that
iPod mini uses. The color display provides crisp definition for the iPod’s
menus, making them easier to read, even in sunlight.
The iPod color display, at 220 x 176 pixel resolution and over 65,000 colors,
offers excellent viewing with built-in backlighting. With the optional AV cable,
you can connect the iPod to a television monitor or video projector for a
video-quality slideshow. It even optimizes your photos to fit on a standard
(4:3 ratio) or widescreen (16:9 ratio) TV.
The iPod main menu for fourth-generation models and iPod nano is the same
as fifth-generation models but without the Videos selection.

Fifth-Generation iPods with Video
Apple shook the world once again in late 2005 by introducing a new genera-
tion of iPod that plays video along with music and photos. The fifth-generation
iPod is a bit slimmer than the previous generation while adding a generous
2.5-inch color display that offers remarkable picture clarity for video content.
All fifth-generation iPods use the same click wheel and buttons as the fourth-
generation models, combining the scroll wheel with pressure-sensitive but-
tons underneath the top, bottom, left, and right areas of the circular pad of
the wheel, as shown in Figure B1-3. Apple offered a slim, 4.8-ounce 30GB
model and a 5.5-ounce 80GB model, which are still available in electronics
stores.
The 30GB model holds about 7,500 songs or about 40 hours of video, and its
battery offers up to 14 hours of music playback, 4 hours of slideshows with
music, or 3.5 hours of video playback. The 80GB model holds about 20,000
songs or about 100 hours of video, and its battery offers up to 20 hours of
music playback, 6 hours of slideshows with music, or 6.5 hours of video play-
back. Both models hold up to 25,000 photos.

iPod & iTunes For Dummies, 5th Edition 

The 60GB fifth-generation iPod, offered in 2005, holds about 15,000 songs or
about 150 hours of video, and its battery offers up to 20 hours of music play-
back, 4 hours of slideshows with music, or 3 hours of video playback.
You can put videos on your fifth-generation iPod by using iTunes. You can
even get some of your favorite TV shows, plus music videos and full-length
movies, directly from the iTunes Store. The color display provides crisp defi-
nition for the iPod’s menus, making them easier to read, even in sunlight. The
iPod color display, at 320 x 240–pixel resolution and more than 65,000 colors,
offers excellent viewing with built-in backlighting. With the optional AV cable,
you can connect the iPod to a television monitor or video projector to show
videos and slideshows. It even optimizes your photos to fit on a standard (4:3
ratio) or widescreen (16:9 ratio) TV.
Like third- and fourth-generation iPods, the fifth generation also uses a dock
connector to connect the iPod to a computer or power supply, and the dock
itself is available separately from the Apple Store. The dock keeps your iPod
in an upright position while connected and lets you connect a home stereo or
headphones. This makes the dock convenient as a base station when you’re
not traveling with your iPod because you can slip the iPod into the dock with-
out connecting cables.
The Original iPod nano
The first version of the iPod nano is pencil-thin (0.26 inch) and 3.5 x 1.6 inches
in size. It weighs only 1.4 ounces, but packed into this mini marvel is a 1.5-
inch color LCD display that crisply displays the iPod menus and album art-
work. At one time Apple offered a 2GB model that holds about 500 songs,
a 4GB model (as shown in Figure B1-4) that holds about 1,000 songs, and
an 8GB model that holds about 2,000 songs. Many of these models are still
available in stores.
Previously, Apple offered a 1GB model that holds about 240 songs, a 2GB
model that holds about 500 songs, and a 4GB model that holds 1,000 songs.
Each model offers a battery that can play up to 24 hours of music — all day
and all of the night — or 5 hours of slideshows with music. You read that
right — the little wonder can also display photos just like full-size color-
display iPods. It is also the smallest iPod that can serve up your personal 
calendar and contacts. Unlike the smaller iPod shuffle, iPod nano is a full-
featured iPod with loads of accessories tailored specifically for it.
iPod nano uses the same style of click wheel and buttons as the fifth-generation
models. Like fifth-generation iPods, iPod nano also uses a dock connector to
connect to a computer or power supply.

The Original iPod shuffle
The original iPod shuffle is 3.3 inches long, less than 1 inch wide, and about
one-third of an inch thick. It weighs only 0.78 ounce, which is little more than
a car key or a pack of gum. You can hang it from your ears with the supplied
earbuds and wear it around your neck like a necklace. You can still find them
for sale in retail outlets and used ones on eBay, but Apple replaced the origi-
nal with the much smaller clip-on model. 
The original iPod shuffle, at 512MB, holds 120 songs, assuming an average of
4 minutes per song, using the AAC format at the High Quality setting (as
described in Chapter 18). Its battery offers up to 12 hours of power between
charges.
Unlike other iPods, iPod shuffle can’t play tunes in the highest-quality Audio
Interchange File Format (AIFF) or Apple Lossless formats, which consume a
lot of storage space. See Chapter 18 for more details on encoding formats.
Underneath the cap on the tip of the original iPod shuffle model is a conve-
nient connector that links the older iPod shuffle to a computer or to an
optional power supply and supplies power for recharging its battery. You
don’t need a separate cable.

Using USB or FireWire Connections
Current fifth-generation iPods and the iPhone, iPod shuffle models, and iPod
nano models use a USB cable to connect to computers with USB 1.0, 1.1, or
2.0 connections. USB 2.0 is faster and also provides power to the iPod. You
can use either a FireWire or a USB cable to connect a fifth-generation iPod,
iPhone, or iPod nano to the AC power supply, but you must use USB to syn-
chronize these iPods with your computer. 
The older USB 1.0 and 1.1 connections work for synchronizing your iPod, but
don’t provide power to the iPod. If all you have is an older USB connection,
you can use it to synchronize your fifth-generation iPod, iPhone, iPod shuffle
or iPod nano, and then use a FireWire cable (available from the Apple Store)
to provide power by connecting it to a FireWire-compatible AC power
adapter.
FireWire is another high-speed connection and power cable, supported by
older iPod generations for connecting and synchronizing with a computer.
First- and second-generation models offer only a standard FireWire connec-
tion — you use a standard Mac-style FireWire cable to connect the iPod to
the Mac’s FireWire connection. Plug the six-pin connector of a standard
FireWire cable into the iPod, and plug the six-pin connector on the other end
to the FireWire port on your Mac. (The six-pin connector is marked by the Y
symbol that resembles a radiation symbol.)
USB and FireWire have been a part of every Mac since at least 2000, so you
don’t need to add anything to your computer. Most PCs already have USB 2.0,
which is all you need to provide power to your fifth-generation iPod, iPhone,
iPod shuffle, or iPod nano, and to synchronize it with your PC. However, if
you have a Windows PC without FireWire and an older model iPod that uses
FireWire, you can add FireWire support to your PC. FireWire/IEEE 1394 expan-
sion cards are available for PCs in various formats: Some offer the standard
six-pin port found on Macs, and some offer a four-pin port that is also used in
camcorders. If your card has a six-pin port, you can plug your iPod FireWire
cable directly into it. The FireCard 400 CardBus card from Unibrain (www.
unibrain.com) plugs into a PC desktop or laptop CardBus slot (laptop PCs
made as far back as 1999 offer CardBus slots). Desktop PCs typically let you
add expansion cards inside the PC, and there are many IEEE 1394 expansion
cards available on the market. Before you buy a FireWire/IEEE 1394 card,
make sure that it’s compatible with your hardware and operating system.
Apple offers approved FireWire expansion cards at the online Apple Store.
For cards with four-pin ports, Apple provides the FireWire cable adapter, as
shown in Figure B1-5, and you can hook it up to the standard six-pin connec-
tor at the end of your FireWire cable. The small four-pin connector on the
adapter plugs into the four-pin port on the FireWire card. Then plug the other
end of your cable to your iPod or your dock. You can purchase a special
BC11
Bonus Chapter 1: Earlier iPod Models and Connections

FireWire/IEEE 1394 cable that has a six-pin plug on one end and a four-pin
plug on the other. Look for this type of cable in well-stocked electronics
stores that sell digital camcorders because many camcorders use such a
cable.
The FireWire cable adapter used to be supplied with full-size fourth-generation
iPods. Unfortunately, it is no longer supplied with current models. You can
purchase a FireWire cable adapter from the Apple Store.
The original iPod shuffle has a USB connector on one end that plugs into a
USB port like a USB cable. Just remove the cap from one end and connect it
directly to the USB or USB 2.0 connection on your computer. You can also use
an iPod shuffle Dock or a USB extension cable (available from Apple at
www.ipod.com/store).
Both FireWire and USB 2.0 connections are plug-and-play: You can plug them
in at any time whether your computer is on or off. Depending on the device
that you use with these connections, FireWire or USB 2.0 can provide power
to the device. For example, fourth- and fifth-generation iPods and iPod nanos
can draw power from a USB 2.0 connection, and all (except the iPod shuffle
models) can draw power from a FireWire connection.

T
he iPod is a player — not just of music and video, but also of personal
information such as calendars, To-Do lists, and contacts. An iPod can
help you manage your activities on the road to the point where it competes
in some respects with personal digital assistants (PDAs). Although you still
add to and edit your Address Book, calendar, and To-Do list on your com-
puter, you can update or synchronize your iPod to have all the information
that you need for viewing and playback.
An iPhone, on the other hand, is a lot more than a PDA — it combines an iPod
with a Web browser, a cell phone, and a keyboard for input. It is even more
important for iPhone users to manage personal information on their comput-
ers and synchronize the information with their iPhones, because some of the
best features of the iPhone involve tasks such as touching someone’s phone
number in the contact list to make a call, or updating your calendar right on
your iPhone. You use iTunes to synchronize your iPods and iPhones with per-
sonal information, just like music, videos, and podcasts. Your iTunes library
is already the center of your entertainment world — your control console 
for playing Master DJ at the party, your video player that plays the latest
releases from the iTunes Store, your basement studio for burning CDs, and
your archive of the most important content in the universe. It makes sense to
use it for synchronizing your life, with respect to iPods and iPhones.
In this chapter, we create content for your iTunes library, and create personal
information — calendars and contacts — for your iPod or iPhone. We cover
downloading music from online sources other than the iTunes Store as well
as digitizing records, tapes, and music from analog sources. We also describe
how to import photos into photo libraries, create video using digital cameras
and camcorders, and convert video from sources such as DVDs.

Keeping Appointments with iCal
iCal is a free, desktop calendar application supplied with Mac OS X. If you
don’t have it, you can download it from the Apple software download page
(www.apple.com/support/downloads). iCal creates calendars that you
can automatically update to your iPod by using iTunes or copy directly to
your iPod. iCal requires using Mac OS X version 10.2.3 or later. You can create
custom calendars for different activities, such as home, office, road tours,
exercise and diet schedules, mileage logs, and so on. You can view them sep-
arately or together. After editing your calendars on the Mac, you can synchro-
nize your iPod to have the same calendars. See Chapter 23 when you’re ready
to sync your calendar to your iPod.
If you use another application to manage your personal calendar, you might
still want to use iCal to painlessly transfer your calendar information to the
iPod. You can import calendars from other applications that support the 
iCal or vCal format, such as Microsoft Entourage, Microsoft Outlook, and
Palm Desktop.
Launch iCal by double-clicking the iCal application or clicking its icon on the
Mac OS X Dock. iCal displays a calendar, as shown in Figure BC2-1. You can
switch the view from an entire month to just one day or one week by clicking
the Day or the Week button, respectively, at the bottom of the window.
iCal starts you off with two calendars: Home and Work. The check marks 
next to their names in the upper left of the iCal window indicate that both 
are visible, and they’re merged into the calendar view. To see only your Home
calendar, deselect the Work option in the Calendars pane on the left, and vice
versa. Setting appointments and events for either calendar is easy.

Setting up an appointment or event
Some appointments and events are a drag, and some are fun, but either way,
you can drag your mouse to create one. Click the Week button at the bottom of
the window to see just a week and then click and drag over a period of time to
create an appointment. You can choose File➪New Event to do the same thing.
To see the details of an event or appointment, do one of these things:
 Double-click the event or appointment.
 Click the event or appointment to select it and then click the i icon in
the lower-right corner.
 Click the event or appointment to select it and then choose Window➪
Show Info.
The detail for the event or appointment appears in the info drawer that sticks
out on the right or left side (depending on display room) of the iCal window,
as shown in Figure BC2-2.
In the info drawer, you can type over the filler New Event and location
text, change the date and time, add attendees, specify the status and whether
the event or appointment should be repeated, and so on. You can type a note
in the Notes section at the bottom and assign the event to a specific calendar
(in this case, the Home calendar). If you’ve created custom calendars within
iCal (as we describe in the upcoming section, “Creating a custom calendar”),
choose the calendar that you want to add the event to from the Calendar
pop-up menu. You can set the event to automatically repeat every day, week,
month, or year from the Repeat pop-up menu.

Adding a To-Do item
iCal can keep track of your To-Do list. Click the thumbtack icon to view the To
Do items pane of the iCal window (or choose Window➪Show To Dos). Choose
File➪New To Do to add an item to the list.
You can set the priority of the To-Do item so that it sorts to the top (highest
priority) or bottom (no priority) of the To-Do list. You can also set its due
date in the Due Date pop-up menu. If you set a due date, the alarm pop-up
appears so that you can also set an alarm for the To-Do item. (The alarm
works in your iPod when you synchronize your calendar with your iPod.) 
iCal lets you assign the To-Do item to a specific calendar and even add a 
Web address to the URL field to link the To-Do item to a Web page. To mark 
a To-Do item as finished, select the Completed option for the item.
Creating a custom calendar
You can create custom calendars in iCal that show only the events that are
assigned to the custom calendar. For example, you might create one custom
calendar for sporting events or concerts, another for family events, another
for an exercise plan, and so on. Your custom calendars are maintained by 
iCal so that you can see them all or individually in calendar view. The list of
custom calendars appears in the top-left corner of the iCal window, with a
check box next to each calendar. When you select the check box, the custom
calendar’s events show up in calendar view.
To create a custom calendar, follow these steps:
1. Choose File➪New Calendar or click the plus (+) button in the bottom
left of the iCal window.
An Untitled item appears in the list of calendars in the top left.
2. Click inside the Name text box and type a new name for the 
Untitled item.
3. Turn the custom calendar on or off.
Deselect the custom calendar if you don’t want its events to be dis-
played. Select it to display the custom calendar along with other selected
custom calendars (merged with the other custom calendar events).
Keeping Appointments with Outlook
Microsoft Outlook is offered as part of Microsoft Office (Windows version),
and Microsoft Outlook Express is offered free with Windows. You can use
BC16 iPod & iTunes For Dummies, 5th Edition

these applications to create calendars and export the calendar information to

Setting up an appointment or event
To set up an appointment or event in Microsoft Outlook, launch Outlook and
then follow these steps:
1. Click the Calendar icon and click any time slot to select it in the
Outlook calendar.

Adding a To-Do task
The outlook for your future plans might be bright, but you need more than a
crystal ball to keep them that way. If you already use Outlook for your e-mail
and calendar functions, you might also want to use it to keep track of your
To-Do list.
To create a To-Do task in Outlook, choose New➪Task and type a subject
name for the task. To make the task a recurring task, select the Recurrence
option and choose a frequency (Daily, Weekly, Monthly, or Yearly) for the
recurring task. Click the Save and Close button to save the task.
Storing Contacts in the Mac OS X
Address Book
Address Book, a free application that’s provided with OS X for the Mac, has
just about all the features you could ever want for storing names, addresses,
and phone numbers. Keeping your iPod synchronized with your addresses
and phone numbers is simple and automatic. You can then have your friends’
addresses and phone numbers with you at all times, right on your iPod.
If you use some other application for storing contact information, you might
want to use Address Book in addition to your other application so you can
import contact information from other applications that support vCards or
the LDIF format. (LDIF is the file format for LDAP, which stands for Lightweight
Directory Access Protocol.) To do so, launch Address Book and choose File➪
Import, choose the format that you used from the submenu, and select the
file that contains the exported information. When your information is in
Address Book, you can synchronize the information with your iPod, eliminat-
ing the hassle of dragging vCards to the iPod individually.
Adding and editing contact information
Launch Address Book by double-clicking the Address Book application or by
clicking its icon on the Mac OS X Dock. To add a new card, follow these steps:
1. Choose File➪New Card or click the plus (+) button at the bottom of the
Name pane.
A new blank card appears, ready for you to add information.
BC18 iPod & iTunes For Dummies, 5th Edition

2. Type the person’s first and last name over the placeholders in the first
and last name text boxes and then add contact information to the
other text boxes.
You can type addresses, phone numbers, and so on, as shown in Figure
BC2-4. To add multiple addresses, phone numbers, or other text boxes,
click the tiny plus (+) icon next to each type of information to add more.
If some text boxes don’t apply, skip them, and they won’t show up in the
edited card. You can even enter a two-line address by pressing Return to
continue to the second line.
3. Save your changes by clicking the Edit button.
To edit a card, select the person in the Name pane and click the Edit button.
To save your changes, click the Edit button again, and Address Book saves
the edits.
You can also add new people to your Address Book from the Mail program in
OS X by selecting an e-mail message and choosing Message➪Add Sender to
Address Book. Then open Address Book, click the name in the Name pane,
and click the Edit button to edit the person’s card. Choosing Add to Address
Book from the Mail program From field’s contextual menu adds the address
and opens the card for editing in Address Book. iChat also works directly
with Address Book to store and use addresses.
If you receive a vCard as an e-mail attachment (with a .vcf extension), you
can simply drag the attachment to your Address Book window to add the
vCard to your Address Book. Wouldn’t it be nice if all your friends sent you
vCards to keep you up to date, and you never had to retype the information?

Bonus Chapter 2: Creating Content for Your iPod

Be wary of vCards from unknown persons because vCards can carry viruses.
Merging cards
One of the coolest features of Address Book is its ability to merge cards. 
You might occasionally end up with multiple cards for the same person in
Address Book, typically by saving the sender’s e-mail address from the Mail
application while also dragging a vCard from the same person. To fix that,
select the cards in the Name pane and choose Card➪Merge Cards. Address
Book creates a new card that combines all the unique information. You can
then delete the excess cards.
Searching in Address Book
Address Book lets you search for any text in any of the text boxes of any
card. If you’re searching for a person and all you have is part of a phone
number or even just part of the person’s name, type the text in the Search
text box at the top right of the Address Book window. While you type,
Address Book displays the names of the people with the text fragment any-
where in their cards. Address Book searches all the information on the cards,
including the Notes text box, and it searches fast, displaying names immedi-
ately. If more than one matching card is found, click the arrow buttons at the
bottom of the window to switch between the cards. Or, choose View➪Card
and Columns to see a list of all the cards that match.
Managing contacts in groups
You can combine address cards in Address Book into a group to make it easy
to select all the addresses at once. For example, make a group of all your
local friends or all your co-workers. You can then send e-mail to them all by
choosing the group as the e-mail recipient.
You can also use a group to keep track of a subset of contacts. For example,
you might want only a subset of your contact list on your iPod instead of the
entire list. To do this, create a group for the subset of contacts and export the
group as a single vCard file that you can then use on your iPod.
To create a group of contacts in Address Book
1. Click the plus (+) sign at the bottom of the Group pane.
Address Book creates a new entry in the Group column with a high-
lighted text box so that you can type a new name for the group.
BC20 iPod & iTunes For Dummies, 5th Edition

2. Type a name for the group.
3. Select the All item in the Group pane to see your entire list of names.
4. Drag and drop names over the group name to add them to your new
group.
After creating a new group, you can see the names in the group by clicking
the group name in the Group pane. Select the All item in the Group pane to
see all the names in Address Book.
To put your addresses on the iPod, you can export a vCard file to the iPod
Contacts folder or use iTunes, as we describe in Chapter 23.
Storing Contacts in Outlook
Microsoft Outlook, included with the Windows version of Microsoft Office,
provides extensive features for managing contacts with e-mail and address
information. You can also import address books and contact information 
into Outlook from programs, such as Eudora, Lotus Organizer, Netscape
Messenger, Microsoft Mail, or Microsoft Schedule+.
Outlook actually uses another application, Microsoft Address Book, to store
contact information. Address Book lets you gather address books from other
sources, including Microsoft Exchange Server and Internet directory services
(depending on how you set up Outlook). It also includes all the contacts in
your Outlook Contacts folder. When you update the information in your
Outlook Contacts folder, Address Book is updated as well, so you can make
all your changes in the Outlook Contacts folder.
To create a contact in Outlook, which saves the contact information in Address
Book, launch Outlook and then follow these steps:
1. Click the Contacts icon to open the Contacts folder.
The Contacts icon appears in the Outlook Shortcuts pane on the left of
the Outlook display; refer to Figure BC2-3.
2. Choose New➪Contact and then type a name for the contact.
To enter multiple entries for a text box, such as more than one physical
or e-mail address, click the down-arrow next to the text box to display
more lines for that text box. Enter all the information you want (or as
little as you want).
3. Click Save and Close to save the contact.
Your contacts are displayed in the Contact window of Outlook.

You can also create a new contact automatically for the sender of an e-mail
message that you receive. Open the e-mail message. In the From text box,
right-click the name that you want to add to your Contacts folder and then
choose Add to Contacts.
You can export the contact information from Microsoft Outlook (and Address
Book) to your iPod. For more on that, flip to Chapter 23.
Downloading Music from Other Sources
The iTunes Store isn’t the only place to get music online for your iPod. Other
digital music services — such as Napster 2.0, Rhapsody, BuyMusic.com,
MusicNow, and Yahoo! Music Jukebox — also offer music you can purchase.
You can find music in the following types of places online:
 From the source: New artists and musicians — and even legendary
bands — are increasingly offering a bit of free music on their Web sites.
This is the best source of free music because it’s legal and benefits the
artists directly — they want you to listen and tell your friends. Examples
include Pete Townshend (www.eelpie.com), The Zen Tricksters (www.
zentricksters.com/home.html), Little Feat (www.littlefeat.
net), and the Flying Other Brothers (www.flyingotherbros.com).
 Protected music: Online music stores and services that offer protected
music typically use the Windows Media–protected (WMA) format. You
can’t import Windows Media–protected songs and other protected for-
mats into iTunes; they’re tied to the computer and player used for the
format. However, you can burn a CD with the music (using a different
player, such as Windows Media Player) and then import the CD into
iTunes. You don’t have to lose any quality because burning a CD doesn’t
reduce the music’s quality, and ripping the CD in iTunes doesn’t reduce
the music’s quality if you use AIFF format or the Apple Lossless encoder.
 Unprotected music: Some online services and Web sites offer unpro-
tected music for sale (typically at a higher price, such as iTunes Plus) 
or for free downloading as part of a promotion for artists. These sites
and services typically offer either MP3 files that you can import directly
into either the Mac or Windows versions of iTunes, or Windows Media–
unprotected files that you can import into the Windows version of
iTunes.
 Swapped music: Free networks using peer-to-peer technology allow
users to swap music for free. That is, people can trade music, but the
network essentially allows them to download music from others on the
BC22 iPod & iTunes For Dummies, 5th Edition

network for free. Some artists use these networks to freely disseminate
their works to the largest possible audience. One of the largest (if not
the largest) is Usenet, which offers music-related newsgroups that
accommodate nearly everyone’s musical tastes, along with samples that
you can download for free. In order to download music files from Usenet,
you need a Usenet newsreader program (such as Barca or News Rover;
see www.newsreaders.com for a list), or you can use a Web Gateway
(such as Google Groups; http://groups.google.com).
Some networks are considered “pirate” networks because they allow
copyrighted content to be traded and operate outside the jurisdiction 
of the United States copyright law and the laws of other countries. We
don’t recommend using pirate networks for two reasons. One, we
believe that copyright owners deserve to have some control over distri-
bution, even free distribution. Two, the music might not be the highest
quality because of compromises (such as lower bit rates for MP3 files,
which make for poorer quality music).
If you have a choice of music formats to download, choose the highest-
quality format that you can download (depending on the bandwidth of your
Internet connection) — typically, MP3 at the highest bit rate offered. iTunes
can import AIFF, WAV, AAC, Apple Lossless, and MP3 files; and the Windows
version of iTunes can also import WMA (unprotected) files if you have
Windows Media Player version 9 installed on your PC. You can use AIFF, WAV,
AAC, Apple Lossless, or MP3 files on your iPod and convert files from other
formats into these formats, as we describe in Chapter 19.
Recording Records, Tapes, 
and Other Analog Sources
You can find millions of songs on the Internet, and some digital recordings 
of songs might even be good enough to please audiophiles. With so many
songs available in the iTunes Store, you might not want to spend a lot of time
recording and digitizing the hits from your record collection, or even the 
B-sides and album cuts. Most likely those songs are also available from the
online store in digital form, ready to play.
However, you might have sounds that were never released on CD or made
available to the public. Rare record collectors and tape archivists (you know
who you are) have recordings that aren’t available on the Internet or on CD. If
you create your own music, how do you get that stuff into your iTunes library
so that you can burn a CD or include the songs on your iPod?
BC23
Bonus Chapter 2: Creating Content for Your iPod

You can record and digitize sounds from other sources, such as tape players
and turntables, and store the digital recordings in your iTunes library. You
can also set the start and stop times of songs in your iTunes library, as we
describe later in this chapter, which is a trick you can use to edit the begin-
nings and endings of songs.
All the applications described here are commercially available for download-
ing from the Internet. Some are free to use, some are free for a limited time
before you have to pay, and some require cash up front. Nevertheless, all are
worth checking out if you have sounds you want to put into iTunes.
You can bring sound directly into your computer from a sound system or home
stereo that offers a stereo audio output connection (such as tape-out) or even
directly from a cassette player or microphone. If you have records with music
that can’t be found anymore, you can convert the music to digital by using a
phonograph connected to a stereo system with a tape-out connection.
You can copy songs already converted to digital into iTunes directly without
any recording procedure. For example, MP3 CDs are easy to import. Because
they’re essentially data CDs, simply insert them into your CD-ROM drive,
open the CD in Windows or the Mac Finder, and drag and drop the MP3 song
files into the iTunes window. Downloaded song files are even easier: Just drag
and drop the files into iTunes. If you drag a folder or CD icon, all the audio
files that it contains are added to your iTunes library.
Before recording sound into your computer, be sure that you have enough
hard drive space to record the audio in an uncompressed form (which is best
for highest quality). If you’re recording an hour of high-quality music, you
need about 600MB of hard drive space to record it.
Connecting and setting up audio input
Most computers offer a line-in connection that accepts a cable with a stereo
mini-plug. You can connect any kind of mono or stereo audio source, such as
an amplifier or a preamp, a CD or DVD player, or an all-in-one stereo system
that offers recording through a tape-out or similar connection.
Find the line-out or tape-out connection in your stereo system and connect a
cable that uses RCA-type left and right stereo plugs or a stereo mini-plug to
this connection. (See Chapter 16 for more information about audio cables.)
Connect the stereo mini-plug to your computer’s line-in connection. You can
then record anything that plays on your home stereo into your computer.
If your computer doesn’t offer a line-in connection, you can purchase a
Universal Serial Bus (USB) audio input device, such as the Griffin iMic (www.
griffintechnology.com).
BC24 iPod & iTunes For Dummies, 5th Edition

When recording from a phonograph, the phonograph must either include an
amplifier or be connected to an amplifier to raise the signal to line levels and
apply proper equalization curves.
After connecting the audio source to your computer, set the audio input for
your computer and adjust the volume for recording.
On a Mac, follow these steps:
1. Choose System Preferences from the Apple menu or the Dock and
then click the Sound icon.
2. Click the Input tab.
The Input tab displays the sound input preferences, as shown in 
Figure BC2-5.
3. Choose Line In from the list of input devices.
Use Line In to record into your computer. The alternative is to use the
built-in microphone, which is useful for recording live performances or
any non-electric playing device (such as a vintage Victrola), but not for
records or tapes because it also picks up any noise in the room.
4. Play the source of the sound.

5. While playing, adjust the volume for the line-in input.
While it plays, watch the input level meter. As the volume gets louder,
the oblong purple dots light up from left to right. To adjust the volume,
drag the Input Volume slider. If all the dots are highlighted all the time,
you’re way too hot (studio tech talk for being too loud). If the dots are
not highlighted at all, you’re way too low. (For some reason, the studio
techs don’t say cool or cold — just low.) You want the dots to be high-
lighted about three-fourths of the way across from left to right for opti-
mal input volume.
6. Quit System Preferences by choosing System Preferences➪Quit
System Preferences (Ô-Q) or by clicking the red button in the top-left
corner of the window.
On a PC, you must have a line-in connection and an audio card driver that
controls it. Some PCs are equipped only with microphone-controlling drivers,
but some offer both line-in and microphone input. If you have the appropriate
hardware, follow these steps:
1. Open the sound properties control panel.
Right-click the small speaker icon in the system tray (Notification area in
Vista) and choose Adjust Audio Properties. In the Windows Mixer dialog
that appears, choose Options➪Properties.
2. Click the Audio tab.

Choosing a sound-editing application
With Sound Studio 3, you can record and digitize directly to your hard drive
on a Mac running OS X. You can download a copy free from Freeverse (www.
freeverse.com). You can then use it for two weeks before having to pay $80.
Mac users can purchase Boom Box from Roxio (www.roxio.com) for $50,
which includes the CD Spin Doctor feature for recording sounds. CD Spin
Doctor offers a Noise Reducer option to select filters for noise reduction: 
de-click removes loud distortions, which occur frequently with vinyl records;
de-crackle removes surface crackling, which happens often with well-played
vinyl records; and de-hiss removes the hissing noise that occurs with many
different analog sources, including records and tapes. Roxio also offers
RecordNow 9 Music Lab Premier for Windows ($50), which includes the LP
and Tape Assistant for streamlining the process of converting classic analog
recordings. You can apply similar cleaning effects as CD Spin Doctor to easily
remove noise, pops, and clicks from recordings.
Importing Photos into Your Computer
Digital photography is truly instant gratification. You see the results immedi-
ately and can then take more pictures based on what you captured an instant
before. When you run out of room on your memory card, you simply connect
your digital camera or card reader to your computer, import the photos into
a computerized photo library, and delete them from the memory card. Then
you can go back and take more pictures!
BC27
Bonus Chapter 2: Creating Content for Your iPod

On a Windows PC, you can use Adobe Photoshop Album (version 1.0 or
newer) or Photoshop Elements (version 3.0 or newer) to import photos into
your computer. You can then organize your photos into collections, as we
describe in Chapter 11. Finally, use iTunes to transfer photos automatically
from your Photoshop Album or Photoshop Elements library to your iPod or
iPhone, as we describe in Chapter 12. If you use other photo-editing pro-
grams, you can still update your iPod or iPhone with the photos, as we
describe in Chapter 12. However, the collections in Photoshop Album and
Photoshop Elements synchronize automatically with your iPod or iPhone.
Connecting a digital camera 
or memory card reader
To import photos to your computer, start by connecting your digital camera
to your computer.
Digital cameras typically come with a special USB or FireWire cable that has 
a very small connector on one end for the camera and a larger connector on
the other end for the computer’s USB or FireWire port. However, if both ends
are the same on the cable you’re using, it doesn’t matter which end is
plugged into the camera or the computer.
Be sure to power up your camera — most digital cameras have a power-on
switch to save battery life. Connect your camera before you turn it on
because the computer might not recognize some camera models unless
they’re turned on while connected. If the computer doesn’t recognize your
camera, try turning off the camera and then turning it on again.
If your camera has an AC adapter, run the camera off the adapter when
importing photos to save the camera’s battery time. If your camera has a
sleep mode, make sure that you disable it or set it to a time increment long
enough for your images to import. Importing 50 photos generally takes about
1 minute with most digital cameras via a USB 2.0 connection; it might take up
to half an hour with a USB 1.1 connection.
Rather than connecting your camera to your computer every time you want
to transfer pictures, you can connect a memory card reader to a USB connec-
tion on your computer and then put a camera’s memory card in the card
reader. A digital camera memory card is like an extra roll of film, and a
memory card reader is useful if you take lots of pictures and use additional
cards. If you use multiple memory cards, this method is especially conve-
nient. Some Media Center PCs running Windows include built-in card readers.
BC28 iPod & iTunes For Dummies, 5th Edition

iPhoto can import photos from a card reader, just like it can from a camera,
using the same steps. Many Windows applications supplied with digital 
cameras can also import photos from memory card readers. For example,
Preclick Silver Photo Organizer (www.preclick.com) can import photos
from CDs as well as from memory card readers and digital cameras that 
connect via USB or FireWire.
Importing your photos
To import pictures from a digital camera, connect the camera to your com-
puter and then launch a photo application, such as iPhoto on a Mac, or the
photo application supplied with your camera. Although different cameras
have different applications, they generally provide instructions for these 
four steps:
1. Connect your camera and then set your application to import mode.
After connecting your digital camera, your application offers a simple
method of importing photos from the camera into your computer. Set 
up the application so that it’s ready to import. For example, in Adobe
Photoshop Album, click the Get Photos button and then choose Digital
Camera or Scanner.
iPhoto automatically changes to indicate that it recognizes your camera.
Depending on the type of camera or memory card reader you’re using,
iPhoto displays a camera icon, a disk icon, or a memory card reader
icon. My Canon PowerShot SD550 displays a camera icon.
2. Choose whether to delete the photos in your camera after importing.
Most camera applications offer an option to delete photos from your
camera as soon as they’re imported. Many cameras have a delete func-
tion, so you don’t need to use this option. However, using this option
enables you to import and delete photos in the camera in one step. With
the photos in the photo library, you no longer need to keep copies in
your camera or on a memory card, and you can make room for new
photos. In iPhoto, you can import photos and delete them from your
camera in one step by selecting the Delete Items from Camera After
Importing option at the bottom of the iPhoto window.
3. Start the importing process by choosing an import command or click-
ing an import button.
While you import the photos, your photo application stores them in its
photo library and displays them. For example, when iPhoto finishes
importing, it displays a small image for each photo in the photo library.
The size of the images in the viewing area is controlled by the zoom
slider in the lower-right corner of the iPhoto window, just underneath
the viewing area. These small versions of your images, which can be
reduced to very small, are thumbnails.

4. Eject, power down, and disconnect the camera.
• To eject the camera on a Windows PC: Right-click the camera icon,
choose Eject from the pop-up menu, and then disconnect the
camera. Another method is to click the Safely Remove Hardware
icon in the bottom-right corner of the screen. When the Safely
Remove Hardware shortcut menu appears, select either the IEEE
1394 device (if you use FireWire) or the USB Mass Storage device
(if you use USB). When the alert dialog appears, click OK and then
disconnect the camera.
• To eject the camera on a Mac: Drag the camera icon over the Eject
icon to properly eject the camera. Although nothing really happens
when you eject the camera (nothing actually ejects from the
machine; no doors open), you might find that if you don’t eject (as
required with some cameras), your images might not delete from
the camera even if you have the delete option enabled.
Importing Videos into Your Computer
Making home movies is nothing new. If you have a camcorder, you know how
to create a video — simply point and shoot. But even if you’re extremely
careful when shooting, you usually end up with a lot of video that you don’t
want. When you play it back, it looks like a typical home movie: amateurish,
disjointed, and confusing. Even with the best camcorders that let you edit
scenes on the fly, you can’t edit an entire video easily.
Before digital video software, such as iMovie (Mac) or Adobe Premiere
(Windows), you had to rent or buy thousands of dollars worth of video-
editing gear and use complicated software to edit videos. Most home users
couldn’t afford that equipment so they had no easy way to edit their videos.
With video-editing software, though, you can navigate freely from scene to
scene in any manner and then save your edits and changes in digital format
on a hard drive without the use of videotape. Digital copies are exact dupli-
cates with no quality loss in the copies. Therefore, you can edit to your
heart’s content without ever sacrificing the original quality of the video.
The essential piece of movie-making equipment you need, besides the video-
editing software, is a digital video (DV) camcorder. You can use this cam-
corder not only to record your own videos but also to convert older video
source material (such as a VHS tape) to a digital format that you can use with
iTunes. Software, such as iMovie, can control the digital camcorder for both
recording directly to the hard drive and transferring digital video from the
camcorder’s cassette. You can connect an older camcorder, a VCR, or even a
DVD player to just about any digital camcorder and then transfer the content
to your computer hard drive.
BC30 iPod & iTunes For Dummies, 5th Edition

Transferring video from a 
digital video camcorder
Camcorders not only record video onto digital media, such as DV tape, but
they also can play back the video you record. Recording and playing video
are accomplished in two separate modes:
 Camera mode records the video. When your camcorder is in camera
mode, its microphone and lens are ready to record when you press the
Record button.
 VTR (video tape recorder) or VCR mode plays back the video you
record. When the camera is in VTR/VCR mode, the camcorder plays
what was recorded after you press the Play button. (You can also rewind
and fast forward.) Some camcorders call this feature edit mode.
To use your camcorder with video-editing software, such as iMovie (Mac) or
Adobe Premiere (Windows), connect the camcorder and let the software do
the rest.
To import your video to your computer, follow these steps:
1. Connect the camcorder to the computer with a FireWire or USB cable.
(Your digital camcorder likely came with one.)
These cables are also available commercially. (FireWire is also known as
IEEE 1394 DV terminal or i.Link.) These cables have a camcorder-style
(very small), square connector on one end and a standard FireWire 
connector for the computer on the other end. PCs generally have 
USB connections if your camcorder supports USB.
2. Turn your camcorder to camera mode or VTR/VCR mode.
If you’re recording video directly to a hard drive without using DV tape,
choose camera mode. If you’re importing prerecorded video from DV
tape cassette, choose VTR/VCR mode.
3. Use the video-editing software to import video from the camcorder.
For example, iMovie automatically detects the camcorder and switches
to camera mode. Click Import to start importing the video. In Adobe
Premiere, choose File➪Capture and then click the Record button to start
capturing the footage onto your hard drive.
Before you start transferring video from your camcorder to your computer,
make sure to disable the camcorder’s sleep mode or set it to a time incre-
ment long enough for your video to play in full at normal speed. If possible,
connect AC power to the camcorder during this process to save battery life.
Having the camera go into sleep mode or having the batteries die while
you’re transferring video to your computer could cost you time; you might
need to start transferring video again from the beginning of the cartridge.
BC31
Bonus Chapter 2: Creating Content for Your iPod

Video on VHS tape or other types of videotape or cassette can be brought
into a program, such as iMovie or Adobe Premiere, through your DV cam-
corder. DV camcorders typically have a video-in connection for S-video or
RCA-type cables. Connect your older camcorder or VCR (or even a DVD
player, cable or satellite receiver, or any device that outputs video with RCA
or S-video connectors) to your DV camcorder. Then follow the instructions
that came with your DV camcorder to record from the video-in connection.
Some camcorders have a special Record button for recording from analog
sources in VTR/VCR mode (separate from the button for recording video in
camera mode). After you start the recording process, the video played on 
the analog device records in digital format on the DV camcorder’s tape. This
process preserves the video in digital format before bringing it into your
computer. You can then follow the preceding steps to import the video from
the DV camcorder tape to your computer.
Some DV camcorders allow you to pass the analog video straight through the
camcorder to the computer without prerecording it to DV tape or digital
media in the camcorder, saving the extra step and expense of prerecording
before importing. For example, the Canon ZR60 offers an analog-digital con-
verter mode that doesn’t require prerecording the material first.
Fine-tuning video format settings for iPods
iTunes accepts a number of different video file formats (including standard
MPEG-4 and the enhanced H.264 version of MPEG-4), but not all these formats
and not all the settings for these formats work on your iPod display. The
major reason is display resolution: The iPod can display no more than 76,800
pixels for H.264 and no more than 230,400 for MPEG-4, and these pixels must
be collected into square 16-pixel blocks, limiting you to certain aspect ratios.
When converting videos from other sources (such as DVDs), keep in mind
the following settings and resolutions for these formats that work in an iPod:
 H.264: This format is best for playing on an iPod. You can set your video
image size to 320 x 240 pixels with a data rate up to 768 Kbps and a
frame rate up to 30 frames per second (fps). Although this format might
not look as good as MPEG-4 on a television, most people don’t know the
difference, and the file size is usually smaller. Other resolutions that you
can use include 480 x 160, 432 x 176, 400 x 192, and 272 x 272 pixels.
 Standard MPEG-4: This format is better for playing on a television con-
nected to your iPod or on an Apple TV connected to a television, but it
also looks fine on an iPod. It just takes up more iPod space and uses
more power during playback. You can set your image size to 480 x 480
BC32 iPod & iTunes For Dummies, 5th Edition

pixels with a data rate up to 2.5 Mbps and a frame rate up to 30 fps. This
format might not look as good as H.264 on an iPod, but it looks better
than H.264 on a television. Other resolutions you can use include 784 x
288, 752 x 304, 720 x 320 (excellent for movies displayed in letterbox, a
format that maintains the rectangular theater image on a television), and
640 x 352 pixels.
To bring a video file into iTunes, simply drag it into the iTunes window or
over the iTunes icon. When the video is in iTunes, you can use it in your 
iPod immediately or after you have iTunes perform a simple (but often time-
consuming) conversion. You can also perform this conversion yourself by
using other software (such as a DVD ripper and converter).
To convert videos in the iTunes library into a format that looks better when
played on an iPod, select the video in your iTunes library, Control-click (Mac)
or right-click (Windows), and then choose Convert Selection for iPod. The
selected videos are automatically copied, and the copies are converted to the
H.264 format at a width of 320 pixels. The original versions remain
unchanged.
Converting video from DVD
Commercial DVDs are typically encrypted with antipiracy software — the
Content Scramble System (CSS) — as well as Macrovision copy protection
and region-coding. Almost all Windows PCs and Macs with DVD players can
play DVDs because the systems support regional codes and are licensed by
Macrovision and licensed to decrypt the CSS-protected content. Computers
that offer a video output connector (such as S-video) must also support the
protection technology in order to play copy-protected movies.
All Macs and most new computers equipped with DVD drives are set to play a
DVD automatically upon insertion. Some Windows PC manufacturers, such as
Dell, bundle DVD player software. However, the bundled player is typically
“overruled” by Windows Media Player, which installs itself as the primary
DVD player software, unless you change the file type assignment for DVD
Video (files with .vob extension). If you turn off this file assignment,
Windows displays a dialog when you insert a DVD, giving you a choice of
players on the system, so that you can pick your own DVD program — such
as one of the DVD ripper or converter programs.
On a Mac, you can simply quit the DVD Player application when it pops up
and then run a program such as Instant HandBrake (http://handbrake.
m0k.org) or MacTheRipper (www.mactheripper.org/) to rip the DVD into
a suitable file for iTunes.

f your PC is on the trailing edge rather than the leading edge, don’t 
worry — you won’t miss out on the iPod revolution. True, if you don’t run
Windows 2000, Vista, or XP on your PC, you can’t use iTunes for Windows.
However, if you use Windows Me (Millennium Edition), you can use Music-
Match Jukebox to manage a music library for your iPod.
MusicMatch Jukebox doesn’t support audio files compressed with the iTunes
AAC encoder and doesn’t play the music available from the iTunes Store.
When Apple started shipping Windows-compatible iPods, it didn’t quite 
have its software act together, so Apple contracted with MusicMatch, Inc., to
supply Windows software. As a result, MusicMatch Jukebox version 7.5 was
supplied on CD with the second-generation iPod for Windows and early third-
generation models.
However, Apple moved on from this arrangement when it introduced iTunes
for Windows, leaving MusicMatch free to develop its own online music store
and software — which is incompatible with the iPod, by the way. MusicMatch
can no longer distribute the iPod plug-in for MusicMatch Jukebox and is no
longer developing or building fixes for iPod plug-ins.

Some people prefer MusicMatch (MM, for short) for ripping CDs, super-
tagging songs to categorize them quickly, recording from other sources, and
so on. You might want to use MusicMatch Jukebox for other reasons, such as
its compatibility with other audio formats. MusicMatch Jukebox offers high-
quality MP3 encoders that produce excellent sound files that don’t take up
much hard drive or iPod space. Still, you must choose because your iPod can
synchronize with only one program — iTunes or MusicMatch Jukebox. This
chapter describes how to install and start using MusicMatch Jukebox. (See
Chapter 2 for details on how to install iTunes.)
Breaking Open MusicMatch Jukebox
With MusicMatch Jukebox, just like with iTunes, your computer is a vast juke-
box limited only by your hard drive space. You can manage this library and
keep a backup copy to preserve the music in high-quality format. iTunes and
MusicMatch Jukebox are very similar in how they work. It’s quick and easy to
slip in a CD and rip (transfer and digitally encode) songs into your music
library. The ripping process is very fast, and track information (including
artist name and title) arrives automatically over the Internet.
MusicMatch Jukebox gives you the power to organize songs into playlists and
burn any songs in your library to CD, in any order. It offers equalizers with
preset settings for all kinds of music and listening environments as well as
the capability to customize and save your own settings with each song. You
can burn songs that you rip from your CDs and import from Web sites and
MP3 repositories onto another CD, copy to other computers, and transfer to
your iPod freely.
You need the following to use MusicMatch Jukebox with the iPod:
 A PC with a 300 MHz or faster processor
 Windows Me, 2000, or XP
 96MB of RAM (128MB for Windows XP)
 Built-in or Windows-certified FireWire (IEEE 1394) connection, or USB
connection
The MusicMatch Jukebox user interface (UI), as shown in Figure BC3-1, looks
a bit different than other Windows applications. If you like, you can customize
how it looks by assigning a skin. A skin is how the UI looks: all the buttons
BC36 iPod & iTunes For Dummies, 5th Edition

and menu options to perform tasks, such as increasing volume, opening the
library, burning a music CD, and so on. Skins are changeable, and you can
download new ones from the MusicMatch site.
MusicMatch Jukebox offers the following separate windows that you can drag
to any position:
 Library: Your music files appear in this window, sorted by artist. You
can open by artist, just like opening folders in Windows Explorer, to see
songs organized by album.
 Playlist: Drag songs or albums to this window to play them. You can also
save playlists.
 Recorder: Tracks on audio CDs appear here, ready to be ripped into
your library when you click the Record button.

Plugging In MusicMatch Jukebox
Before installing the iPod software for Windows, make sure that you’re 
logged in as a Windows Administrator user if you’re using Windows 2000 
or XP. Quit all other applications before installing and disable any virus-
protection software.
If you’ve installed an earlier version of MusicMatch Jukebox (especially if it’s
a demo version provided with your computer), you must remove the earlier
version before installing the version that came with your iPod. Choose Start➪
Settings➪Control Panels➪Add/Remove Programs, and then select Music-
Match Jukebox to remove the program (called uninstall in some versions of
Windows).
The second-generation 10GB iPod for Windows model, as well as some early
third-generation iPod models, included MusicMatch Jukebox with iPod-for-
Windows software on CD-ROM. When installing this version of MusicMatch
Jukebox from CD-ROM, be sure that you have the serial number from the
sleeve of the CD for your iPod. When you install MusicMatch Jukebox, you
need to enter this serial number, which unlocks the Plus version of Music-
Match Jukebox on the CD. The Plus version runs a bit faster and offers many
more features than the standard version, including the ability to save your
playlists. For troubleshooting information, visit the MusicMatch Jukebox FAQ
page for iPod users at wwws.musicmatch.com/faq/IPOD056.htm.
If you’re installing from the CD and get a message recommending that you
update MusicMatch Jukebox with a version that’s newer than version 7.5,
don’t do it unless you intend to use MusicMatch Jukebox without your iPod.
This means that you must use iTunes to synchronize your iPod. MusicMatch
and Apple no longer provide support for the iPod plug-in for MusicMatch
Jukebox version 7.5 or earlier versions. Version 7.5 works with the plug-in
provided on CD with second-generation iPod for Windows models. For all
newer iPod models, use iTunes.
You can also use version 8.1, which is still available from OldVersion.com
(www.oldversion.com), along with the iPod plug-in for MusicMatch
Jukebox, available from Version Tracker (www.versiontracker.com).
Versions newer than version 8.1 of MusicMatch Jukebox won’t work with an
iPod. You can visit the MusicMatch Jukebox FAQ page (wwws.musicmatch.
com/faq/IPOD053.htm) for information about version 8.1, which supports
the iPod with a separate iPod plug-in (available from Version Tracker).
To install MusicMatch Jukebox on a Windows PC to use with an iPod, follow
these steps:
BC38 iPod & iTunes For Dummies, 5th Edition

1. Insert the CD. Do not connect your iPod to your PC yet.
MusicMatch Jukebox version 7.2 or version 7.5 is provided on CD sup-
plied with older iPod models. The CD automatically starts running when
you insert it into a PC.
2. Start the installation wizard.
To start the downloaded version of the installer, double-click the
installer file. If the installer (on the CD) doesn’t open automatically,
double-click the CD-ROM icon in the My Computer window and then
double-click the Setup icon.
3. Click Install and follow the instructions.
iPod for Windows software must be installed on the C: drive to work, but
you can choose a destination folder.
4. If you installed version 8.1 of MusicMatch Jukebox from the Internet
(no longer available as of this writing), run the iPod plug-in installer
wizard and follow the instructions.
Double-click the iPod plug-in installer file downloaded from Version
Tracker.
5. Connect your iPod.
The installation instructions tell you when it’s time to connect your iPod
to the PC.
6. Follow the instructions to continue and finish installation.
If the PC doesn’t recognize the iPod, see the troubleshooting instruc-
tions in Chapter 25.
After you first connect the iPod to a PC during the installation process, the
iPod should be properly configured to work with Windows. The iPod-for-
Windows software should automatically run MusicMatch Jukebox when it
detects the iPod. If the program doesn’t automatically run, you can launch it
by double-clicking the icon for MusicMatch Jukebox.
In MusicMatch Jukebox, your iPod should appear in the PortablesPlus
window under the Attached Portable Devices folder, as shown in Figure
BC3-2. If the window is not yet open, choose File➪Send to Portable Device.
The iPod automatically synchronizes to the MusicMatch Jukebox library 
after you connect it, but you probably don’t have anything in your music
library yet. Your next step in building up your MusicMatch Jukebox library 
is to import music from CDs, buy music online, or import music from other
sources. The next time that you connect your iPod, the music transfers 
automatically.
BC39
Bonus Chapter 3: Putting a Dime in the MusicMatch Jukebox

Importing Music into 
MusicMatch Jukebox
To get tunes into your iPod, you need to first import the music from your
audio CDs or other sources. The importing process is straightforward, but
the settings that you choose for importing affect sound quality, hard drive
space (and iPod space), and compatibility with other types of players and
computers.
Setting the recording format
Importing music from an audio CD takes less time than playing the CD.
However, before you actually rip a CD, you should check your importing set-
tings. To check your importing (Recorder) settings in MusicMatch Jukebox,
follow these steps:
1. Choose Options➪Settings and click the Recorder tab.
The Recorder tab of the Settings dialog appears, as shown in Figure BC3-3.
2. Choose an encoding format from the Recording Format pop-up menu
and then make changes to its settings, which vary depending on the
encoding format that you choose.
You have to do this step only once. MusicMatch Jukebox keeps these
settings for recording from audio CD until you change them.

Use the MP3 recording format for songs that you intend to send to others
over the Internet, burn an MP3 CD for use with MP3 CD players, or copy to an
iPod or other portable MP3 players. Select the quality option that you want:
 Choose CD Quality (128 kbps) or Custom Quality and move the slider to
320 Kbps for the highest bit rate provided for the MP3 format. (Higher
bit rates mean higher quality audio.) MusicMatch Jukebox also offers a
version of CD Quality that offers Variable Bit Rate (VBR).
 Use Near CD Quality for songs that you want to compress more and
don’t mind the loss in audio quality.
 Use FM Radio Quality for voice recordings, narration, and very low-
quality audio but very high compression.
For more information about the MP3 format in MusicMatch Jukebox, see
“MusicMatch Jukebox Encoders” later in this chapter.
WAV, the high-quality recording format used on PCs, is more suitable for digi-
tal song files that you burn onto an audio CD. However, songs encoded in
WAV occupy approximately 10MB per minute, which is many times more
space than using MP3 format. As a result, WAV files also require more iPod
battery power to play and might skip when playing in an iPod because the
skip protection cache fills up too quickly when playing uncompressed music.

Bonus Chapter 3: Putting a Dime in the MusicMatch Jukebox

We recommend using WAV only to rip songs you intend to burn onto an audio
CD or use with sound-editing programs.
You can import songs from a CD with one encoding format and then import
them again with a different format. For example, you might use WAV to encode
songs that you intend to burn onto a CD and then use MP3 to encode the
same songs for use on an iPod. After burning the CD, you could delete the
WAV versions, which take up a lot of space.
Ripping songs from a CD
To rip a CD with MusicMatch Jukebox on a Windows PC, follow these steps:
1. Choose View➪Recorder.
The Recorder window opens, as shown in Figure BC3-4.
2. Insert an audio CD.
The songs first appear in your song list as generic, unnamed tracks. If
your computer accesses the Internet at all times, MusicMatch Jukebox
can connect to the Internet automatically and retrieve the track informa-
tion every time you insert an audio CD. This takes only a few seconds. 
If you have to connect first by modem, go ahead and establish your 
connection, making sure that CD Lookup is enabled. (To check, choose
Options➪Settings and click the CD Lookup/Connectivity tab.) Then click
the Refresh button along the top of the Recorder window.
3. (Optional) Remove the check mark next to any songs on the CD that
you don’t want to record (import).

skips that song.
4. Click the red Record button in the Recorder window or next to the
playback controls to start importing the music.
5. MusicMatch Jukebox rips the CD.
When it’s done, the program automatically ejects the CD.
During recording, the status area shows the progress of the operation. To
cancel, click the Cancel button in the Recorder window.
Adding song files from other sources
After you save or copy an MP3 or WAV file to your hard drive from another
sound-editing program or from the Internet, click the Add button in the
MusicMatch Jukebox Library window. You can then browse your hard drive
to find folders of music files and either add music files separately or add
entire folders of files at once.
You can also use MusicMatch Jukebox to automatically search your hard
drive for music to add to your library. Choose Options➪Music Library➪
Search and Add Tracks From All Drives. You can use this function to import
music from a network server as well as from your own hard drives.
Rocking On with MusicMatch Jukebox
To play songs in MusicMatch Jukebox, click the song title and click the Play
button in the circle of playback controls in the upper-left corner of the Music-
Match Jukebox window (refer to Figure BC3-1). This control panel offers the
usual Play, Pause, Forward, and Previous buttons as well as a volume slider.
You can also click an artist name to select all the songs by the artist, and
then click the Play button.
When you select songs and click the Play button, the songs appear in the
order that you selected them in a list in the Playlist window, as shown in
Figure BC3-5. You can also drag songs or albums to the Playlist window in any
order you choose; then click Play.
BC43
Bonus Chapter 3: Putting a Dime in the MusicMatch Jukebox

To select a range of songs, click the first song and then press Shift while clicking
the last song. To add single songs to your selection, press Ctrl while clicking
each.
Saving a playlist
To save the songs in the Playlist window with a name for each playlist (essen-
tial for transferring playlists to the iPod), click the Save button and give the
playlist a name.
After saving a playlist, click the Clear button to clear the Playlist window so
that you can load a new set of songs to create another playlist.
To open a saved playlist, click the Open button in the Playlist window and
click the Playlists icon in the left column of the Open Music window. You can
then select any named playlist, and MusicMatch Jukebox loads the playlist
into the Playlist window for playback.
Leave the Clear Current Playlist When Adding New Tracks option enabled so
that you replace the current tracks in the Playlist window with the new play-
list. If you want to add to the end of the current playlist, disable this option.

Playing albums
Although filling the Playlist window with all the songs by a particular artist is
easy, you might instead want to play entire albums of songs without having to
select each album or song.
To create a playlist of entire albums in a particular order, follow these steps:
1. Select one or more albums in the Library window.
2. Drag the album or albums into the Playlist window and then click
Play.
3. (Optional) Save your playlist by clicking the Save button, and then
type a name for your new playlist (such as the album name).
4. (Optional) After hearing the album, click the Clear button to clear the
playlist for the next album you choose.
Getting a Grip on Song Information
Organization depends on information. Your computer can do a lot more than
store your songs with Untitled Disc and Track 1 as the only identifiers. Song
names, album titles, genre definitions, and composer credits might seem triv-
ial, but you can use this information to browse songs on your iPod.
Using CD Lookup
Use CD Lookup to grab song information for CDs from the Internet.
You can get information about most music CDs from the Internet. However,
you need to check your Internet connection first, keeping the following in
mind:
 If you use an always-on broadband Internet service (for example, DSL or
cable modem), you probably want MusicMatch Jukebox to connect and
retrieve song information automatically.
 If you’re using a dialup modem, if your Internet service is intermittently
off, or if your Internet service provider (ISP) charges prohibit using it all
the time, you probably don’t want this connection to be automatic.
BC45
Bonus Chapter 3: Putting a Dime in the MusicMatch Jukebox

In MusicMatch Jukebox, you can enable CD Lookup to grab song information
from the Internet. Just choose Options➪Settings and click the CD Lookup/
Connectivity tab. Then select the Enable CD Lookup Service option.
You can set an optional timeout limit, in seconds, for how long MusicMatch
Jukebox should spend trying to access the database before giving up.
(Internet databases can be offline for a number of reasons, or your Internet
connection might not be working.)
MusicMatch Jukebox lets you defer CD Lookup for another time, when your
Internet connection is active. By default, MusicMatch Jukebox is set to enable
deferred service, assuming that most users are intermittently connected to
the Internet. This is set by default so that you can record CDs to your music
library and have MusicMatch Jukebox look up the information later, when
your computer is connected to the Internet. You can change this setup by
disabling the Enable Deferred CD Lookup Service option.
When you record audio CDs, MusicMatch Jukebox connects to the Internet
and retrieves the song information automatically, or defers this action until
your computer is connected (unless you turned off these options). Music-
Match Jukebox refers to song information as tags, and you can always edit
your tag information manually.
Editing information tags
The song information on the Internet might not be exactly the format you
want. For example, solo artists are listed by first and last names, as in John
Lennon, but you might want to list them surname first, as in Lennon, John.
You might also want to remove The from band names such as The Who, so
that the band is listed under W as Who.
You can change the song information retrieved using the CD Lookup service.
You can edit the tag information for a single song or for an entire album of
songs at once.
To edit the information for a single song, select the song and click the Tag
button (or right-click the song and choose Edit Track Tags) to open the Edit
Track Tag(s) window, which is shown in Figure BC3-6.
The Edit Track Tag(s) window opens with the General information. You can
change the information for each tab: Lyrics, Notes, Bios, and More. The
General tab shows information that appears in the Player window when you
play a song, and some of this information is transferred to your iPod for sort-
ing songs under the artist’s name, the album name, and so on.
BC46 iPod & iTunes For Dummies, 5th Edition

So far so good, but you don’t have to edit the album title, artist name, or
genre for an entire album that way. Change some of the information for an
entire album at once by following these steps:
1. Select one of the songs and click the Tag button (or right-click the
song and choose Edit Track Tag) to open the Edit Track Tag(s)
window.
2. Click the Load Album button in the lower-left area of the Edit Track
Tag(s) window.
The Load Album button loads all the songs from the album into the list
on the left side of the window.
3. To change information in all the songs at once, click the Select All
button and then change the information (see Figure BC3-7).
You can also click each song in the album and change its information
specifically.

A check mark appears automatically in the box next to the tag. The
check mark indicates that the tag will be changed when you click OK.
4. Make sure that only the tags you want to change are selected and then
click OK.
MusicMatch Jukebox changes the tags for the entire album of songs.
In the music library, MusicMatch Jukebox lists your songs under the artist
name. If you change the artist name for an album of songs, the location of the
music in your library changes because the names are sorted in alphabetical
order. However, the filenames don’t change.
When you change the artist’s name for an album of songs, you might also
want to change the filenames to reflect this change. See the “Super-tagging
songs with information” section later in this chapter.
Adding information about songs
Adding more information about songs enables you to use the criteria of your
choice — such as genre or your personal ratings — to locate songs in the
MusicMatch Jukebox library and on your iPod.
After your songs are recorded into the music library, locate a single song and
click the Tag button (or right-click the song and choose Edit Track Tags). The
Edit Track Tag(s) window opens, providing a list of songs for an album (if you
click Load Album) and showing the hard drive path to the file for the selected
songs. You can change the information by clicking each of these tabs:
 General: This tab shows the track title, artist name, album title, genre,
and preference. It also offers album artwork retrieved from the song
information database on the Internet. Alternatively, you can add your
own artwork by clicking the Find Art File button and browsing your hard
drive for the file or by clicking Paste from Clipboard if you already have
the artwork copied to the Windows Clipboard.
 Lyrics: This tab lets you add the lyrics to songs. You can copy the lyrics
from a text editor (such as Notepad or Microsoft Word) or a Web page
and paste them into the empty text box.
 Notes: This tab lets you add notes and comments. You can copy infor-
mation from a text editor and paste it into the empty text box.
 Bios: This tab lets you add musician credits or other information (such
as liner notes) to songs. You can copy this information from a text editor
and paste it into the empty text box.
BC48 iPod & iTunes For Dummies, 5th Edition

 More: This tab lets you categorize your songs by tempo, mood, and situ-
ation; specify the year of release; and add URLs (Internet addresses) for
more information. You can also specify whether the song should be pre-
pared for volume leveling.
Although most of this added information is ignored by the iPod (only the
information on the General tab is transferred), the information makes it
easier to find music in the MusicMatch Jukebox library and prepare playlists
for different occasions; a playlist is a list of songs to play in a particular order.
You can, for example, select all your up-tempo songs for a playlist and trans-
fer that playlist to your iPod for listening on an upbeat day.
Super-tagging songs with information
You can tag your music with information automatically by using the super-
tagging feature. After you transfer your songs into the music library, select a
group of songs or an entire album, right-click the selection, and choose Super
Tagging (or choose Edit➪Super Tag Playlist Track(s) with the album or songs
already selected) and then choose one of the following:
 Lookup Tags to find and add information from the Internet. Even if you
have partial song information, super-tagging can fill in the remaining
tags. The Lookup Tags results window displays the tags found for each
track. Choose the tag set that best represents your tracks.
 Tag from Filename to find and add information based on the music
track’s filename. For example, if the music file is U2 - Beautiful
Day.mp3, the tags created are U2 for the Artist field and Beautiful Day
for the Track Title field.
 Rename Files to change the filenames to reflect a change in the artist’s
name. (Music files are stored by artist name.) MusicMatch Jukebox dis-
plays the current name and new name for each song, and you can click
OK if you want to make the change.
Viewing Your Song Library
When you update your iPod automatically, all the songs in your library are
transferred to your iPod. However, if you want to update your iPod manually
with specific songs or albums, you need to be able to find these songs and
albums in the library quickly. With MusicMatch Jukebox, you can sort the list
of songs and locate songs or albums.

Browsing the library
When you first open MusicMatch Jukebox, the Library window displays
songs in a similar fashion as Windows Explorer, with songs appearing as files
within a folder that uses the artist’s name, as shown in Figure BC3-8 (showing
the songs from the album All That You Can’t Leave Behind, by the band U2).
Clicking the plus sign next to an artist’s name opens that listing like a folder;
clicking the minus sign closes the folder.
To make a column wider or narrower in MusicMatch Jukebox, drag the divid-
ing line between the column and the next column.
Changing views of your library
MusicMatch Jukebox lets you customize the Library window to show more 
or less information, or different information, in the columns. You can change
your music library’s display of songs to view by album, artist, genre, or even
album art.
To change the viewing of songs for browsing, click the folder icon in the View
By column, which displays a drop-down menu for choosing different ways to
view the songs.
When you select to view by album cover art, the album covers appear in the
music library, with pop-up text balloons appearing over each album as you
move your mouse over them.
Double-click a song in the list or double-click an album, and the song (or
songs) appears in the Playlist window and starts playing. Click the Clear
button under the playlist to clear the playlist.

To change the columns in the song list, choose Options➪Settings➪Music
Library to display the Settings window. In the View By pop-up menu, you can
change the first column of the song listing, which typically is the column
used for sorting the list.
You can choose up to six more columns (for a total of seven) to display in the
song list. To pick the type of information for a column, select the check box
for the column and choose the type of information (tag) for that column. An
unselected column header indicates a column that doesn’t appear.
You can also right-click any column heading in the MusicMatch Jukebox song
list to change the type of information that it shows.
The column headers also act as sorting options; click once to sort in ascend-
ing order, and click again to sort in descending order. The arrow indicator in
the header indicates whether the sort is in ascending or descending order —
when the arrow points up, the sort is in ascending order; a down arrow indi-
cates a descending order.
Searching for songs
To search for a song in MusicMatch Jukebox, click the Find button in the
Library window to display the Find in Music Library dialog. Type part or all
of a song name’s characters and then click Find First (or OK).
MusicMatch Jukebox lists the first match for the characters in the Find
window. You can continue to find more matches by clicking Find Next.
Clicking the Add button adds the song to your current playlist.
You can use the Match Complete Name Only and Match Case options to
refine your search. To match the complete name, you must type the entire
song name. To match case, you must type the name exactly as it appears in
the list, with uppercase and lowercase characters.
Synchronizing Your iPod with 
MusicMatch Jukebox
You can set up your iPod to be synchronized with music from the Music-
Match library in different ways, depending on how much music you have in
your library: automatically, by playlist, with preselected songs, or manually.
BC51
Bonus Chapter 3: Putting a Dime in the MusicMatch Jukebox

Synchronizing automatically
Adding music to and deleting music from your iPod can be totally automatic.
By default, the iPod is set up to synchronize itself automatically with your
music library.
With automatic synchronization, your iPod matches your library exactly,
song for song, playlist for playlist. MusicMatch Jukebox automatically copies
everything in your music library to your iPod. If you made changes in your
music library after the last time you synchronized your iPod, those changes
are automatically made in your iPod when you connect it to the computer
again. If you added or deleted songs in your library, those songs are added 
or deleted in your iPod’s library (unless you use the Ignore All Content
Deletions option).
By default, MusicMatch Jukebox is set up to automatically synchronize your
iPod unless you disabled the Complete Library Synchronization option in the
Options dialog.
Follow these steps to sync your iPod to MusicMatch :
1. Connect your iPod to the PC, and MusicMatch opens.
If MusicMatch Jukebox doesn’t launch by itself, start the program.
Wait a few minutes for MusicMatch Jukebox to recognize your iPod,
which appears in the PortablesPlus window under the Attached
Portable Devices folder. If the window is not yet open, choose File➪
Send to Portable Device to open it.
2. Select your iPod and click the Sync button to update your iPod with
the MusicMatch Jukebox music library.
3. Click Yes for the warning message that appears.
4. When the synchronization is complete, click the Eject button in the
bottom-left corner of the PortablesPlus window to eject the iPod.
During synchronization, the iPod displays the Do not disconnect
warning. Wait for the synchronization to finish and also for the iPod to
display the iPod main menu (or the message OK to disconnect in
older iPods) before disconnecting it from your computer.
If you changed your iPod options to copy music manually or synchronize
automatically by playlist, you can change it back to automatic synchroniza-
tion by following these steps:
1. Connect your iPod to your PC and wait for MusicMatch Jukebox to
recognize your iPod.
BC52 iPod & iTunes For Dummies, 5th Edition

Your iPod appears in the PortablesPlus window under the Attached
Portable Devices folder. If the window is not yet open, choose File➪Send

2. Select the iPod, click the Options button, click the Synchronization
tab, and then select the Complete Library Synchronization option, as
shown in Figure BC3-9.
3. (Optional) Enable the options to Automatically Synchronize on Device
Connection and Ignore All Content Deletions.
You can set your iPod to automatically synchronize each time you con-
nect the iPod so that the synchronization starts immediately. Or, you
can set it to ignore all content deletions so that the synchronization
doesn’t delete anything in your iPod — it simply adds more music, leav-
ing the music on your iPod intact.
4. Click OK to close the Options dialog.
5. Click the Sync button in the PortablesPlus window to synchronize
your iPod with the MusicMatch Jukebox music library.
6. Click Yes for the warning message that appears.

Synchronizing by MusicMatch playlist
If you have several iPods or music devices, or several people sharing one
music library or one iPod, you might want to set up automatic synchroniza-
tion by playlist so that you can determine which playlists (and associated
music files) are copied to the iPod automatically. Before using this option,
create the playlists that you want to copy to the iPod, as described earlier in
this chapter.
MusicMatch Jukebox lets you save playlists and synchronize them automati-
cally. When you use this feature, you can make changes to the defined
playlists in the library, and the changes are automatically updated to the
iPod’s versions of the same playlists. You can create new playlists and define
them for synchronization, and MusicMatch then copies the new playlists and
music to the iPod.
To define playlists for automatic synchronization, follow these steps:
1. Connect your iPod to your PC and wait for it to be recognized by
MusicMatch Jukebox.
Your iPod appears in the PortablesPlus window under the Attached
Portable Devices folder. If the window is not yet open, choose File➪Send
to Portable Device.
2. Select the iPod, click the Options button, click the Synchronization
tab, and then select the Selected Playlist Synchronization option.
You can also enable the options to Automatically Synchronize on Device
Connection and Ignore All Content Deletions.
3. Select each playlist that you want to synchronize and then click OK to
close the Options dialog.
4. Click the Sync button in the PortablesPlus window to synchronize
your iPod with the defined playlists.
5. Click Yes for the warning message that appears.
6. When the synchronization is complete, click the Eject button in the
bottom-left corner of the PortablesPlus window to eject the iPod.
Copying music manually
You can copy music directly to your iPod without automatic synchronization.
The iPod’s playlists appear directly under the iPod’s name on the left side of
the PortablesPlus window. The contents of the iPod (or the contents of the
selected playlist in the iPod) appear on the right side of the window.
BC54 iPod & iTunes For Dummies, 5th Edition

To copy music directly to your iPod, follow these steps:
1. Connect your iPod to your PC and wait for MusicMatch Jukebox to
recognize your iPod.
Your iPod appears in the PortablesPlus window under the Attached
Portable Devices folder. If the window is not yet open, choose File➪Send
to Portable Device.
2. Select the iPod so that its contents appear on the right side of the
window.
3. Drag entire albums or songs from the music library window to the
PortablesPlus window.
4. When the copying is complete, drag more albums or songs or click the
Eject button in the bottom-left corner of the PortablesPlus window to
eject the iPod.
Deleting Songs
Deleting songs or albums from the MusicMatch Jukebox library is easy. Select
the song or album in the library window, right-click, and choose Remove. The
song files aren’t deleted — only the links to the library are deleted. You must
still use Windows Explorer to locate and delete the song and album files. See
“Searching for songs” earlier in this chapter for details on how to find the
song files in MusicMatch Jukebox.
If you synchronize your iPod automatically, song deletion is also automatic
on the iPod. If you delete a song or album from your music library, the next
time you synchronize the iPod, the song or album is deleted automatically
(unless you disable the Ignore All Content Selections option).
However, if you’re manually copying music to your iPod, you also have to
manually delete songs that you no longer want on your iPod.
Connect your iPod, select the iPod in MusicMatch, and then delete the songs
as you do in MusicMatch.
Repairing Broken Links to Songs
MusicMatch Jukebox can play songs located anywhere on your hard drive,
but if changes occur to your hard drive’s folder structure or to folder names,
BC55
Bonus Chapter 3: Putting a Dime in the MusicMatch Jukebox

some of your songs might not be linked properly to MusicMatch Jukebox.
Fortunately, you can repair these links automatically.
If you get the <path\track . . . could not be found . . .
message while trying to play a track from your library, you can repair the link
by right-clicking the track and choosing Repair Broken Links (or choosing
Options➪Music Library➪Repair Broken Links). MusicMatch Jukebox scans
your library for broken links and offers the following functions in a dialog:
 Fix It: Browses your hard drive for the file to re-link it to the library.
 Remove: Removes the link from your library but doesn’t remove the
music file from your computer.
 Remove All: Removes all broken links. MusicMatch Jukebox searches
your entire library and removes any links to tracks that are no longer
active. However, it does not remove the music files from your computer.
 Skip: Skips the current missing link and moves on to the next one.
 Abort: Ends the repair process prematurely.
You should repair all broken links before synchronizing your iPod to your
MusicMatch Jukebox library so that you don’t miss any songs.
MusicMatch Jukebox Encoders
MusicMatch Jukebox offers several options for fine-tuning CD-ripping. When
you first use the program, the MP3 recording format is selected by default,
offering various quality options. You can change the recording format (prop-
erly known as an encoder) to mp3PRO, WAV, Windows Media, and other
encoder formats that are associated with third-party, plug-in software for
MusicMatch Jukebox.
You have two choices for encoding formats in MusicMatch Jukebox that will
work with your iPod: MP3 (and its variations) and WAV. Choose MP3 (or a
variation, such as mp3PRO) for songs you want to enjoy on your iPod.
Although using a WAV encoder provides the highest-quality sound, it doesn’t
compress the audio; therefore, using WAV format isn’t as useful for iPods.
WAV files, the digital audio standard for Windows, take up enormous amounts
of hard drive and iPod space because they’re uncompressed. Use a WAV
encoder if you plan on burning the song to an audio CD or want to use the
song with a PC-based, digital sound-editing program.
BC56 iPod & iTunes For Dummies, 5th Edition

The mp3PRO encoder that’s provided with MusicMatch Jukebox creates a
smaller MP3 file, using greater file compression than a standard MP3 encoder.
People typically use an mp3PRO encoder for songs that don’t require high-
fidelity playback because an mp3PRO encoder compresses files even further
and fits more songs on your iPod.
To get the benefits of different formats, import a CD with one encoder (such as
WAV) and then import the CD again with a different encoder (such as MP3).
Although MusicMatch Jukebox can converts an MP3 file to a WAV file or an
MP3 file at a lower bit rate to an MP3 file with a higher bit rate, neither con-
version improves the song quality. You might have a reason for converting
from MP3 to WAV, but the song’s quality remains exactly the same and
requires more hard drive space. The same is true for converting MP3s from a
lower bit rate to a higher bit rate. The most useful conversion is from a WAV
file (the format used for burning CDs) to an MP3 file (the format used on the
Web and iPod). Although this conversion slightly reduces the quality of the
song, it shrinks file size exponentially so that more songs can fit on your
iPod.
Recording in Windows with 
MusicMatch Jukebox
You can also use MusicMatch Jukebox to record sound through a PC Line In
connection. Follow these steps:
1. Choose Options➪Settings and click the Recorder tab.
2. Choose Line In from the Recording Source pop-up menu.
Alternatively, you can choose Options➪Recorder➪Source ➪Line In.
MusicMatch Jukebox uses the Recorder Settings for recording the audio
(which you can set by choosing Options➪Settings➪Recorder). You can
read about this in the following section.
3. Click the Advanced button so that MusicMatch Jukebox will automati-
cally detect the end of a song. Then click the Active button and select
the Auto Song Detect option.
4. Select the Gap Length and Gap Level options.
Gap length is the amount of time between songs (typically about 1.5 sec-
onds, or about 1,500 milliseconds [ms]) that MusicMatch Jukebox uses
to determine when a song ends and another begins. The Gap Level tells
MusicMatch Jukebox to listen for a certain volume level to determine
BC57
Bonus Chapter 3: Putting a Dime in the MusicMatch Jukebox

when a song is over (typically about 10 percent of the total volume or
less).
5. Start the source sound player and click the Record button in the
Recorder window to start recording from the analog source.
Each recorded segment is listed in the Recorder window as a separate
song with a generic title.
MusicMatch Jukebox saves the recording with the encoding format that you
set in Recorder Settings (which you can set prior to recording by choosing
Options➪Settings➪Recorder). The recording is automatically added to your
MusicMatch Jukebox library, which you can use to update your iPod, as we
describe in Bonus Chapter 2.
Changing Recorder Settings 
in MusicMatch Jukebox
In MusicMatch Jukebox, encoder settings are called Recorder Settings. To
change your Recorder Settings in MusicMatch Jukebox, choose Options➪
Settings➪Recorder, which displays the Settings dialog. There, you have sev-
eral options, as the following sections describe.
Selecting MP3 settings
You can select the following quality settings for MP3 recording in MusicMatch
Jukebox:
 CD Quality (128 Kbps): Measured in kilobits per second (Kpbs), this
option offers the most common bit rate for MP3 files on the Web. The
notion that this is CD quality is subjective. With this setting, one minute
of music takes about 1MB of hard drive space.
 Near CD Quality (96 Kbps): When using this setting, one minute of
music takes about 700K of hard drive space. However, we find the qual-
ity to be poor. If you don’t hear or mind the difference, you can certainly
cram more music on your iPod with this setting.
 FM Radio Quality (64 Kbps): Bit rates lower than 96 Kbps are appropri-
ate for voice recordings or sound effects — not music. At this setting,
one minute takes about 400K of hard drive space.
BC58 iPod & iTunes For Dummies, 5th Edition

 Custom Quality: Choosing this option sets the stereo bit rate. A higher
bit rate offers higher-quality sound and increases file size. The most
common bit rate for MP3 files available on the Web is 128 Kbps. Lower
bit rates are more appropriate for voice recordings or sound effects. We
recommend using at least 192 Kbps for most music. We use 320 Kbps,
the maximum setting, for songs we play on iPods.
 Custom Quality (VBR): This setting uses Variable Bit Rate (VBR) encod-
ing to vary the number of bits used to store the music depending on the
complexity of the sound. MusicMatch Jukebox offers a range from 1
(lowest quality with highest compression) to 100 (highest quality with
least compression). At its highest setting, VBR might use the highest bit
rate of 320 Kbps in sections of songs where the sound is complex enough
to require a high bit rate, while keeping the rest of the song at a lower bit
rate to save file space. We recommend using only the highest setting if
you use VBR at all.
 Digital: MusicMatch Jukebox can record from either a digital or an
analog source. When ripping CDs, select the Digital option. Use the Error
Correction option to filter noise and produce better results with CDs
that have minor scratches. If you hear clicks and pops or a jittery sound
in the recorded digital music, try using this option, which minimizes the
audio artifacts that occur from drive-seeking errors. Recording time
takes longer, but the recording quality might be better with some
CD-ROM drives.
 Analog: The Analog setting, which records in real time, is by far the
slowest method and is provided for recording from slow (1X) CD-ROM
drives to get higher-quality results.
BC59
Bonus Chapter 3: Putting a Dime in the MusicMatch Jukebox
Using the mp3PRO encoder
MusicMatch Jukebox offers the mp3PRO
encoder for creating smaller MP3 files that
come close in quality to the larger files created
by the default MP3 encoder. The mp3PRO
encoder can create files that are nearly 50 per-
cent smaller, but it offers only low bit rate set-
tings up to 96 Kbps, which is suitable for mono
records that predate 1960 and voice recordings,
but not much else. (Use the MP3 encoder for
higher bit rate settings.)
The mp3PRO encoder offers the CD Transparency
setting for 96 Kbps, which is the only setting we
recommend. The lower settings aren’t useful
because the sound quality is poor (at least, to
me). You can also set a custom bit rate, but not
one higher than 96 Kbps. Variable Bit Rate
(VBR; discussed elsewhere in this chapter) is
also provided.

Selecting the WAV format
If you plan on burning the song to an audio CD, use the WAV format, which
offers the highest possible quality. The files occupy more space than MP3
files because they aren’t compressed. One minute of music in the WAV format
occupies about 10MB of hard drive or iPod space. CD Quality is the only
option for WAV.
Using advanced recording options
MusicMatch Jukebox offers advanced settings, which you can access by
clicking the Advanced button in the Settings dialog. The Advanced Recording
Options dialog appears, and you can select a variety of recording options and
special effects.
The following options improve the recording quality when ripping songs 
from CDs:
 MP3 Encoding: You can force the recording into Stereo or Mono format
with this option. By default, MusicMatch Jukebox is set to use the appro-
priate setting that matches the source — Stereo for stereo sources, and
Mono for mono sources.
 Maximum Bandwidth: This option sets the range of frequencies allowed
in the MP3 file. The human ear can theoretically hear frequencies up to
22 kilohertz (kHz), but many humans actually can’t hear anything higher
than 16 kHz. If you want frequencies higher than 16 kHz (often found in
classical music), you can adjust this slider higher.
 Auto Config: This option automatically configures MusicMatch Jukebox
for your CD-ROM drive and should be used whenever you install a differ-
ent CD-ROM drive. You can select the sample size (short, medium, or
long) in the pop-up menu before configuring. Although you can config-
ure most drives by using the short or medium sample size, some need
the long size.
 Digital Audio Extraction (DAE): If your audio files sound like they play
too fast, perhaps the CD drive doesn’t operate fast enough to keep up
with the recording process — a drive speed/recording speed mismatch.
Changing the DAE Speed setting to 4 (for a 4X recording speed) generally
fixes this problem. If not, you can try 2X or real-time recording (1X). If
you hear jitter in the sound even with error correction on, try turning on
the Multipass option so that MusicMatch Jukebox reads the CD track
multiple times, ensuring a successful recording (while also increasing
recording time).
BC60 iPod & iTunes For Dummies, 5th Edition

The following special effects might be useful to you when recording songs:
 Fade In: You can record a song with a fade-in at the beginning and set
the number of seconds for the fade-in. The fade-in is recorded along with
the audio so that it’s permanently part of the music file.
 Fade Out: You can record a song with a fade-out at the end and set the
number of seconds for the fade-out. The fade-out is also permanently
part of the music file.
 Track Offset: Use this option to start the recording process a number of
seconds into the track instead of at the very beginning. For example, if a
CD track has no sound or an introduction that you want to skip, you can
specify the number of seconds to skip (offset) before starting to record.
Setting Up the iPod Hard Drive
You can enable the iPod to work as a hard drive in Windows by using Music-
Match Jukebox (as described in the following steps) or the iPod Manager utility
installed with MusicMatch Jukebox (as described in the upcoming step list).
1. Connect your iPod to your PC and wait for MusicMatch Jukebox to

Troubleshooting iPod for Windows 
and MusicMatch Jukebox
Troubleshooting any complex and varied operating system (OS) can be a
daunting task, and it’s no secret that Windows is somewhat different than the
Mac OS. Installing the latest updates and service packs from Microsoft
ensures that your Windows PC is up to date.
BC63
Bonus Chapter 3: Putting a Dime in the MusicMatch Jukebox

If you use MusicMatch Jukebox with your iPod on a Windows PC, you use
iPod Updater to update or restore your iPod. (You can also use iTunes; see
Chapter 24.) iPod Updater is installed when you install iPod for Windows from
the iPod for Windows CD-ROM. iPod Updater can update the software that
controls an iPod and can also update the firmware for the iPod hard drive, if
necessary. The update doesn’t affect the data stored on an iPod hard drive.
Updating an iPod with the MusicMatch
Jukebox configuration
To update an iPod’s firmware and software with the version of iPod Updater
supplied on CD-ROM with MusicMatch Jukebox, follow these steps:
1. Connect the iPod to your computer.
MusicMatch Jukebox opens, displaying the iPod in the PortablesPlus
window. If you set your iPod for automatic update, MusicMatch Jukebox
synchronizes the iPod with music and playlists from its library. Music-
Match Jukebox notifies you when the music update is complete.
2. Close MusicMatch Jukebox by clicking the Close button or by choos-
ing File➪Exit.
3. Open iPod Updater by choosing Start➪iPod➪iPod Updater.
4. Click the Update button.
If the Update button is dimmed, the software on the iPod is the same
version or a newer version than iPod Updater. You should quit the
Updater and skip these steps.
After clicking Update, a progress bar appears. When the progress bar
shows that the update is finished, the Update button is dimmed, indicat-
ing that your iPod no longer needs an update.
5. Click the Close button in iPod Updater to quit.
6. Eject the iPod.
When you quit iPod Updater, MusicMatch Jukebox might launch again
because your iPod is still connected. You can eject the iPod by clicking
the Eject button in the bottom-left corner of the MusicMatch Jukebox
PortablesPlus window.
If MusicMatch Jukebox doesn’t launch, you can eject the iPod in one of
two ways:
BC64 iPod & iTunes For Dummies, 5th Edition

• Right-click the iPod Watcher icon on the taskbar and choose
Unmount.
• Right-click the Safe Remove Hardware icon on the taskbar. Choose
the Apple IEEE 1394 (FireWire) device if you’re using FireWire, or the
USB Mass Storage device if you’re using USB, and then click the
Unmount button.
Because of how an iPod for Windows works with MusicMatch Jukebox, you
should use only one of the two eject methods (or the Eject button in Music-
Match Jukebox) to eject your iPod. Do not right-click the iPod icon in the My
Computer window and choose Eject. This Eject option doesn’t work with iPod
for Windows and MusicMatch Jukebox and might cause your iPod to stop
working — forcing you to restore the iPod to its original conditions and
wiping out your music.
After ejecting an iPod, wait for its display to show the main menu or the OK
to disconnect message. You can then disconnect the iPod from its dock or
disconnect the dock from the computer. Don’t ever disconnect an iPod before
ejecting it. You might have to reset your iPod.

Sometimes MusicMatch Jukebox fails to recognize an iPod through the
FireWire connection. Don’t panic; follow these steps first:
1. Follow the instructions in the “Taking Your First Troubleshooting
Steps” section in Chapter 24.
Make sure that your connection from the iPod to the computer is prop-
erly secure and that your iPod has power.
2. Wait until activity stops on your iPod.

activity indicator (two arrows spinning in a circle) appears in the upper-
left corner of the display. Before ejecting or disconnecting, wait for the
arrows to stop spinning.

3. Eject the iPod.
You can eject the iPod by
• Right-clicking the iPod Watcher icon on the taskbar and choosing
Unmount.
• Right-clicking the Safe Remove Hardware icon on the taskbar. 
Then choose the Apple IEEE 1394 (FireWire) device if you’re using
FireWire, or the USB Mass Storage device if you’re using USB; then
click the Unmount button.
4. Restart your PC.
5. Disconnect the iPod and reconnect it.
6. Launch MusicMatch Jukebox if it doesn’t launch automatically.
If MusicMatch Jukebox still doesn’t recognize the iPod, try restoring the iPod,
which we cover in the earlier section, “Restoring an iPod with the Music-
Match Jukebox configuration.”
When shipped from the factory, an iPod’s hard drive is formatted as a Mac
hard drive. When you install the iPod with MusicMatch Jukebox, iPod for
Windows 2.0 software reformats the drive by using the Windows (FAT32)
format. If the iPod doesn’t appear in MusicMatch Jukebox the first time you
connect it after installing the software, the iPod might still be formatted as a
Mac hard drive. You can check the format on your iPod by choosing
Settings➪About. If the About display doesn’t read, Windows, reinstall the
iPod software (see Bonus Chapter 1) and check again to make sure that it for-
matted the drive with the Windows (FAT32) format.
If an iPod doesn’t appear in MusicMatch Jukebox and Do Not Disconnect
appears on the iPod display, open the iPod Manager utility and make sure
that MusicMatch Jukebox is the home application. The iPod Manager utility
is provided with iPod for Windows to change iPod settings, launch the soft-
ware updater, check the Apple site for updates, and change the home applica-
tion for the iPod (set to MusicMatch Jukebox by default). To change the
home application with iPod Manager, follow these steps:
1. Click the iPod Watcher icon on the taskbar.
2. Click the Change Home Application button and choose MusicMatch
from the pop-up menu.
3. Click OK to close the iPod Manager window.
4. Eject the iPod.
5. Disconnect the iPod and reconnect it.
6. Launch MusicMatch Jukebox if it doesn’t launch automatically.

Bonus Chapter 3: Putting a Dime in the MusicMatch Jukebox

If an iPod doesn’t appear in MusicMatch Jukebox but you see menus on the
iPod’s display, make sure that Disk Mode is enabled in the iPod Manager util-
ity. See “Setting Up the iPod Hard Drive,” earlier in this chapter.
If your iPod still doesn’t appear in MusicMatch Jukebox, restart the Windows
PC while the iPod is connected. Occasionally, the FireWire connection on a
PC conflicts with another device or fails to work for some mysterious reason.
You can tell when this happens: Launch the System control panel in Control
Panels, click the Hardware tab, and then click the Device Manager icon. The
Apple iPod IEEE 1394 device should be listed. If it has a yellow exclamation
point next to it, a conflict exists. You might be able to temporarily resolve the
conflict by restarting Windows.

Using Your iPod for 
Backup and Restore

 Using your iPod for backing up full-resolution images and files
 Transferring photos from a camera or card reader to your iPod
 Putting Mac OS X, OS 9, or Linux on your iPod 
A
lthough an iPod is a road warrior’s dream weapon for combating fatigue
and boredom, it can also prove invaluable as a tool for quick informa-
tion and saving your files from disaster — that is, if you update and maintain
its hard drive contents wisely. Don’t let hard drive space go to waste: Fill up
your iPod and let it be your road manager. You can put your most important
applications, utilities, and files on the iPod hard drive as a backup.
Mac users can even put a version of the Mac Operating System (OS 9 or OS X)
on FireWire-based second-, third-, and fourth-generation iPods in case of
emergencies, and they can boot the system from an iPod. (Unfortunately, you
can’t do this with Windows.) Apple doesn’t recommend putting the Mac OS
on older iPods because using the iPod as a startup hard drive might make
your iPod too hot from overuse.
The key to these capabilities is that you can enable your iPod to act as an
external hard drive. See Chapter 22 for details on how to do this.
We don’t recommend using an iPod regularly as a hard drive to launch appli-
cations because iPods are designed for sustained playback of music and
video. You can eventually burn out the device by using it to launch applica-
tions. Instead, use its external hard drive capabilities for backing up and
copying files. Copy applications to a hard drive before launching them.

Transferring Full-Resolution 
Photos and Images
Picture quality with a digital camera is measured by the number of pixels —
specific points of information in a picture, also known as the image resolution.
Digital cameras are described by the image resolution in millions of pixels, or
megapixels (MP). Higher megapixel counts usually result in better images. For
example, a 2MP camera produces good 4" x 6" prints and acceptable 8" x 10"
prints. A 3MP camera produces very good 4" x 6" prints and magazine-quality
8" x 10" prints. A 5MP camera produces good quality 10" x 14" prints. And so on.
By default, a color-display iPod doesn’t need full photo resolution to display
them well on televisions and use them with video projectors, which are far
lower in resolution than prints. Certainly, the tiny iPod display doesn’t need
high resolution in the photos that it displays. And, the higher the resolution,
the more space the photo takes. So, during file transfer, iPod software opti-
mizes photos for video display to save space.
If you intend to use your iPod to transfer images to another computer or to
make a backup of your photos in their original resolution, you can set an
option to include full-resolution versions of the photos when transferring
photos.
Using the Include Full-Resolution Photos option copies full-resolution photos
into the Photos folder of your iPod, which you can access on your computer
by enabling your iPod for hard drive use. Follow these steps:
1. Select the device name in the iTunes Source pane.
2. Click the Photos tab.
The Photos synchronization options page appears. (See Chapter 12 for
details on synchronizing photos with your iPod.)
3. Select the Sync Photos From option and then choose a photo library
or a folder from the pop-up menu.
You can choose your photo library (such as iPhoto on a Mac, or Adobe
Photoshop Album in Windows) from the pop-up menu to synchronize
photo albums, or choose a folder from the pop-up menu (such as your
Pictures folder). You can also opt for Choose Folder from the pop-up
menu to browse files and folders on your hard drive or other storage
media (such as a CD-ROM or a server volume). In Finder or Windows
Explorer, browse your hard drive (or other storage media) for the folder
containing images and then click Choose (Mac) or OK (Windows).
BC70 iPod & iTunes For Dummies, 5th Edition 

4. Select one of the following photo options below the Sync Photos
option:
• All Photos and Albums: Synchronizes all photos and albums from
the library or folder selected in Step 3 with your iPod.
• Selected Albums: Synchronizes the photo albums from the library
(or subfolders from the folder) selected in Step 3. You can scroll
the list box to see all photo albums in your photo library (or sub-
folders in your folder). Select the check box to select a photo
album (or subfolder) to synchronize with the device.
5. Select the Include Full-Resolution Photos option.
6. Click Apply to apply the changes.
Transferring Photos from a Camera
You can use your iPod as a portable hard drive that doubles as a storage
repository for your photos — even an older iPod that doesn’t display photos.
With full-size iPods that have a dock connector, you can use an accessory to
temporarily store photos from digital camera memory cards at full resolution
so that you can later import the photos into your computer.
If you’re traveling with just your digital camera and your iPod, you can shoot
all the pictures you want without worrying about filling up your camera’s
memory card. Just connect the camera to your iPod and transfer the photos
to your iPod hard drive; you can use the Apple iPod Camera Connector (avail-
able from the Apple store) or the Belkin Media Reader for iPod (http://
catalog.belkin.com). Delete the pictures from your camera’s memory
card and then go snap some more. You could travel for weeks on end, shoot-
ing thousands of photos in locations around the world, without running out
of space in your iPod.
The key to these capabilities is that an iPod can serve as an external hard
drive. After you mount the iPod on your Mac or Windows desktop, you can
use it as a hard drive.
The Apple iPod Camera Connector and other accessories like it connect to an
iPod’s dock connection to transfer photos quickly to the Photos folder on
your iPod hard drive. Your iPod can hold hundreds or even thousands of
photos (depending on how much music is already stored on it). These acces-
sories work only with full-sized iPod models with dock connectors.
BC71
Bonus Chapter 4: Using Your iPod for Backup and Restore

To transfer the photos to the iPhoto library on a Mac, mount the iPod as a
hard drive. Then import the photos by dragging the files directly from the
iPod hard drive and dropping them over the iPhoto window. To transfer the
photos to a Windows photo application, such as Adobe Photo Album or
Photoshop Elements, drag the files or the entire Photos folder directly from
the iPod hard drive into a folder on your hard drive and then open them with
the photo application.
With the Apple iPod Camera Connector, you can shoot your photos, transfer
them into a color-display iPod for storage, preview them on the iPod, and
continue shooting. Depending how much space you have on your iPod, you
could continue shooting photos indefinitely without having to visit your com-
puter or use more memory cards.
The iPod Camera Connector is a convenient adapter — about the size of a
flash memory card and about twice as thick — that connects to a color-
display iPod dock connection and lets you plug in a USB cable connected to
your digital camera. You can then temporarily store photos from digital
camera memory cards at full resolution on the iPod, and you can import
them later into your computer.
To transfer photos with the iPod Camera Connector, follow these steps:
1. Connect your digital camera to the iPod Camera Connector.
Use the USB cable supplied with your camera.
2. Connect the iPod Camera Connector to the dock connection of your
color-display iPod.
3. Turn on your digital camera.
The Import menu appears on the iPod color display, showing the
number of photos in the camera and the space occupied, along with the
Import and Cancel menu functions.
4. To import photos, highlight Import and press the Select button.
The Photo Import menu appears, showing the progress of the download
to your iPod. During this process, you can choose the Stop and Save
function to save the pictures you’ve downloaded or Cancel to cancel the
download. When the download finishes, your color-display iPod gives
you the option to erase the camera’s memory card.
Taking Your System on the Road
Life on the road can be hazardous to your laptop’s hard drive, and if any por-
tion of the hard drive containing system files is damaged, your system might
BC72 iPod & iTunes For Dummies, 5th Edition 

not start up. When this happens, you ordinarily use the installation CDs or
DVDs to start the computer, scan and fix the hard drive trouble spots, and
reinstall the operating system (OS). The installation CDs or DVDs let you load
and start — boot — the system onto your computer regardless of the status
of the hard drive. With a Mac, you can accomplish the same thing with
another hard drive set up with a system to boot your computer.
Well, your iPod is another hard drive. Older iPod models that use FireWire for
updating — the first through fourth generations — can also boot a Mac with
a replacement OS. This feature could prove very handy for saving your Mac
in a system crisis if you have a spare OS saved on your iPod. It’s even more
useful for people who want to boot another OS, such as Linux. Unfortunately,
it doesn’t work with the current fifth-generation models that rely on USB 2.0
for updating, but it does work with the Intel-based Mac models that can boot
from a USB 2.0 drive. Although Apple doesn’t officially support system boot-
ing from an iPod, you can load the iPod with a minimally configured Mac or
Linux system and then use the iPod to start up your Mac. Depending on the
size of your iPod, you should be able to fit both a minimal system and a 
considerable amount of music on the iPod. (Mac models introduced after
January 2003 can’t start up with Mac OS 9, so you need to save Mac OS X to
your iPod unless you use an older Mac.)
Although you can safely copy files and folders to and from your iPod (using it
as a hard drive), booting a system from an iPod severely strains the hard
drive and shortens the life of your iPod — so do this only in an emergency.
iPods’ drives just weren’t designed to support that kind of activity over a
long period of time, and the heat alone could eventually fry your iPod.
To get the most functionality from your iPod, make sure that you have the
latest version of iPod software. To update your iPod software to the latest
version, see Chapter 24.
To copy files and applications to your iPod, first enable the iPod as a hard
drive, as we describe in Chapter 22.
Installing Mac OS X
If you use an older Mac that can run OS X 10.1 (not an Intel-based or G4 Mac)
and a FireWire-based iPod (first through fourth generation models), you
probably can get by with this older, leaner, meaner version of OS X as an
emergency system to boot your computer. To install a custom version of the
older OS X 10.1 on the FireWire-based iPod, first enable the iPod as a hard
drive, as we describe in Chapter 22, and then follow these steps:
BC73
Bonus Chapter 4: Using Your iPod for Backup and Restore

1. Insert your Mac OS X installation CD into your Mac and follow the
directions to start the installation process.
You have to restart the Mac with the installation CD while holding down
C to start the computer from the CD.
2. When the installer asks you to select a destination, choose the iPod
hard drive.
Do not use the option to erase and format the hard drive because the hard
drive of your iPod is specially formatted for playing music, and format-
ting it in this manner prevents it from playing music again. Do not format
it! If you format or erase an iPod hard drive by mistake, you must restore
it to its factory condition; see Chapter 24.
3. Specify a custom installation instead of a standard installation.
To make sure that you don’t use too much hard drive space on your
iPod, choose a custom installation of OS X. In the custom installation
section, choose only the languages that you need. These language
options take up a lot of space, and you probably don’t need them.
4. After installation finishes and the Mac restarts from the iPod, con-
tinue through the setup procedure and then use Software Update in
System Preferences to update the Mac system on your iPod.
Most likely, a lot of system updates are waiting for you (released after
the date of your installation CDs). Take the time to update your system
because these updates might make a difference how your computer per-
forms with certain applications.
To install a custom version of OS X version 10.2 (Jaguar) through version
10.4.7 (Tiger) on your iPod, you can use SuperDuper! (www.shirt-pocket.
com/SuperDuper/SuperDuperDescription.html). Although you could
clone your system by using the UNIX ditto command in the Terminal
window of Mac OS X, this process is tedious, and you could easily make a
mistake.
You can also install a custom version of OS X version 10.3 (Panther) or ver-
sion 10.4 (Tiger) on your iPod by connecting your iPod as a hard drive and
then using the Disk Utility program supplied with OS X. (It’s in the Utilities
folder inside your Applications folder.) Using Disk Utility, drag the icon for a
source hard drive with a version of OS X to the Source text box in the Disk
Utility dialog, and then drag your iPod hard drive icon into the Destination
text box. Click Restore, and the program does everything for you.
To start a Mac in an emergency situation from an iPod that runs Mac OS X,
connect the iPod, hold down Option, and choose Restart from the Apple
menu. (Or, if your system is already hosed, use the Power button to reboot
BC74 iPod & iTunes For Dummies, 5th Edition 

while holding down Option.) Eventually, while the Mac resets itself and scans
itself for any startup drives, all the startup drives appear as icons in a row,
with a right-pointing arrow underneath the icons. Click the icon representing
the iPod hard drive and then click the right-pointing arrow to start the
system from that drive.
While you’re at it, copy the Disk Utility program to your iPod so that you can
repair any Mac’s hard drive by using your iPod as the startup drive.
Installing Mac OS 9
Macs sold since 2003 no longer use OS 9, and some older models can’t use a
FireWire drive (such as an iPod) as a startup drive. However, you can still
install OS 9 on an iPod to use as a startup drive for a Mac that can run OS 9.
To install a custom version of OS 9 on your iPod, connect your iPod as a hard
drive and then follow these steps:
1. Insert your Mac OS 9 installation CD into your Mac and follow the
directions to start the installation process.
You have to restart the Mac with the installation CD while holding down
C to start the computer from the CD.
2. When the installer asks you to select a destination, select the iPod
hard drive.
3. After the installation finishes, quit the installation program.
That’s all you have to do. The installer does everything for you.
To start a Mac from an iPod that holds Mac OS 9, connect the iPod, hold
down Option, and choose Restart from the Apple menu. (Or, if your system is
already hosed, use the Power button to reboot while holding down Option.)
Eventually, while the Mac resets and scans itself for any startup drives, all the
startup drives appear as icons in a row, with a right-pointing arrow under-
neath the icons. Click the icon representing the iPod hard drive and then
click the right-pointing arrow to start the system from that drive.
Removing the Mac OS from your iPod
Removing Mac OS 9 from an iPod is easy: Drag the System Folder from the
iPod hard drive to the Trash when your iPod is connected as a hard drive.
BC75
Bonus Chapter 4: Using Your iPod for Backup and Restore

Removing Mac OS X isn’t as easy because OS X installs hidden files and direc-
tories, and there is no easy way to drag them to the Trash. (Perhaps that’s
why Apple doesn’t support this feature.) The quickest and easiest way to
remove OS X from an iPod is to restore the iPod, as we describe in Chapter
24. Restoring erases and reformats the iPod to its original factory condition.
Be sure to copy any important files stored on your iPod before restoring it.
Although all your music and files are erased in this one step, it’s much easier
to add your music from iTunes, your calendars and contacts, and your files
than it is to try to delete files associated with OS X. Restore and then copy
everything back to your iPod as needed.
Installing Linux
Linux, an OS first conceived and implemented by Linus Torvalds when he
was a student programmer in Finland, has been enhanced and refined by an
enormous community of volunteer programmers to become the flagship
work of the open-source software movement. One of the many virtues of
Linux is that it can run on just about any computing platform. Linux already
runs well on a variety of processors from Intel, Motorola, IBM, and others and
behaves similarly on all.
People who use Linux on their desktop or laptop PCs or Macs can also put
Linux on their iPods. Although versions of Linux can be downloaded for free,
commercial companies also package Linux in a distribution — either on CD or
DVD or for downloading — and often include automatic installation programs
or wizards that help you through the process of configuring the system for
different hardware configurations. Yellow Dog Linux, in a distribution from
Terra Soft Solutions Corp. (www.yellowdoglinux.com), can be set up to
boot a computer on any model iPod that uses FireWire for updating. You can
then use the iPod to boot Linux on your Mac and experiment with Linux with-
out ever installing Linux on your Mac’s hard drive. You can fit a minimal 1GB
configuration onto any FireWire-model iPod and still have room for music.
To enable using an iPod with computers running Linux, the iPodLinux Project
(http://ipodlinux.org) provides a customized uClinux (www.uclinux.
org) kernel to run on the iPod. Its simple user interface — dubbed podzilla —
offers familiar navigational menus for accessing various functions in iPodLinux,
such as playing music, file browsing, and image viewing. As of this writing,
iPodLinux is safe to install on first-, second-, and third-generation iPods.
