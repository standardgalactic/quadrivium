editorial
a thing or two about a thing or two
In a flurry of announcements last 
year, Intel shook the desktop and mobile 
scene with a number of back to back 
CPU releases. It was the first time that 
the CPU giant veered off its normal Tick-
Tock release schedule. Not only was it 
confusing to the market, but it became 
apparent its Skylake CPUs were a detour 
from the real destination: Kaby Lake.
The new CPU architecture brings with 
it a sea of changes, which include a brand 
new 200 Series chipset, higher clock 
speeds, improved integrated graphics, 
more PCIe lanes, and support for Intel’s 
new Optane storage—you know, the 
really crazy fast storage Intel has been 
boasting about. Apparently, Optane is 
supposed to give current NVMe drives a 
run for their money.
Kaby Lake will bring us full-fledged 
into 2017, a year of more innovation and 
excitement for the industry. 2016 was 
the year for VR. But VR kind of showed 
up with a huge hurrah, and then the 
excitement fizzled. However, Microsoft 
recently made a huge announcement 
that would help catapult both the VR and 
AR industries forward. We’re going to see 
faster everything, with lower price points 
than before, all in the name of change.
I’m all for change, especially on such 
a vibrant platform. Everything started 
pointing back toward the PC in 2016, and 
there’s never been a better time to be out 
with the old and in with the new.

Just how far will the social media company go to 
break into new markets?
Facebook Colludes  
in State Censorship
company that doesn’t comply 
faces being blocked; censorship 
isn’t optional. Actually, such 
tools were inevitable.
China loves the Internet, 
censored or not. Realistically, 
though, Facebook’s chances of 
success there are pretty slim. 
A 
domestic 
Facebook-like 
app has already failed there. 
Renren claimed 160 million 
users at its stock launch, but 
quickly withered. The big thing 
is WeChat, largely used on 
smartphones; it has 846 million 
active users. Blocking foreign 
competition for so long has 
enabled domestic companies 
to become well established. 
Put simply, the Chinese state 
would prefer the big players 
on its home turf to be Chinese 
and under close control, and it 
has the power to make that so. 
Apple is a rare success, and 
that has drawn a backlash.
Meanwhile, 
at 
home, 
Facebook has faced calls to 
censor fake news stories, many 
of which circulated before the 
election, at one point gaining 
more coverage than the real 
ones. Initially, the company 
denied it had influenced the 
outcome of the election—“a 
pretty crazy idea,” according 
to Zuckerberg. He may have 
a point: People tend to read 
and spread stories they already 
either agree or disagree with 
strongly. This was later followed 
by a more nuanced response. 
Facebook said it will employ 
third-party 
fact-checkers 
and stronger detection by 
algorithms in future. 
We may abhor censorship 
in theory, but it’s remarkable 
how quickly it is called for 
when we don’t like the results 
of unrestricted access. It is a 
slippery slope on a delicate 
balance. As Mr Zuckerberg 
commented, “we need to be 
careful 
not 
to 
discourage 
sharing 
of 
opinions 
or 
mistakenly restricting accurate 
content.” However, it is still a big 
step from removing individual 
articles to allowing wholesale 
censorship on specific subjects 
under 
state 
control. 
The 
Chinese experiment is moving 
into darker waters.
An uncomfortable question 
here is how far is Facebook 
willing to compromise to get 
new business? Social media 
sites need to keep moving 
or they sink. Facebook has 
started to hit the limits on 
growth in mature markets; with 
67 percent of adult Americans 
having access, there can’t be 
much more room for growth 
here. To grow it must go abroad, 
where local laws, and state 
controls, can be very different. 
In a recent press interview, 
Mark Zuckerberg was asked 
what checks and balances 
needed to exist for entities such 
as Facebook, as those checks 
and balances currently seemed 
to be Zuckerberg himself. 
The reply consisted largely 
of platitudes on connectivity 
and the power to share. It 
was particularly unconvincing 
stuff. There is a growing gap 
between accountability and 
responsibility that will need 
addressing at some point. –CL
FaCebook is preparing for 
the Chinese market, and part 
of that preparation is the 
development of tools to enable 
the Chinese government to 
suppress unrest by ensuring 
that posts on certain subjects 
never appear. Facebook won’t 
do the censorship itself, but 
it will supply the means for a 
third party to monitor feeds and 
decide what goes live. 
Facebook has refused to 
confirm or deny the existence 
of such tools as yet; it’s still an 
internal project. Their existence 
was leaked by employees, 
alarmed by the implications. 
The 
Electronic 
Frontier 
Foundation, the leading non-
profit organization defending 
civil liberties, calls the project 
“extremely disturbing.” 
Facebook has made no 
secret of trying to get into China. 
Mark Zuckerberg has made 
many visits, met President 
Xi, and even started to learn 
Mandarin. The lure is obvious. 
The Internet is censored in 
China, and effectively, too. Any 
Meanwhile, at home, 
Facebook has faced calls to 
censor fake news stories.
This man has access to 
personal data on 1.8 billion 
people—do you trust him?

ReseaRcheRs at the University of Central 
Florida 
have 
produced 
a 
prototype 
supercapacitor battery for small devices that 
can be charged in seconds, but potentially 
last all week. It can also be recharged 
30,000 times without degrading. 
Supercapacitors 
store 
energy 
electrostatically on the surface of a material. 
There are no chemical processes, which 
are slow and cause physical damage to the 
structure of the battery. A supercapacitor 
can charge and discharge extremely rapidly, 
because the only moving thing internally is 
the electrical charge.
Traditionally, supercapacitor tech has 
been held back by low energy density. To get 
a usable amount of power meant unfeasibly 
large 
capacitors, 
limiting 
previous 
applications to buses and trains. This is 
where the new generation of nanomaterials 
comes in, making it possible to build huge 
surface areas into a tiny film of material. The 
prototype contains millions of nanometer-
thick coated wires to store the static charge. 
Before we get too excited, this is still at 
the proof of concept phase, but building a 
working prototype looks encouraging. The 
Florida team is among many such groups 
working on new battery technologies, and 
many use nanotechnolgy in one form or 
another. A group based at MIT has developed 
a new form of anode built from carbon 
nanotubes, to boost the effectiveness of 
Lithium-ion batteries, which shows promise. 
The world has been waiting for a 
replacement for chemical batteries for 
years; while everything has got more 
capable and faster, it has drained batteries 
all the more rapidly. If nanotechnology 
capacitors can be made commercially 
viable, waiting hours for your car or phone to 
charge will become a distant memory. –cL 
RemembeR the ceLeRon 300a? It was cheap, 
unlocked, and capable of being absolutely thrashed. 
It meant you could buy cheap, play with the clock multiplier, and go hundreds of 
megahertz faster. And it was stable, too. It was basically the same silicon as the 
more expensive models, and just as capable. Then Intel starting locking its chips 
down, bar a few high-end specialities. However, it looks as though we could be in 
business again with the new Kaby Lake i3-7350K, multiplier unlocked out of the 
box. At stock it runs at 4.0GHz, with a 4.2GHz Turbo, and unlike the other new i3s, 
it also has Hyper-Threading enabled.
Early reports are very enthusiastic, with it out-gunning nearly all the previous 
generation of quad-core Core i5s and i7s. It means you can build a highly capable 
games machine on a budget, and get to tweak the best out of it. Early pricing has 
it going for $177. We predict it’ll be rather popular. –cL

apple backlash
the new macbook PRo has USB-C ports, and that’s it. Which means you’ll need an adapter to 
plug just about every other piece of kit you have into it. And there are no adapters in the box. 
Cue much foaming and frothing online from some understandably annoyed customers. To 
calm things down, Apple has temporarily dropped the prices on its adapters, of which there 
are 17 different types. Price cuts range from around 25 to 50 percent. The basic USB-C to 
USB adapter drops from $19 to $9. 
A statement from the company includes this nugget: “We recognize that many users, 
especially pros, rely on legacy connectors to get work done today.” Legacy? You can’t even 
connect a brand-new iPhone without an adapter. Apple has an enviable reputation for 
innovation, but this isn’t the first time the company has tried to push things along a little too 
quickly for comfort. –cL

Bitcoins and 
Cryptocurrency
The core idea is to have a currency backed by the 
power of cryptography (i.e., math), rather than 
governments, gold, or another physical entity. Neal 
Stephenson’s book Cryptonomicon contained an idea 
like this back in 1999, and in 2008, Satoshi Nakamoto 
introduced bitcoin to a cryptography mailing list, 
with the software going live by January 2009.
Bitcoin is sort of like a distributed computing 
competition, called “mining,” where, based on your 
computational contributions, you have a chance of 
“winning” a block of bitcoins. This happens every 10 
minutes, on average, and the more you participate, 
the higher the chance of mining a block. The block 
reward started at 50 bitcoins (BTC), and halves every 
210,000 blocks (about four years)—it’s currently 
12.5 BTC. Mathematically, that means there will 
never be more than 21 million BTC.
The rewards exist to entice people to run the 
software, because mining also secures the bitcoin 
network. Basically, the difficulty of mining a block 
scales, based on the total speed of the network, 
called the hash rate, and someone would need to 
control more than 50 percent of the hash rate to 
have a reasonable chance of hacking the Bitcoin 
network. So, the more people (processors) running 
the hashing algorithms, the more secure the 
network, and the harder it is to find a block solution. 
The bitcoin network hash rate has gone from tens 
If you haven’t heard of bItcoIn, don’t feel bad—I’ve dabbled in bitcoin 
since 2011, and while some general awareness of it now exists, most 
people still don’t really know what it is or why we need it, or if we 
should even want it. The brief synopsis goes something like this, and I’m 
intentionally skipping a lot of the complexity.
of millions of hashes per second 
during its first year, to billions, then 
trillions, and it currently sits at 
roughly two quintillion hashes per 
second (H/s, with SI prefixes now 
used). The reason for the increase 
in hash rate isn’t just more people 
participating—the processors that 
are used for hashing have gotten 
much faster, too. Mining started 
with CPUs, then moved to GPUs, and 
eventually to custom processors 
that are designed purely for bitcoin’s 
hashing function. The fastest ASICs 
now do around 4.7TH/s, which is 
orders of magnitude faster than the 
best CPU or GPU.
But what do you do with these 
bitcoins, and do they have any value? 
Some might say no, but scarcity, the 
lack of bank/government control, 
and 
their 
pseudo-anonymous 
nature has given them plenty of 
worth in the eyes of others. Anyone 
can create a BTC wallet, a 26–35 
character address that’s the public 
part of a public-private key pair, with 
the owner keeping the private key. 
BTC can be transferred between 
wallets, protected by the power of 
cryptography, allowing digital funds 
to move around the world in a matter 
of minutes. Today, a single bitcoin is 
valued at over $700 (though pricing 
is admittedly highly volatile), and 
more than 100,000 vendors accept

BTC, including Newegg. But it’s not 
all sunshine and lollipops.
There have also been plenty 
of thefts, scams, and other shady 
goings-on in the bitcoin world. BTC 
ends up being a lot like digital cash, 
meaning it’s very difficult to trace or 
intercept. Money laundering, drugs, 
and other illicit practices have used 
bitcoin, and ransomware viruses 
exist that encrypt hard drives and 
demand BTC to get the unlock 
code and software. That’s both the 
blessing and curse of the pseudo-
anonymous currency.
But despite years of people 
declaring the death of bitcoin, and 
others hailing it as the promised 
messiah, for most people, bitcoin 
remains a fringe curiosity. It’s 
theoretically 
possible 
to 
make 
money via mining, but the power 
cost is nearly as much as the value of 
the BTC mined. Instead of becoming 
a currency free from the controls 
of governments and banks, bitcoin 
is now largely controlled by a small 
collection of interested parties, 
who have heavily invested into the 
network. And, ironically, greater 
acceptance of bitcoin will likely 
come only with more regulation.
Today, a single bitcoin is valued 
at over $700, and more than 
100,000 vendors accept BTC.

After years of poring through fake news and partisan 
vitriol on Facebook, I chose to opt out of the service 
for a while. Maybe it was the company I chose to 
keep. Maybe it was the fact that the 2016 presidential 
campaign, started in mid-2015, kept me on edge for 
18 months. Whatever the reason, I felt my blood 
pressure rise with every login. So, I decided to turn 
my attention back to my own blog (which I’m paying 
for, anyway).
By running your own blog, you’re not as restricted 
by terms-of-use (short of hosting illegal content). 
Even if you do want to keep your Facebook account, 
running your own blog enables you to use the 
POSSE model—short for “publish (on your) own site, 
syndicate elsewhere”—to disseminate your posts. 
By using this model, you retain control of a central 
repository for your content. (This is essentially 
the same model that every major media outlet—
including PC Gamer Hardware—uses.)
When building your own blog, you need four 
things: a server, a DNS provider, a domain name, 
and software to run the blog. When you purchase a 
server (a VPS or space on a shared host), the DNS

Social media uSe is pretty much ubiquitous among Internet users. 
Twitter and Facebook dominate a lot of online traffic, and serve as 
primary portals to other content on the web. Social media services are

that the software automatically

appropriate social media platform 
based on type (text, photo, audio).
If you’re looking for something 
lighter and faster, there’s a lot of 
work being done on flat-file CMSes. 
Flat-file CMSes eschew the use of 
databases (which just demand more 
security and administration) for flat 
files that contain the content. What 
I really like about using flat files is 
that you can publish with Git if you 
want (assuming you have a VPS 
or a shared host that supports 
Git). There’s a great list of flat-file 
CMSes on Ahad Bokhari’s flat-
file-cms repo (https://github.com/
ahadb/flat-file-cms) on GitHub (the 
repo is just one Markdown file). 
Since flat-file CMSes don’t require a 
database, they’re pretty easy to set 
up for testing, which makes it a lot 
easier to shop for the platform that 
will work best for you.
Whatever platform you choose, 
taking back control of your content 
can be liberating. After all, the most 
important thing to remember may 
be this: Love it or hate it, nobody’s 
forcing you to use Facebook.
Jekyll powers GitHub pages. If it’s 
good enough for GitHub, it’s good

A subsidiary of Kingston, gaming-oriented HyperX has dominated memory and high-
end storage, and has created some fantastic headphones. Now it’s produced the award-
winning Alloy keyboard. We spoke to senior business manager, Marcus Hermann, and 
Edward Baily, EMEA HyperX business manager, about what the future holds for the 
company and the peripherals market, and what impact eSports is having on the industry.
HyperX Discusses its 
Keyboard Design and More
Marcus Hermann and Edward Baily talk peripherals
Maximum PC: HyperX 
has something of a legendary 
reputation among hardware 
reviewers like ourselves—
certainly when it comes to great 
audio. The Cloud headset, in 
particular, rattled cages when it 
first launched for being such a 
solid product at an exceptional 
price. Now, we know that was 
based on Qpad’s QH-90 headset, 
but can you talk to us a little 
about what made HyperX decide 
to swallow its pride and go for 
a design that was already very 
well established?
Edward Baily: 
Interestingly, a lot of people 
don’t know this, but we actually 
partnered with SteelSeries 
before talking to Qpad at all. 
We worked to create a fully 
custom HyperX Siberia V2 
gaming headset—this was our 
first venture into the gaming 
peripheral market at all. Further 
down the line, while we were at 
the DreamHack gaming event 
in Sweden (a long-term partner 
of ours), we came across Qpad. 
Qpad was known in northern 
Europe for its strong quality and 
design. However, the company 
was not as well known globally. 
It was the perfect size to be an 
agile partner for us—we could 
execute product decisions 
quickly, and help it grow, too, 
as we did so. 
Marcus Hermann: 
With SSDs, it was actually the 
same approach—we started 
off with Intel products, before 
developing our own models to 
reach the mass market. We 
are no stranger to this form 
of marketing, and it seems to 
work well.
MPC: A lot of our readers 
probably won’t be aware that 
HyperX is now its own separate 
entity from Kingston. Can you 
talk to us a little about why that 
decision was made, and how this 
brand stands on its own?
EB: To clarify, HyperX is a 
brand that sits under Kingston 
Technology’s umbrella. It’s 
actually quite like how Xbox 
works with Microsoft. The 
idea to split the brands out 
was a way for us to move away 
from the corporate look and 
feel of Kingston. And by doing 
this, we were able to push the 
boundaries of our marketing 
(our new Stinger video in 
the USA, for example), and 
ultimately address more of 
a different audience than we 
could have done previously 
with Kingston. Kingston still 
remains as the corporate 
business professional, while 
HyperX is pursuing the height of 
computing, along with eSports 
as well.
Working with Kingston since 2010, Ed (on left) is certain eSports 
will lead the way when it comes to technical innovation. Marcus 
(on right) has worked with Corsair, PNY, and Samsung, before 
returning to champion HyperX’s new leading line of peripherals.

The latest peripheral from 
HyperX is the Alloy FPS 
keyboard, reviewed on pg. 88.
MPC: Can you tell us, then, 
how much involvement does 
Kingston still have with HyperX’s 
product design? Is it solely 
designed inside of HyperX, or 
does Kingston still have the 
final say?
MH: We still operate shared 
services—HR and PR, for 
instance, are still operating 
across both brands. And 
so there are still Kingston 
Technology departments that 
are involved in the product 
development side. The product 
definition and design is owned 
and driven by HyperX alone.
MPC: Speaking of product 
design, what was it that pushed 
HyperX into pursuing keyboards 
in particular? It is, after all, a 
heavily contested market at 
the moment.
EB: It was the obvious product 
after two and a half years of 
establishing ourselves as a 
major gaming headset brand 
within the industry. Our loyal 
fans and customers wanted us 
to further expand our lineup, and 
bring our quality and expertise 
to the keyboard world. 
MH: We have faith in the 
strength of our brand, so we are 
not afraid of our competitors. 
Extending the peripherals 
lineup is a logical step on many 
levels. Gamers care primarily 
about products that they can 
touch, rather than what’s inside 
the PC. Out of those products, 
we only have headsets, but 
not keyboards or mice. On top 
of that, it is also a lot easier to 
break into larger retailers if you 
can fill a shelf with the various 
peripheral products, rather than 
just the one product or two. We 
intend to become a significant 
peripherals brand in terms of 
revenue and units, and you can’t 
do that just with headsets.
MPC: The Alloy is, by far, 
one of the nicest keyboards 
we’ve had the pleasure of 
reviewing this year. Can you tell 
us a little about what design 
considerations you made when 
setting out to craft the initial 
concept? What was it that you 
wanted to focus on in particular?
MH: First of all, thank you! 
We are probably the brand that 
is the most active in eSports, 
in terms of team and event 
sponsorship, so it made sense 
to develop a product that would 
ideally resonate with that target 
audience. We understand 
that, globally, LoL is the most 
popular game, but we identify 
that FPS games are, by far, the 
fastest growing gaming genre 
out there, particularly driven by 
CS:GO. Another popular title is 
Overwatch. With this in mind, we 
designed a keyboard that would 
be quite well suited to play FPS 
games. Usually, you play FPS 
games with a low dpi setting, 
which requires a lot of space for 
your mouse movements. The 
less space the keyboard takes 
up, the better—so that’s why the 
Alloy FPS is as compact as it is.
MPC: Going with the Cherry 
MX Blue switch initially, as 
opposed to the MX Red, is a bold 
move, especially as the Red 
is often the key touted across 
global marketing as being the 
“gaming” switch. Can you tell us 
why HyperX made that decision?
MH: We always developed this 
product with three switches 
in mind. So, after Blue, we 
will release a Red and Brown 
version, too. We decided to 
launch the Alloy FPS through 
staggered regional launches, 
and China was part of our first 
wave, where the Cherry MX 
Blue is by far the most popular 
switch. We had faith that a 
good product, in addition to our 
brand strength, would carry the 
product, and the initial numbers 
have proved us right. An Alloy 
version with Red and Brown 
switches will be announced 
at CES. 
MPC: We’ve seen a wide 
range of headsets, memory, 
keyboards, and even 
mousemats added to your 
lineup—the question has to be 
asked? Is a gaming mouse on 
the cards any time soon?
EB: We have a lot of exciting 
peripheral products coming in 
2017. You will just have to wait 
and see!
MH: We don’t have an official 
comment on this yet, but the 
previous answers should make 
that pretty clear.
MPC: How do you see the 
peripheral market looking right 
now? We have companies like 
Mionix claiming it’s stagnating, 
trying to radically innovate with 
things such as heart rate and 
GSR sensors. But what’s your 
or even HyperX’s take on the 
whole situation?
EB: Interesting you mention 
Mionix—I actually invested in 
the Kickstarter project for its 
new gaming mouse, the NAOS 
QG. At HyperX, we are big fans 
of what Mionix has done, and 
how it is innovating inside of the 
gaming market. From our side, 
we only see the gaming market 
growing every year. PC gaming 
is at an all-time high, with sales 
booming. If you look at eSports, 
the revenue will grow 51 percent 
year on year, to $493m in 2016, 
according to NewZoo. All of 
those gamers in eSports need 
the best gaming peripherals 
in the market, and this is why 
we are heavily invested in the 
eSports community. 
MH: As far as the peripheral 
market is concerned, it is a 
common phenomenon that 
fast-growing markets have less 
pressure to innovate. Other than 
RGB keyboards, there were a 
few ideas that so far haven’t 
taken off just yet.

THIS MONTH THE DOCTOR TACKLES...
↘ submit your questions to: doctor@maximumpc.com
Upgrade or Replace?
Dear Doc, ever since a friend 
recommended your magazine 
in 1999, I’ve been hooked. It 
made me want to build my own 
rig. I love the combination of 
hardware and software, and the 
trends you introduce. Keep up 
the great work!
After all that time, I finally 
put together a rig for my 10- 
year-old son last year. It’s a 
family hand-me-down with a 
few upgrades. When he’s ready 
for a better gaming experience 
on his birthday or Christmas, 
what are the best upgrades 
available? He’s playing Fallout 
4, The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim, 
and Assassin’s Creed Syndicate 
at medium quality presets.
The system is an HP Pavilion 
p7-1007c, with an AMD Phenom 
II X6 1045T, 16GB of Patriot 
DDR3-1600 memory in two 8GB 
sticks, an Nvidia GeForce GTX 
660, and a 650W power supply. 
The cooling is stock; nothing 
is overclocked. I recently 
bought an MSI GeForce GTX 
1060 Gaming X 6G. If I put it 
into this PC, will a bottleneck 
somewhere else limit the card’s 
performance? I have another 
system it was destined for, but 
that’s another story entirely.
Thanks for any help you 
can provide to a long-time 
Maximum PC fan in Phoenix!
 
–Joaquin Pantel
THE DOCTOR RESPONDS: The 
Alvorix motherboard in your 
HP system supports up to 95W 
CPUs, and the Thuban-based 
Phenom II X6 is top of the line 
for its Socket AM3 interface. 
That rules out a CPU upgrade.
A GeForce GTX 660 is 
already quite an upgrade from 
the Radeon HD 4200 graphics 
built into AMD’s 785G chipset. 
However, the GeForce GTX 
1060 should be notably faster 
if you choose to send it your 
son’s way. A conservatively 
clocked CPU like the 1045T 
might hold the 1060 back a 
bit, but high-quality graphics 
settings should be available 
at playable frame rates on an 
FHD display. Of course, it helps 
that someone stripped out HP’s 
stock 250W PSU and replaced 
it with a 650W upgrade 
somewhere along the line.
How about an SSD? If the 
p7-1007c is still leaning on its 
stock 1TB drive, you’re losing 
a lot of responsiveness to the 
mechanical disk. Even a 128GB 
or 256GB SSD for your son’s 
favorite games would cut level 
load times tremendously.
Storage Confusion
Hey Doc. I’ll be building a new 
PC in the near future and I’d like 
to know which SSD to use. I’d 
like an Intel PCIe or M.2 drive. 
However, I’m unsure if my OS 
will boot from it. I’d prefer to 
use a single storage device, so 
I’m springing for at least 1TB 
of capacity. I understand that 
some SSDs aren’t bootable. Can 
you help clarify the ins and outs 
of an upgrade? 
–Ken Payne
THE DOCTOR RESPONDS: A lot 
of new storage-oriented terms 
and technologies were thrown 
at PC builders in 2014/2015. 
Suddenly, client SSDs could 
be attached directly to the 
PCIe bus. There were also the 
NVMe and AHCI non-physical 
interfaces to consider. Finally, 
motherboards started 
including M.2 slots, supporting 
legacy SATA SSDs, PCIe-based 
SSDs communicating through 
AHCI, and NVMe PCIe drives.
Whether or not your PC will 
boot from a modern Intel SSD 
depends on several factors. 
First, your motherboard must 
have the right firmware. Many 
board vendors enabled support 
up and down their Z97- and 
X99-based portfolios in 2015. 
Check that the latest UEFI 
version is installed, and that 
it explicitly calls out NVMe 
support. Next, what OS are 
you using? Windows 8.1 and 
10 support NVMe PCIe boot 
devices natively. Win 8 requires 
additional drivers during 
installation. Hold-outs with 
Win 7 need a specific Microsoft 
hotfix, though even then mobo 
compatibility is dicey.
Intel sells two 1TB-plus PCIe 
SSDs: the SSD 600p and SSD 
750. The former is available as 
M.2, and qualifies as somewhat 
mainstream (peak sequential 
writes of 560MB/s aren’t much 
faster than SATA 6Gb/s). SSD 
750 drives are markedly faster. 
You’ll find them in familiar 
2.5-inch packaging with an 
SFF-8639 connector, or as 
expansion cards that drop 
into a PCIe slot. Both high-
performance models require 
airflow over them, so plan on 
purchasing an extra fan or two 
if you opt for the SSD 750.
Be warned that high-end 
PCIe-based drives command 
a premium. And while they’re 
great if you need massive 
throughput, SATA is viable in 
most enthusiast environments.
Long Windows Update
Dear Doctor, I know my PC and 
OS are old, but I really like the 
Adding a DDR4 SO-DIMM to your 
laptop may not do as much for 
performance as you’d hope.

way they’re set up. Most of my 
work on this machine involves 
Outlook, web browsing, and 
listening to music. In many 
ways, I find it easier to control 
than my Windows 10 PC.
Here’s the issue I’m having 
with my HP Pavilion m7790y 
running Windows Vista: Two 
or three months ago, Windows 
Update stopped working, even 
though Microsoft still officially 
supports the OS. When I 
click “Check for Updates” or 
“Automatic,” I get an endless 
cycle of checking with no 
results. I’ve tried this several 
times, letting it run for hours, 
with no luck. I tried Safe mode, 
toggling updates off and back 
on, and disabling apps that run 
in the background. Nothing 
works. I even tried System 
Restore, but that didn’t go far 
enough back to cover my last 
good configuration. Microsoft 
Fix It wasn’t any help, either.
Although I’ve tried to 
diagnose the issue by searching 
online, none of what I’ve found 
matches my situation exactly. 
I’m guessing that something 
needs to be reset in the registry, 
but I need an expert like you to 
help. I’ve been a subscriber for 
18-plus years! –Gary Leonardo
THE DOCTOR RESPONDS: The Doc 
doesn’t have a PC with Windows 
Vista installed, unfortunately, 
so he can’t verify the efficacy of 
this fix. However, a Microsoft 
Community member has a 
procedure that other folks 
are finding helpful. Check 
out https://goo.gl/5sNwgt for 
details. The Windows Update 
Agent is broadly blamed for the 
delays you’re experiencing.
Although Vista is still 
officially supported, its lifecycle 
does end in April 2017. Further, 
Microsoft introduced a patch 
in June 2016 to solve the same 
issue in Windows 7. While your 
setup seems to be running fine 
otherwise, Vista is clearly on 
the way out, and it may be time 
to consider upgrading.
Pro PC on a Budget
Here’s the skinny, Doc: I’m a 
mechanical engineering major, 
and have come to the realization 
that I may need a beefier rig. I’m 
a gamer at heart, but have 
also put my machine through 
its paces with rendering and 
design projects. At this point, I 
believe I’d benefit from newer 
technology, as my hardware is 
going on four years old.
Is there any way to put 
together a workstation and 
gaming machine that even a 
college brat could afford? Or, 
could you help me with a list 
of worthwhile upgrades for an 
ageing Haswell-based system? 
Thanks for the help.
 
–Christian Waters
THE DOCTOR RESPONDS: Has it 
already been that long since 
the Haswell architecture was 
introduced? The Doc doesn’t 
know which fourth-gen Core 
processor you currently use—a 
dual-core i3 needs replacing 
far more than a quad-core i7. 
However, neither Broadwell nor 
Skylake represent significant 
enough upgrades to suggest 
swapping out your CPU, 
motherboard, and memory.
A similarly old graphics 
card would probably put you in 
GeForce GTX 700/Radeon R9 
200 territory. Nvidia’s GeForce 
GTX 1070 is one of the Doc’s 
favorites right now, both for 
its ability to outperform the 
previous-gen flagship, and its 
availability under $400. That 
would probably be your most 
rewarding upgrade.
Not sure where you are 
with storage, but an SSD is 
mandatory. And make sure 
important school projects, 
movies, and music are saved to 
a redundant array—whether 
that’s a couple of internal disks 
or a networked appliance. And 
if you’re currently gaming/
working on a single monitor, 
strongly consider a second or 
third. The Doc swears by three 
for maximizing productivity.
Upgrading a Laptop
Doctor, as a long-time reader, 
I trust your sound advice. I 
recently bought an Acer Aspire 
E5-575G-53VG laptop. To my 
surprise, it has an open RAM 
slot, and the system drive is a 
256GB M.2-based SSD. It also 
has an available SATA bay for 
adding more storage. Even with 
its discrete GPU, it lasts for 10 to 
12 hours on a full charge.
I am considering adding 
another memory module and a 
second hard drive. Should I buy 
a Samsung 850 EVO SSD or save 
money and go for a mechanical 
disk? Is it worthwhile to swap 
out the M.2 card for a 512GB 
Samsung SSD? I am looking 
to extract as much speed as 
possible from this laptop, 
because it needs to last me at 
least three years. I mostly use it 
for traveling and some discreet 
gaming while I am on the road. 
It runs Fallout 4 at moderate 
detail settings right now, so I 
expect it to be decently fast for a 
while yet. Your advice is greatly 
appreciated. –Stephen Fraser
THE DOCTOR RESPONDS: You 
have to love upgradeable 
mobile platforms. The E5-
575G-53VG comes with 8GB of 
DDR4 in an SO-DIMM format, 
so feel free to add a second 8GB 
module. Just don’t expect that 
to have a resounding impact on 
performance. The same goes 
for storage. A 256GB SATA 
6Gb/s SSD, which is what that 
machine sports, is going to be 
fast and responsive. Higher-
end SSDs might be a little faster 
and a little more responsive, 
but adding capacity is the 
only way the Doc could justify 
a replacement. As for your 
empty bay, pop an inexpensive 
mechanical disk in there. That 
256GB SSD will only stretch so 
far, and 2TB hard drives sell for 
under $100.
Unfortunately, the go-fast 
parts that’ll keep you happy 
with your Aspire for another 
three years aren’t serviceable. 
The laptop is competent for 
under $600, but consider its 
unpopulated ports and slots 
an extension of functionality, 
rather than an opportunity to 
exploit untapped potential.
BIOS Follow-Up
Doc, I was the one who asked 
about the Acer BIOS the other 
month (thank you for your help 
clearing that up). I looked but 
cannot find a download link. I 
still want to update the firmware 
to get as much as I can out of 
this machine, at least until I can 
afford to build a beautiful new 
PC. Could you point me in the 
right direction?
 
–Trevor Giampieri
THE DOCTOR RESPONDS: The 
Doc pulled your system’s 
BIOS information from Acer’s 
support site. The latest version 
is downloadable from https://
goo.gl/cLSttx. 
Nvidia’s GeForce GTX 1070 is faster 
than last gen’s flagship, and cheaper.
Kingston’s HyperX Predator is available in 
M.2 and add-in card form factors.

Not to put too fine a point it, but expectations 
are nothing if not high for AMD’s upcoming Zen 
CPU architecture. We’ve previously branded it 
as being everything from a new hope to AMD’s 
absolute last chance for survival. And as we look forward 
to 2017, the year Zen will finally arrive, it feels every bit as 
portentous as all that—Zen is a really big deal.
That’s chiefly because competition improves the 
breed, and ever since AMD launched its failed Bulldozer 
architecture back in 2011, Intel hasn’t really had any 
competition in the PC processor market. The consequence 
of that has been a state of general stagnation in terms of 
mainstream CPU performance on the desktop. Intel’s 
processors have been quad-core items, and have only 
improved very marginally in terms of conventional CPU 
performance over the past five years.
It’s into that context that we’re hoping AMD can drop a 
big old bomb with Zen. The good news is that there’s every 
reason to be optimistic. For starters, AMD has been fairly 
open about the errors of Bulldozer’s ways. So, say goodbye 
to Bulldozer’s radical modular architecture. Zen switches 
back to heavy-duty CPU cores, each with a full set of their 
own resources for crunching through as many instructions 
per clock cycle as possible. Zen also packs simultaneous 
multithreading, which means each core can process two 
threads in parallel. Sound familiar? It’s just like a modern 
Intel chip.
AMD’s aim with Zen is to increase the number of 
instructions the architecture can process per clock cycle—
otherwise known as IPC—by 40 percent over existing 
AMD cores, without increasing power consumption 
per cycle. Sounds good, but will Zen deliver? AMD has 
demonstrated an eight-core Zen chip beating a same-
clocked eight-core Intel chip by a small margin, albeit in 
a single benchmark. Also, the brain behind Zen happens 
to be Jim Keller. The same man who gave us AMD’s killer 
Hammer architecture back in 2003. Then again, more 
recent rumors have suggested an eight-core Zen will offer 
performance more in line with a six-core Intel processor.
Anyway, it’s thought that AMD will start with just one 
Zen CPU die for desktops, an eight-core design called 
Summit Ridge. If AMD really does inject an eight-core chip 
into roughly the same space as Intel currently operates 
with quad-core chips, that really will be a revolution. Watch 
this space.
A new hope
AMD’s new Zen CPU takes aim at the Intel empire
Remember 
when AMD 
had properly 
competitive 
CPUs?
Pins, pins, pins: AMD's new AM4 socket will have to 
accommodate 1,331 of the pointy little things.
A plAtform for success
If AMD’s CPUs are looking crusty, its platforms 
and chipsets could also do with being taken 
out with the trash. Native support for modern 
high-bandwidth interconnects and storage 
are conspicuous by their absence. Put another way, even if 
AMD’s new Zen CPU architecture delivers on its promise, 
that will only be half the job done. AMD needs some new 
platforms, too. A warm welcome, therefore, for AM4, 
AMD’s new socket, and the X370, B350, and A320 chipsets.
AM4 will also come with support for DDR4 system 
memory. But it’s elsewhere that the real interest lies. The 
new platforms seem to have all the bases covered: Nothing 
is official as we go to press, but NVMe and M.2 storage, plus 
native USB 3.1 Gen 2 and PCI Express 3.0 are all reportedly 
in the mix, according to leaked documents.
The top chipset is the X370. That will pack dual x16 PCI 
Express 3.0 ports for multi-GPU action. X370 will also have 
a full range of overclocking features. Beyond that, not a 
great deal is known. We certainly hope that additional PCI 
Express 3.0 lanes will be available to allow dual graphics, 
plus a high-speed PCIe SSD.
There’s reason to think that, as leaked details about 
the mid-range B350 chipset indicate it will come with 
support for two PCIe drives, although the actual number 
of lanes available to each drive isn’t clear. All told, it looks 
promising, and exactly what AMD needs to complete its 
next-gen offering. All the indications are that Zen and 
its supporting platforms will be announced very early in 
2017, so here’s hoping Intel finally has a fight on its hands.

Tick-Tock 
is 
dead. 
Long 
live 
Process, 
Architecture, Optimization. It’s no secret that 
the whole chip industry is now having trouble 
keeping up with Moore’s Law, hence Intel 
dropping its Tick-Tock cadence, and with it a commitment 
to die-shrink its CPUs every other year.
However, what is a little surprising are rumors involving 
yet another 14nm CPU architecture to follow the freshly-
minted Kaby Lake. The first 14nm family was, of course, 
Broadwell, which begat Skylake, which was, in turn, 
usurped by the aforementioned Kaby Lake. But the latest 
leaked CPU road maps from Intel indicate a hitherto 
unknown family of chips called Coffee Lake.
Nothing is certain, but the indications are that Coffee 
Lake will be 14nm. That’s a surprise in itself, but the really 
intriguing development is the addition of a six-core Coffee 
Lake model for mainstream sockets. If true, it will be the 
first six-core mainstream chip from Intel for desktop PCs. 
The six-core chip will also find its way into laptop PCs.
We can’t help noting that the emergence of Coffee 
Lake coincides with AMD nearing launch with its Zen 
architecture. Already, it seems, Zen is influencing the CPU 
market for the better. A mainstream six-core CPU from 
Intel is long, long overdue, and almost certainly hasn’t 
happened before because AMD hasn’t put Intel under any 
pressure for the past five years or so.
Coffee Lake is due in 2018, so a little after Intel’s first 
10nm chips, known as Cannon Lake, and penciled in for 
late 2017, albeit only for mobile PCs. One major change 
with Cannon Lake is embedding the PCH chip in the CPU 
die, making Cannon Lake more or less a full-fledged SoC, 
or System-on-a-Chip. That will be very interesting from 
a mobile PC perspective, in terms of power consumption 
and packaging. It should enable some fairly exotic designs 
in terms of compactness, and squeezing true desktop 
performance into smaller designs than ever before.
Beyond that, relatively little is known about Cannon 
Lake, or indeed its 10nm successor, Ice Lake. Talk of eight-
core Cannon Lake chips has circulated, but at this stage that 
is highly speculative. Given that Cannon Lake is ostensibly 
just a die shrink of Kaby Lake, it’s perhaps Ice Lake that 
you might expect to bring major architectural innovations. 
But given the flux Intel’s road maps have suffered of late, 
we wouldn’t rule anything out over the next year or three.
intel's confusing new cpus
A six-core mainstream Intel CPU at last?
Intel’s Kaby Lake chips 
are now shipping in both 
mobile 
and 
desktop 
form, 
which 
means 
Intel’s high-end platform finds itself 
in the odd position of being fully two 
generations behind in architectural 
terms. 
Currently, 
the 
Core 
i7 
Extreme Edition lineup, including the 
monstrous 10-core i7-6950X, is based 
on the Broadwell-E architecture.
With that in mind, it makes a 
certain kind of sense to find that Intel 
is preparing a double whammy for 
its high-end desktop series in 2017. 
It seems both Skylake-X and Kaby 
Lake-X chips are go for launch.
Skylake-X will be the bad boys of 
Intel’s 2017 range, rocking in with six, 
eight, or 10 cores, and TDPs up to 140 
watts. Sky Lake-X chips will also pack 
as many as 44 PCI Express 3.0 lanes 
for massive I/O capability, along with 
a quad-channel memory controller. 
That said, Intel already offers a 10-
core CPU, so it remains to be seen 
whether Sky Lake-X will be much of 
a step forward for raw performance.
Kaby Lake-X, meanwhile, will be 
limited to a mere four cores, 16 PCI 
Express lanes, and a dual-channel 
memory controller. If that seems like 
a retrograde step, our best guess 
is that the Kaby Lake SKUs may be 
a pre-emptive response to AMD’s 
new Zen CPUs. AMD will be offering 
a full range of traditional Zen CPUs 
without integrated graphics, and 
Kaby Lake-X could be an attempt 
to see off the bottom end of the Zen 
offering. Whatever, both of these new 
CPU families from Intel will slot into 
the new LGA2066 socket, breaking 
backward compatibility with existing 
LGA2011 platforms and chipsets. 
Consequently, a new platform and 
chipset, codenamed Basin Falls-X, 
will arrive. Highlights will include up 
to 10 USB 3.0 ports, and up to 24 lanes 
for PCI Express storage.
intel’s next-gen super-chips
Not long for this world: Intel's LGA2011 socket.
Looks as though 
Kaby Lake won't 
be Intel's last 
14nm design.

2016 has been a year of graphical revolution. 
We finally transcended the confines of 28nm 
down to 16nm and 14nm. Big wins have been 
made for both Team Red and Team Green, as 
performance-per-watt figures spiked in celebration of this 
new transistor size. But, it hasn’t been a bed of roses for 
the guys at AMD. With an early entry into the mid-range 
battlefield, AMD clawed market share back from its green 
rival, but seven months on from the launch of the price-
to-performance dominator that was Polaris and the RX 
480, we’ve still seen nothing in regard to a true endgame 
from AMD. Nvidia is left to reap the rewards, dominating 
the field with the GeForce GTX 1080 and 1070, able to price 
itself wherever it pleases. So where are we heading?
The answer is Vega. A plethora of rumors surround the 
card, but all we know for sure is that it will be debuting in 
the first quarter of 2017. With it likely to be revealed at CES, 
by the time you read this, it should have been announced.
At a guess, we expect this new GPU architecture to still 
be based on GlobalFoundries’ 14nm FinFET manufacturing 
process, featuring twice as many compute units and 
shader cores as the RX 470—around 4,096 cores in total. In 
terms of memory, it’s a widely held belief that these cards 
should come packing HBM 2.0, and the delay is due to AMD 
trying to work the bugs out of the manufacturing process. 
With 16GB of HBM 2.0 being the top end, we can expect 
somewhere around 512Gb/s total memory bandwidth. 
Alongside Vega 10, we’re expecting a cutdown variant 
of the new architecture, known as Vega 11. This should 
be the spiritual successor to the RX 480 and the original 
Polaris chips. Based on the same architecture as Vega 10, 
we expect it to come with around 30 percent fewer shaders 
and compute cores, and perhaps even a drop down into 
HBM 1.0 and GDDR5 memory, hopefully with a TDP of less 
than 75W on the lowest end of that spectrum.
This will likely be followed by a rebadging of the Polaris 
architecture at the bottom end. It’s hard to say what the 
nomenclature will be, but our money’s on AMD dropping 
the RX 400 series, and opting for the RX 500 series instead.
Beyond the Beyond
With AMD and Nvidia announcing their product timelines 
publicly, we can comment on a few items that we know for 
certain are coming over the next few years. We know that 
Vega 10 and 11 should be dropping in 2017, to be followed by 
AMD’s transistor shrink in 2018 from 14nm to 7nm, thanks 
to the help of GlobalFoundries. This means we could expect 
to see a dual-cored, 7nm card in only two years. Vega 20 (all 
hypothetical from this point onward) should come packing 
a phenomenal 32GB of HBM 2.0 for a mind-boggling 1TB/s 
of total memory bandwidth, and a scarily huge 8,192 shader 
cores. That’s around nine times more transistors than 
found in a single RX 470—45.6 billion on a single GPU.
Vega 20 sounds insane, and for now is just rumor. But 
when you consider that alignment with GloFo’s 2018 goals, 
and the fact that AMD will launch its new Navi architecture 
in 2019, it’s a lot more reasonable to expect Team Red to 
produce a 7nm dual-cored test subject, before dropping a 
new architecture on top of a die shrink simultaneously.

the memory conundrum
After last year’s bonanza, 
with GDDR5X and HBM 
making it to market, and 
DDR4 cementing itself 
into Z170/B150 chipsets, little looks 
likely to change for memory. DDR4 
will still hold true in the mainstream 
platforms, with AMD’s Summit Ridge 
and Kaby Lake supporting it. While, 
no doubt, frequencies will continue 
to rise, alongside a drop in the cost 
per GB, there’ll be little in the way 
of 
revolutionary 
change. 
Quad-
channel will still be limited to HEDT 
variants, as Skylake-X retains the 
mammoth bandwidth standard, with 
Kaby Lake-X holding on to the dual-
channel heritage.
HBM 2.0, on the other hand, is 
a real game changer. Over the last 
year, we’ve seen game developers 
take ever greater advantage of 
larger frame buffers and faster 
memory bandwidth, and with GDDR5 
taking a backseat in terms of PCB 
space consumed versus memory 
transfer speeds, HBM filled that gap. 
Unfortunately, HBM 1.0 is still a flawed 
standard, only capable of supporting 
up to 4GB of VRAM at 512GB/s total 
bandwidth (each stack supporting 
128GB/s). HBM 2.0 looks to remedy 
that situation, enabling 4GB of VRAM 
at 256GB/s per stack, allowing for a 
total of 16GB at a combined memory 
bandwidth of 1,024GB/s.

Nvidia had a phenomenal 2016, thanks mainly 
to it being able to sort out its 16nm production 
process, and put it to good use with its Pascal 
architecture. Star of the show was, and still 
is, the GTX 1080, although for those with a more reserved 
eye on their bank balances, the likes of the GTX 1070 and 
1060 have possibly had more sway in actual upgrades. 
Meanwhile, at the top end, the new take on the Titan X 
won plenty of plaudits, if you could afford premium pixel 
pumpers, and could actually find a reseller with stock.
Fast-forward to 2017, and we should see the last logical 
addition to the family, the GTX 1080 Ti, make an appearance. 
It’s rumored to sit between the Titan X and the GTX 1080, 
with a specification and price to match. The reason that it 
hasn’t been released sooner than this? There hasn’t been a 
need for it—AMD doesn’t have a competing card at the high 
end to take on the GTX 1080, which means Nvidia has been 
able to employ a wait and see approach to proceedings. 
We will probably see the 1080 Ti as a response to an R9 
490X. Expect 10GB of GDDR5X on the GeForce GTX 1080 Ti, 
60 streaming multiprocessors, and a sub-$1,000 price tag.
The next major GPU architecture from Nvidia goes by 
the codename Volta, and we could see the first GPU based 
on Volta as soon as May—it’s expected to appear at the 
Graphics Technology Conference. Volta was originally 
planned for release in 2018 using the 10nm FinFET 
production process, but given the pains Nvidia and TSMC 
have had shifting to 16nm, it’s no surprise that the transition 
has been delayed. So, Volta will use the same 16nm process 
as Pascal, but benefit from a few tweaks in a move that is 
reminiscent of Intel’s Tick-Tock updating regime.
Details are scarce, but we know Volta will support 
stacked RAM, aka HBM 2.0 (see “The Memory Conundrum” 
opposite). The expectation is that Volta will do much better 
when it comes to asynchronous compute, too, as used by 
DirectX 12 and Vulkan. Despite the fact that Pascal has 
been warmly welcomed commercially and critically, AMD 
still has the edge when it comes to some DX12 code paths.

where next for vr?
While the HTC Vive and Oculus Rift work 
well enough, the price barrier is enough to 
prevent either from really taking off—we’re 
not just talking about the headsets, as you 
need a powerful graphics subsystem to drive a pair of HD 
displays at 90Hz, too. Indeed, a recent sales report puts 
both headsets as being minor in the overall VR market, 
with Google Cardboard leading the pack, and Sony’s 
PlayStation VR already making interesting inroads. 
Even so, as many have predicted, the big challenge 
for VR is on the software side—creating a believable 
VR experience can be incredibly expensive, and even 
the most impressive titles so far have been either 
very limited in scope or very short-lived. We still think 
there’s plenty of room for more non-gaming experiences, 
too, but without a sufficient installed user base, we can’t 
see radically new experiences emerging anytime soon. It 
may be Sony’s offering that starts the ball rolling here, but 
we’ll have to wait and see where this is going.
What we do expect in 2017, though, is an influx of new 
VR headsets, something that will be partly driven by 
Microsoft’s bullish entry into the market. Microsoft’s 
interest in VR headsets for Windows 10 may well be 
a stepping stone to its HoloLens technology, but with 
the weight of the hardware industry behind it, renewed 
competition can only help. Headsets are expected from HP, 
Lenovo, Dell, Acer, and Asus, with suggested retail pricing 
starting at $299. In fact, that pricing alone may be all that’s 
needed to get VR into more homes, and then surely the 
titles should start rolling in.

just one bit of data. The consequences for NAND flash are 
time-consuming read-modify-write cycles, and the need 
for complex garbage collection algorithms. That’s all gone 
with 3D XPoint, which should mean massively improved 
random access and IOPs performance.
Of course, much of that is theoretical. Early demos have 
shown random-access performance around five times 
faster than a current top SSD. Not quite 1,000. But imagine 
if Intel launched a CPU that was five times faster. Quite.
If that covers the technicalities, what’s the latest on any 
of us being able to buy an SSD with 3D XPoint tech? The 
only thing we know for sure is that Intel will be selling its 3D 
XPoint SSDs under the Optane brand. There has been some 
debate over what form that will take, including implications 
that it would be a whole new memory class, acting as a sort 
of high-speed cache, rather than mass storage.
More specifically, certain system configurations with 
an Optane drive will support a software-defined cache 
hierarchy, where the CPU’s addressable memory space is 
a combination of RAM and the SSD. But that tech is aimed 
more at heavy-duty database work than desktop PCs. With 
that in mind, Intel’s first step with Optane will be Optane-
based testbeds designed for cloud computing. Intel is 
partnering with Facebook to test the technology, and it’s 
possible the latter is already using Optane to some extent.
However, the good news is that it’s probably conventional 
Optane SSDs that will hit the market first. That’s because 
using 3D XPoint as a system cache requires 
the creation and fine-tuning of a new 
software abstraction layer. Optane SSDs 
using the 3D XPoint technology could be 
plug and play with any modern PC. The only 
question is when that will happen. Back in 
mid-summer, some Intel road maps leaked, 
indicating a very-late 2016 launch. As we 
write these words in the dying days of 2016, 
that still hasn’t happened.
More recently, there has been talk of 
Optane drives launching with Intel’s new 
Kaby Lake seventh-generation Core processors. But 
just to really confuse things, those Optane drives 
are mooted at 16GB and 32GB capacities. In 
other words, so small that the implication is that 
they are cache drives, not mass storage SSDs.
The bottom line is that Optane isn’t out as we go 
to press, and it’s not clear when that will happen, or 
what form it will take. We still think it will be a killer 
technology—and, with any luck, 2017 will be the year 
it finally delivers. In the meantime, 2017 will see ever 
faster variants of what you might call conventional 
SSDs, but it will still look pretty exotic. Samsung’s new 
960 Pro is likely a harbinger of things to come. M.2 and 
PCIe SSDs with GB/s of bandwidth will probably be fairly 
routine by the end of 2017.
There’s a performance bomb heading for the 
solid-state storage market. That’s what we 
said this time last year. But it never happened. 
Not as we hoped, at least. To put it another way, 
Intel and Micron’s 3D XPoint memory technology, known as 
Optane when applied to Intel SSDs, never materialized.
Of course, 3D XPoint is a radical new type of memory 
tech, not an incremental improvement, so it’s not exactly 
shocking that it’s taking longer to hit the market than 
expected. But before we consider whether it will finally 
appear in 2017, it’s worth recapping why it’s so exciting.
3D XPoint is a non-volatile memory tech that’s claimed 
to be up to 1,000 times faster, 1,000 times more robust, and 
10 times denser than the conventional NAND flash found 
in existing SSDs. Staggering stuff, but how does it work?
Unlike NAND flash, which is composed of memory cells 
consisting of gates in which electrons are trapped, 3D 
XPoint uses electrical resistance to store data. Each cell 
stores its bit of data via a subtle change in the conductive 
resistance of the cell material. A benefit is that this doesn’t 
require a transistor, and that means each cell can be 
smaller, so more can be packed into a given area of memory 
chip. That means higher densities and more storage.
The other major difference is the fact that 3D XPoint’s 
memory cells are addressable at the individual bit level. 
That’s a dramatic change from NAND, where whole blocks 
of memory, usually 16KB, must be programmed to save

4K TVs are now a dime 
a dozen. In that sense, 
you’d be mad to buy a 
new HDTV that wasn’t 
4K. That’s true despite the fact that 
there’s relatively little 4K content to 
watch. For the PC, however, the same 
logic doesn’t quite apply. At least, it 
hasn’t done up until now.
That’s because what little 4K 
content does exist hasn’t tended to 
be available on the PC. Mainly, that 
reflects DRM and pirating concerns, 
which 
meant 
streaming 
video 
providers like Netflix have declined 
to open up their 4K streaming for the 
PC. It’s been reserved for closed set-
top boxes and smart TVs.
However, that could all be set to 
change with the introduction of Intel’s 
new Kaby Lake seventh-generation 
Core CPUs, known as the 7000 
Series. The big news involves new 
DRM features built into Kaby Lake’s 
2D video engine. Reportedly, it could 
be enough to convince Netflix and 
other rights holders that the PC is 
now sufficiently secure for premium 
4K content streaming. For sure, Intel 
has confirmed that Kaby Lake will 
be certified for Sony’s 4K movie and 
television streaming service, known 
as Ultra, sometime in 2017. So, 
fingers crossed.
Another aspect of Kaby Lake that 
could make having a 4K monitor 
worthwhile again relates to that new 
2D video engine. It has full fixed-
function 
hardware 
acceleration 
support for the most important 4K 
video codecs—HEVC 10 and Google’s 
VP9. The upshot is that a Kaby Lake 
chip can decode eight 4K streams 
in parallel. In other words, pairing a 
Kaby Lake thin-and-light laptop with 
an external 4K monitor is a goer in 
terms of 4K video. For games, not so 
much. But all in good time. 
that reason, we’re very much looking forward to the first 
dedicated HDR computer monitors in 2017.
The other piece of the 2017 puzzle for screens is the 
ever-tantalizing promise of OLED technology. OLED 
HDTVs finally got some traction in 2016, albeit at a hefty 
price, and a couple of OLED laptops popped up, too. We still 
don’t expect OLED to go mainstream in 2017, but it should 
become gradually more prevalent. So, depending on where 
you are in your monitor upgrade cycle, and no matter 
how tempting a conventional LCD panel may 
be, even with HDR capabilities, it might 
just be worth holding out for that 
OLED awesomeness.
Conventional wisdom has it that screen 
technology usually develops gradually, and 
is only occasionally punctuated with major 
developments. If that’s true, somebody has 
gone crazy with the exclamation marks of late when it 
comes to PC monitors. The pace of change is almost out of 
control, and 2017 looks set to see more of the same.
We’ve already seen so many innovative new features 
become mainstream in the last 18 months or so. How 
about frame-synching tech, such as Nvidia’s G-Sync and 
AMD’s Freesync? Or high refresh panels capable of 144Hz 
or more? Or curved screens, super-wide aspect ratio 
screens, 4K screens, and more?
For 2017, all of those features should become ever more 
affordable. But the really big news is likely to come in two 
forms. The first, and the one that’s a dead cert, is HDR, 
or high dynamic range technology. In simple terms, it 
means screens will be both brighter and darker—
they’ll operate over a wider range. If that’s sounds 
a little abstract, in practice it means screens with 
staggering levels of visual pop and vibrancy. So, 
now that 4K has arrived and given us millions and 
millions of pixels, HDR is all about making each 
pixel work much harder.
HDR is a technology that’s already rolling 
out across much of the HDTV market, and at 
relatively affordable prices. Indeed, there’s 
nothing stopping you from picking up an HDR 
HDTV, running it with one of the latest Nvidia 
or AMD GPUs via HDMI 2.0, and getting in on 
the action immediately. The only snag is that 
HDR content, particularly games, is extremely 
scarce. Still, buy an HDR panel now, and you’ll 
benefit from features such as much improved 
contrast and local backlight dimming. For

know about managing your installed content

a
pplications—programs 
you run on your PC—are a 
constant. They’re always 
there. We all use them, 
and our machines would be dusty 
husks without them. But they do have 
a tendency to get a bit out of control, 
particularly if a system has existed for a 
long time. An application almost always 
consists of a bunch of files; the more 
apps and games you have installed, 
the more files exist on your hard drive. 
This isn’t, in itself, a problem, until 
your drive is filled with ten thousand 
chunks of goodness-knows-what, and 
a single search operation takes half an 
hour because Windows has decided it 
must meticulously inspect every single 
thing. And here’s a quiz for you: What 
was the last program you installed, 
and where is it on your hard drive? We’d 
wager that, in the first count, you’re 
probably not sure, and in the second, 
you hammered through the process, let 
it ensconce itself in goodness-knows-
what folder, and have absolutely no idea 
what other things it scattered over 
your hard disk. 
Going with the flow of program 
installation is normal and entirely 
understandable, but it’s not difficult 
or onerous to get yourself organized, 
and a well-sorted PC will stand you in 
good stead for continued use. Unless 
you use extreme methods, you won’t 
ever be able to stop the miasma 
of random files seeping through 
your PC. But we’ll show you how to 
seek them out, and how to remove 
unwanted programs entirely. We’ll 
even show you new ways of installing 
software that make it easier to 
manage, update, and uninstall when 
you’re ready. And if the thought of 
installing software is giving you some 
form of filesystem OCD, we can teach 
you how to make your own portable 
apps that don’t need installing in the 
first place, or how to integrate your 
favorite apps into a custom build of 
Windows 10 that starts a clean PC 
exactly the way you want it.

Once upon a time—
and we’re going back 
some 20 years here—
getting a program up 
and running involved 
little more than placing a few files in a folder 
on your PC. That’s all an installer did. Don’t 
have the right drivers? Tough luck. Find 
them yourself. Operating system not up to 
scratch? Go through all the hassle first, and 
you’ll find out that something’s wrong when 
you try to run your application. A dark time, 
but one with benefits: Removing a program 
folder meant, usually, erasing all trace 
of that software. A simple scheme from 
a time when, however bleak things might 
have been, operating systems were less 
complex, and software depended on little. 
Try manually excising a bit of software 
now, and you’ll not have a good time; the 
typical modern installer is responsible 
for more tasks, and spreads the software 
much wider, and uninstallers are required 
to scrape off the remains of redundant 
apps. The installer decompresses large 
files, which have been archived to ensure 
an efficient distribution size. It determines 
whether you’re installing from scratch or 
upgrading. It places references to program 
variables in the Windows registry, and 
configures other files to suit your hardware 
and personal preferences. It downloads, or 
upgrades, software dependencies—drivers 
and software frameworks that the program 
being installed may depend upon to run. 
And it does even more besides. 
To make things even more complex, 
there’s not one kind of installation package, 
though this won’t make a huge difference to 
the average user. You most regularly come 
across executables (exe files), which tend 
to use some kind of third-party program 
to get the job done, or Microsoft Installer 
(msi) files, which do the same thing using 
Windows’ built-in installation components. 
Others—the likes of .cub, .msp, and 
.msm—also use the Windows Installer, 
and are meant for patching or modifying 
components. You don’t see them often 
while using Windows on the desktop, if at 
all, although those who stray into server 
territory might get more familiar.
For all we’ve said, a complex installation 
method isn’t strictly required for every app. 
Many apps have been designed to run in a 
so-called “portable” configuration, where 
their content is contained in a single folder 
and requires no installation whatsoever. 
While these are few and far between—
portable apps are usually small tools, 
although programs such as LibreOffice are 
also available in a non-installed format—
they’re perfect if you want to carry around 
a toolkit of apps on a USB stick. And you can 
Create portable apps
Installing isn’t the be all 
and end all of software. 
Check out http:// 
portableapps.com—you’ll 
find a vast range of apps 
that run comfortably 
from a USB stick without 
marking your precious PC 
even slightly. But what if 
your favorite app doesn’t 
offer a portable version? 
Most programs can be 
made portable using 
Cameyo (www.cameyo.
com), a system that uses 
the concept of a virtual 
machine to package 
up all the components 
of an application into a 
single executable file, 
either on your desktop or, 
excellently, online. We’re 
not done with installers 
entirely, however; in 
order to create a Cameyo 
package, you need to fire 
it up, run the installer, and 
tell it when the installation 
has finished. It detects 
the changes made to the 
filesystem, and swallows 
them into its own virtual 
environment. When you 
then run the app, it finds 
the files exactly where it 
expects them to be, not 
even knowing that it’s 
running in virtual space.
Cameyo’s commitment 
to portability extends 
beyond USB sticks full 
of apps, though. You can 
run your stuff entirely 
online with its cloud 
hosting service (session 
time is limited if you’re 
a free user), or take 
advantage of its library 
of portable apps, all of 
which are ready to go in its 
online repository. This is 
especially useful if you’re 
using a managed PC—at 
work, for example—where 
you might be denied access 
to software you need. 
Register yourself a Cameyo 
account, head to the 
site, and (as long as your 
network administrator isn’t 
wise to it) you gain virtual 
access to some of the 
best free apps out there. 
Nothing to install, no trace 
left behind. It’s like you 
were never there at all.
Cameyo enables you to run 
full apps, such as Celestia,

We have no doubt that you’ve installed

and outs of clicking “Next” a few times in the 
course of a traditional software installation 
would be insulting your intelligence. But, as 
you may have guessed by the extent of this 
feature, the standard way is not the only 
way of going about things. The regular way, 
perhaps, but not the best in all cases. 
You may, for example, have grabbed 
some of the rare decent software from the 
Windows Store, Microsoft’s poorly-policed 
den of application iniquity. Whatever your 
feelings on its content, it has a number of 
advantages—Windows Store apps run in a 
sandboxed mode, isolated from the main 
OS, which means that even if something 
malicious slips through, it can’t attack your 
PC directly, and installing, removing, and 
updating Store apps is quick and easy. The 
technically minded might avoid it, and there 
are other ways of sandboxing apps you might 
not know of (see “Sandboxing Applications” 
on pg. 41), but don’t underestimate its 
convenience. So that’s one alternative, but 
let’s explore some of the other ways of 
getting software on your PC.

Sometimes 
you’re 
starting entirely from 
scratch with a clean 
Windows installation 
that you need to get  
up to speed in a hurry. Problem is, deploying 
a new machine can be a massive slog of a 
job. Collecting together the items you 
need is one thing, but running through the 
individual installation processes of all that 
software is time-consuming and labor-
intensive, particularly if you’re dealing with 
programs that include sneaky shovelware 
in their installers. One wrong click and 
you’re infested, meaning it’s not even a job 
you can do on autopilot. But there’s a tried 
and tested solution that has been dealing 
with all that nastiness for a number of 
years, and it’s even applicable if you’re not 
installing a machine from scratch. 
Ninite (www.ninite.com) compresses all 
that work into a single job, then deals with all 
the effort for you. It installs everything you 
need, preselected to your specifications, as 
long as it’s in the extensive list of supported 
software, without any hassle. Head over to 
the site, check a few boxes for your desired 
apps, and click the big button to download 
the installer. Run it, and Ninite automatically 
gets hold of the latest versions of your 
chosen

range 
from security and development tools to 
messaging and creative apps—and installs

Installing Windows from 
scratch, particularly if 
you’re doing it repeatedly, 
is an absolute pain. 
Although we’ve talked 
about ways of installing 
batches of software at one 
time in the main feature, 
that’s not your only option. 
If you’re deploying a batch 
of machines, you could do 
it using a system image—
essentially a fully installed 
version of Windows, with 
all the software you’re 
going to need, that you 
copy wholesale on to a 
new hard drive. Microsoft 
provides a tool called the 
Windows Assessment and 
Deployment Kit to help with 
this task, which includes 
ImageX, an application 
that can deal with the 
creation and deployment 
of system images. Find out 
more and download the 
Windows ADK at https://
developer.microsoft.com/
en-us/windows/hardware/
windows-assessment-
deployment-kit, and make 
sure you run Sysprep 
(included with Windows) 
before making your image, 
to strip out everything 
machine-specific, including 
Windows license keys. 
This is all rather 
complex and, frankly, 
quite redundant for most 
users. You’ll probably be 
more interested in having 
a customized Windows 
build on hand for those 
odd occasions when you 
need to reinstall your 
operating system. NTLite 
(www.ntlite.com) is the 
perfect choice for this; 
it’s a tool that helps you, 
yes you, create a custom 
Windows build, integrating 
software updates, adding 
the software of your choice, 
and even setting it to install 
completely unattended. 
You can use it to remove 
Windows components, 
too, meaning you end up 
with a streamlined install, 
and you can automate 
post-installation tasks in 
order to avoid that tedious 
early-days rigmarole. The 
free version is absolutely 
adequate unless you’re 
looking to use it for those 
IT manager tasks we’re 
trying to avoid, although 
don’t make the mistake 
of thinking it’s a way 
of avoiding complexity 
completely. Building an 
NTLite Windows package 
is a task that requires a 
good few hours and a lot 
of coffee.

Although this feature 
is 
dealing 
with 
Windows, it would be 
a canny move to take 
a look at what the 
competition is up to. Most flavors of Linux are 
perfectly capable of installing software 
from 
files 
that 
have 
been 
directly 
downloaded—however, that’s not the usual 
method. Linux tends to rely on a disparate 
group of package managers, small tools 
that can download, install, update, and 
remove software—thus dealing with both 
the hassle of finding it and installing 
anything else your machine might require 
to get it running. 
Windows 
has 
been 
employing 
its 
own under-the-hood package manager 
for some time, a Powershell app called 
PackageManagement, which is a fork of 
open-source downloader OneGet. It is 
bafflingly complex—mastering it is a task 
for another day, although if you’re intrigued 
enough to experiment, you can read more 
about it at http://bit.ly/2gstsvW. Better, we 
think, to start with something more user-
friendly and sweet.
Chocolatey is the delicious-sounding 
Windows analog to Linux tools such as

apt-get, yum, and pacman, and it works 
in much the same way. Microsoft even 
uses its framework (which spawned from 
open-source app NuGet, just to add to the 
complexity of the software management 
family tree) as part of PackageManagement, 
which is a ringing endorsement. To get the 
command-line version installed, open up an 
administrative command prompt by holding 
Shift, right-clicking the “Start” button, and 
selecting “Command Prompt (admin).” 
Head over to www.chocolatey.org/install, 
then copy and paste the top install line 
into your command prompt. Let it run for 
a while, then close and reopen the window 
once the C:> prompt reappears.

a little recursive. Try typing:
 choco upgrade chocolatey
into a fresh command prompt, and you’ll see 
Chocolatey’s interface in action as it heads 
off to see whether there’s a new version of 
itself available. There won’t be, of course, 
because we’ve just installed it. But if there 
were, it would download and perform the 
upgrade autonomously. Let’s get hold of 
something a little more useful now:
 choco install notepadplusplus -y
grabs excellent text editor Notepad++ from 
the Internet, and safely ensconces it on your 
system, forgoing any standard Windows

the install, so it happens in an automated 
manner. Replace “install” with “upgrade” 
or “uninstall” to perform those tasks, and

We’re 
spoiled 
by 
today’s 
enormous 
spinning drives and 
ever-growing SSDs. 
Space doesn’t tend to 
be an issue. But managing it really should 
be, both in terms of what’s there and 
where you’re putting it. Yes, Windows 
search can dig things up quite readily, but 
despite Microsoft’s attempts to improve it, 
searching on NTFS drives is simply not a 
quick task. However, if your files are well, 
er, filed, you may never need to do a Windows 
search again.
Consider, before you do anything rash, 
changing your default installation directory. 
By default, most applications you install 
either nestle in the “Program Files” or 
“Program Files (x86)” folders, splitting 
them up between those that run natively 
in 64-bit (the former) and those that don’t. 
Logically, this makes sense; practically, 
64-bit Windows is now the mainstream, 
32-bit applications are entirely compatible 
with 64-bit systems, and there’s no 
reason to split them apart in this way. It’s 
just confusing. But during each program 
installation (bar those of poorly-coded 
programs that rely on specific directories 
to run), you are given a choice as to where 
you install your software. Setting up your 
own folder structure—say, a “Programs” 
folder, with folders within labeled “Music,” 
“Office,” et al—is a great way both to neaten 
up your collection and find out what you 
have installed when the Start menu begins 
to get a bit unruly. It’s a five-minute manual 
job that will make life easier in the future.
Desktop Windows isn’t nice enough to 
offer folder quotas for files in the same way 
its server-focused skew does. Quotas, as 
you might expect, help control the amount 
that users are allowed to store. Restricting 
yourself in this manner is a great way to 
make sure you’re cleaning out the dead 
wood regularly—if you’re forced to make 
room every time you want to stick a new 
game or program on your system, those 
tough decisions suddenly get much easier 
to make. As we’ve said, Windows doesn’t

control your apps

The Windows Store is 
clever. It shuts its apps 
away in their own little 
capsules, protecting your 
computer from rogues, 
and from the influence of 
anything untoward that 
may be swimming around 
your OS. Most standard 
Windows apps, though, 
don’t have this facility. 
Unless, that is, you add 
it yourself. Sandboxie 
(www.sandboxie.com) 
does exactly this. If you’ve 
grabbed something a 
bit sketchy and need to 
test it out without risk, 
you can install it within 
a sandbox to ensure it 
doesn’t get its tentacles 
in. Running a web browser 
on a family PC? Run it via 
Sandboxie to prevent your 
kids from downloading 
awful PC gremlins, or 
to stop your mom from 
inadvertently “upgrading” 
something she shouldn’t. 
Nefarious threats such 
as CryptoLocker are 
completely negated by 
running a sandboxed 
browser, unless your 
mother somehow works 
out how to store her 
important documents 
within the sandboxed folder 
structure—that’s behavior 
you need to curb on your 
own, though. Once you’ve 
set it up, you can open your 
sandboxes (through the 
app) as standard folders 
using Explorer.
Sandboxie can be used 
for free, though you get a 
nag screen after 30 days, 
and miss out on a few 
features only available 
to subscribers—if it’s 
something you use 
regularly, you can sign up 
for $20.95 per year. There’s 
a secondary benefit to 
all this, too: Sandboxie 
tucks all of the data from a 
program away in a single 
contiguous chunk of hard 
drive space, meaning 
deleting a sandboxed app 
doesn’t leave the same 
fragmented storage you 
might get after uninstalling 
a regular program. It’s 
a very minor thing, and 
there’s every chance you’re 
not even slightly worried 
by the behind-the-scenes 
goings-on of your data, but 
a well-organized drive is a 
fast drive.
Windows Store apps are safe and easy to work with, if not, necessarily, very good.
to fully reinstall doesn’t mean a loss of 
your files. That said, as we’ve expounded 
upon, your installed programs are unlikely 
to work properly, thanks to the required 
references that get scattered through 
Windows whether you like it or not. Copying 
files between partitions is also slower on 
spinning platter drives, due to the physical 
distance the read/write head needs to 
travel between the split areas of space.
You might think partitioning is something 
that can only be done to a clean system. 
That certainly is the easiest way to make it 
happen. As you run through the Windows 
installer, early on (if you don’t choose the 
“Upgrade” option) you’re given the option 
of where to install Windows, at which point 
you can also chop your disk up, and format 
it as you see fit. We’d leave at least 32GB for 
Windows itself—if you’re running an SSD 
and a magnetic drive in parallel, use the 
SSD for the operating system. Doing it this 
early is beneficial both in terms of instilling 
an ethos of organization to your system, and 
for speed—Windows won’t need to shuffle 
itself around or be defragmented to make 
space for a new partition.
posT  
parTiTioning
It’s likely, though, that 
you’re not going into 
this from scratch. 
And 
that’s 
OK; 
Windows’ own Disk 
Management tool (right-click the “Start” 
button, and select “Disk Management”) is 
all too happy to slice up the drives of any 
living system. Open it up, and you may see 
that what you thought was a simple drive 
actually consists of several partitions; we 
tried it on a laptop we had hanging around—
one that had seen itself upgraded from 
Windows 8 to 8.1 to Windows 10 to the 
Anniversary Update—and found a host of 
recovery partitions and other empty space. 
It might be tempting, seeing this, to ditch 
this wasted space, but without knowing 
exactly what’s on each partition, we advise 
that you tread very carefully. 
Find your main partition, or a partition 
you want to split, in the graphical 
representation. Right-click it, and select 
“Shrink partition” to begin the operation of 
creating some empty space. It’s here that 
you’ll see just how much you’re allowed to 
shift; so-called “unmoveable” files put a 
damper on this in a hurry, but this problem 
can often be sorted by (temporarily) 
disabling System Restore or running Disk 
Cleanup. You can shrink your main partition 
down to the individual megabyte, but be 
sure to leave a reasonable amount of space 
free on your Windows partition in order that 
it can accommodate system updates and

Finding resourCe hogs
Although we’ve mainly had 
our eyes set firmly on your 
hard drive in this feature, 
your applications don’t 
just take up space there. 
Certain programs can 
have a disastrous negative 
effect on the overall 
running of your system, 
and might even be running 
on your system without 
your knowledge. Task 
Manager can do a pretty 
good job of showing you 
what’s going on; hit Ctrl-
Shift-Esc to open it, then 
“More Details” to see a 
categorized list. Right-click 
the column headers, select 
“Type,” then click it to sort 
the apps in the list, and 
have a look through to see 
what’s running. Keep an 
eye out for things that hog 
your CPU, memory, and 
disk access, and look at the 
“Performance” tab for a 
graph of the usage of these 
elements over time. The 
“Details” tab can offer a bit 
more insight into exactly 
what everything in the 
“Processes” tab is actually 
supposed to do. Do a full 
reboot of your system, 
reopen Task Manager, and 
have a good look at what’s 
running for anything you 
wouldn’t expect to be 
there had you not opened it 
yourself. In all likelihood, 
it’s there because of some 
autorunning application, so 
head to the “Start-up” tab, 
and disable any items you 
don’t feel you need. This 
can often make programs 
load a little slower—
they have to load these 
components at run time, 
instead of them being ready 
when you boot your PC, but 
they can always be enabled 
again at a later time if you 
notice a problem.
Spying on running 
software can get rather 
addictive, and it’s fully 
possible to delve even 
deeper than the Task 
Manager allows. Try 
Process Explorer (https://
technet.microsoft.com/
en-us/sysinternals/
processexplorer.aspx), 
one of the Microsoft 
Sysinternals tools, to see 
what’s happening on your 
system in ridiculous detail.
Task Manager versus Process Explorer—if you want information, you want the latter.
virtual memory. Once the shrink operation 
is complete, create your new partition 
or partitions by right-clicking the now 
unallocated empty space, selecting “New 
simple volume,” and allocating your desired 
amount of space, repeating the process for 
each new partition you wish to create.
cleaning up
Where, 
oh 
where 
does the space go? 
An 
established 
system tends to eat 
up hard drive bytes 
somewhat mysteriously, and if you’re 
obsessive about watching your drive stats,  
you may be wondering what’s going on. We 
can’t tell you precisely, although there are a 
few obvious culprits to look for if you’re 
getting too low for that big app install. First, 
and most prevalent, is System Restore 
points. These have the potential to be huge 
on their own, but if you’re doing frequent 
installs, your Windows system may be 
making loads of them, and keeping a 
needless archive. Disk Cleanup helps 
you delete all but the most recent. To find 
the option, open up an Explorer window, 
right-click your OS partition (or just your C: 
drive), select “Properties > Disk Cleanup 
> Clean Up System Files,” then head to 
the “More Options” tab. Disk Cleanup can 
also clean up temporary files and the like, 
although you may not save a vast amount of 
space this way.
So where are the hogs? The best way to 
find out is to use a visual method, rather 
than poking through Windows Explorer 
poring over file sizes. For this you have 
two primary choices: TreeSize Free (www.
jam-software.com/treesize_free) 
and 
WinDirStat (http://windirstat.net). TreeSize 
feels very much like a natural extension 
of Windows Explorer. Install it, and it runs 
from a context menu; right-click a folder 
or drive, fire it up, and it very quickly trawls 
through, and finds out exactly what’s inside, 
offering you the option of reopening as an 
administrator if any of your files are locked 
down. It then lists your folders by their 
size, with a handy bar graph indicator in 
the background. Drill down into the largest 
folders, and you’ll find your files—you can 
right-click them for a standard Explorer 
context menu, but be careful not to delete 
anything you don’t explicitly know the 
meaning of.
WinDirStat is a similar tool, but infinitely 
cooler in that it ramps up the visual finery 
to a huge extent. Give it a run, select your 
drive (or “All local drives” if you want to be 
unnecessarily thorough), then wait as it 
laboriously traverses your disk in search 
of meaty files—it’s certainly nowhere

super removal
Uninstalling apps you’ve deliberately added 
to your PC is one thing. Hacking away 
the dead wood that Microsoft includes by 
default in Windows is another. It doesn’t 
look easy—there’s not even an obvious 
way to remove those horrible, redundant 
entries from the Windows 10 Start menu. 
At least, there doesn’t seem to be, but 
there’s a sneaky feature built in to Win 10: 
Right-click an unwanted app in the Start 
menu list and, if it can be easily gotten rid 
of, an “Uninstall” option is present in the 
context menu. But what of the ream of apps 
that can’t be chopped out in this way?
For this you need Powershell, the 
super-command line that’s bundled 
with Windows. Find it in the application 
list, right-click it, select “Run as 
administrator,” then type the following to 
remove (in this example) 3D Builder: 
 Get-AppxPackage *3dbuilder* | Remove- 
 AppxPackage 
This uses Get-AppxPackage to seek out 
the appropriate program, then pipes its 
location and information to the Remove-
AppxPackage tool; the phrase within the 
asterisks can be replaced with the specific 
package names for a host of applications, 
though these aren’t immediately obvious, 
so here’s the basic list:
3D Builder: 3dbuilder
Alarms and Clock: windowsalarms
Calendar and Mail: 
windowscommunicationsapps
Camera: windowscamera
Groove Music: zunemusic
Maps: windowsmaps
Movies & TV: zunevideo
OneNote: onenote
People: people
Photos: photos
Store: windowsstore
Voice Recorder: soundrecorder
Xbox: xboxapp
near as fast as TreeSize. When it’s done, 
though, you’ll see the benefit: a color-coded 
map of your entire drive, with rectangles 
representing the size of files, collected into 
larger rectangles that represent folders. 
Click a big file and check the status bar to 
see exactly what it is, and right-click to find 
a context menu that will help you open the 
folder in Explorer or copy its path to your 
clipboard. Click a folder or file in the top 
left pane, and it highlights it in the visual 
view, or use the top-right pane to hunt down 
files of particular types. They’re listed, by 
default, in order of the size those files take 
up, so it’s a good way to discover the space-
munching culprits.
Time To  
uninsTall
Once you’ve found the 
monsters—or 
when 
you’re 
simply 
done 
with your apps—how 
do you remove them?  
You might be surprised, but we’re going to 
suggest that the best way to clean up an old  
app is by using Windows’ own built-in 
interface, which you can find in the 
“Programs and Features” section of the 
Control Panel. Removing files using this 
tool automatically fires up their included 
uninstaller (or, in the case of MSI-installed 
components, 
the 
Windows 
built-in 
equivalent), which should mean all trace of 
the app is wiped away. Make sure, if using 
this method, that you remember to check 
any boxes that also remove settings files or 
equivalent because, while they’re not going 
to take up much space, any redundant files 
you leave on your drive slow down indexing 
and basically irritate you no end. 
If you’re a fan of overkill and salting the 
Windows earth, try a tool such as IOBit 
Uninstaller (www.iobit.com). It’s available 
as a portable app from http://portableapps.
com (because if anything should be, it’s 
a tool that helps you get rid of installed 
software), and it’s a great way of making 
sure every trace of an app is removed. Set it 
to work, and it bangs through your registry 
and filesystem to find files traditional 
uninstallers might have missed. If a 
program doesn’t appear to be installed—
as in, it doesn’t appear in “Programs 
and Features”—you can also point IOBit 
Uninstaller at its executable file, and it does 
its best to do an automatic uninstall. It’s not 
flawless, but it’s pretty damn good. 
WinDirStat’s rectangular map is incredibly useful for finding gargantuan files.

But Jeremy Laird says    
Let’s begin with a note of clarity 
and candor. There is much about 
Intel’s new seventh-generation Core 
processor family, codenamed Kaby 
Lake, that makes us want to do 
bodily harm to the leading maker of 
PC processors with a boxed copy of 
Windows 98. Because Kaby Lake is 
yet another incremental step that tops 
out with four cores in desktop trim, 
and is overwhelmingly optimized for 
mobile PCs. There are no radical new 
architectural changes, no promises of 
revolutionized performance.
It feels as though Intel has been 
rolling out updates like Kaby Lake 
for years and years now, safe in the 
knowledge that its only rival, AMD, 
simply cannot compete with it. And 
yet Kaby Lake actually looks kind 
of cool. It’s not cool in the old-school 
sense of shaking up the benchmarks, 
or tearing up the rule book for CPU 
architectures. But Kaby Lake will 
allow you to do a few genuinely 
worthwhile things with your PC that 
haven’t been possible before.

  14nm and four cores all over again.
 Kaby Lake will be killer for 4K video fans
Much of that involves a major 
upgrade to the chip’s 2D video encode 
and decode abilities, the upshot of 
which will be twofold. First, Kaby 
Lake will allow 4K video playback 
on whole new classes of devices. 
Very likely, it will also mean that 4K 
streaming services are finally going 
to be supported on the PC. That’s right, 
if you’ve been frustrated by a lack of 
4K Netflix support on your machines, 
then give it up for Kaby Lake. It could 
be the solution.
What’s more, Kaby Lake isn’t 
a completely busted flush from a 
traditional 
enthusiast’s 
point 
of 
view either. Granted, Intel has had 
some serious problems with its chip 
production technology of late. But 
that’s not exclusive to Intel—the 
whole industry has been struggling 
as chip feature sizes shrink to the 
point that they begin to flirt with the 
very fabric of the universe.
Despite that, it seems as though 
some useful headroom has been 
achieved. 
In 
other 
words, 
Kaby 
Lake might just be nicely cut out 
for overclocking. Plus, as ever with 
a new chip family from Intel, there are 
new chipsets. So there are also some 
platform-related upgrades to sweeten 
the deal. Kaby Lake may not be the 
radical game changer you’d hope for, 
but it will probably still be the chip of 
choice for at least the next six months.

Kaby LaKe represents no less than the 
third new processor family to be released 
on Intel’s 14nm process. That is the 
critical factoid that puts Intel’s latest CPU 
into proper context.
For starters, it’s symptomatic of the 
problems Intel has had shrinking the 
transistors inside its chips down to ever 
smaller proportions. Prior to Kaby Lake, 
Intel had been running to—or at least 
attempting to run to—a self-imposed 
cadence of product launches known as 
“Tick-Tock.” The idea was simple: One year 
Intel would shrink an existing processor 
architecture via a new manufacturing 
process node, the next a new architecture 
on the existing node. Rinse and repeat, 
long live Moore’s Law, and so on.
Except Intel couldn’t keep up. With 
each new node, there was a little Tick 
slippage, leaving several of the Tocks 
looking 
short-lived. 
Tick-Tock 
was 
introduced in 2007, the year Intel’s first 
45nm chips went on sale. Follow the logic 
of Tick-Tock, and the schedule should 
have been 32nm in 2009 (that slipped 
into 2010), 22nm in 2011 (didn’t happen 
until April 2012), 14nm in 2013 (September 
2014 in reality), and 10nm in 2016. 10nm 
obviously hasn’t happened yet, and 
probably won’t until late 2017, by which 
point Intel will be a full year behind its 
Tick-Tock schedule. Whoops.
None of which is a critique of Intel. The 
entire chip industry has been struggling 
to keep up with the two-year cadence for 
doubling transistor densities as famously 
dictated by Moore’s Law. Instead, Intel’s 
struggles are the background to a new 
paradigm being introduced with Kaby 
Lake, namely “Process, Architecture, 
Optimization.” So that’s a new production 
process in year one, a new architecture 
in year two, and an optimization of that 
architecture in year three. Call it Tick-
Tock-Tock, if you like, but as the third 
14nm processor family, Kaby Lake is an 
optimization under the new regime.
Lake-side Launch
Of course, given the timing of “Process, 
Architecture, Optimization,” it’s hard 
not to conclude that it’s a retrospective 
wheeze in response to troubles ramping 
up 14nm production. But the change of 
strategy helps to explain the slightly 
disjointed launch of the Kaby Lake family. 
Since August 2016, mobile PCs with Kaby 
Lake chips have been available, starting 
with the super-slim 9.8mm Acer Swift 7 
Ultrabook. Today, there are plenty of Kaby 
Lake laptops, including the Dell XPS 13 
refresh, with its stellar 22-hour battery 
life (which hints that Kaby Lake is pretty 
interesting), but no desktop chips.
Meanwhile, both Intel’s multi-core 
server chips, with up to 22 cores, and its 
closely related enthusiast-class Core  i7 
processors for the LGA2011 platform 
remain based on the older Broadwell 
architecture, a full two generations 
behind the latest laptop chips.
If that’s the background, what are the 
tech specs of the new architecture, and 
what CPU models can we expect when 
the 
desktop-orientated 
Kaby 
Lake-S 
variants arrive in early 2017? The second 
half of that question is straightforward. 
At the time of writing, Intel hasn’t 
officially announced any desktop models, 
but leaked documents have revealed the 
launch lineup in detail.
As seventh-generation Core processors, 
the new chips take the 7000 Series 
moniker. The top chip at launch will be 
the quad-core, eight-thread Core i7-7700K, 
clocked at 4.2GHz base clock. That’s 
200MHz more than the existing Skylake-
based Core i7-6700K. The quad-core, quad-
thread Core i5-7600K, meanwhile, jumps 
to 3.8GHz from the 3.5GHz of its 6600K 
predecessor. However, it isn’t known for 
sure what the new 7700K and 7600K will 
deliver in terms of Turbo clock speeds. As 
we’ll see, there are some reasons to think 
these new Kaby Lake puppies will be 
quite the thing for overclocking.
Across the 11 new Kaby Lake processors 
that will be available at launch, base 
clock speeds are up by 100–300MHz. Once 
we know what the official Turbo clocks 
are, of course, the next question will be 
overclocking. As we suggested, laptops 
such as the Dell XPS 13 and its borderline 
ridiculous battery life hint at significant 
progress when it comes to the process 
technology, despite Kaby Lake remaining

intel’s kaby lake

14nm. Could that play into overclocking 
headroom with the desktop S series?
It may make sense. That’s because Intel 
hasn’t carried over its 14nm production 
tech untouched for Kaby Lake. Instead, 
it’s been revised, and is now known as 
14PLUS. Two major changes are involved. 
Taller fins for the FinFET gates (so-called 
for their fin-like 3D structure) mean less 
driving current is needed, and thus less 
leakage, and, in turn, power consumption 
and heat dissipation are less of a problem. 
The other feature is a wider gate pitch, 
which, at first glance, is an odd one.
Gate pitch is a critical metric when 
determining transistor density. So, wider 
gate pitch would, on the face of it, mean 
lower transistor density, which, in turn, 
could be regarded as a step backward. For 
now, the impact of this is unclear in terms 
of Intel’s die size and chip production 
costs. Intel has reportedly said that it 
won’t have an impact on die size. What 
we can say is that the intended benefit 
is that the wider pitch allows the heat 
generated by each transistor to dissipate 
more efficiently, rather than multiplying 
with that of nearby transistors.
Put the wider pitch together with 
the taller FinFETs and, in theory, you 
have access to greater voltage range and 
higher frequencies. Certainly, base clock 
speeds are up over Skylake chips. Will 
overclocking headroom benefit, too? We 
hope so. There’s at least a chance that 
Kaby Lake could be the best overclocking 
chip from Intel for several generations.
cLock-watching 
That’s the process tech dealt with. What 
about architectural tweaks? Intel has 
said little about Kaby Lake’s execution 
cores, other than to indicate that little has 
changed. You should not, therefore, expect 
much, if any, improvement in throughput 
when it comes to performance-per-clock. 
In other words, a 3.5GHz Kaby Lake 
processor will perform the same in most 
tasks as a 3.5GHz Skylake chip. Any 
improvements would need to come from 
higher clock speeds.
Intel hasn’t changed the architecture 
of its 3D cores in its integrated graphics 
engine, either. But there is one exception 
to this tale of mostly static per-clock 
performance: 2D video. There are three 
ways a processor can handle 2D video. It 
can brute-force it on the general-purpose 
CPU cores. It can use the integrated 3D 
graphics cores to accelerate some parts of 
the job. Or it can hand the job over to the 
purpose-built or fixed-function 2D video 
engine for full hardware acceleration.
In practice, it’s a little more complicated. 
Depending on the spec of a given CPU 
MobIle MagIc
No new CPU core design. No additional 
CPU cores, for that matter. What is 
there in Kaby Lake to please desktop 
enthusiasts? Probable support for 
DRM-sensitive 4K stream services, 
such as Netflix, could be a major boon. 
We wouldn’t kick the additional PCI 
Express lanes out of bed, either.
There’s reason to think Kaby Lake 
might be quite the overclocking tool, 
too. But as a package, it’s hardly the 
stuff of enthusiasts’ dreams. As ever, 
then, its real appeal is likely to be as 
a mobile processor. Of course, mobile 
PCs with Kaby Lake processors have 
been available since the fall of 2016.
The impact of the chip’s improved 
efficiency has been real enough. When 
Dell revised its popular XPS 13 laptop 
to add Kaby Lake chips, claimed battery 
life leaped to a slightly crazy 22 hours, 
in part due to the refinements Intel 
has achieved with its revised 14nm 
production process. But that probably 
doesn’t truly capture what a huge game 
changer Kaby Lake could be for video 
playback in laptop and tablet PCs.
You can read about the full details 
of the new media engine in the main 
story. But the implications of full 
fixed-function hardware support 
for the latest video codecs could be 
profound. For starters, it will enable 
4K video playback in a whole new class 
of devices. Existing Intel ultramobile 
Core processors can struggle with 
some 4K playback, especially when it’s 
browser-based. But Kaby Lake’s media 
engine can decode eight 4K streams 
simultaneously. Crazy.
Just as important, hardware decode 
will mean massively lower battery 
drain when cutting cables to watch 4K 
content. When you think about how 
most people use their laptops, that 
makes for a pretty compelling package. 
When you next buy a laptop PC, you’re 
probably going to want it to come with 
Kaby Lake.

MaInstreaM cPUs?
  Where are Intel’s sIx-core
Where the heck are Intel’s mainstream 
six-core (or more) CPUs? Generation 
after generation, Intel wheels out 
new chips, but at best they have four 
cores. Enthusiasts seeking more cores 
have had to move to Intel’s altogether 
more expensive enthusiast socket and 
platform to access more cores.
Problem is, platforms such as X99 
and the LGA2011 socket are thinly 
disguised server technology. That 
means cost and complexity of entirely 
no relevance to desktop PCs. Far more 
preferable would be for Intel to chuck 
a few more cores into its mainstream 
LGA1151 socket.
Of course, some would argue that 
CPU performance is already good 
enough, that the focus for performance 
improvement should be elsewhere. And 
it’s true that many applications don’t 
require additional CPU performance—
or, rather, the type of performance they 
could make use of pertains to a single 
software thread running on a single 
core. Adding more cores won’t help.
But some applications scale well 
on multiple cores. Belatedly, games 
are beginning to fall into that category. 
Then there’s the old “build it and they 
will come” philosophy. Who knows what 
delights coders and developers may 
come up with if only mainstream PCs 
had more performance. What’s more, 
with AMD planning to release its new 
Zen CPUs in 2017, Intel may at last be 
forced to up its game.
Well, rumor has it that Intel is finally 
planning to release some mainstream 
CPUs with more than four cores. 
Spotted in various roadmaps is a new 
family of chips known as Coffee Lake. 
Details are sparse, but it’s penciled in 
for early 2018. It’s actually slated as a 
high-performance mobile chip. But it is 
listed as offering up to six cores.
Put another way, if it does slot 
into the LGA1151 socket (or its future 
mainstream equivalent), it’s not hard 
to imagine a desktop sibling being 
offered. If so, there will be much 
rejoicing inside Maximum PC HQ.
and the video codec, there can be some 
overlap, with some parts of the workload 
done in software, others accelerated by 
the 3D cores, and yet others hardware 
accelerated. The big news for the Kaby 
Lake fixed-function media engine is 
that Intel has added some serious full-
hardware support for the latest codecs, 
right up to 4K resolutions.
More specifically, there’s full hardware 
support for encode and decode of 4K HEVC 
Main10 profile video streams. Skylake 
chips can decode HEVC Main10 up to 4K at 
30fps, but they use a hybrid process that 
shares the workload between the general-
purpose CPU cores and the GPU’s shader 
cores. The upshot of which is that Kaby 
Lake can decode 4K HEVC video streams 
at a fraction of the powerload of Skylake. 
In fact, the engine is so powerful, it can 
decode up to eight standard 4K HEVC 
streams simultaneously, and can support 
ultra-high bitrate streams, too, up to 4K 
at 60fps and 120Mbps, which is pretty 
preposterous when you think about it.
Intel has also given Kaby Lake proper 
fixed-function 8-bit encode and 8/10-bit 
decode support for Google’s VP9 codec. 
Again, Skylake only supported that in 
a hybrid mode. VP9 is Google’s preferred 
codec for high-quality video on YouTube, 
so full hardware support is a real boon.
the 4k future 
The really intriguing development when 
it comes to streaming video arguably lies 
elsewhere. As you probably know, Netflix 
doesn’t allow 4K streaming to PCs. That’s 
largely, if not exclusively, down to piracy 
concerns. However, Kaby Lake’s video 
engine is thought to have additional DRM 
features that may allow it to be certified 
as a platform for 4K Netflix streaming. On 
a related note, Intel has confirmed that 
Kaby Lake will be certified for Sony’s 4K 
movie and television streaming service 
sometime in 2017. It’s known as ULTRA, 
and has hitherto been restricted to Sony’s 
own TVs, which tends to confirm that 
Kaby Lake does indeed bring new DRM 
features to the mix.
A final related feature enabled by the 
new 2D video engine are some tweaks 
to enable HDR and wide color gamut in 
Rec.2020 format. Intel hasn’t gone into 
much detail, but increased per-channel 
color bit widths are surely part of the 
package. Intel has also indicated that 
Kaby Lake’s HDR support leverages both 
graphics execution units and the 2D video 
engine, so there is scope for hardware 
acceleration and assist to enable HDR 
visuals within a low-power profile.
That pretty much wraps up the 
video part of the Kaby Lake package,

so what about the minor matter of the 
CPU cores and general performance. Is 
there any good news? Apart from the 
aforementioned increase in clock speeds, 
the answer is no. Intel has introduced 
Speed Shift v2. That’s a feature that, via 
a software driver, allows the CPU itself 
to control its own Turbo mode. This latest 
version allows for quicker adjustments 
in CPU frequency. Kaby Lake can react 
in 10ms to Skylake’s 30ms. But this is a 
feature that’s most relevant to mobile PCs.
All of which leaves one final frontier: 
the new platform that comes with Kaby 
Lake. We speak, of course, of the new 200 
Series motherboard chipsets. As we go to 
press, full specifications are still being 
sorted out, but a number of intriguing 
new features are likely. For starters, the 
native PCI Express support goes up from 
20 PCI Express 3.0 lanes on 100 Series 
chipsets, such as the Z170, to 24 lanes. 
Access to PCI Express bandwidth is 
becoming ever more critical as storage 
technology increasingly switches from 
SATA interfaces to PCI Express.
Specific support for Intel’s upcoming 
Optane storage and memory technology 
is also in the mix. Exactly what form this 
will take remains to be seen. You could 
say the same thing for Optane, to be fair. 
A general affinity for high-bandwidth 
interfaces 
will 
feature, 
too. 
Expect 
support for up to 10 USB 3.0 sockets built 
into the PCH chip natively. Thunderbolt 
3 support built natively into the platform 
those neW Kaby laKe desKtoP cPUs In fUll
Kaby Lake processors are 
manufactured on silicon wafers 
at Intel production facilities. 
is also expected, though this isn’t quite a 
total, nailed-down certainty.
Of course, these features will vary 
depending on the CPU and spec of the 
motherboard chipset. The 200 Series 
chipsets and Kaby Lake maintain the 
existing LGA1151 socket. Indeed, the 200 
Series chipsets are backward compatible 
with sixth-generation CPUs—Skylake, in 
other words. Needless to say, if you use a 
Skylake chip in a 200 Series mobo, you’ll 
default back to the 20 PCI Express lanes 
built into the CPU, and native Thunderbolt 
3 support will be a goner, too. Anyhow, the 
usual stratification of consumer chipsets 
will feature, with mainstream H250, 
H270, and Q270 chipsets capped by the 
more enthusiast-orientated Z270 chipset. 
Kaby Lake certainly isn’t the most 
compelling CPU Intel has ever cooked 
up. It won’t blow away any records for 
pure performance. But when you factor 
in some of the new platform features, 
and the extra bandwidth available for 
storage and peripherals, along with the 
new 2D video engine, and the promise of 
DRM support for premium 4K streaming 
services, the likely upshot is that Kaby 
Lake will be pretty compelling for anyone 
building a new PC. That’s not something 
you’ve always been able to say about 
Intel’s CPU refreshes of late.

Upgrading my 
personal rig
Ever since we made our mini water-
cooled Dream Machine back in July, 
I’ve been fortunate enough to look 
after it. But, alas, I found a massive 
leak emanating from the GPU 
waterblock fittings, so I decided to 
strip the system, swap out the Fury X 
for a GTX 1070, and run an AIO instead.
The problem is, I’m getting a little 
frustrated with a couple of issues. 
Firstly, the noise. Although I’ve got 
four Noctua NF-F12 iPPC fans, they 
have a rated operating RPM of around 
1,100–2,000, and while that’s fantastic 
for pushing vast quantities of air at 
high pressure, it’s less than amicable 
when it comes to noise. Couple that 
with the somewhat antiquated fan tech 
in the Corsair AX1200i PSU and the 
GTX 1070, and, well, you get where I’m 
coming from.
To counter this, I’ve opted to do a 
few things. I’m swapping to another 
chassis entirely, going from the Manta 
to the NZXT Source 340 Elite instead. 
I’m also swapping out the power 
supply for a Corsair HX1000i, which 
fortunately has 0dB fan tech. And I’m 
swapping the Noctua NF-F12s for 
three Corsair ML120 Pros with white 
LEDs, too. Not only will the ML120s 
add a hint of movement and color to 
my new build, but they also operate 
at as little as 400rpm at their lowest 
settings—perfect for a silent system. 
There are a few extra upgrades 
going on, too, but if you want to find out 
about those, you’d best take a look at 
“Build It” this issue, on page 68.

BACKGROUND
Google wants to bring the robot assistants of the future to the 
world today. Equipped with Google Assistant, the Google Home 
is raring to work with smart home devices, support Google 
services, and answer questions. Does it have what it takes to 
fulfill your futuristic fantasies? Time to tear down the Home!
MAJOR TECH SPECS
•  High-excursion speaker with two-inch driver and dual 
two-inch passive radiators
•  Far-field microphones
•  Customizable base
•  802.11ac (2.4GHz/5GHz) Wi-Fi
•  Touch surface controls
KEY FINDINGS
•  Removing the base gives us our first look at that high-
excursion speaker and a hidden micro-USB programing/
debug port. To pull out the four Torx screws hiding deep in 
the speaker recess, we grab our fixed-blade screwdrivers 
for a little extra reach. Once they’re out, we pop the top. The 
lid separates with ease, and finally the capsule is open.
•  After sending out a few test signals, we move on to 
disconnect a pesky interconnect cable. This runs from the 
motherboard up to a board tucked in the top of the lid, 
probably home to a fancy microphone and LED array.
•  There’s some seriously strong adhesive holding this board to 
the upper case. With a final yank (and a big dose of isopropyl 
alcohol to dissolve the glue), the LED board comes free to 
reveal the source of our struggle: a ton of adhesive tape.
•  The stretchy O-ring seems to be the key to delving even 
deeper inside this smart speaker. In addition to its role as a 
gatekeeper, the O-ring probably also functions as a vibration 
dampener. This seems a more repair-friendly solution than 
the layer of stuck-down fabric on the Amazon Echo. 
•  The bit that holds the magnets for the bottom case also has 
a mystery cable locked inside it. Closer inspection reveals: 
yet more mystery! The cable sports four contact points. 
Perhaps more testing points? Alternate (made-up) theories: 
Recognizes the base color, so the Home can co-ordinate its 
outfits better; vestigial charging mechanism (maybe the 
Home’s architects intended it to be portable); abandoned 
Easter egg dungeon level for teardown engineers. 
•  Repairability Score: 8 out of 10 (10 is easiest to repair). 
Minimal moving parts mean there are minimal points of 
failure. Only standard screws and connectors are used 
throughout the device. Many components are modular and 
can be replaced individually. The DC-in port is soldered to 
the motherboard, but is unlikely to experience much wear, 
considering the device stays plugged in. The touch board is 
strongly adhered to the upper case.

Crafting your Calendar
For this project, you need a Raspberry Pi with Internet access 
[image a]. In the interests of saving on cabling and space, it’s 
best to use the Raspberry Pi 3, which has integrated Wi-Fi.
>> You also need to choose a monitor. One excellent option is 
the Official Raspberry Pi Touchscreen Display (see “Choosing a 
Monitor,” opposite) but any compatible monitor will do. This isn’t 
a DIY tutorial, so please only attempt to mount the Raspberry Pi 
and display if you are comfortable with using a drill and installing 
brackets. If the display comes with a stand, there’s no reason it 
can’t be placed on a desk or table.
>> This is also a good time to start measuring cable lengths, 
so you can be sure both the monitor and the Pi will have power 
wherever they’re mounted. 
>> Once your equipment is in order, you need to consider the type 
of calendar you wish to use. If you and your family or colleagues 
already have a calendar you share, you can start following the 
tutorial right away.
>> If that’s not the case, you may wish to create a single 
calendar for this purpose. If you’re using Google Calendars, you 
can follow the steps at https://support.google.com/calendar/
answer/37095?hl=en to do this. For Mac users, visit https://
support.apple.com/kb/PH2674?locale=en_US to create a new 
iCloud Calendar. Outlook users can also create a calendar by 
visiting http://calendar.live.com. 
>> It’s not particularly important which calendar service you use, 
provided it can be displayed in Mozilla Firefox, which we’re using 
for this project. Try to give the calendar a distinctive name, such as 
“Smith Family Calendar,” so everyone using it knows it’s distinct 
from their personal calendar.
One staple in futuristic films is that everyone has a handy panel on the wall showing their 
appointments for the day. While we have calendars on our smartphones and tablets, now, thanks to 
the Raspberry Pi, it’s possible to have an economic wall-mounted calendar in your home or office.
Given that we have just admitted that we could, for instance, use a calendar app on our phones 
instead, is this just a novelty, or are there any advantages to doing this? Well, mounting your 
calendar on a wall is certainly more aesthetically pleasing than many smartphones, but the main 
advantage is that it enables you to share a calendar with others, by putting it in a public place, 
such as your living room. Your family can see your own appointments, and you can make sure you 
schedule your commitments around theirs. In the workplace, you can use calendar views, such as 
Agenda in Google Calendars, to organize meetings and assign tasks to colleagues. –nate drake

If you do have an existing calendar, you may wish to 
import your personal appointments, birthdays, and 
so on into the new one. It may not be necessary, because 
providers such as Google and iCloud allow multiple 
calendars. Events are color-coded to show which calendar 
they belong to [image B].

previously used a different platform—for example, you 
have decided that you will all use a Google Calendar, but

one person has been using an iCloud one on their iPhone—you need 
to import it. 
>> To import events from an iCloud Calendar into Google, first 
export them into an ICS file by following the steps at https://
support.apple.com/kb/PH11524?locale=en_US. Then import the 
file by following Step 2 at https://support.google.com/calendar/
answer/37118?hl=en. 
>> To export a Microsoft Outlook Calendar to Google Calendar, 
follow the steps at http://bit.ly/2cI17lN.

CuStomization
Once you have a single, shared calendar, take some time 
to set it to a format with which you’re comfortable. Most 
providers have the option of a daily, weekly, or monthly view. 
>> Next, feel free to fine-tune the appearance. You can make 
changes to the iCloud Calendar—for example, to change the 
viewable time period—by following the instructions at https://
support.apple.com/kb/PH2678?locale=en_US. 
>> Google Calendar’s default look and feel is rather spartan. If you 
would like to experiment with different themes, there’s a number 
available 
from 
https://userstyles.org/styles/browse?search_
terms=google+calendar. However, you need the Stylish Firefox 
extension in order to install them, so visit https://addons.mozilla.
org/en-US/firefox/addon/stylish/?src=ss, then click “Add to 
Firefox” to install this.
4 
full-SCreen ahead
Because you’ll be using a much smaller screen than you’re 
used to, space will be at a premium, so consider installing 
the Real Kiosk (r-kiosk) add-on for Mozilla Firefox. Real Kiosk does 
what it says on the tin: It’s designed to turn your browser into the 
equivalent of an Internet kiosk. This means the menus, 
toolbars, and even the right-click function are disabled. 
The chief advantage of this is that Firefox always opens in 
full-screen mode, making your calendar much easier to 
see. This also makes sure your device can only be used as 
a calendar, because people trying to view other websites 
are bounced back. 
>> If you do need to close down Firefox for any reason, 
you can do this by connecting a keyboard, holding down the 
Alt key, then pressing F4. 
5 
editing your CalendarS
Reading this project so far, it would seem that 
viewing the calendar in the web browser is a passive 
experience. However, if you have a central calendar on 
your wall, wouldn’t it be ideal to let people add and edit 
appointments as well?
>> If you are using the official Raspberry Pi Touchscreen 
Display [image C], tapping anywhere with your finger 
simulates moving the mouse and left-clicking in that 
place. You can use this to edit the time of events, and even 
create new ones. 
>> Problems may arise when you want to edit the text of 
events or create names for new ones. Naturally, you could 
connect a small wireless keyboard, and leave it near the 
wall-mounted calendar in case data needs to be entered. 
>> A much less clumsy solution, however, would be to 
have the keyboard built into the browser itself. The Mozilla 
Firefox extension VKeyBoard [image d] is designed for 
kiosk browsers, and pops up when clicked to allow users 
to enter text. 
>> Simply visit https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/ 
addon/vkeyboard/?src=search 
inside 
the 
browser, 
and click “Add to Firefox” to install. If you have already 
installed the r-kiosk add-on, and can’t change your web 
page, restart Firefox in safe mode, as outlined above. 
6 
Sharing the dateS
If you want to use any device besides the Pi to add 
or change appointments in Google Calendar, you 
either need to sign into your Google or iCloud account on 
that device, or share your calendar with others.
>> To share your Google Calendar, follow the steps at 
https://support.google.com/calendar/answer/37082? 
hl=en. You can send a link to only certain email addresses,

There’s no shortage of suitable small 
monitors to connect to your Raspberry 
Pi. If you feel comfortable with a small 
amount of wiring, the Official Raspberry 
Pi Seven-Inch Touchscreen Display is 
the ideal size to display a calendar, as 
well as having a handy slot at the back 
to place your Pi. The screen, along with 
assembly instructions, is available 
from the Adafruit website for $80  
(www.adafruit.com). 
If you don’t like messy wires all over 
the place, Amazon sells a short micro-
USB power cable for about $3, to allow 
the Raspberry Pi to draw power from the 
monitor’s USB port. 
The Touchscreen Display has the 
added advantage of enabling you to 
scroll through appointments with a click 
of a finger. If this isn’t important, or the 
display is out of your budget, Amazon and 
eBay also sell Pi-compatible displays. 
As the Pi has an HDMI port, any HDMI-
compatible monitor will do, but some 
come with a driver board to allow you to 
connect it to the Pi’s own DSI port.
If you are very comfortable with 
electronics, and want to save money, find 
a broken-down laptop with a working 
LCD. If you can remove the screen safely 
and buy a compatible controller board 
online, it can be made to work with the

to edit it need to access it from their own devices. For anyone with 
a computer, this is a simple matter of visiting the link, as you would 
on the Pi, by using their browser.

Calendar ConundrumS
If you create or change an appointment, and it 
doesn’t appear right away on everyone’s device, wait 
for 5–10 minutes before attempting troubleshooting, to let 
it percolate through. If the changes are visible on the wall 
calendar—that is, on the website—the issue is most likely 
to do with the device, not the Raspberry Pi. 
>> The software and add-ons used to view the calendar 
are very easy to install, so the most problematic part of this 
project is likely to be when it comes to adding the monitor, 
and fixing it to your wall [image e].
>> You can make life much easier for yourself by buying a 
monitor specifically designed for the Raspberry Pi, so you 
have somewhere to put the computer itself.  
>> If the place you want to install the wall calendar is 
hard to reach, you may be able to buy a longer micro-USB 
cable, but bear in mind that the voltage drops as cable 
length grows. Consider using shorter cables and/or a 
powered USB hub.
>> If the Raspberry Pi crashes for any reason, Firefox 
tries to restore all open web pages once it reboots, which 
may mean you have to plug in a mouse or keyboard to close 
down any extra tabs.
>> You can reduce the chance of this happening by starting 
Firefox in safe mode, and then entering “about:config” in 
the address bar. Press Return to be taken to the settings 
screen for Firefox. 
>> Once you’re there, simply scroll down to the setting 
marked 
“Browser.sessionstore.resume_from_crash,” 
and double-click to change from “True” to “False.” 
>> If you are using Google Calendars, anyone who 
scrolls to the top of the screen can switch from your 
calendar to your other Google Apps, such as Gmail. They 
can also use the search bar to view documents stored in 
your Google Drive.
>> If this concerns you, consider setting up a dedicated 
Google account, just for the calendar. You can still access 
and edit the calendar from your own account. 
When the calendar is on your 
wall, the cursor can look 
untidy, especially when using 
a touchscreen. A handy app 
called Unclutter can hide the 
cursor except when it’s being 
moved or you’re touching the 
screen. Open Terminal on 
your Pi (or connect via SSH), 
and run the command  sudo  
 apt-get install unclutter .
In case the Pi crashes, 
and you’re forced to reboot, 
it’s best to have Firefox 
programmed to open 
automatically, saving you 
the trouble of reconnecting 
a keyboard and mouse. 
Open Terminal on your Pi (or 
connect via SSH), and run 
the command  sudo nano  
 /etc/xdg/lxsession/lXde-  
 pi/autostart . Scroll to the 
bottom of the window and add 
the line  @firefox-esr . Press 
Ctrl-X, then Y, then Return to 
save your changes. 
Finally, to make sure the 
display doesn’t sleep after a 
few minutes, open Terminal 
or connect via SSH once 
again, and run the command  
 sudo nano /etc/lightdm/  
 lightdm.conf . Scroll down 
to where it says  #xserver-  
 command=X  and remove the 
hash at the start of the line. 
Next, put a space after the 
letter  X  and type  -s 0  
 –dpms  . Press Ctrl-X, then 
Y, then Return to save your 
changes, then reboot your 
Raspberry Pi.

set up yOur wall calendar
1. Update Raspbian and install FiReFox
Before you can physically transform your Raspberry Pi into a 
wall calendar, you need to connect the device to the Internet, 
and open the Terminal app. Run  sudo apt-get update  and then 
 sudo apt-get  upgrade  to bring your RPi up to date. Next, 
enter  sudo apt-get install iceweasel  to install Firefox 
Extended Support Release on to your mini computer.
3. set FiReFox FoR FUll-scReen
This step is optional but recommended. Visit https://addons.
mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/r-kiosk/ to install the Real 
Kiosk add-on—this disables menus and toolbars. Firefox 
needs to restart for it to work. Remember, you can still close 
the window by connecting a keyboard to the Raspberry Pi, and 
pressing Alt-F4.
5. connect it Up
The specific steps to connect your monitor vary from device to 
device. If you are using the official Raspberry Pi Touchscreen 
Display, assembly instructions are available from http://
thepihut.com/blogs/raspberry-pi-tutorials/45295044-
raspberry-pi-7-touch-screen-assembly-guide.
2. set FiReFox pReFeRences
Go to “Menu > Internet > Firefox ESR” to open Firefox. Visit your 
calendar address—http://calendar.google.com, for example—
and sign in if necessary. If Firefox prompts you to remember your 
preferences, say “Yes.” Once you can see your calendar, go to 
“Edit > Preferences,” and click the “Set to Current Page” button 
to make sure Firefox always displays the calendar.
4. peRFoRm tweaks
Make sure the calendar is in the view you want—for example, 
Monthly. Next, follow the steps in the “Calendar Tweaks and 
Tips” box (opposite) to hide the mouse when not in use, disable 
the RPi’s sleep function, and make Firefox start every time you 
switch on the machine, if you wish. Restart the RPi to ensure your 
changes have taken effect.
6. Finishing toUches
Once you’ve connected your Raspberry Pi up to a screen, you’ll 
want to position it somewhere that everyone can access. If it’s in 
your home, you’ll probably also want to make it look as good as 
possible. You can let your imagination run wild here—take a look 
online to see what other people have achieved.

Edit Raw Files with 
Affinity Photo
1 
Grab the software and an imaGe
The Affinity Photo Windows beta can be downloaded from  
http://affinity.serif.com—the testing version is free at the 
moment, but you have to supply an email address to get it. Once 
you’ve got the application installed on your computer, you need 
to find a raw image file that you want to process. These have  
file extensions such as .CR2, .NEF, and .DNG, and if you’ve got 
one of the better smartphones, you may even be able to coax  
one out of the onboard camera. A list of supported cameras can 
be found at http://bit.ly/Affinity-raw, and includes everything from  
4K Black Magic Production cameras to Canon DSLRs and LG 
Android smartphones.
2 
open the imaGe
If you were to open your raw file in an Adobe application, 
such as Photoshop, you would be taken to Adobe Capture 
Raw. Naturally, Affinity Photo doesn’t use this, but has its own raw 
processing system, which opens as a full-screen app, rather than 
the small window Adobe prefers. 
3 
the develop persona
Once you’ve got your file open, the interface looks a little 
different from the usual Affinity Photo one [image a]. This 
is Develop, one of Affinity Photo’s “personas”—the term Serif uses 
to differentiate between the application’s various modules. To the 
left, you’ll find a selection of tools for manipulating the view of your 
photo, removing red-eye and blemishes, and cropping the image; 
and to the right are the tools and sliders you use to alter your photo 
before opening it in Affinity proper. A raw file is never directly 
If you have a DIgItal SlR cameRa or advanced compact, you might have wondered what the 
“raw” image quality setting is about. Or you may know all about it, and are squinting your eyes at this 
patronizing opening paragraph. A raw capture is a simple dump of the information gathered by your 
camera sensor, with no processing applied, other than that needed to turn it into a PC-readable file. 
No noise reduction, no additional sharpening, and no compression. This can be a big advantage.
Shooting in raw shifts the burden of processing your images from your camera to your PC, 
where you can manually affect the process with software such as Adobe Lightroom. For this 
tutorial, however, we’re going to use the free beta version of Serif’s Affinity Photo, which is currently 
available as the software prepares for a Windows release. It’s been available in the land of Apple for 
a while, so should be relatively bug-free as it transfers across. Famous last words. –Ian EvEndEn

edited—instead, you build up a list of edits that are only 
applied once you click the blue “Develop” button at the top-
left, and enter the Photo persona [image b]. Affinity then 
generates a new file, which you save as a JPEG or TIFF, 
leaving your original raw file wherever you saved it, rather 
like a digital negative.
4 
exposure
The most commonly applied adjustments are 
grouped in the “Basic” tab. These are things such 
as exposure, which you can push up or down to brighten 
or darken the overall picture. A raw file captures the full 
bit-depth of the sensor, which is often 14-bit, rather than 
discarding information the way an 8-bit JPEG would. This 
means there is more potential detail to be recovered from 
the highlights and shadows of an image, so you can push 
the exposure the way film was once pushed in a darkroom, 
as though it were a higher sensitivity than marked. Be 
aware, though, that the more you increase exposure, the 
more noise you’re likely to reveal, particularly in shadows, 
thanks to the way camera sensors record less information 
in darker areas.
5 
noise reduction
If you just want to brighten the dark areas of your 
image (or darken the highlights), look further down 
on the right, and you’ll find “Shadows and Highlights.” 
Check this box, and two sliders appear that allow you to 
make finer adjustments to the brightness of your image. 
If the noise levels—either pixels that are the wrong color 
for their area of the image, or a grain-like pattern where

they’re the wrong brightness—get out of hand, you can move  
over to the “Details” tab, where you’ll find “Noise Reduction” 
[image c]. This is split into two parts—for color noise and 
luminance noise—and comes with a rather awesome button 
marked “Extreme,” for those times when you really want to go to 
town. It’s worth noting, though, that noise reduction isn’t perfect, 
and can remove detail from your image. 
6 
sharpen your imaGe
The “Detail Refinement” section above “Noise Reduction” 
is Affinity’s term for sharpening. All JPEG images shot on a 
digital camera are sharpened as part of the processing applied by 
default, so you may find your raw files a little soft by comparison. 
Bringing out the extra detail hidden in the feathers of our crane 
is a matter of bringing up the “Amount” slider to around halfway, 
then gradually upping the “Radius” slider until we’re happy with 
the result. If your image is noisy, sharpening can enhance this 
instead of the underlying detail, so it pays to keep an eye on what’s 
happening across your image.
C
7 
remove distortion
The “Lens” tab is home to tools that can remove 
distortion, especially useful if you’ve been tilting 
your camera up at a tall building, or had a wide-angle lens 
too close to the face of someone with a prominent nose. 
More handy, and able to be applied with a single click, is 
the “Chromatic Aberration Reduction” box beneath—this 
removes the fringing you sometimes get in high-contrast 
images, which comes from a lens focusing different 
wavelengths of light on to different parts of the sensor.
8 
Keep experimentinG
Because none of these adjustments are permanent 
until you hit the “Develop” button, you can toy 
with the sliders to your heart’s content. Any change you 
make can be undone by pushing the slider in the opposite 
direction, and Affinity makes it easy to see what you’re 
doing with its Mirror view [image d], which puts altered 
and unaltered versions of your image side by side. 
D
At the top of many image-editing programs is a histogram. 
This is a graph showing the brightness of your image on 
the X axis, with the number of pixels at that brightness on 
the Y. You can use this to see if your image has highlights 
that are pure white—known as “clipped”—and from 
which no detail can be extracted. Affinity has a “Show 
Clipped Highlights” button, top-right, which shows these 
up as red areas in your image. The opposite, shadows that 
are pure black, can be revealed in blue with the “Show 
Clipped Shadows” button. As you alter the brightness of 
your image, you can watch the histogram to get an idea 
of how much latitude you have before areas start to clip.

Power Up Your 
Plex Media Server
1 
Use the right format
The most effective way to improve performance is by reducing—
or even eliminating—transcoding. Transcoding converts your 
media stream from its native format to one that’s compatible 
with your media-playing device, so the more exotic and varied  
your media formats are, the more likely it is that Plex needs to 
transcode them.
>> Wherever possible, save your media in .mp4 file containers 
using the H.264 video and AAC or MP3 audio codecs—this is the 
closest to a universal format you can get, and most devices should 
be able to play it directly. Handbrake (www.handbrake.fr) can do 
this for you.
>> The critical elements here are the codecs—if you use a 
different file container (such as .mkv or .avi) with H.264 and AAC/
MP3, Plex uses a process called Direct Stream to “remux” the 
file in a compatible container (typically .mp4) before streaming it. 
Although this requires extra processing power, remuxing is far less 
demanding than a full transcode.
2 
add sUbtitles
If you need subtitles, it’s important to choose the right 
format if you use external files—otherwise Plex has 
to transcode the stream to accommodate them. Go to “Media 
Preparation > Subtitles” at https://support.plex.tv/hc/en-us 
for instructions. Here you’ll discover which formats to choose 
If you’re lookIng for a medIa server that doesn’t just enable you to organize and play your 
media, but shows it off in the best possible way, you need Plex. It works across just about any device 
you own, and enables you to watch across multiple platforms, both at home and over the Internet, 
picking up where you left off watching on another device.
The biggest issue with Plex is choosing the server to run it on. A PC is an obvious choice, but it 
needs to be left on 24/7 for unlimited access. You’re better off installing it on a dedicated low-power 
device, such as a high-end NAS, like QNAP’s TS-251+, which boasts a quad-core Celeron CPU and 
hardware transcoding engine. But that’s not necessarily affordable, so a cheaper NAS with app 
support (like the WD My Cloud [image a]) or a Raspberry Pi 2 or 3 is capable of serving media.
The major trade-off is performance—you free up resources from your main PC, but your server 
is slower and visibly less responsive. It still does the job, though, and armed with the following tips, 
you’ll squeeze that bit more performance from it to deliver a great media experience. –Nick Peers

to avoid transcoding (.srt and .vtt are two), along with a 
means of fetching subtitles on demand from the Internet 
using OpenSubtitles.org. Then browse to “Settings > 
Languages,” check the “Automatically select” box, and set 
“Subtitle mode” to “Shown with foreign audio,” and “Prefer 
subtitles in” to “English.” 
>> Subtitles are notorious for being out of sync—if your 
media player doesn’t provide offset controls (typically in 
milliseconds), visit www.subsedit.com/simple to paste 
in your subtitles from a text editor, select an offset, and 
generate a new .srt file that syncs perfectly. Use VLC 
Media Player’s “Tools > Track Synchronization” with the 
original .srt file to calculate the offset you need.
3 
sPeed UP netWork connections
If you connect your server wirelessly to your 
network, you can improve its performance by taking 
it off your congested Wi-Fi network, and connecting it via 
Ethernet cable—either directly to your router, or indirectly 
via a switch or HomePlug network (500Mb/s is adequate, 
but 1,300Mb/s is best if your server frequently serves 
multiple streams). 
>> Some NAS drives—including our beloved QNAP—
offer dual Ethernet ports with support for Link Aggregation 
Control Protocol (802.3ad). Pair this with a suitable network

switch (such as TP-Link’s affordable TL-SG2008 model), and you’ll 
boost network throughput when serving multiple connections.
4 
transcoder settings
There’s a noticeable lag when playing back media over the 
Internet—like it or not, this involves some transcoding, even 
with directly supported formats. To boost responsiveness at the 
expense of quality, log on to your server through your web browser: 
“192.168.x.y:32400/web,” where “192.168.x.y” is the IP address of 
the device running your server. Choose “Settings > Transcoder,” 
and set “Transcoder quality” to “Prefer higher speed encoding.”
>> Plex is also set to transcode an unlimited number of streams—
restrict this to just one or two via the “Maximum simultaneous 
video transcode” drop-down [image b]. Note: This doesn’t restrict 
Direct Play connections.
5 
oPtimize for transPort
Does Plex struggle to deliver a good stream to certain 
devices? You can use its Media Optimizer tool to make use 
of idle server time, by converting selected media files to a format 
that will stream using Direct Play, without buffering or dropping 
frames. The process produces a smaller, lower-quality copy of the 
file in question, which sits alongside the original, and improves 
streaming performance.
>> Don’t optimize your entire library; instead, optimize on 
demand—maybe you’re going away for a few days, and want access 
to three or four TV episodes or movies. To do this, log into the 
server in your web browser, then browse to the movie or episode 
in question. Click the “…” button in the left-hand pane, and choose 
D
“Optimize.” Pick a preset: Mobile, TV, Original, or Custom 
(this latter option lets you choose from more presets, or 
set your own frame rate and resolution). Leave the default 
storage location alone, and click “Optimize” [image c].
6 
tWeak oPtimization settings
Media is optimized one file at a time, but you can build 
a queue. Check their progress via the “Conversion” 
tab. To manage optimized versions—allowing you to delete 
some or all of these converted files to reclaim drive space 
at a later date—go to “Settings > Optimized Versions.”
>> Return to “Settings > Transcoder,” and click “Show 
Advanced.” At the bottom of the screen, you’ll see the 
“Background transcoding x264 preset” setting—it’s set to 
“Very fast” by default, but consider “Super fast,” or even 
“Ultra fast,” if the optimization process is taking too long, 
and you’re not bothered by video quality.
7 
restrict library UPdates
Go to “Settings > Library” to manage how Plex 
updates your media libraries. By default, it monitors 
for new and changed content in your media folders, then 
updates accordingly. This isn’t practical on lower-end 
media servers, such as the Raspberry Pi, so restrict the 
scan to no more than once an hour using the “Update my 
library periodically” option instead. Also consider setting 
“Generate video preview thumbnails” and “Generate 
chapter thumbnails” to “Never” to reclaim more system 
resources [image d]. 
E
C
An alternative way to access subtitles is to embed them into 
your media using Handbrake. A full guide can be found under 
“Advanced Features” at https://handbrake.fr/docs/en/—but 
it’s basically this: Load up your media, switch to the “Subtitles” 
tab, and either import your .srt file (you can set an offset if 
required), or click “Add Track” if ripping from DVD. Look for 
a “Foreign Audio Scan” option [image e], which attempts to 
detect the foreign-language dialog track for you, then check 
both “Forced Only” and “Default” (or “Burn In” if you want the 
subtitles to be physically overlaid on the video track, which 
means they’re visible even if subtitles are switched off). You’ll 
never be bamboozled by Jabba the Hutt again.

The Ultimate 
Upgrade
Winter is here, the cold dark nights have firmly 
fixed themselves upon us, and as the bitter chill of 
the north wind bites into the flesh in those dark and 
somber hours, it’s important to have something 
to comfort the soul, as we come out of the snow 
and into the warmth. Something? Well, this is 
Maximum PC, so it has to be a system. In short, the 
aim of this is to be the ultimate upgrade. After a year 
of fantastic releases and phenomenal performance 
increases, our reviews editor decided it was about 
time he pursued an upgrade of his own. So, what 
are we upgrading from? Well, at the heart of the 
system was an Intel Core i7-6700K @ 4.8GHz, 32GB 
of Kingston HyperX DDR4 @ 2,400MT/s, an Nvidia 
GeForce GTX 1070, one Samsung 950 Pro 256GB 
M.2 SSD, and a 1TB OCZ Trion 100 SSD. There 
are a few other details: The Corsair Hydro H100i 
GT cooling the CPU is kept chilled by four Noctua 
NF-F12 iPPC fans, and the power is supplied via a 
Corsair AX1200i inside an NZXT Manta chassis.
It’s a respectable rig. Already quite the 
powerhouse of technology, but not without its 
flaws. The fans are too loud, they spin at too high 
an RPM; the GPU, although powerful, isn’t enough 
to satisfyingly game at 4K; and the Asus Z170i 
Pro Gaming is having trouble booting from that 
Samsung PCIe SSD, with load times reaching into 
minutes in some cases.
The solution to all these woes came from two 
desires. One, to swap out from a 28-inch TN 4K 
Iiyama Prolite B2888UHSU (seriously, who thought 
of that designation?) to a 27-inch IPS 165Hz 1440p 
AOC Agon AG271QG. And the second to utilize the 
absolutely stunning NZXT Source 340 Elite chassis.

Gluttony and hardWare deCisions 
For this build, it was all about keeping it as clean as possible; 
accenting just the hardware, and drawing away from the cables 
and anything else cluttering up the interior. To start, we opted 
for the Asus Z170 TUF Sabertooth motherboard, with a twist. 
The thermal armor covering the majority of the mobo helps keep 
it looking slick, but the mid cap, with its chrome finish, is a bit 
gaudy, so that would have to be plastidipped. Then it was on to 
the cooling. As the NZXT Kraken X52 had just arrived in the office, 
it seemed like the obvious choice. For fans, we opted for three 
of Corsair’s ML120 Pros with white LEDs; their super-low RPMs 
mean they can run whisper quiet, and they look awesome. We 
had them in a pull configuration on the radiator, purely to ensure 
we could see some form of movement inside the case itself. 
For graphics, we went with two MSI GeForce GTX 1080 Gaming 
Xs, the same cards we used for the Dream Machine 2016, but 
running on air, and with one of MSI’s HB bridges as well, to 
give them a little more pizazz, and to put to bed the question of 
whether or not the HB bridge makes a difference. Memory was 
provided by four sticks of 16GB G.Skill Trident Z DDR4, and the 
storage changes came in the form of swapping out the 256GB 
950 Pro to a 250GB 960 Evo, and the 1TB OCZ Trion 100 for the 
now slightly ageing 2TB Samsung 850 Pro 2.5-inch SSD instead.
it’s the small details that matter the most. With 
limited airflow, we had to be smart about how we 
installed the setup. By default, the S340 supports up 
to two 140mm fans in the front, one 140mm fan in the 
roof, and one 120mm fan in the rear. To ensure we had a 
positive system, the plan was to install the Kraken X52 
in the front of the case, using the two ML120 Pros as 
intakes, and then only have one ML120 Pro exhausting 
air out of the back, leaving the top fan empty. The only 
problem being the excessively open grille letting in 
dust. To counter this, we opted to grab two Silverstone 
magnetic dust filters, one for the rear of the chassis and 
one for the roof. These set us back about $8 each, but 
are well worth it in the long run.
the next addition to this build was the SLI bridge. 
Now, we’re still not entirely convinced about how 
much this actually affects performance, but judging by 
the fact that the Fire Strike scores are slightly higher 
at 1440p and 4K, we assume it’s doing something 
worthwhile. That said, what it definitely does add is a bit 
of bling, along with additional support between the two 
cards, reducing GPU sag in return. The LED lighting, 
although not controllable, does look pretty swish with 
the GTX 1080s, and the brushed aluminum finish fits in 
nicely with our overall aesthetic.

For CablinG, we decided to opt for a set of pre-sleeved cables 
from BitFenix. In fact, we were pretty shocked to discover they 
sold full kits, but with support for a variety of brands, including 
EVGA, Corsair, Seasonic, Be Quiet!, and Cooler Master, it was 
a no-brainer. The original intention was to pop out the ATX 
pins and fit them with E22 stealth combs, to further smarten 
them up, but, unfortunately, they turned out to be too tight to 
remove from the factory fitting—a tutorial for another time, 
perhaps. On top of that, the S340 Elite comes with fantastic 
cable routing options, with the SATA SSD mount in the floor (if 
you’re not running two HDDs behind the PSU cover), the GPU 
power passthrough, and, of course, the giant cable bar running 
up through the center of the chassis.
liGhtinG in this build is tricky. We’re still not 100 percent 
sure whether this will be the final configuration, but it does 
look cool. The general rule of thumb for lighting anything 
is that the lights themselves shouldn’t be seen, but the 
light they throw should. You can work different angles and 
highlight different products by utilizing either LED strips 
or individual LEDs. One thing to note: You should almost 
always use white LEDs; using any other color LED strips 
pulls all the color out of your components, and just bathes 
them in the color of the lights. Also, you need to be smart 
with your strip purchases. We use magnetic BitFenix 
Alchemy 2.0 strips in our steel chassis builds, and normal 
adhesive-based ones in acrylic or aluminum cases.

2.5-inCh ssd support in the S340 Elite is an interesting 
proposition. You have three options for placement. You 
can place one at the front, on the side of the PSU cover, 
two below the graphics cards, with easy cutout holes for 
cables to reach through, or two in the hard drive cage, 
inside the PSU cover. Because we opted to use a 250GB 
Samsung 960 Evo M.2 drive for our OS, hidden away under 
our motherboard’s armor, we decided on a single SSD on 
the PSU cover, and removed the additional two SSD sleds 
below the GPUs, to make it look a little cleaner. We were 
fortunate with this build in that the two MSI cards, spaced 
so far apart, successfully cover those two sleds; without 
them, two empty bays would look a little out of place.
What a beautiFul pieCe of craftsmanship—NZXT’s latest 
AIOs look stunning. The infinity mirror on the CPU block is 
nothing short of awe-inspiring, but to run a block like that, in this 
manner, requires a plethora of cables, including a substantial 
micro-USB cable, and a proprietary fan/pump cable. These 
were a little difficult to route. We ended up running the micro-
USB through the CPU power cutout, and the rest of the cables 
into the back of the chassis, to the top-right of the motherboard, 
before routing them back through to reduce cable slack. The 
pump header was then carefully weaved around the thermal 
armor and into the fan header, below the four sticks of DDR4.

there are two cutouts here for ssd cables; we 
chose to use the one closest to the front panel, as 
it meant we could keep our ssd branding the right way 
up, and the cables out of sight. unfortunately, it does 
limit the potential of those two 3.5-inch bays behind.
2  
We originally intended to do a bit of a minor mod 
here, by taking a pre-braided cable kit, popping 
off the connectors, and fitting them with stealth combs 
to keep them better aligned. however, they proved to 
be too difficult to remove, so we opted to run without. a 
how-to feature coming up soon….

the plastidip job we did on the ugly chrome 
motherboard cover really did the trick. thanks 
to the plastic paint covering it, it matches the rest of the 
build, doesn’t look too gaudy, and is easily removable if 
necessary in the future.
4  
the Kraken x52 is certainly a treat to look at. that 
said, there’s something about a 240mm radiator 
that doesn’t sit right with us nowadays. especially 
because there are so many well-developed 140mm 
static pressure fans available, mag levs included.

Our desktop zero-point PC uses a Core i7-6700K CPU @ 4.6GHz, an AMD R9 Fury X, and 32GB of RAM.  
All games are tested at 1080p on max settings, with HD texture packages installed.
We set out to prove that you don’t have 
to go the whole hog to create a stunning-
looking system. Things such as liquid-cooling, 
although coming with their own thermal 
advantages and aesthetics, aren’t the be all 
and end all of bespoke custom PCs. Yes, the 
build we have here is monstrous, and comes 
with a hefty price tag, but its components 
are, in lots of ways, very similar to those at all 
ends of the spectrum. GPUs with four-figure 
price tags often use the same cooler designs 
as those costing just under $200; the highest 
capacity memory still fits into the same 
slots as those two 4GB DDR4 sticks; and so 
on. Although SLI is limited nowadays to only 
operating on the GTX 1070 and above, you can 
achieve similar results with AMD solutions, or 
even just opt for a single, more powerful card.
For some, aesthetics are a waste of time 
in computing. After all, it’s just a box that’s 
going to end up under your desk, so why 
care? Because it’s something you pour time 
and money into, something you sit at, often 
for hours, working, enjoying media, gaming, 
so why not make the most of it, and take the 
opportunity to make your system beautiful?
 Of course, it does cost more to do 
something like this, but it could be less than 
you think. Taking time to route your cables and 
tidy them up costs nothing. The next step up, a 
new case, an LED strip or two, and a braided 
cable kit for your PSU, can come in at less than 
$200. Add in two or three fans and a decent 
dual-rad cooler for 300–400 bucks, and you 
net yourself improved thermals, lower noise, 
and a system you can proudly display in your 
home. That’s a win in our books.
But enough justification, what about the 
system? Well, it looks stunning. The Kraken 
X52 not only looks good, but also keeps the 
chip cool, with temperatures ranging from 
27 C at idle, up to 52 C under load. Corsair’s 
ML120 Pro fans are extremely quiet, the only 
downside being that the MSI cards can get 
noisy under load. As a performer, it’s quite 
impressive; rendering performance is snappy, 
and having access to 64GB of DDR4 makes 
for exceptionally fast Photoshop work. We’re 
utilizing a 24GB RAM cache to take advantage 
of all that storage by transferring the browser 
cache, scratch disk, and temporary system 
files to it to alleviate load times, among other 
things. Gaming on older titles is nifty, and 
although there are a few issues with newer 
AAA games, it’s an exceptionally enjoyable 
experience at 1440p and above, with frame 
rates reaching well into the 70s and above.
Is it perfect? Arguably no. There are still 
things we can tweak: an extra LED or two, 
better cable routing, and our own custom 
cables. And, no doubt, the mighty Kaby Lake 
and a multitude of upgrades lie in its future. 
But, for now, this reviews editor couldn’t be 
happier, with a well-rounded system to see us 
through those harsh winter months.

Kaby LaKe is eighth processor iteration 
since the introduction of the Intel Core 
series that started with Nehalem. For eight 
years, the company has pressed to push the 
advantage in its processor lineup, and each 
and every time it’s managed a marginal 
10–15 percent performance increase. This 
process has been, for the longest time, 
based around the concept of Tick-Tock. 
In short, a new architecture would be 
designed based on the latest transistor 
size, then that transistor size would be 
shrunk the following year. For instance, 
Sandy Bridge (or the Core i5-2500K) held 
the new architecture, while Ivy Bridge 
(Core i5-3570K), released a year later, was 
the die shrink, and so on. 
However, this hasn’t always been the 
case, and Intel has, time and time again, 
come up against issues. The first we saw 
of this was with the Haswell refresh, 
known as Devil’s Canyon, then once more 
as Broadwell was delayed for around 
six months—each drop in transistor 
size becoming ever more difficult for the 
technology giant to achieve. Fast-forward 
to the release of Skylake, Intel’s first 14nm 
architecture, and we’re greeted with news 
that Tick-Tock is finally being annexed 
in favor of a new scheme called PAO, or 
Process, Architecture, Optimization. In 
short, the die shrink (originally the Tick) 
has turned into the Process part; the 
architecture (the Tock) is now, well, the 
Architecture; and lastly we also have 
Optimization. A new piece to the puzzle, 
The return of 5GHz
Intel Core i7-7700K
where Intel attempts to gain the maximum 
amount of performance possible from 
both a mature manufacturing process and 
a more optimized architecture. On top of 
giving Intel an additional year to perfect its 
manufacturing processes, it also gives us 
another chip.
Ignoring Devil’s Canyon, Kaby Lake is 
the first true Optimization release we’ve 
seen, and with it comes a lot of questions. 
If Intel’s generational gains have been so 
minimal from generation to generation, 
what on earth can Kaby Lake do to make 
that any different? Well, that’s what we’re 
here to answer.
Benchmark Bonanza
Intel’s Core i7-7700K is a four-core, 
eight-threaded, 
low-power 
rendering 
powerhouse. It is, in short, the pinnacle 
of what Intel has managed to achieve 
with Skylake and the 14nm technology. 
With greater performance and better 
overclocking potential than we’ve seen 
from any of Intel’s last few generations of 
chips, it comes packing a whopping 4.2GHz 
core frequency, turboing up to 4.5GHz with 
boost. We were immediately impressed 
with 
its 
out-of-box 
performance. 
In 
Cinebench R15, we saw scores planted 
well into the high 900s, with single-core 
performance peaking at 194—a sweet little 
8 percent increase over Skylake. It was a 
similar experience across the board.
What really impressed, however, was 
the overclocking potential. We increased

the multiplier up to 48 without the core 
batting so much as an eyelid, and stock 
voltages happily keeping the 4.8GHz 
chip on track. 5GHz came next, needing 
only a 0.05V increase to the Vcore, with 
temperatures sitting comfortably at 62 C 
under our 280mm NZXT Kraken X61. But 
it kept going, higher and higher, until 
eventually we topped out at 5.2GHz with 
1.4V added to the Vcore—a substantial 
increase, but temperatures still only sitting 
at 80 C. This chip runs cool—ice cool, in 
fact. Stunningly impressive compared to 
older editions, this is an overclocker’s core. 
Is it worth upgrading today? Well, that 
depends on what interests you. Generally 
speaking, the Z270 chipset is feature-
rich, and adds additional support for 
PCIe devices and such. But in contrast to 
the change from Z97 to Z170, it pales in 
comparison. Putting the processors side by 
side, the difference between Skylake and 
Kaby Lake is minimal. If you’re already set 
up with the sixth generation of processor, 
it’s certainly not worth your time, unless 
you’re an overclocking fiend after the 
highest possible performance, with lower 
temps, and better power draws. Upgrading 
from Ivy Bridge, Haswell, or Devil’s Canyon, 
on the other hand, is very much worth your 
time. And we can’t recommend this core 
enough in that regard. –ZaK storey

With 
any 
neW 
chip, comes a new 
chipset. 
And 
with 
each 
generation, 
that chipset improves in a variety of ways. 
The improvements usually revolve around 
connectivity and expansion support. But 
there are often other notable tweaks as 
well, such as aesthetic design, cooling 
support, and updates and enhancements to 
the bundled software, so that it works with 
the latest and greatest hardware.
Asus’s TUF Z270 Mark 1, is the first 
of this new generation of boards that 
we’ve been fortunate enough to review. 
Replacing the Sabertooth pseudonym in 
favor of the far simpler Mark 1, this is a 
mobo that should, in every way, follow in its 
father’s footsteps—a reliable workhorse, 
compatible with all, and capable of keeping 
up with even the best overclocking boards 
out there.
Unfortunately, we had trouble from the 
get go, with memory kits in particular. The 
TUF Mark 1 was decidedly awkward, only 
operating with a single stick of DDR4, no 
matter how much we worked with Asus 
on trying to remedy the situation. Sadly, 
this is the type of issue that reviewers 
often have to deal with, especially when 
having access to products so far ahead 
of launch. Asus has assured us that it 
is working on a BIOS update to fix any 
potential memory compatibility issues 
in readiness for launch, and by the time 
you read this review, all of the TUF

Mark 1 motherboards should be up and 
running perfectly.
Memory troubles aside, what’s different 
in the Z270 chipset compared to last gen? 
Well, firstly, Intel has included an additional 
four PCIe 3.0 lanes (going from 20 to 24), to 
help cater for the ever more aggressive 
push toward PCIe storage. We additionally 
have Thunderbolt 3 support (although 
it isn’t included on this motherboard), 
10 USB 3.0 ports, allowing for two onboard 
USB 3.0 headers, and that’s about it. USB 
2.0 support is the same, Ethernet is the 
same, even the socket is still the LGA1151, 
meaning you can insert a Skylake chip in a 
Z270 board, and vice versa if you so desire.
Performance Parities
Performance, however, is impressive, and 
coincides nicely with the new Intel Core 
i7-7700K processors. We won’t know for 
sure how far we can push our new Kaby 
Lake successors until the more premium 
overclocking boards arrive on the scene, 
but, for the time being, we’re more than 
impressed with what Intel has managed 
to pull off in conjunction with these Asus 
boards. Overall, it seems the power-phase 
design on the VRMs are exceptionally 
similar between the two review boards we 
have in. Although performance did vary 
slightly between the Asus TUF Z270 Mark 1 
and the Maximus IX Hero, overclocks and 
undervolts remained exceptionally similar

between them. Noticeable differences 
occur in overall design, with the TUF 
featuring a rather interesting vertical 
M.2 slot, with securing bracket included, 
located at the bottom of the board. On top 
of that, the two internal fans designed to 
shift cool air below the thermal armor are 
gone. Instead, we’re graced with further 
integration of Asus’s RGB phenomenon in 
the form of AURA lighting, located below 
the center cap, and a single 40mm fan 
in the rear, which seems like a missed 
opportunity, given PCIe SSDs’ tendency to 
thermally throttle themselves. The neat 
features integrated in the last series of 
TUF Sabertooth are also still around. The 
thermal armor is still capable of hiding a 
full M.2 PCIe SSD, the dust covers and caps 
are still there, and the board still features 
a plethora of fan headers and TUF’s world-
renowned ICe fan controller chip.
The Mark 1 is a solid reiteration on the 
last generation of TUF motherboards. 
And although Z270 isn’t mind-bogglingly 
different to Z170, the expanded storage 
support and reiterated design make it a 
worthy upgrade, and well worth your time

They say good Things come in small 
packages. That certainly is the case when 
it comes to the Chronos from Origin PC, 
a supremely powerful system in a very 
small chassis. Measuring just 11.75 x 
13.75 x 4 inches, the Chronos is one of the 
most compact systems we’ve ever tested. 
And considering that size, and the power 
it packs inside, it just might be worth its 
super-premium price tag. 
Of course, a big price tag should mean 
top-end performance, and the Chronos 
does not disappoint. The system we tested 
was outfitted with the enthusiast-class 
Intel Core i7-6950X sitting in an ASRock 
X99 ITX motherboard. The 6950X’s 10 cores 
clocked at 4.1GHz helped the Chronos blow 
away our zero-point in Cinebench R15 and 
TechARP’s x264 benchmarks. 
For storage, our Chronos featured 
a 512GB Samsung 950 Pro M.2 SSD, 
Small but 
mighty

PC 
Chronos
combined with a 6TB Western Digital Red 
HDD. Remarkably, Origin says the system 
can fit up to four 2.5-inch SSDs, but we 
can’t for the life of us figure out where. The 
inside of the Chronos is packed tighter than 
an overflowing suitcase—not surprising, 
considering it sports a full-size GeForce 
GTX 1080 GPU. 
Here at Maximum PC, we often get 
spoiled 
by 
crazy 
high-end 
systems, 
making it easy to forget that the GTX 1080 
is an impressively powerful graphics card. 
While the Chronos can fit up to a GTX Titan 
X inside, the 1080 in our system is more 
than capable of handling high-demand 
gaming situations.
The Chronos boasted an average of 
125fps across Rise of the Tomb Raider’s 
three-part GPU benchmark in 1080p at 
max settings. Far Cry Primal and The 
Division produced similar results from 
their 
benchmarks—around 
102 
and 
95fps respectively. More impressively, 
the Chronos performed well at higher 
resolutions. Rise of the Tomb Raider 
showed 84fps at 1440p, and 47fps at 4K. 
And through several hours of Titanfall 2’s 
campaign at 1440p, we don’t recall the 
frame rate ever dropping below 80fps, 
even in the most frantic firefights. 
What’s in a case?
A large selling point for the Chronos is its 
custom-built chassis, made from server-
grade steel. It’s small, sturdy, and can 
be outfitted with a custom paint job in the 
pattern or color of your liking. However,

packing that much power into such a small

liquid 
cooler keeps the CPU at a reasonable 
temperature, considering there’s little 
room for airflow inside the cramped

need to open the case up and look inside. 
When we reassembled our Chronos, the 
liquid cooler tubes blocked the radiator fan 
from spinning unless they were positioned 
just so. Origin, of course, should ensure 
the tubes are properly situated, but it’s 
something to think about should you ever 
need to open the case for a routine dusting.
Overall, the Chronos is an impressive 
system in a very small frame. And thanks 
to its detachable magnetic feet, it can  
sit in any orientation on or under your 
desk. We recommend proudly displaying 
the beastly GTX 1080 through the LED-

BENChmArkS
Best scores are in bold. Our test bench consists of an Intel Core i7-6700K, MSI Z170A 
Gaming M7, and 16GB Crucial Ballistix Elite DDR4-2666.
Zeroes and ones, that’s all there is to 
computing, right? Theoretically, yes. In 
practice, things are a bit more complicated. 
Enter Adata’s new XPG SX8000 SSD.
Such are the complexities of SSD tech, 
the SX8000’s headline specifications are 
little more than a stepping-off point for 
what the drive actually delivers. It’s still an 
intriguing SSD on paper, of course.
For starters, it uses Intel’s hot (in more 
ways than one) new 3D MLC NAND flash 
memory. Feeding those memory chips is 
Silicon Motion’s SM2260 controller. It’s a 
full-featured item with two ARM Cortex 
cores, eight NAND flash channels, and 
low-density parity check (LDPC) error 
correction. More on that in a moment.
In terms of form factors and interfaces, 
we’re talking M.2, quad-lane PCIe, and, 
naturally, the NVMe control protocol. A 
thoroughly modern SSD. Adata pegs the 
SX8000’s sequential read performance at 
up to 2,400MB/s, and its write performance 
at 1,000MB/s when pseudo-SLC caching is 
used. As for random performance, the new 
drives can deliver up to 140,000 4K read/
write IOPS. Those figures are for the 512GB 
model here and its 1TB sibling. The 128GB 
and 256GB options are significantly slower.
Back to LDPC. Some would argue that 
it’s old technology wheeled out to claw back 
some endurance from the write cycles of 
Intel’s 3D MLC memory. Meanwhile, the 
SX8000 is partially dependent on caching 
technology to achieve its peak speeds—not 
always great for real-world performance.
With all that in mind, what can we tell 
you about the SX8000’s performance? It’s 
A consistently inconsistent SSD
complicated. Following our setup routine, 
which involves brimming the drive with 
data before wiping it clean, the numbers 
were hideous. Actually, scratch that. We 
could see this drive had a few issues even 
during the setup process. The SX8000 
was clearly cycling through performance 
states, most likely as a consequence of 
filling, then flushing that pseudo cache.
TesTing Tragedy
Diving into the benchmarks, it wasn’t 
getting 
anywhere 
near 
the 
claimed 
numbers, and dropped as far as 600–
700MB/s for sequential reads and writes. 
Things didn’t look any rosier in our real-
world file transfer and compression tests. 
Over four minutes for our 30GB internal 
file copy test is nothing short of tragic. Left 
overnight to idle, however, and the SX8000 
performed much, much better.
Peak sequentials of 2,291MB/s and 
946MB/s for reads and writes respectively 
in CrystalMark are pretty much on the 
money, for instance. It returns some very 
nice looking numbers in AS SSD’s 4K 
random access benchmarks, too. 
But here’s the catch. Not only is 
Samsung’s latest solid-state killer, the 960 
Pro, capable of much faster performance 
in most tests, but even after being left to 
idle, and thus allowing the Adata’s garbage 
collection routines to do their thing, 
performance still remains inconsistent.
Very likely, much of this comes down to 
the properties of NAND flash and its need 
to be written in blocks, rather than being 
addressable at bit level. Judging by how hot

the drive gets to the touch, it’s possible that 
thermal throttling is partly to blame, too. 
Either way, most SSDs now do a good job 
of compensating for the shortcomings of 
flash memory. For all the wrong reasons, 
the SX8000 is a reminder of how far flash 
memory has come, and how complex it 
is to implement in a high-performance, 
small-form-factor SSD. –Jeremy Laird

ViewSonic has packed 
the VP2468 with pro 
color features.
in the lab
82
MAXIMUMPC

feb 2017

Two hundred and fifTy bucks. That’s all 
you now need to stump up for a 24-inch, 
Full-HD, IPS, multi-input, fully-adjustable 
PC monitor. Prices really have tumbled 
over the last five years.
If that’s the new norm, it’s also the highly 
competitive context in which ViewSonic’s 
latest, the VP2468, must strut its stuff. The 
good news is that its feature set does indeed 
go a little beyond that norm. For the record, 
it begins with the aforementioned IPS panel 
and its 1920x1080 pixels. Inevitably at this 
price point, it’s almost certainly a 6-bit-
per-channel panel in hardware terms, and 
uses dithering to achieve the claimed 16.7 
million colors.
However, the VP2468 also supports 
14-bit 3D look-up tables, plus six-axis 
color adjustment functionality. Both are 
a little unusual for this class of display, 
and elevate the VP2468’s utility beyond 
the budget-monitor masses. Its static 
contrast, meanwhile, is rated at 1,000:1, 
the maximum refresh at native resolution 
is 60Hz, the backlight is a simple white LED 
affair, and max brightness is 250cd/m2. If 
all that, bar the color management stuff, is 
pretty much par for the course, ViewSonic 
has also thrown in a decent array of input 
options, including two HDMI inputs, both 
full and mini DisplayPort connectors, and 
a DisplayPort-out for daisy chaining. Nice.
But if there’s anything that really makes 
the VP2468 stand out physically, it’s the 
bezels. There are numerous affordable 
monitors with slim bezels on three sides. 
But the VP2468 ups the ante to all four. 
In other words, it lacks the big, fat chin of 
most slim-bezel designs. The result is a 
pleasingly minimalist design, and one that 
A pro panel for a puny price?
ViewSonic VP2468
looks conspicuously compact for a 24-
inch panel. The fully adjustable stand with 
swivel, rotate, tilt, and height tweakability 
is a welcome inclusion, too.
All of which just leaves the minor 
matter of how this display performs. The 
VP2468 is pitched as a cheap solution for 
professional applications, and with that in 
mind, each panel comes factory calibrated, 
complete with a printout of the results, and 
a promise that all color deltas are below 
two. The upshot is a nicely set-up display, 
with excellent detail in both black and white 
scales. As you’d expect from an IPS display, 
the viewing angles are excellent, too.
Another plus point concerns the two-
tier OSD menu. With both a simple menu 
for frequently used settings and a fuller 
option that includes more settings, it’s 
extremely pleasant to use. The only obvious 
omission is an option for adjusting the pixel 
overdrive. Handily, that brings us to the first 
of the VP2468’s image quality issues. The 
pixel response is mediocre. Worse, there 
is occasionally some fairly obvious inverse 
ghosting with certain colors and shapes. As 
if that isn’t enough, the likely fact that this 
is a cheap 6-bit IPS panel is all too obvious 
when viewing color gradients. The tell-tale 
banding is, sadly, clearly evident.
We’re not crazy about the contrast, 
vibrancy, and colors, either. We had a 4K 
TN monitor running in parallel during our 
review process, and it had this ViewSonic 
comprehensively beaten for subjective 
contrast and color vibrancy, which goes 
to show you shouldn’t always base your 
buys on panel type. The comparison 
also highlighted a lack of punch from 
the backlight, and a slight dirtiness to

the quality of the white tones. It’s not the 
purest, whitest panel you could wish for.
Of course, this is an affordable $250 
screen, it has a strong feature set, and its 
shortcomings are largely generic. Cheap 
6-bit IPS panels aren’t pretty. If you need 
the special features the VP2468 offers, 
most notably the 14-bit 3D look-up tables 
and six-axis color controls, it may make 
sense at this aggressive price point. For 
everyone else, we advise throwing a few 
more dollars at your display. –Jeremy laird

Let us waste no time and begin by 
addressing the elephant in the Logitech 
C922 room: its box-vaunted background 
replacement feature. This is meant to do a 
virtual chroma-key, and blot out everything 
but yourself, making this (in theory) a 
perfect cam for cost-conscious streamers. 
Using a piece of third-party software called 
Personify Chromacam, which appears as a 
virtual device in any webcam-compatible 
software, whatever happens to be behind 
you is indeed excised—but it’s done with 
the ferocity and finesse of an angry toddler 
carrying a chainsaw. 
Testing 
the 
feature 
on 
a 
busy 
background, Chromacam routinely hacked 
off our headphones, and the majority of 
our arms and shoulders, with strange, 
wobbling, wavy edges. Sitting stock still 
and giving it time to adjust just made the 
problem worse, because it then presumed 
we were part of the background. If you’re 
interested in holding video conversations 
looking like a digital ghost struggling to 
traverse the barrier between the human 
and spirit worlds, more power to you; the 
ironic thing is that, in order to get even 
mildly good results out of it, we needed 
to move to a spot with a neutral, plain 
background that contrasted with our 
clothes and skin. Isn’t that precisely what 
the feature is supposed to prevent you 
having to do? 
Background replacement isn’t this 
cam’s only automatic feature, though, and 
the rest of it is really rather good. Auto-
focus works very well, reacting quickly to 
distance changes in the central portion 
of the camera’s viewing area, though the 
edges, with no way to select a particular 
focus point, are less sensitive. There’s a 
massive focal range, so it captures you 
nice and sharp wherever you happen to 
be sitting. The camera’s automatic low-
light correction is also pretty good, a step 
above the integrated webcams we tested 
Cut out and weep
it against. Although, as is usual for digital 
sensors, there’s a notable increase in 
visual noise as the sensor has to work hard 
to fight the dark. This is an environmental 
feature more than anything, in that it’s 
helpful if you’re in an inconsistently lit 
locale—next to a window, for example—
but less so if you’re in an electric-lit room. 
Taking control manually using the bare-
bones settings panel, you get access to a 
limited set of exposure levels, so you won’t 
always find the perfect configuration. 
Stream dream?
There’s also panning, tilting, and zooming 
integrated into the driver—these aren’t 
physical functions, but they’re useful 
if you’re a little further away from the 
camera’s massive 78º field of view, and 
want to crop out your boyband posters 
and dirty laundry. With its maximum 
resolution of 1920x1080 at 30fps (and a far 
zippier 1280x720 60fps mode available) 
tied into some remarkably sharp H.264 
compression, the C922 gives you plenty of 
wiggle room, in most cases, to work with a 
smaller area of the image when streaming 
or holding conversations. Its integrated 
mic is, well, fine—not something we’d ever 
record with, and the usefulness of stereo 
mic functionality in a unit you’ll primarily 
use for Twitch or Skype is debatable. But 
adding an environmental mic to a desktop 
PC that lacks one, or upgrading that of a 
cheaper laptop, is a bonus. You’re not short 
of positioning options, with a desk tripod in 
the box, and a stiffly-engineered monitor 
hook that can be adapted to hang from 
the top of just about any screen, 
so it’s flexible enough for most 
potential setups.
The main issue with the 
C922 isn’t its failed chroma-key 
gimmick or slightly awkward 
settings panel, though. We’re utterly 
spoiled by the devices we have in our 
pockets, and while phone sensors are 
improving rapidly, the same can’t be said 
for the sensors we get to play with on the 
desktop. This is functional and sharp—
perfect, in fact, if you just want a webcam—
but it’s time for the tech, particularly at this 
price, to take the next step. –aLex cox

HyperX Has been doing some brilliant 
things in the enthusiast sector. Its RAM 
is super-fast, its storage solutions pretty 
much perfect, its keyboards clacky and 
colorful, and its headsets—particularly 
the Cloud II—market-leading examples 
of comfortable audio pleasure. The Cloud 
Stinger isn’t meant to sit in the same niche, 
though, coming in at literally half the 
price of its big brother. But you wouldn’t 
know it, at least initially, because this 
is a neat set of cans, well shaped, and 
sporting 
HyperX’s 
signature 
memory 
foam earcups. The headband is roomy 
and well cushioned, the metal adjustment 
arms stiff and unmoving, unless properly 
teased, and from them dangle 90-degree 
rotating earpieces, useful (we presume) 
if you happen to have a head designed by 
Pablo Picasso. Or if you want to place the 
Stinger flat on your desk. Put this super-
lightweight closed-cup headset on, and no 
matter how angular your skull may be, you 
will not be disappointed with the fit.
Closer inspection, however, reveals the 
greasy fingerprints of corners cut. The 
four-pole jack cable is a pathetic 4.2 feet 
long, although clicking it into the included 
dual three-pole adapter rounds the length 
up to a more reasonable 9.8 feet—if you’re 
stuck with a single audio port on your 
machine, be sure to pick up an extension.  
Give the faux-leather cup covers a light 
tug, and that silky cladding moves, and 
comes away slightly. It doesn’t appear to 
be attached particularly well to the body 
of the headset—it seems to be glued to the 
foam—and we could imagine it working 
its way loose after extended use. There’s 
discrete on-ear volume control, which is 
always a nice feature, but this slightly sticky 
slider isn’t exactly super-useful, jumping 
as it does between moderately quiet, 
mildly loud, and utterly tinnitus-inducing, 
with little to no nuance in between. Our 
Stinger also had an unpleasant quirk: Use 
the slider to drop the volume beyond a 
certain point, and the right ear audio drops 
Budget cans stripped 
to the bare essentials
out. This could be an isolated glitch, or it 
could be a common flaw.
Again, this is a headset that hits a 
highly reasonable price point. It’s not 
unreasonable to expect greatness from 
HyperX, but we would be churlish to judge 
the Stinger against its godly sibling when 
that’s not really its competition—if you 
have $100 to spend on a headset, there’s a 
world of hardware out there that is actively 
better than this. But if you have $50 to 
spend, the Stinger will quickly convince 
you to forget (or work around) those few 
flaws. Its 30 ohm 50mm directional drivers 
bang out a perfectly pleasant soundscape, 
which, while lacking a little warmth in the 
middle and vocal ranges, won’t leave you 
thinking you’ve underspent on sound. Bass 
noise, as is common with gamer-leaning 
headsets, is thick and boosted, though not 
to the point of rattling or distortion, and not 
so much that the treble end of the spectrum 
doesn’t crack through in a satisfying way. 
Noises off
The earcups do tend to be a little leaky 
as soon as you edge above mid-volume, 
and the high sensitivity of the condenser 
microphone makes it all too apparent 
when you’re listening to music while on 
a call or stream—noise canceling it may 
be, but extreme metal canceling it ain’t. 
Placed low toward the neck or higher 
toward the cheekbone, it’s a keen enough 
mic to capture clear conversation without 
any unpleasant breathing noises, and 
moving it to vertical mutes it by completely 
cutting the mic connection to your PC. 
Handy, although certain soundcards might 
not like this method.
So, HyperX has cut corners, but it’s cut 
them in the right places. The Cloud Stinger 
feels comfortable, it sounds pleasant, it 
has a pretty awesome mic, and it’s a fine 
starter headset. It’s fundamentally not as 
good as things that cost twice the price, but 
this is an argument we could make forever 
about everything. –aleX coX

We’re in agreement with Mionix when 
it comes to the mouse market: It’s 
stagnating. It's nothing more than a 
gently flowing stream, producing slightly 
different iterations of the same product 
each and every year. There’s no innovation. 
Nothing new, nothing truly interesting. 
Perhaps the mouse has reached its end 
goal. Perhaps there is nothing more to do 
but reiterate on the design. Mionix doesn’t 
think so. The Naos QG is the first mouse 
we’ve seen since the introduction of the 
laser sensor—which shifted away from the 
unwieldy ball—to truly rethink what you 
can do with the wily peripheral. Indeed, a 
heart rate sensor and GSR (galvanic skin 
response) sensor hardly seem like obvious 
additions, but the more you think about it, 
the more they make sense. 
Consider being able to track your heart 
rate while you’re using your computer, 
directly linking and synching programs 
up with it. Whether that’s for health 
reasons, or purely for entertainment, it’s 
an interesting concept. Link a game to a 
heart rate sensor, and you could have it 
react according to how you’re behaving. 
Take a horror title, for instance. Things 
becoming a little too intense? Knock it 
down a notch. Feeling calm? Send more 
jump scares. Obviously, that could become 
a little dangerous for the end user in terms 
of potential health issues….
The Naos QG comes loaded with these 
sensors: one IR-based heart rate sensor 
to the left-hand side of your right palm, 
and the GSR to your right. It’s certainly 
an experience—with an Overwolf overlay 
on screen, you can see your heartbeat 
displayed as you play or wander around 
your desktop. In game, it is somewhat 
unnerving to see how your body reacts. As 
your hairs stand on end due to the terrifying 
scenes held within each title, the mouse 
detects the changes, and vast spikes 
running along the outside of the edge of 
the overlay make it painfully apparent that 
you’re somewhat ruffled. Those watching 
Watch how you 
play, as you play
can immediately tell. And that brings 
us to who this was initially designed for: 
streamers and content creators. It adds 
another layer for the audience to view 
your reaction, another way for them to see 
how you respond in those often terrifying 
player experiences.
Nice mice?
That aside, this is still an ergonomically 
well-crafted tool. For right-handers only, 
unfortunately, the Naos supports your 
ring finger and pinky, nestling you into 
place naturally. It’s big—bulkier than the 
Castor—but still feels quick and agile 
enough to ping even the most graceful of 
headshots into the skull of your opponent’s 
avatar. The RGB lighting is there, of course, 
along with the other features you’d expect 
from any mouse, including adjustments to 
polling rates, DPI, and lift-off sensitivity. 
Alongside that, the Naos has a soft-touch 
rubberized gray finish, making it resistant 
to grease and sweat, while still providing 
you with an intriguingly different non-
black/white device—it’s a subtle color, 
almost looking as though it’s still in its 
initial concept phase.
Is it flawless? No, not on your life. The 
software is still in its infancy, and the heart 
rate sensor is jittery. Sometimes, you go 
from 70bpm to 150bpm, even while on 
desktop, with little to no explanation, even 
after removing your hand from the mouse. 
Other times, it registers your heart rate at 
40bpm. It’s not frequent enough to make 
it a particularly frustrating issue, and no 
doubt it’ll be something that’s ironed out 
in firmware and software updates, but it is 
still a concern.
Is this a good mouse? Yes, very much 
so. It’s currently targeted at a very niche 
audience, but as it is somewhat of an open 
standard, with a set of open APIs, it may 
very well be something that we see a lot 
more of going forward. And that’s no bad 
thing in our book. –zak storey

From a certain distance, mechanical 
keyboards all start to look the same. 
They’re generally matte black, have the 
same number of keys that are about 
the same size, and sit on the same 
switches. Everything has anti-ghosting 
and N-key rollover, so you can press more 
than one key at once, and not worry about 
keystrokes not registering. 
This means that you start to look 
at features, such as programmability, 
additional macro keys, and a board’s more 
general levels of usability—as well as 
its looks—to decide what to buy. There’s 
brand loyalty to consider, too, with a desk 
packed with Corsair products more likely 
to attract another.
Where does that leave a brand such as 
HyperX? A division of Kingston Technology, 
known for its memory products, HyperX 
has been around since 2002, and sponsors 
20 pro gaming teams. With manufacturers 
desperate to make you think that buying 
their product will transform you into a 
professional Counter-Strike player, a little 
pedigree goes a long way.
We 
mentioned 
looks 
earlier, 
and 
the Alloy delivers on that score. It’s a 
minimal keyboard, with a small footprint 
(something the promotional material plays 
up amusingly, suggesting this makes it 
ideal for FPS players, who presumably 
have smaller desks than those who prefer 
RTS), and a flat backboard with a steel 
frame underneath, upon which the keys 
stand proudly to attention, like a well-
regulated militia. From the right angle, 
they can appear to float above the base; 
black trees sprouting from blue trunks.
That’s right: blue. While the Cherry MX 
Red switch has become almost ubiquitous 
Minimal keyboard produces maximal noise
in recent mechanical keyboards, as the 
various manufacturers all strive to prove 
that their keys are the fastest to the floor 
in the kind of race to the bottom that’s led 
to many models feeling the same, HyperX 
has installed the Blue switch. The one that 
clicks. And, by the gods, it’s glorious. Using 
the Alloy at any speed sets up a fantastic 
racket, as each switch adds its own voice 
to the tumult. Maximum PC’s official 
review wife actually came to see what 
we were doing, intrigued by the noise we 
were making.
Blue genes
Every single key is mounted on a Blue 
switch, which means you get as much 
clicky feedback from Printscreen as you 
do from W. They also light up, and HyperX 
has taken the commendable decision to 
stick to one color—in this case, red. A 
little more care could have been taken in 
the positioning of the LED beneath the key, 
though (it’s just above the switch stem, 
in a little curved cutout, so HyperX has at 
least tried to mitigate the issue), because 
while the $ lights up nicely, the 4 beneath it 
is markedly dimmer. Most keys have their 
cutouts at the top of the cap, allowing the 
light to shine through in the optimum way, 
so it’s only on those with a double row of 
cutouts that this is noticeable. 
The lighting is controlled with the Fn key 
and the arrow keys—there’s no software 
for this keyboard, which also means no 
programmable buttons. What you do get 
in the box is a set of replacement keys for 
WASD, a key removal tool, a bag to keep 
the keyboard in at night, and the double-
headed USB cable that supplies extra 
power to the board for the phone charging 
port. This is certainly a nice addition, but 
why it couldn’t have been a full-fat USB 3 
port ready to stick a flash drive in, we just 
don’t know. 
HyperX has created something great 
here. The Alloy is fantastic to use, the 
steel frame adding weight to the base 
without taking up unnecessary space, and 
the Blue switches bringing the fun back 
to keyboards. The lighting is just enough, 
and while the lack of programmable keys 
grates a bit, there are enough media 
functions and other features—such as full 
anti-ghosting and rollover—to take the 
edge off our pain. –ian evenden

Case design has always been a challenging 
field for manufacturers to excel in. But 
that’s 
understandable—after 
all, 
the 
number of variables involved is vast. 
There’s material choice, build quality, 
internal layout, ease of access, included 
accessories, shape, size, price, and even 
logo and brand design. All of which affects 
how consumers view a case.
But, as more and more money is 
pumped into R&D labs across the case 
spectrum, the art has almost been 
perfected, to the point that innovating in 
this particular subsector of the industry 
has become unbelievably challenging. It’s 
not hard to find cases that look stunning for 
less than $100 now. Go back three or four 
years, however, and the chassis ecosystem 
was almost unrecognizable, with the only 
heavy-hitting top-sellers emanating from 
the foundries of Corsair and BitFenix.
So, here we are in 2017 with BitFenix’s 
latest Aurora chassis. This amalgamation 
of soft plastic, steel, and tempered glass 
certainly is eye-catching. The shape alone 
is enough to turn heads—not in a “wow!” 
kinda way, but more like that odd facial 
expression your dog gives you when you 
make a high-pitched whistle noise. The 
not-so-subtle curves cut out of the front 
and top exterior panels add a strange 
aesthetic to the tempered glass chassis, 
allowing plenty of airflow into the ventilated 
front panel, without being too obvious 
about it. There’s a subtle nod given to both 
the Prodigy and the Shinobi chassis that 
predate this aggressively designed case. 
Will it be to everyone’s fancy? Perhaps not, 
but the design does slowly grow on you.
The tempered glass panels, now 
commonplace in the industry, sit snug 
against the Aurora. The smoked side, which 
reveals all your internal components, cries 
out for solid internal lighting, while the 
rear panel is entirely blackened, retaining 
the look and feel of glass, without showing 
off the undoubtable mess of cables you 
have tucked away in the back.
That aside, the chassis as a whole 
follows BitFenix’s traditional aggressive 
modular design. Both of the 3.5-inch 
drive bays are entirely optional, with the 
upper cage mimicking a 5.25-inch cage, 
Time to get funky
easily removable with the release of four 
separate screws, one on each side, and 
two in the front. 
It’s a trap!
There’s no hint of a PSU cover just yet from 
the German manufacturer, but that’s not to 
say the Aurora is devoid of features. The 
two recessed radiator mounts located in 
the front and the roof of the chassis are 
neat little additions, adding a little extra 
room, and helping to show off your fans 
through the case window. The support for 
full E-ATX motherboards, coupled with 
three 2.5-inch bays, is nice as well. And we 
also have to mention the oddity of the front-
facing LED SSD mount. It's Asus Aura-
ready, so that if you want your SSD to light 
up the same color as your motherboard, 
you can do that…. Yeah.
All in all, it’s an intuitively designed 
chassis, coming in at a respectable $100. 
It’s not the most modern out there, nor 
does it offer the most features, but it’s 
well rounded and provides a solid base 
for any PC builder. It does have its flaws, 
however—we wish the soft-touch finish, 
often associated with BitFenix cases, had 
made its way to the Aurora, and that there 
was an integrated PSU cover. The design is 
also a little outlandish, but in an industry 
that’s struggling to define itself outside 
of six rectangular panels, we can easily 
understand that. –ZaK storey

Dishonored 2
Save a civilian from a guard, and he might  
go running for more soldiers, rather than 
spare a word of thanks. 
The new city of Karnaca deserves praise. 
The product of an on-team architect at 
Arkane, it offers a sunnier alternative to the 
smoky Dunwall, and shows off the abilities 
of the Void Engine, powered by idTech. 
Dishonored 2 is imaginative and beguiling

the man-with-gun homogeneity of modern 
games, and deserves to be celebrated as

verdict
You’re no match for several guards in a 
fair fight, so strike from the shadows.
a game with a distinctive art style is a 
rarity in these days of potato-faced motion 
capture, and Dishonored has always been 
so very distinctive. Snarling frowns and 
raddled complexions stare out at you from 
every NPC, while the architecture you 
scurry across is as much a part of the game 
as the thin faces of the main characters.
For this sequel, Arkane is offering a 
choice. You can have more of the same, 
in a game full of references to things that 
have gone before in the first title and its 
DLC. Choosing to play as returning royal 
protector Corvo opens this up, his suite of 
powers familiar, but now able to be upgraded 
beyond anything the previous game offered.  
A different way of playing is offered by 
Emily, Corvo’s daughter and a deposed 
empress, sculpted more for ranged combat 
and the manipulation of foes, eventually 
unlocking the powerful Domino ability that 
chains the fates of enemies together. Setting 
one on fire burns them all; an executioner 
can be linked to his victim, and lose his own 
head. Take that idea and have some cruel 
fun with it, especially if you then throw a 
doppelgänger of yourself, created with 
another of Emily’s abilities, into the mix. 
It’s playing as Emily that sees Dishonored 
2 come into its own. There’s only one path, 
no matter which character you choose, 
and entire ideas and ways of playing 
are dreamed up for one level only, then 
discarded to make way for something else. 
While Corvo can still ghost his way through 
as if he was never there, there’s something 
about his gruff delivery and heavy sword-
fighting that doesn’t sit right. Emily, able to 
stand off, observe, and affect happenings 
from a distance, is a better fit for the game.
Instead of differing missions, Dishonored 
2 offers differing ways to play. Stealth 
may be better rewarded, and feel like the 
“correct” approach, but slashing your way 
through is just as valid. You just might not 
get such an exultant ending.
The rules are not left unbroken, 
though. An entire sequence that runs  
on clockwork could be a metaphor for the 
game itself, as guards follow their patrol 
paths and you pull levers to transform it, if 
it weren’t for the way NPCs surprise you.

Call of Duty: Infinite Warfare
continue fighting even though your head is 
down. That the designers needed to make 
this concession is a bit of a criticism of 
COD’s style of warfighting—standing in the

what you want to do in order to be a hero. 
Your space carrier represents the best

This is you, Captain Reyes 
of the Retribution.
Earth’s fleet: not enough 
to protect it from attack.
Earth seen from your ship’s 
bridge. Stirring stuff.
Zero-G combat can 
be confusing.
For a while now, the campaigns in Call of 
Duty games have felt a little like training 
for the multiplayer. And with many players 
having decamped to Battlefield One, the 
developer needed to produce something 
distinct enough to tempt them back.
It has sort of succeeded. The outer space 
setting is certainly a contrast to Battlefield’s 
European fields, but it’s in single-player 
that Infinity Ward shows it has been paying 
attention to developments in other games. 
Infinite Warfare shares a few ideas with 
previous mainline COD games. The story 
sees a commander wrestling with the 
dichotomy of winning his battles for the 
greater good versus saving the lives of his 
men. In a universe that would find Black 
Ops’ robot limbs useful, we’re fully human, 
with just a suit and an oxygen supply to 
protect us from a horrid vacuum death. 
Because we’re in space, we can still wall-
run, however, and gravity can be switched 
on and off as the plot demands. One 
sequence sees you breach a spaceship’s 
windows from the outside, sucking all the 
air out and suffocating the crew. Another, 
as you fly a fighter ship between asteroids, 
gives a glimpse of a game that might have 
been, taking multiple routes, and destroying 
targets in an order you choose.
From the beginning, with a cloud-diving 
insertion that reminds us of MDK, you’re 
led by the nose through missions in which 
your AI companions wait for you to catch up, 
before allowing you the honour of landing 
the final shot, opening the door, or throwing 
the switch that leads to victory. There’s 
always plenty to look at, as things explode, 
topple, and spin into space. 
Infinity Ward has clearly been playing old 
PlayStation 2 games as well, as the whole 
setup is a little bit Killzone, with a lot of 
brown marines on gray backgrounds to deal 
with. Spotting the difference between a bad 
guy and a member of your squad would be 
tricky if your reticule didn’t snap to the right 
ones to shoot when you pull the trigger. 
This is handy, due to the amount of time 
you spend hunkered behind cover. Seeker 
grenades, gunship strikes, and hacking 
modules seem to have been designed 
around this restriction, allowing you to

AlAn Dexter, ExEcutivE Editor
A couple of months Ago, I mentioned that 
I was having problems activating Windows 
10 on one of my systems after I upgraded 
the CPU, motherboard, RAM, and graphics 
card. I was tempted to install Ubuntu, but as 
a last ditch effort (and on the advice of one of 
our calmer readers), I elected to get in touch 
with a Microsoft support engineer first. 
One option is to chat with the engineer 
using a messaging app, and that’s the one I 
went for. This turned out to be a good choice, 
because it allowed me to check off various 
activation codes without having to read out 
the 25-digit digits over the phone. It also 
meant he could check a few things using a 
remote desktop connection, to help confirm 
that I wasn’t trying to pull a fast one.
The guy I dealt with was calm, clear, and 
very helpful. And I did eventually end up with 
an activated copy of Windows 10, though it 
did take a long time due to the machine in 
question—a PC that can trace its origins 
back to a pre-built system from a now 
defunct system builder. Even though the 
engineer managed to sort me out in the end, 
the situation is still ridiculous. 
In order to activate the machine, I had 
to trawl through several Windows codes, 
some upgrades to existing operating 
systems, others less obvious, until I ended 
up with an old Windows 7 code I had emailed 
myself seven years ago. When I did copy and 
paste this across to the engineer, he initially 
said that it had already been upgraded 
to Windows 10 (which is obvious, given 
that’s what was running on the machine 
before the upgrade), but once he’d taken 
control of my machine, and sorted a few 
keys out, I was good to go. So am I now 
back on Microsoft’s side? Not quite. While 
I understand that Microsoft has to defend 
itself against pirates, having a system that 
tracks upgrades properly would have saved 
me many hours of effort. There was only 
ever one copy of Win 10 on that machine, and 
while it looks like it has the ability to keep 
track of that, the dots aren’t lining up yet. 
Come on Microsoft, you can do better than this!
Windows 10 Fun
When the Source 340 Elite 
chassis came in, I fell in love. I 
fell in love with its style, its class, 
and its elegant and sophisticated 
build features. And it got me 
thinking that perhaps it’s time 
I upgraded, and stepped away 
from the Manta. The fans were 
already annoying the crap out 
of me, but more frustrating was 
the screen situation. Allow me to 
clarify: At work, I have a 1080p 
iMac for what we call corporate 
work (I access the company 
servers on it), and then I have 
a custom-built ITX machine 
constructed from spares and 
leftover hardware for everything 
else. Connected to that are two 
27-inch 1440p 144Hz TN panels, 
which are beautifully smooth, 
and a joy to work on. At home, 
on the other hand, I have a 28-
inch 4K TN beast—however, it’s 
limited to 60Hz.
So, the concept of 4K gaming 
has started to grate on me. 
Although it’s entirely possible, 
the fact that I’m working on a 
144Hz screen and gaming on a 
60Hz panel in my spare time just 
isn’t making any sense. So I’m 
going to rotate the 4K out in favor 
of a 165Hz IPS variant instead. To 
do this, I’m going to combine the 
Source 340 with a whole new 
setup. I’ll be swapping out the 
cooling, the motherboard, and 
the storage, whilst also taking 
the opportunity to upgrade up to 
two GTX 1080s combined with an 
HB SLI bridge to really cement 
my spare-time experience. I’ll 
let you know how it goes.

I’m 
crazy 
about 
technology. Being in this 
job, I get to play with all 
the latest gadgets, often before they hit the 
market. I’ve seen a lot of really cool things 
over the years, but one of the craziest I’ve 
experienced recently is being able to watch 
Netflix or stream my Plex media off my NAS 
on to… wait for it… my printer.
Yes, the printer I have can browse the 
web, using Google Chrome, and watch 
movies with a native Plex app.
I’ve 
been 
playing 
with 
Samsung’s 
M5370LX, which is a multifunction laser 
printer that’s meant for handling office 
duties. It’s got an automatic document 
feeder to handle scanning jobs, and is very 
fast at spitting out full sheets of text and 
images at 55 pages per minute. But then 
it’s got a huge 10.1-inch touchscreen on it 
that allows me to install apps. So I installed 
Chrome and Plex. I tried watching House of 
Cards from Netflix, and it’s great. And Plex 
lets me stream my media from my NAS. The 
printer handles both with no issues.
It’s utterly absurd I know, but there’s 
something so cool about being able to watch 
a movie on your printer. Despite this being 
so cool, there’s one 
thing left I need to try: 
installing the original
Doom. Why? Because
people have gotten
Doom to run on their
graphing calculators,
and I’ll be damned if I
can’t play Doom on my
laser printer.

razer Ornata 
ChrOma
I’m a massive fan of 
mechanical keyboards. 
They feel good to type 
on and have a visceral 
effect on my cold fingers. So imagine my 
surprise when Razer sent me its membrane 
Ornata Chroma keyboard, pitching that it 
would feel just as good as the expensive 
mechanicals I’ve been using. No way, I said.
I was wrong. I’ve been using the Ornata 
Chroma in place of my Das Keyboard 4 with 
MX Blue switches for several weeks, and I’m 
addicted. But the Ornata isn’t a complete 
membrane keyboard, it has what Razer 
calls mecha-membrane. The switches have 
a metal nub above the membrane switch 
that clicks as you press down on the keys. An 
obvious solution, but the effect is profound.
Describing the feel is difficult. It’s not 
quite like the Cherry MX switches I’m used 
to, and it’s not quite like a membrane either. 
Think of the key travel as a clear mechanical 
snap, with the softer landing of a membrane.
At first, using the Ornata Chroma felt 
strange. I wasn’t sure I was going to like it. 
When I switched back to my Cherry MX Blue 
keyboard, however, I missed the Ornata’s 
feel. That’s when I knew it had me hooked. 
If you can, find one at a local store and try it 
out for yourself. I think Razer has a winner.

WE TACKLE TOUGH READER QUESTIONS ON...
Overclocking Options
I have an Asus ROG Maximus 
VIII Hero Alpha running a 
Core i7-6700K chip with XMP 
settings, and I’m trying to 
follow your overclocking 
article [Dec 2016 issue]. It 
says, “Input a slightly higher 
number multiplier.” I’ve 
looked all over AI Tweaker 
under “Advanced Mode,” and 
can’t see this “42” number, 
or where I can increase it 
to “44.” 
–Kerry Gifford
Reviews editoR Zak stoRey 
Responds: In AI Tweaker, 
look for the section that 
says “CPU Core Ratio,” 
and change it to “Sync All 
Cores.” Once selected, four 
more options appear below, 
three grayed out. The first 
says “1-Core Ratio Limit,” 
and in the box next to it, 
it should say “Auto.” This 
is where you can set the 
multiplier. Type “44” into 
the box, and it overrides the 
Auto, and sets the multiplier 
as 44. Then it’s just a case 
of working your way up, and 
changing the Core Voltage 
at the bottom of this screen, 
as stated in the article, and 
you’ll be on to a winner.
A quick heads up: I 
like to switch off “Asus 
MultiCore Enhancement” 
when I overclock. It’s 
great for additional stock 
performance, but at higher 
overclocks, it adds an 
element of instability, and 
tends to lead to (confusingly) 
lower overall performance, 
at least in our testing.
Battling Hardware
After I read your October 
2016 $699 VR PC issue, I 
started wondering how well 
the build would perform 
when playing Battlefield 4 
on high settings on a non-VR 
setup. Even though the 
FX-8320E has mediocre 
single-core performance, 
I’ve heard of tweaks where 
one can get BF4 to use up 
to six cores instead of one. 
So, is the RX 480 powerful 
enough to run BF4 on 
moderate/high at decent 
frame rates?  
–Charlie
Reviews editoR Zak 
stoRey Responds: We’ve 
dug into our archives and 
corroborated our results 
with colleagues, and the 
RX 480 should be powerful 
enough to run Battlefield 4 
on Ultra comfortably. Sadly, 
we only have Battlefield 
Hardline on our results 
tables, at an average frame 
rate of about 60fps at 1080p, 
with everything ramped up. 
That said, we predominantly 
benchmark on Intel Core i7 
processors as well, to 
maintain an even playing 
field, free of bottlenecks. 
So, I got in touch with our 
contact at AMD, just to 
triple-check, and he assures 
us that you should be able 
to get around 80fps in BF4 
on Ultra with the 8320E and 
an RX 480, based on the fact 
he’s getting about 70fps with 
an RX 470 and an FX 8300.
Hope that helps with your 
decision making.
Stealth Blocking
I have a question relating to 
ad blockers. It seems there’s 
a war between companies, 
like Facebook, and 
consumers who don’t want 
to see obtrusive ads. But 
why aren’t there any browser 
add-ons that load the site as 
normal, but don’t display the 
obnoxious ads? It could use 
the “reasonable ads” criteria 
to encourage advertisers to 
keep their ads unobtrusive, 
without hurting the websites 
in the process.
One might say this only 
moves the problem, except 
the advertisers, not the site 
owners, are the ones losing 
money for trying to display 
video ads and pop-ups. 
Do you know any practical 
reason why it wouldn’t work?
 
–Brendon Matusch
executive editoR alan 
dexteR Responds: There’s 
no obvious reason why 
this wouldn’t work, but I 
don’t think it’s really the 
answer we need, although 
it’s worth covering a couple 
of things first. One of the 
reasons for the popularity 
of ad blockers on mobile is 
that they save bandwidth, 
and your idea wouldn’t 
help that at all. On our PCs, 
that’s less of a problem, 
although not everyone has 
unlimited connections, so it 
could be an issue there, too. 
And if you’re downloading 
potentially malevolent 
adverts, they could still be 
a problem. 
There’s a bigger issue 
here: advertisers would 
believe their message is 
getting out there, but it 
wouldn’t be, so they’d drop 
advertising, which would 
lead to websites not being 
able to generate enough 
revenue to exist, and the 
standard web model would 
come crashing down. While 
shifting the problems to 
the advertisers and getting 
them to play fairly is a noble 
concept, at the moment the 
war seems to be getting 
worse, if anything, with 
advertisers trying to find 
ways to get around all ad 
blockers—something that

we feel isn’t going to end 
well, either. 
While a future where we 
have to pay to visit every 
website isn’t out of the 
question, it wouldn’t be my 
preferred choice. I feel the 
answer lies in whitelisting 
certain advertisers, but 
that only works if we buy 
from them, not just let them 
display their adverts. 
Cool Dream PC
I love when someone takes 
the time to document how 
they build their computers. 
It’s a personal side that’s 
rarely revealed. You put all 
the components together, 
showed some benchmarks, 
but missed the point of liquid 
cooling: Where are your 
temperatures? With all that 
work, tell us your lowest and 
highest temps at idle and at 
full load! Inquiring minds 
want to know.
 
–Peter Romano
Reviews editoR Zak stoRey 
Responds: I love a well-
documented build, too. The 
amount of time I’ve spent 
pondering other people’s 
build logs for inspiration is 
ridiculous. In fact, I did a lot 
of research on the In Win 
909 Owner’s Club before 
starting that build.
As far as temperatures 
go, we didn’t have enough 
space in the mag to include 
them in the traditional 
formats. At idle, the CPU 
loop, while overclocked to 
4.2GHz, was running at 36 C, 
which ramped up to 82 C 
under full load. Which is hot, 
but we also ran it passively 
cooled to a degree, so I was 
impressed all the same.
The GPU loop featuring 
the triple rad was far more 
impressive: At idle it settled 
in at 22 C, with the first card 
spiking up to 47 C under 
load, while the second card 
stayed at about 42 C. Pretty 
cool, I think you’ll agree.
We’ve already got big 
plans for next year’s Dream 
Machine, looking at a 
custom acrylic case, a more 
cooling-friendly design, and 
using copper tubing, but 
we’ll keep that between us.
Overprotection 
With so many apps available 
for “protection from the 
Internet,” what is enough, 
not-enough, or overkill? 
I use Norton Security 
Deluxe, SUPERAntiSpyware 
Professional, Malwarebytes 
Anti-Malware Home 
(Premium), Malwarebytes 
Anti-Exploit Premium, 
CCleaner Professional, 
Secunia PSI, and FileHippo 
App Manager.
 
–Jerry Franco, Jr.
senioR editoR JaRRed 
walton Responds: I’m of the 
mindset that less is more, 
and don’t use anything more 
than the built-in Microsoft 
stuff (Defender, Security 
Essentials, Firewall), and 
I keep Malwarebytes (free 
version) handy to scan for 
when things are off. I also 
know enough to do a lot 
of my own scanning and 
troubleshooting, though, 
and I don’t usually visit sites 
or download stuff that would 
cause problems. I surf with 
Chrome, and have uBlock 
Origin extension installed, 
and that has kept me safe. 
I haven’t had a virus in 
a decade or more. But my 
kids aren’t old enough to 
be doing sketchy stuff on 
the PCs, and I limit what 
they’re allowed to do. I have 
relatives whose teenagers 
seem to get a new infection 
every month! Malwarebytes 
remains one of the best 
solutions for helping remove 
garbage programs, though.
The reason I’ve stuck with 
Microsoft is that, for one, its 
stuff is free and integrated 
into the OS. Secondly, MS 
has a vested interest in not 
making your PC run slow. 
Defender isn’t perfect, but 
every time I’ve encountered 
a system with McAfee, 
Norton, or AVG installed, 
I swear those big security 
suites overtax everything 
but the most powerful PCs. 
On a midrange system, 
they can cause serious 
slowdowns. One thing you 
don’t want to do is have two 
of the same type of program 
running—two antivirus 
scanners, for instance. 
They’ll sometimes fight with 
each other, and if one such 
app can slow down your 
PC, two doing redundant 
checking is a sure-fire way 
to a poor user experience.
Straight In
I have been running an OCZ 
RevoDrive 3 for years, and 
have been very happy with 
its performance. But it has 
to boot the BIOS, then the 
SSD BIOS, then boot the OS. 
It takes much longer to boot 
to Windows than I’d like. Do 
new PCIe SSDs behave the 
same? Or do they boot right 
into Windows? –Sid Phillips 
executive editoR alan 
dexteR Responds: In many 
ways, the RevoDrive 3 was 
ahead of its time, and one of 
the downsides of that was 
a prolonged boot process. 
The good news is that 
modern motherboards are 
far quicker at getting you in 
your operating system. The 
bad news is that you’ll need 
a new mobo to get the most 
out of newer SSDs—M.2 
and NVMe drives that are 
natively supported by new 
motherboards don’t have 
any additional boot stages 
versus a SATA drive. Of 
course, this means you’ve 
probably got a complete 
new system build on your 
hands. If you’re looking at 
a new build, rest assured 
that modern drives can 
boot faster—20 seconds 
from a cold boot to being 
in Windows 10—otherwise, 
you could just get used to 
putting your PC to sleep, 
rather than turning it off.

If there’s one single feature 
PC hardware companies 
have beaten to a bloody pulp 
by now, it’s RGB lighting. 
Some purists argue that it’s 
an unnecessary gimmick, 
but others can’t help but 
be drawn to the appeal of 
having a 24/7 party on their 
desktop. Lucky for them, 
there’s also plenty of LED 
lighting options to bring the 
party to the PC, too.
Lighting up the interior 
of a PC is nothing new. Cold 
cathode light tubes, basic 
LED strips, and LED fans 
have been used to light up 
builds for well over a decade 
now. But with more and 
more users showing off the 
inside of their clean builds, 
it was only a matter of time 
before RGB hit the interior 
lighting space. We checked 
out a ton of available LED 
kits to find the best way 
for you to light up your

Another huge chAnge to the midrange this issue. We’re swapping out 
our NZXT Manta for the S340 Elite. NZXT’s hit the nail on the head with 
this ATX chassis, with the perfect balance of airflow and style. It’s a 
real treat, fantastic to build in, and allows us to expand our support 
from ITX motherboards all the way up to ATX. We also decided to drop 
EVGA’s SuperNOVA G2 650W 80 Plus Gold for something a little more 
classy. Corsair’s RM650X PSU comes with a lovely set of flat black 
cables, allowing you to make a tidy build with ease, and if you want, 
you can always sleeve these later, or buy a pre-braided kit. On top 
of that, we picked up a Gigabyte GA-Z170XP-SLI mobo, and swapped 
out the Gigabyte Windforce GTX 1070 for an EVGA SC Gaming ACX. 
We know there have been problems with memory on some of EVGA’s 
cards, but these have been resolved, and all cards out of the factory 
now come with the correct BIOS to ensure it doesn’t happen.
thAt’s one heck of A shAke-up to the budget build, huh? Four new 
components and a saving of $62, even including a slightly pricier 
chassis. The Thermaltake Core V1 wasn’t cutting it for us anymore, 
and we wanted a system that was a little easier to piece together 
than inside the claustrophobic confines of the Core. The Phanteks 
Enthoo Evolv ITX has a plethora of cooling options, room for large 
cards, and a compartmentalized design to improve ease of access. 
We also stepped down from the SuperNOVA 550W PSU in favor of 
EVGA’s 450B. At most, our system only draws 250W from the wall, 
so this still gives us plenty of headroom. On top of that, we also went 
from the ASRock H170M ITX mobo to the Gigabyte GA-H110N. Still 
supporting DDR4, and even including a hidden M.2 slot for future 
PCIe storage upgrades, it’s the perfect entry-level board for anyone 
looking to build their own system with future-proofing in mind.

We finAlly dropped the Intel 1.2TB PCIe SSD. It wasn’t quite quick 
enough for what we wanted to do anymore, and the form factor and 
additional PCIe slot were enough to put us off and head over to the 
Samsung side of flash memory. Samsung’s 1TB 960 Pro is around 
$200 cheaper, allowing us to drop a bit of cash elsewhere, and deal 
with the price hikes we’re seeing across the board. We also changed 
out the Asus X99-A II for MSI’s X99A SLI Plus. Although slightly 
more expensive, the A II has been bumped back up to $250, making 
the SLI Plus the better value option. MSI’s UEFI BIOS does need a 
bit of tweaking, but it’s a solid performer, and comes with plenty of 
expandability, including SLI support, alongside M.2, and a strong 
rear I/O solution. We swapped out the single 4TB Western Digital 
Black drive for two 2TB variants, too. Although not as cost-effective 
as the single 4TB, we can set these up as a mirrored RAID array, 
ensuring we’ve got extra redundancy for our work and mission-
critical files. Memory prices are continuing to creep up, so we’ve 
dropped the 32GB Corsair Vengeance LPX 2666 quad-channel kit 
for its slightly slower little brother, and even that is pricier than the 
$168 we reported last issue. Other changes remain subtle. We saw 
the price of the case and the graphics card increase, and have done 
our best to balance those, swapping out the EVGA GPU for an MSI 
iteration instead, yet we’ve still managed an overall saving of $140. 
“I’m giving her all she’s got, Cap’n!” There’s no such thing as 
too much speed, and this is definitely the case with storage—a 
fast SSD makes for one of the most, if not the most, notable 
differences you’ll see on a workstation. Improving file copy and 
transfer times has a phenomenal effect on your working life. 
Samsung’s 960 Pro series of M.2 drives provides a fantastic 
solution to anyone harboring an M.2 slot on their motherboard, 
and coming in capacities all the way up to 2TB, you’ll be more 
than satisfied with the blistering performance and, relatively 
speaking, fantastic value for money.
