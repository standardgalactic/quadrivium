Title -   Engineering Thermodynamics - Solutions Manual
Author – Prof. T.T. Al-Shemmerii
Thermodynamics is an essential subject in the study of the behaviour of gases and vapours in real 
engineering applications.
This book is a complimentary follow up for the book “Engineering Thermodynamics” also published on 
BOOKBOON, presenting the solutions to tutorial problems, to help students to check if their solutions 
are correct; and if not, to show how they went wrong, and change it to get the correct answers.
This solutions manual is a small book containing the full solution to all tutorial problems given in the 
original book which were grouped in chapter four, hence the sections of this addendum book follows 
the format of the textbook, and it is laid out in three sections as follows:
4.1 First Law of Thermodynamics N.F.E.E Applications
In this section there are 6 tutorial problems 
4.2 First Law of Thermodynamics S.F.E.E Applications
In this section there are 5 tutorial problems
4.3 General Thermodynamics Systems
In this section there are 15 tutorial problems

First Law of Thermodynamics N.F.E.E Applications
4.1	First Law of Thermodynamics 
N.F.E.E Applications
1.	
In a non-flow process there is heat transfer loss of 1055 kJ and an internal energy increase of 210 
kJ. Determine the work transfer and state whether the process is an expansion or compression.
[Ans: -1265 kJ, compression]
Solution:
Closed system for which the first law of Thermodynamics applies,
Q - W = DU
1055 – W = 210
Hence the work done can be found as:
W = -1265 kJ
Since negative, it must be work input, ie compression.
2.	
In a non-flow process carried out on 5.4 kg of a substance, there was a specific internal energy 
decrease of 50 kJ/kg and a work transfer from the substance of 85 kJ/kg. Determine the heat 
transfer and state whether it is gain or loss.
[Ans: 189 kJ, gain]
Solution:
Closed system for which the first law of Thermodynamics applies,
Q - W = DU
Q 	
= DU + W 
	
= 5.4x (-50) +5.4 x 85 
	
= + 189 kJ,
Since Q is positive, it implies heat is entering the control volume, ie Gain.

During the working stroke of an engine the heat transferred out of the system was 150 kJ/kg 
of the working substance. If the work done by the engine is 250 kJ/kg, determine the change in 
internal energy and state whether it is decrease or increase.
[Ans: -400 kJ/kg, decrease]
Solution:
Closed system for which the first law of Thermodynamics applies,
Q - W = DU
Hence
DU 	
= Q – W
	
= (-150) – 250
	
= -400 kJ/kg
Since the sign is negative, there is a decrease in internal energy. 
4.	
Steam enters a cylinder fitted with a piston at a pressure of 20 MN/m2 and a temperature of 500 
deg C. The steam expands to a pressure of 200 kN/m2 and a temperature of 200 deg C. During 
the expansion there is a net heat loss from the steam through the walls of the cylinder and piston 
of 120 kJ/kg. Determine the displacement work done by one kg of steam during this expansion.
[Ans: 168.6 kJ/kg]
Solution:
State 1
at 20 MPa, 500 C: u = 2942.9 kJ/kg 
State 2
at 200 kPa, 200C: u = 2654.4 kJ/kg
Closed system for which the first law of Thermodynamics applies,
Q - W = DU
Rearranging to determine the work done:
W = Q - DU = (-120) – (2654.4 -2942.9) = 168.5 kJ/kg

the pressure to 1.0 bar. Also determine the change in enthalpy and entropy per unit mass of the

A boiler is designed to work at 14 bar and evaporate 8 kg/s of water. The inlet water to the 
boiler has a temperature of 40 deg C and at exit the steam is 0.95 dry. The flow velocity at inlet 
is 10 m/s and at exit 5 m/s and the exit is 5 m above the elevation at entrance. Determine the 
quantity of heat required. What is the significance of changes in kinetic and potential energy

W =0 (since constant pressure process),
ignoring Dke and DPe: the SFEE reduces to

State 1- h1 is hf at T=40C, closest to this is Ts=45, h1=191.83 kJ/kg

h2=830.30+0.95x1959.7 = 2692 kJ/kg

Steam flows along a horizontal duct. At one point in the duct the pressure of the steam is 1 bar 
and the temperature is 400°C. At a second point, some distance from the first, the pressure is 1.5

Find enthalpy values at 1 and 2:
State 1- 1.0 bar and the temperature is 400°C, hence h1= 3263.9 kJ/kg
State 2- 1.5 bar and the temperature is 500°C, h2 = 3473 kJ/kg
Hence	 	
(h2 - h1) = 3473 -3263.9 = 209.1 kJ/kg
Since this is positive, then V1 >V2, ie decelerating

A rotary air compressor takes in air (which may be treated as a perfect gas) at a pressure of 
1 bar and a temperature of 20°C and compresses it adiabatically to a pressure of 6 bar. The 
isentropic efficiency of the processes is 0.85 and changes in kinetic and potential energy may 
be neglected. Calculate the specific entropy change of the air. Take R = 0.287 kJ/kg K and 
Cp = 1.006 kJ/kg K.
[Ans: 0.07 kJ/kg K]
Solution:
Closed system for which the first law of Thermodynamics applies,
dQ - dW = DU
dQ = T.dS;	
dW= -pdV;	
Cv = du/dT, 	
Hence
Tds – pdV = Cv.dT
dS = (P/T)dV + Cv(dT/T)
integrating
(S2-S1)=R ln(V2/V1) +Cv ln(T2/T1)
For isentropic process
V2/V1=(P1/P2)^1/n
T2/T1=(P2/P1)^(n-1)/n
Hence
S2-S1 = R ln(P1/P2)^1/n +Cv ln(T2/T1)
T2s = T2 (P2/P1)^(1-n)/n =488.5 K
T2 = T1 + (T2s-T1)/effc = 293+ (488.5-293)/0.85 = 523 K
S2-S1 = R ln(P1/P2)^1/n +Cv ln(T2/T1) 
S2-S1 =0.287xln(1/6)^(1/1.4) + (1.006-0.287) ln(523/293)
= -0.3673 + 0.4166
= 0.05 kJ/kgK 
Very small quantity, note that if the process is 100% isentropic, the change in entropy would be zero.

A steam turbine inlet state is given by 6 MPa and 500°C. The outlet pressure is 10 kPa. Determine 
the work output per unit mass if the process:-
a)	 is reversible and adiabatic (ie 100% isentropic),
b)	 such that the outlet condition is just dry saturated,
c)	 such that the outlet condition is 90% dry.
[Ans: 1242.7 kJ/kg, 837.5 kJ/kg, 1076.8 kJ/kg]
Solution:
a)	 when 100% isentropic
h1 = 3422.2 kJ/kg, S1=6.8803 kJ/kgK
S2’ = s1 and x2’ is found using
Then	
6.8803 = 0.6493 + x2’ (7.5009), from which x2’ = 0.8307
Thus	
h2 = hf + x hfg 	
 = 191.83 + 0.8307 x 2392.87 = 2179.6 kJ/kg
Hence
W = h1 – h2 = 3422.2 – 2179.6 = 1242.6 kJ/kg
b)	 if x=1, 
h2 = 2584.7 kJ/kg
W = h1 – h2 = 3422.2 – 2584.7= 837.5 kJ/kg
c)	 if x=0.9
h2 = hf + x hfg 	
 = 191.83 + 0.9 x 2392.87 = 2345.4 kJ/kg
Hence
W = h1 – h2 = 3422.2 – 2345.4 = 1076.8 kJ/kg

A boiler receives feed water at 20 kPa as saturated liquid and delivers steam at 2 MPa and 500oC. 
If the furnace of this boiler is oil fired, the calorific value of oil being 42000 kJ/kg; determine the 
efficiency of the combustion when 4.2 tonnes of oil was required to process 42000 kg of steam.
[Ans: 76%]
Solution:
a)	 Constant pressure process.
h1 = hf@20 kPa = 251.40 kJ/kg
h2­ = 3467.6 kJ/kg
SFEE ignoring W, Dke and DPe:
Qs	
= ms (h­2 - h1)	
= 42000 (3467.6 – 251.4)	
= 135 x 106 kJ 
b)	 The heat generated by burning oil in the furnace is
= mass of oil burned x calorific value 
= 4200 x 42000 = 176 x 106 kJ

10 kg/s steam at 6 MPa and 500oC expands isentropically in a turbine to a pressure of 100 kPa. 
If the heat transfer from the casing to surroundings represents 1 per cent of the overall change 
of enthalpy of the steam, calculate the power output of the turbine. Assume exit is 5 m above 
entry and that initial velocity of steam is 100 m/s whereas exit velocity is 10 m/s.
[Ans: 9 MW]
Solution:
At 6 MPa, 500 oC 
h1 = 3422.2 kJ/kg
s1­ = 6.8803 kJ/kgK
at 100 kPa, 
sf = 1.303, sfg = 6.056 kJ/kgK
hf­ = 417, hfg = 2258 kJ/kg
