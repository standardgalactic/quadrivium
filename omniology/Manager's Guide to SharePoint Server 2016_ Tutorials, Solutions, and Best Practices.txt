Introduction
Over the last few decades, it has become an ever-increasing task to manage 
the mountains of structured and unstructured data required to run today’s 
businesses. Content management systems (CMS) are the tools of choice 
to help businesses get their content under control. However, as firms have 
different claims on CMS, depending on the type of information the firm has to 
deal with, the type of use, and the type of provision, different available CMS are 
available that usually focus more or less on different tasks. For example, some 
CMS focus on managing and publishing content for the web, known as web 
content management systems (WCMS). Other systems, known as document 
management systems (DMS), are not concerned with publishing on the web 
but are specialized for structuring paper-based content within an intranet, 
and other CMS focus on administrating digital non-paper-based documents, 
known as digital asset management systems (DAMS). Other CMS, referred to 
as electronic records management systems (ERMS), manage business records. 
And, in addition, CMS exist that focus on all the previously mentioned tasks 
within a single system, known as enterprise content management systems 
(ECMS). Such systems do not follow a single methodology or idea but have 
the ability to support enterprises in a holistic manner, namely as a system to 
depict the strategic and dynamic process inside enterprises.
The CMS Microsoft SharePoint Server (usually abbreviated as SharePoint) 
focused, with its first releases in 2001 and 2003, on managing documents inside 
a collaborative environment. However, since the release in 2007, it became a 
true ECMS, with permanent development and improvements coming with the 
subsequent releases in 2010, 2013, and 2016. Despite these, however, at the 
management level, the opportunities as well as limits of SharePoint are often 
unknown, as a concrete use case of the available features and functionalities

is missing. In addition, daily users with or without computer affinity are often 
overwhelmed by the complexity of this all-around solution, as the palette of 
functionalities and possibilities is too extensive. For example, the provided 
site  collection templates include overlapping functionalities that make the 
right choice challenging. The same holds true for the different site collection 
templates included with applications. In addition, the customizing of SharePoint 
is often error-prone and time-consuming, as the inheritance of diverse 
settings is unknown, or the activation of settings that are required to allow 
customization is missing. In the end, this leads to dissatisfaction and, in the 
worst case, results in a rejection of the system on two fronts. First, managers 
who have decided to use SharePoint reject the system, as they do not see its 
benefits. Second, end users who must employ the system daily are dissatisfied, 
as the ECMS does not simplify their jobs if the possibilities and limits are 
unknown, or the system is not in a shape to effectively support daily tasks.
To overcome these challenges, this book provides a hands-on introduction to 
this leading ECMS. As such, it explains SharePoint—more precisely, its most 
recent release, Microsoft SharePoint Server 2016—from the perspective 
of how it can concretely help enterprises in specific, but also general, use 
cases. In addition, it details, with more focus on management and strategic 
development, how to impart the possibilities of SharePoint to users, instead 
of focusing on users with programming skills, as provided in the very 
comprehensive books introduced by Tony Smith1 and Olga M. Londer.2 With 
the help of understandable tutorials, best practices, and solutions, this book 
provides transparency regarding what is available but, in turn, the most fitting 
technologies for a specific business goal, such as managing content for the 
web, structuring documents, administrating records, and managing assets. 
Moreover, the different chapters include guidelines for overlapping tasks, such 
as project management, improving collaboration, managing metadata, access 
level, etc. With this in mind, the book focuses on four types of practitioners 
and scholars across domains, as follows:
• 
Managers/Consultants, who decide which CMS will be 
used to increase the manageability of content in small, 
medium, and large enterprises. After reading this book, 
managers and consultants will be able to understand 
how and where SharePoint can help improve companies’ 
success.

• 
Final users, who use SharePoint for daily business, 
e.g., users who work together on projects or those 
who are responsible for editing content. With the help 
of this book, users of SharePoint will be able to better 
understand what to do within SharePoint and how to 
more effectively deal with this ECMS.
• 
Site administrators, who are responsible to customize 
SharePoint to improve usability and user experience. 
This type of audience will be able to understand the core 
elements and applications inside and outside SharePoint 
used for customizing, and how to improve the sites’ 
functionalities, as well as functionalities of the included 
applications, libraries, pages, web/template parts, etc.
• 
Scholars/Students, who teach or study the basics of 
CMS in undergraduate and postgraduate courses with a 
focus on applied science. Teachers will be able to better 
explain the use of SharePoint as a collaboration and 
management platform and, consequently, students will be 
able to more quickly understand what a CMS provides.
The remainder of the book is organized as follows. In this chapter, an 
introduction to CMS is given. The scope of CMS is detailed and the differences 
between the various types of CMS are explained. This includes the differences 
from a functional perspective (DMS, WCMS, DAMS, ERMS, and ECMS) but also 
from a license perspective (proprietary vs. open source), as well as from an 
operative perspective (on-premise vs. cloud computing). The second chapter 
elaborates ECMS SharePoint by giving details about its basic technology and 
the features and ideas of the provided templates (site collection, applications). 
Hands-on tutorials are presented in the third chapter, in which the underlying 
technology and templates to be used are covered in detail. These tutorials are 
divided into different use cases having different level of complexity. Through 
this, use cases for end users, but also use cases for site or site collection 
administrators are included. Best practice scenarios are presented in the 
fourth chapter. These include case studies, governance, and tools to improve 
the usability, manageability, and the look and feel of SharePoint. Solutions for 
the hands-on tutorials are presented in the fifth chapter. In the sixth chapter, 
the book finally concludes.

Content Management Systems
Content management is the process of preparing and processing information, 
whereby a content management system is a software application to support its 
collaborative management.3 CMS are used in business to manage documents, 
simplify web content publishing, enable business transaction traceability, and 
provide libraries for managing digital assets. First, this chapter presents CMS 
from a logical perspective. Afterward, the differences between the various 
functions of different types of CMS are explained.
Logical Components of Content Management Systems
To manage a huge amount of content, each CMS is divided into two logical 
components: a management processes component on the one side, and a 
system processes component on the other side (see Figure 1-1).

The management process component is required to manage the various rights 
of users and to process workflows from a strategic perspective. It manages 
the different levels of accessibility and the necessary workflows to manage the 
information according to the enterprise’s needs. It utilizes two sub components:
• 
Rights management is used to structure the 
different types of users into different groups, called 
user management. The various user groups are assigned 
different levels of access, which control authentication 
and content-based access.
• 
Workflow management is utilized to standardize and 
automatize the processes inside the system processes but 
also the processes between the three different system 
processes.
A system process component is needed to treat the CMS tasks from an 
operational level, that is, to enable the information management processes. 
This includes the capturing and management of information, the storage of 
information to preserve content, and, finally, publication of the information. 
The process-oriented view is divided into three areas:4
• 
Editing system allows content and data to be edited 
inline. This means that the editing is done inside the 
CMS, without the use of another application on another 
machine (personal computer, virtual machine, server, 
etc.). For example, the editing and formatting of a text or 
table can be done without using a further text editor or 
a separate spreadsheet program.
• 
Repository system allows for storage of the captured 
content. To improve the ability to search information, 
two different semantic techniques are used: taxonomy 
and folksonomy. Taxonomy uses hierarchically ordered 
concepts (also known as terms) to model a domain in a 
formal way.5 Such types of metadata have their merits for 
navigation and for exploring similar items.6 For storing 
page-based documents, for example, taxonomy is used to 
issue the scope of the documents, whereby tags are used 
to better describe the content of a document. Folksonomy 
can model a field of interest in an informal way, using

keywords (often referred to as tags). This type of semantic 
structure allows keyword-based search, as it is used to 
index the search engine.7 Tags are a quick means of finding 
specific information. While concepts are generally created 
by experts, tags can usually be created by any user.
• 
Publishing system makes it possible to publish (deliver) 
stored information. Again, the type of content distinguishes 
how publishing is performed. For example, the publishing of 
information can be done via the Internet, to make it available 
to anonymous users, inside an intranet, to be available only 
to known users, or published by another system.
Finding Information
The management of large amount of data has caused a paradigm change in 
how we access information. The focus of structuring information has changed 
to finding information based on formal and informal structured data. Finding 
information involves the following processes:
• 
Crawling process is a regularly performed process 
ensuring that the queries to be executed can always rely 
on the relevant data. Therefore, it is necessary to clarify 
a crawling schedule, which defines the resources and 
content types that must be crawled, and, of course, how 
often the crawling is to be performed. Depending on the 
amount of data, this process is usually performed hourly, 
daily, or weekly.
• 
Indexing process collects data that has been crawled. 
Its aim is to organize the crawled data in a structured 
(indexed) manner. This has the benefit of allowing search 
queries to be performed in an efficient manner.
• 
Querying process is the last of the search queries 
performed by the user. This process uses indexed items 
to ultimately show to the user the items satisfying a query.
• 
Raking process sorts the detected results, depending 
on the extent to which the single detected items overlap 
with the performed query. It is also known as relevance. 
Usually, the more that keywords overlap with the query 
and the resulted item, the higher the relevance, and the 
higher it is ranked.

Search Experience
Today, a good search experience is crucial for information management, 
in addition to providing intuitive navigation. This is because the amount of 
data is increasing rapidly, but the huge amount of information stored on the 
internet is mainly distributed over only a few platforms, such as Google, 
Facebook, YouTube, and Yahoo, which increased rapidly in importance over 
the last years.8 Because of this, different approaches have been developed for 
optimizing search, i.e., on-page and off-page optimization.
Figure 1-2. Techniques for finding products on Amazon
To allow a good search experience, the underlying search engines must 
consider different types of search result representation (e.g., images, products), 
handle different types of data (e.g., text, figures, metadata), interpret the search 
query, recognize how results should be ordered, and should allow additional 
techniques for filtering in detail. The leading retailing firms provide search-driven 
applications that satisfy the previously mentioned criteria. This means that the 
focus is strongly on finding products by using the search slot. In turn, the search 
slot must interact in an intelligent manner, and other metadata-driven search 
techniques must be supported, depending on the query performed inside the 
slot. The leading retailing firm Amazon, for example, is providing all state-of-
the-art techniques for helping customers to find the desired products with a 
search-driven application, summarized in Figure 1-2:
8The Internet Map, http://internet-map.net/, accessed June 1, 2017.

Chapter 1 | Introduction

• 
Intelligent Search (Slot) can suggest products. If a 
customer begins to write a phrase, the search engine 
can automatically suggest products by automatically 
completing that phrase. In addition, the intelligent search 
slot can tolerate phrases that include spelling errors, 
compare synonyms, and handle phrases typed in upper 
or lower case.
• 
Search Statistics show the customer how many 
relevant products are found, based on the performed 
search query.
• 
Relevance Refiner lets the customer sort the resulted 
products in different ways. For example, the results can 
be sorted by: best results, popularity, price, or novelty.
• 
Top Search Results and Search Results finally show 
the products found. The previously mentioned results are 
included at the top of the list, whereas other results are 
presented below. Usually, a fee must be paid to be a top 
result.
• 
Dynamic Taxonomies and Faceted Search provide 
a customer the opportunity to strictly refine search 
results. Therefore, products that are part of a specific 
subcategory can be filtered (by dynamic taxonomy), or 
products satisfying a specific metadata tag can be filtered 
(by faceted search).
Besides the above-mentioned techniques, the ability to handle language is the 
most crucial element of search engines. The reason is that typing phrases into 
the search slot can cause many problems. The biggest problem is that some 
phrases have the same meaning, known as synonyms. For example, the words 
watch and clock can be considered synonyms. Because of this, the search engine 
must be able to recognize if a phrase is a synonym of another phrase and show 
both results. In contrast, phrases exist that have an opposite meaning. These 
are known as homonyms. For example, the word ice has multiple meanings. 
The search engine must also have the right level of tolerance, meaning that 
it must accommodate both the users employing specialist terms to filter for 
products, as well as others using very general phrases. Also, users employing 
negating terms must also be considered. In addition, the search engine must 
be able to apply root words and handle abbreviations.

Navigation
Navigation on a web site includes control elements and links to help users 
navigate through the information management system (content management 
system, e-commerce system, enterprise resource planning, etc.) and, ultimately, 
to simplify the user’s orientation.
Metadata Techniques
Traditionally, using folders (e.g., inside file directories) has supported the 
structuring of information inside information management systems, such 
as documents inside DMS. Therefore, the folders are used to simulate a 
hierarchical order of the data. These orders are classified by a name that is 
defined by a nomenclature or, informally, without any rules. In addition, some 
information (metadata) is assigned to these folders, such as the date of creation, 
the date of the last modification, or the size of the included documents. The 
technique of using folders provides a clear structure, as well as a good control 
over the documents. However, storage is too inflexible for most use cases. It 
is not intuitive, and, of course, users have to perform many clicks to reach the 
desired information. A much quicker way of finding the desired information is 
provided by using filters. As the information management systems provide lists 
to collect data, e.g., documents, filters can be created, depending on specific 
information, for different users, for sorting, etc. This allows more intuitive 
structuring of data, based on the information included and, ultimately, reduces 
the time to find the desired information. However, for effective filtering, data 
must have the correct information (e.g., realized with using a nomenclature). 
Creating the wrong filters is misleading, and filters must be used correctly. To 
automatically provide predefined filters, another technique, called views, is 
used inside information management systems. Such views can rely on existing 
filters and provide for single use cases, or single users, exactly the information 
required. However, with this, other drawbacks exist. First, only predefined 
views can be used, and unless a user is an administrator, further filtering is 
usually not supported, and becomes complicated. Often, many useless views 
may have been created, and data has to be stored correctly to use the views 
effectively.
As information management platforms are now more diverse and fragmented 
than ever before, presenting users an overload of information across 
different platforms and channels (social media, e-commerce, forums, content 
management, etc.), the aforementioned techniques are no longer sufficient. 
To overcome this information overload, to support an intuitive structuring 
of the information, and to finally help people find the desired information, 
two metadata techniques are provided in current information management 
systems: taxonomy and folksonomy. On the one hand, the lightweight method, 

Chapter 1 | Introduction
10
folksonomy, is applied in the form of informal keywords to data, products, 
blogs, conversations, reviews, etc. This technique has enjoyed high acceptance 
by users, as they can define their own tags, the handling is intuitive, and the 
realization is quick. However, as there are no restrictions for creating tags, the 
folksonomies contain semantic ambiguities and synonyms. On the other hand, 
the formal method, taxonomy, uses hierarchically ordered concepts. Taxonomy 
can be created by going from the most general to the most specific concepts, 
or vice versa. In addition, the concepts of the taxonomy can be classified 
according to the process being considered, the organizational structure, or 
by using a standard taxonomy. Such a metadata-driven technique has evident 
advantages to facilitate users’ navigation through large data corpuses. As the 
concepts are formally controlled, the structure is consistent, and the concepts 
are semantically rich. However, as the taxonomy is usually created by experts 
who know the domain of interest in detail, this technique is often lacking 
in user acceptance. The reason is that for some users, it is not intuitive, as 
every user has other ways to structure a domain, but each user is offered the 
identical, inflexible taxonomy.
As both metadata techniques have their own benefits and drawbacks, both are 
combined in practice. On the one hand, taxonomy ensures that each document 
is assigned the formally correct concept. Because of this, it is important that 
the taxonomy be not too fine-grained, to have a clear differentiation between 
concepts. On the other hand, folksonomy ensures that finding the desired 
information is intuitive. So, in the end, each item (document, data, etc.) should 
be assigned with a formal concept defining the general area of the item and 
informal tags giving more detailed information about the item.
Workflows
With the help of workflows, enterprises can ensure consistent business 
processes. In addition, as workflows perform fully or semiautomatically, 
enterprises can automatize and standardize specific tasks for improving 
operational effectiveness and productivity. For users, workflows allow focusing 
on the actual required tasks. In practice, workflows are used inside CMS for 
editing documents, managing tasks, or creating and approving pages to be 
published on the web.
From a technical perspective, workflows can be considered a stringing together 
of single tasks or events, whereby each task results in a single result. Two 
types of workflows can be distinguished. For realizing linear procedures having 
no loops, sequential workflows exist. Each task is followed by another, wherein 
the former task cannot be repeated. For realizing more complex workflows, 
so-called state-machine workflows exist. By this, loops between tasks can be 
considered, as well as relationships between tasks. No matter which type of 
workflow is used, each workflow consists of the following three main phases:

Manager’s Guide to SharePoint Server 2016
11
• 
Association is the first phase to be performed. This 
assigns a workflow to a specific object, e.g., an item inside 
a list, a document inside a library, a page to be approved, 
etc.
• 
Initiation is the second phase. Here, the workflow 
is started. This can be performed manually or in an 
automatic manner, e.g., if a new item is created or an item 
is modified.
• 
Execution is the third and final phase. This means that 
the different tasks/steps of the workflow are performed, 
e.g., sending an e-mail, collecting feedback, giving a new 
status to an item, etc.
Types of Content Management Systems
During the last decades, different types of CMS have been manufactured 
according to the technical progress achieved and, associated with it, the 
different requirements of varying business cases and sectors. All technically 
different CMS use the same previously mentioned system and management 
processes but vary in their ability to capture information, store content, 
manage the processes, preserve information, and publish content on different 
channels and devices. The following four types of CMS are distinct: document 
management systems (DMS), web content management systems (WCMS), 
digital asset management systems (DAM), and electronic records management 
systems (ERMS). Combining the single types lead to a fifth type: the enterprise 
content management system (ECMS).
Document Management Systems
DMS help firms to capture, store, and manage (track) paper-based content 
and preserve documents.9 For example, documents stored in the closed 
Portable Document Format (PDF), slides stored as editable PowerPoint files, 
or editable text documents stored as Word files can be effectively managed 
inside a DMS, including sharing, approval, editing, etc.
The main purpose of a DMS is to support the collaborative creation of 
documents and their structured storage. Within workflow management, 
the business processes to create, store, preserve, and share documents are 
considered. For example, the preparation/writing of the document, e.g., a user 
manual, is considered the first step. The document’s approval or rejection by 
9Association for Information and Image Management (AIIM), “ADDIN ZOTERO_ITEM 
CSL_CITATION {“c”A www.aiim.org/What-Is-Document-Imaging#, 2017.

Chapter 1 | Introduction
12
a coeditor can be considered a second step. If the document is approved, the 
proofreading is performed as a third step, before the document is approved 
by the sponsoring editor, published, and, ultimately, preserved. Within rights 
management, the type of contribution to the document is considered. In our 
example, the author and proofreader are eligible to write and edit the user 
manual but cannot approve/reject it and, of course, cannot share it with the 
printing company. Conversely, the coeditor can approve/reject the document, 
leave comments to the author if the document is rejected, and send the 
document to the printing company, if it is approved, but she/he cannot write 
the document or make changes. To allow such scenarios, the DMS must 
include the following techniques10:
• 
Check-in/check-out allows simultaneous editing, as 
well as coauthoring.11 Check in of a document means 
that the file is uploaded into the DMS. The document is 
asserted with metadata, such as the date of creation, date 
of last edit, author, number of pages, etc. To check out a 
document means that the file still exists inside the DMS 
but cannot be edited. The reason is that another person 
has recently edited it. However, after editing, this person 
will again check in the document. For example, after the 
author corrects the document according to the feedback 
of the proofreader, the document will be checked out.
• 
Versioning and annotating enables control of the 
differences between single versions of the document 
and the document life cycle. After every change to the 
document, a new version is created. The versioning 
process usually distinguishes between two types of 
versions. Major versions indicate comprehensive changes 
to the document; minor versions indicate small changes 
to the document. For example, to distinguish between 
draft versions, minor versions are created. Conversely, to 
differentiate between approved versions, major versions 
are created. To always be able to come back to the prior 
version, the DMS also utilizes what is known as the roll-
back feature. Annotating allows for leaving comments 
to each version of the document, e.g., to communicate 
required changes.

• 
Audit trail enables users to control which person has 
contributed what to the document, for example, to 
determine why a document was processed incorrectly or 
who has accessed the file.
• 
Automatic tagging means that the document is 
automatically assigned with related metadata—the tags. 
Through this, the user does not have to create the tags 
manually, as they are automatically retrieved, based on the 
content of the document.
Web Content Management Systems
WCMS help firms, organizations, and private persons to capture, manage, 
store, preserve, and publish content as web pages on the Internet.12
The main benefit of using WCMS is the collaborative creation of web pages, 
which allows for dynamic (queried) content on pages, user management, and, 
for most of these systems, almost no programming skills are required to 
publish a web site. As with managing documents, the workflows performing 
inside WCMS focus on the processes to create, approve, and publish web 
sites. However, for managing web content, the processes to remove web 
pages, to archive content and pages, and to create/remove dynamic content 
on web pages have to be considered. For example, suppose that a marketing 
assistant is writing about her firm’s new product. This copy has to appear 
alongside the new product as well as on the start page. However, if another 
product is more recent, copy about the previous product must disappear. 
Within rights management, WCMS generally distinguishes between only a few 
internal users on the one hand, e.g., staff that creates and fills the web sites, 
and a huge number of external users on the other hand, e.g., clients, peers, and 
prospective clients who only read the information and are not logged in to 
the site. In summary, compared to an intranet platform, the main differences 
are that anonymous access must be supported, as well as multilingualism, the 
focus is on layout and design, and information must be approved before finally 
being published on the web. However, if the WCMS allow the creation of a 
forum or blog, external users are also allowed to contribute to the web pages, 
e.g., in the form of reviews or blog entries. The key features of WCMS are as 
follows13:
12AIIM, “ADDIN ZOTERO_ITEM CSL_CITAT www.aiim.org/What-is-Web-20#, 2017.

Chapter 1 | Introduction
14
• 
Design of web sites is usually performed with 
templates. Templates control the position and the look 
and feel of different blocks that appear as a complete site. 
For example, a product-page template can include a block 
as a header, to display the name of the product; an image 
block on the left side below the headline, to illustrate 
the product; and a text block on the right side below the 
headline, to describe the product in detail.
• 
Organization of web sites requires different types  
of techniques. First, whether the recent site subsumes 
another site must be defined, and, with this, the navigation 
below its parent site. Second, metadata is required to 
administrate the site, with the help of formal terms and 
informal tags. Such metadata defines when the site was 
created, by whom it was created, when it will be removed, 
which version is published, etc.
• 
Web site creation workflows allow for standardizing, 
controlling, and automating the complete web site life 
cycle, including its creation, and the archiving of single 
web sites, in addition to the removal of outdated content. 
An example is a site that has been created by a marketing 
member, approved by the head of marketing and then 
automatically published after its approval.
• 
Dynamic content inside web pages enables the use of 
already existing information inside blocks on other sites. In 
our example, the headline and image of the product page 
site will most likely also occur on the site summarizing all 
available products, whereby its description only occurs 
on the product page site itself. However, if the product 
is new, the image and the description of the product may 
also occur on the main/home page of the company.
Digital Asset Management System
DAMS, often referred to also as media asset management, supports enterprises 
in tasks concerning the organization, storage, sharing, and retrieval of assets. 
Such digital files can be any type of media, such as photos, video, audio, and 
slides.14 However, page-based documents are often considered as assets as 
well, because they require the same processes of document management.
14Webdam, “ADDIN ZOTERO_ITEM CSL_CITATION {“ci https://webdam.com/what-
is-digital-asset-management/, December 12, 2016.

Manager’s Guide to SharePoint Server 2016
15
Through using DAMS, firms are provided with a centralized digital library from 
which to create, manage, store, and track assets in a structured way inside 
a collaborative environment. The workflow management must consider the 
different stakeholders who create the assets, approve the assets, and utilize 
the assets for publishing and sharing. Using photos as an example, the process 
of taking a photo is the first step. The image processing in the pre-press 
department is the second step. The approval by a senior editor is the third 
step. And the submission of the photo to a printing company is the fourth 
step. Within rights management, DAMS perform like a system for managing 
paper-based documents. The key features of DAMS are the following:
• 
Automatic converting means that during the import 
and export of assets, these are automatically converted 
into another file format. This is important, as when 
publishing the asset on different channels, different 
resolutions are required. In addition, the publishing is 
performed using closed formats, whereby the editing is 
performed using open file formats. For example, a file in a 
Portable Network Graphics (PNG) format is exported as 
a Joint Photographic Experts Group (JPEG) file to be used 
on a digital device but is exported as a high-resolution 
Portable Document Format (PDF) file and is edited using 
Adobe Photoshop file format.
• 
Automatic indexing and categorization of media 
is necessary to help users find the assets they need.15 
Again, metadata in the form of semantic technologies 
(taxonomy and folksonomy) is crucial.
• 
Processing and review process is performed using 
workflows. Similar to managing documents and web 
sites, the workflows usually treat the complete life cycle 
of assets.
• 
Visualization and rendering are crucial today in 
multichannel applications, meaning the use of different 
devices and channels to display and finally publish an asset.
Electronic Records Management Systems
ERMS help enterprises to control the distribution, use, maintenance, and 
disposition of records to document business transactions and activities.16
15Elizabeth Ferguson Keathley, Digital Asset Management—Content Architectures, Project 
Management, and Creating Order Out of Media Chaos, (New York, Apress, 2014).
16AIIM, “ADDIN ZOTERO_ITEM CSL_CITATION {“citationID””A www.aiim.org/What-
is-ERM-Electronic-Records-Management#, 2017.

Chapter 1 | Introduction
16
The main advantage to using an ERMS is that enterprises can document their 
business processes and transactions. The key features of ERMS are as follows:17
• 
Unique identifiers ensure that each record in a database 
is assigned with a primary key existing only once over a 
set of objects. In addition, such identifiers are used to set 
objects in relation to other objects. An example is that 
a service provider receives a unique identifier, as does a 
customer. The e-mails (records) coming from the service 
provider also receive unique identifiers. This means that 
the other two identifiers mentioned are used as so-called 
foreign keys, through which the complete conversation 
and its participants can be clearly identified.
• 
Digital signature means that a record is assigned with 
a secret and public key generated with the help of an 
asymmetric cryptosystem. This ensures that the integrity 
and authorship of a record cannot be violated. E.g., 
the contract between the provider and the customer 
is assigned with a key that reveals the creator of the 
document.
• 
Audit trails handle the examination of processes, 
activities, and results regarding the fulfillment of predefined 
requirements, norms, and standards.18 The audit trail 
itself is the method used to control and document the 
attempted and actual acts of users during a specific time 
period.
• 
Refresh and migrate are necessary, as records contain 
a firm’s sensitive information and, in some branches, 
must be stored for extended periods, even decades. This 
feature ensures long-term accessibility to the records, 
as it periodically refreshes and migrates the database 
supporting the ERMS.
Enterprise Content Management Systems
The aggregation of the four types of CMS within one environment is known 
as enterprise content management systems (ECMS). As each of the above-
mentioned types is already a complex process, managing enterprise content 
requires an ongoing and evolving strategy to achieve business goals. This is

realized through a combination of methods, strategies, and technologies to 
capture, manage, store, preserve, and publish information (see Table 1-1). 
ECMS support enterprises in systematically collecting and organizing any 
type of information to be used by a designated audience in a collaborative 
environment, e.g., clients, departments, agile project teams, etc., as summarized 
in Figure 1-3.19

The main benefit of using ECMS is that the enterprise establishes a cumulative 
system, rather than single systems, to capture, store, manage, preserve, and 
deliver different types of content. With an ECMS, storage costs are reduced, 
as redundant content is eliminated; operating costs are decreased, through 
workflows performing without system interruption; and productivity and 
efficiency are enhanced, as users get exactly what they need at the right time.22 
To achieve this, ECMS must include the following features23:

better. This includes documents, tasks, calendars, blogs, 
wikis, e-mail integration, and the capability to manage 
projects, teams, departments, etc.
• 
Portal means that users are not restricted only to a user 
account to log in/log out of tasks they are performing. 
In ECMS, users receive their own profile, to maintain 
information about themselves, such as education, work 
experience, contributed projects, interest, etc. In addition, 
they can connect to other users, create their own sites, 
and have their own repository to share content.
• 
Search within ECMS must ensure that a huge amount 
of information, which is heterogeneous according to 
type and format, can be found. To improve searchability, 
search engines must be capable of allowing keyword-
based search, must be scalable, and faceted search must 
be enabled.
• 
Content management includes managing documents, 
managing records, administrating assets, and managing 
content to be published on the web.
• 
Business forms and processes must enable users to 
capture information in browsers and allow nonsequential 
workflows to handle more complex processes over 
different subtasks. In addition, back-end integration must 
be enabled, as well as single sign-on.
• 
Business 
intelligence 
is 
required 
to 
analyze 
information. This includes the integration of sensitive 
data, server-based spreadsheets, data visualization, and 
key performance indicators.
Types of License and Provision Models
In addition to the technical aspects of the different types of CMS, the systems 
can also vary according to license type and the type operating the CMS, 
especially since the advent of cloud computing. This section presents the 
types of licensing that exist and those that can be used to operate a CMS.

Chapter 1 | Introduction
20
Proprietary vs. Open Source Systems
Regarding the different license models, CMS can be distinguished by two main 
categories: proprietary CMS and open source CMS.24 However, one system 
may be available not only as a single license type. Usually, applications are 
available in various license types, which differ as to the type of service model 
and the range of implemented features.
Proprietary CMS require a fee, as the manufacturer of the CMS owns the rights to 
the application, and the user buys permission to use the CMS.25 The advantages of 
using a fee-based CMS are that support is ensured, the system is stable and built 
for enterprise needs, and the manufacturer makes sure that training for users 
and administrators is given. The drawbacks of utilizing a proprietary CMS are 
that you have to pay a fee to use the system, the number of available developers 
and administrators is lower, most modules are also fee-based, and the number of 
communities and forums is lower, as not everyone can use it.
Open source CMS, in contrast, are not fee-based.26 Such systems can be 
used, customized, and further developed by anyone and for any purpose. The 
advantages of using an open source CMS are that the system is free and a 
large community of developers, administrators, and users is available. However, 
support is not assured when using an open source CMS, and the systems are 
often not stable, as bugs are sometimes included. Pure open source CMS 
are often not suitable for enterprise needs. Because of this, manufacturers of 
open source CMS usually provide additionally what is known as an enterprise 
version, or suite, which is fee-based. Using this, an open source CMS can 
be reserved for private persons or smaller firms, and the aforementioned 
enterprise version CMS retained for medium and large businesses.
On-Premise vs. Cloud Computing
With regard to the different types of systems operating and provisioning the 
CMS, two main categories, each with its own benefits and drawbacks, can be 
distinguished: on-premise and cloud computing (usually abbreviated as cloud). 
Again, one application may not only be available solely as one provision type, 
but as different models, which vary in the degree to which they use their own 
or foreign hardware.

Manager’s Guide to SharePoint Server 2016
21
On-premise CMS, whether open source or proprietary, are performed on 
hardware administrated by the user and not provided by the manufacturer 
of the CMS. The user (e.g., an enterprise) has to provide its own server farm 
that is static according to the used hardware. It can rent the server farm from 
another service provider but still must provide its own resources to manage it. 
Logically, on-premise systems normally adhere to what is called a user license, 
or, if the system is not open source, a per-server license that is billed annually. 
This type of provision has been the dominant model since the advent of cloud 
computing but has lost its attraction in the last decade. The reason is that it 
provides high control, high adaptability, and high data sensitivity, and ensures 
that data stays in-house, but the investment costs are high, as are the costs for 
administration, and the farm is less scalable.27
Cloud computing means that CMS do not perform processes on their own 
hardware but, rather, on hardware provided by another source, for example, 
the system provider. As a result, investment costs are decreased; hardware 
is highly scalable in its resources and, therefore, flexible regarding costs for 
hardware; users require less effort to administrate the CMS farm; and costs 
are very transparent. Licensing is usually billed per user and is paid monthly or 
annually. However, when using CMS “in the cloud,” you create dependencies 
of the provider; the legal situation is often unclear, as different countries 
have different laws; data sensitivity decreases; and, of course, the user has 
less control over the CMS and the included data.28 In cloud computing, 
three different models are differentiated, depending on what is outsourced: 
platform-as-a-service (PaaS), software-as-a-service (SaaS), and infrastructure-
as-a-service (IaaS).
Evaluation and Research Methodologies
For finding the specific CMS that best fits the enterprise’s needs, a structured 
selection process has to be performed. This process is usually performed 
in five steps, which the enterprise can perform itself or be supported by a 
consultancy firm or by established market research reports:
	1.	 The market of existing systems has to be scanned, and 
a criteria catalog has to be established. This catalog 
should include general criteria, such as highlighting 
the targets that are pursued with the system to be

Chapter 1 | Introduction
22
implemented, establishing the existing processes, defining 
how the system will be used, and, of course, clarifying 
the budget frame. This frame will mainly be influenced 
by the costs for licenses (if not open source), the costs 
for migrating and implementing the system, those for 
additional hardware, support, and training the users. In 
addition, functional criteria should be addressed, including 
scenarios to evaluate and test the functionalities of the 
systems regarding the established criteria.
	2.	 A call for tender should be performed. This means 
providing potential service providers with the criteria 
catalog created in the previous step. The provision should 
be performed by using structured questionnaires, instead 
of having an unorganized conversation. Alternatively, 
this can be discussed with potential service providers; 
manufactures can be consulted directly; market studies 
can be used; or consultants can support this step. In 
turn, providers, manufacturers, or consultants will be 
responsible for answering questions regarding the catalog 
and, ultimately, for performing a conditional examination.
	3.	 Based on the call for tender, the enterprises usually 
make a preselection. Afterward, a second discussion with 
the service providers is performed. Here, the service 
providers present how the required criteria can be 
addressed using their system. This presentation usually 
includes only very high-performing or very attractive 
features, which is why it is often referred to as a “beauty 
contest.”
	4.	 After another selection based on the preceding step, 
a further step is required, detailing how the criteria 
will actually be addressed. This is usually performed 
by installing the system and by developing prototypes. 
Therefore, a demonstration is required, and providers 
create a proof of concept as to how they will meet the 
requirements regarding time and budget.
	5.	 Based on the criteria catalog and the performed 
selections, only a few providers should remain, usually 
a maximum of three. For all providers, a ranking list is 
compiled, and the prices for setting up the system are 
discussed in detail. Finally, a specification sheet is created, 
documenting which features are part of the project.

Manager’s Guide to SharePoint Server 2016
23
Criteria Catalog
CMS criteria catalogs, or software catalogs in general, can be created by 
breaking down the different aspects of the information management system 
into requirements and summarizing those into categories. In the end, such 
catalogs include requirements that must be fulfilled to satisfy the enterprise’s 
needs. In addition, each criterion is usually weighted according to its importance. 
For example, the firm can establish such user-specific criterion as capacity, 
workflows, and group specificity, wherein group specificity is most important 
(ranked ten out of ten in importance), but capacity is less important (seven 
out of ten in importance). The most-widely used criteria and subcriteria used 
for evaluating CMS are the following:
• 
General criteria include criteria about overall 
conditions. The manufacturer is included as subcriterion, 
as it is important that it function over a long period 
in a stable manner. The license model is considered a 
subcriterion, as some systems can be open source. The 
documentation of the system is also important, as users 
will rely on this. The expandability of the system is also 
considered a sub  criterion, as some systems provide 
modules to expand the system, whereas others require 
additional techniques to be developed from scratch.
• 
Architecture and infrastructure consider the very 
technical criteria. These include subcriteria to review 
the server landscape—for example, if it is more or less 
complex and stable. In addition, often included in these 
criteria are how data and information can be archived, 
how backups can be performed, and how good data 
security can be ensured.
• 
Content creation considers mostly the functional 
criteria. This includes the subcriteria of how content can 
be created, if different types of templates and layouts are 
provided, if the front-end design of the system can be 
customized quickly, if different types of data are allowed, 
and, of course, if the system is able to provide a good 
search experience, as well as intuitive link and metadata 
management/integration.
• 
User management is another criterion that is often 
part of CMS criteria catalogs. This is important, as, usually, 
large numbers of users employ the system. Therefore, 
it is important to consider the user capacity, the ability 
to manage different permission levels and roles, and to 

Chapter 1 | Introduction
24
ensure an authentication process that lets people see 
only what is allowed.
• 
Workflows are required to automatize and standardize 
the different tasks to be performed within the system. 
Through this, it is important that different types of 
workflows are provided out of the box, if the workflows 
can be customized, and whether they can really cover 
complex tasks automatically.
Market Research Reports
Market research reports also consider the requirements that a system must 
fulfill and compare the fulfillment of different CMS. The two most important 
and well-known fee-based market research reports are provided by Gartner 
Inc. (www.gartner.com) and Forrester Research, Inc. (www.forrester.com). 
Each of the two companies uses a proprietary research methodology to 
identify the best performing systems.
• 
Gartner provides the Gartner magic quadrant research 
methodology. It classifies the different systems according 
to their ability to execute the different requirements 
and their completeness of vision. This results in four 
types of systems, listed according to their ability to fulfill 
requirements: leaders (high ability, high completeness), 
visionaries (high completeness, low ability), challengers 
(high ability, low completeness), and niche players (low 
ability, low completeness).29 Through this, the quadrant 
can clearly identify the position of competing players in 
a specific technology market. Regarding the right choice 
of CMS, the following quadrants are most important: 
social software, portals, enterprise search, enterprise 
content management, business process analysis, business 
intelligence, content collaboration, and web content 
management.
• 
Forrester provides the Forrester wave research 
methodology. In each wave, the criteria to grade a 
system’s offerings, as well as a score for each criterion, 
are provided. To do this, it relies on the participation of 
four types of contributors: the analyst, who determines 
29Gartner Inc. “Methodology Guide: Gartner Magic Quadrant”, ar www.gartner.com/
technology/research/methodologies/research_mq.jsp, accessed March 1, 2017.

25
the criteria; the research associate, who manages the 
research process and communicates with vendors; a 
vendor’s response team, which comprises the contacts to 
vendors; and customers who share experiences with the 
CMS.30 Each wave classifies the different CMS according 
to its current offering and its completeness of strategy. 
At the end, users are presented four types of CMS, listed 
according their fulfillment of criteria and how this is 
weighted, as follows: leaders (strong strategy, and strong 
offering), strong performers (strong to medium strategy, 
and strong to medium offering), contenders (medium 
to low strategy, and medium to low offering), and risky 
bets (low to strong strategy, and low to strong offering). 
In addition, the wave also reflects the market presence. 
It does this by differentiating between full vendor 
participation and incomplete vendor participation.
Crowd-sourced (non-fee-based) research reports exist but are less extensive 
and less controlled, as anyone, regardless of knowledge and experience, can 
contribute to these reports. The two most comprehensive crowd-sourced 
reports are provided by G2 Crowd (www.g2crowd.com), which uses a similar 
methodology as Gartner, and Trust Radius (www.trustradius.com), which 
uses what are known as trust maps.
Conclusion
This chapter has provided informative introduction to the general principles 
of content management. It has included an overview of the different types of 
existing systems (DMS, WCMS, DAM, ERMS, ECMS), as well as the different 
components used within such systems. In addition, this chapter has reviewed 
recent types of license and provision models, including proprietary systems, 
open source systems, on-premise systems, and cloud computing. This chapter 
has also presented different methodologies to evaluate the market and specific 
systems. A novel criteria catalog has been presented, prior to pointing out 
various market research reports.

SharePoint 
Technology
Microsoft SharePoint Server, often referred to simply as SharePoint, is the 
enterprise content management system (ECMS) developed and distributed 
by the Microsoft Corporation (www.microsoft.com). SharePoint combines 
capabilities to manage content intended to be published on web sites, features 
to effectively manage paper-based documents, technologies to administrate 
electronic records, and functionalities to manage digital assets, all inside one 
uniform system. The latest release of SharePoint was in 2016, named Microsoft 
SharePoint Server 2016 or, in short, SharePoint 2016.1 From the introduction 
of SharePoint in 2001, SharePoint 2016 represents the fifth successive release 
of the product. With each release, Microsoft has substantially improved the 
platform, by picking up the most influential trends in information technology 
and constantly implementing those trends within SharePoint. Therefore, 
SharePoint focuses not only on functional trends, such as integrating social 
media features, but also on technical trends, such as providing SharePoint as a 
cloud computing service instead of one available only on-premise, or improving 
the graphical user interface (GUI) by providing more branding features.

The first release of Microsoft SharePoint in 2001 was named Microsoft 
SharePoint Portal Server, or, in short, SharePoint 2001.2 SharePoint 2001 
provided a pure platform to manage paper-based documents, i.e., a document 
management system (DMS), which was supported through minimal collaboration 
features. The strategy was to provide a portal solution to enterprises, instead of 
having isolated applications on personal computers and ultimately storing the 
documents inside file directories, which do not support automatic versioning 
and annotating, check-in/check-out, automatic tagging, and audit trail. The next 
release, named Microsoft Office SharePoint Portal Server 2003, had the same 
focus, but the range of features was supplemented by the My Site technology. 
The My Site technology was strongly inspired by the emergence of Web 2.0 
and social media platforms like Myspace. With this, the My Site feature greatly 
improved the collaboration capabilities of SharePoint 2003, by providing 
techniques to improve social interaction between users, for example, by giving 
each user the opportunity to create his/her own social profile, and by giving them 
the possibility to follow other users, etc. The biggest improvement in SharePoint 
was achieved with the release in 2007 of Microsoft Office SharePoint Server 
2007. This was during the era when SharePoint became a comprehensive IT 
platform and, finally, a complete ECMS. In contrast to the releases in 2001 and 
2003, comprehensive techniques are now integrated to create individual web 
sites, as provided by WCMS. In addition, techniques are integrated to focus also 
on the management of non-paper-based documents, and techniques to effectively 
administrate business records have been provided. In addition, and based on the 
afore mentioned improvements, an updated search center was included, as were 
business processes and forms and techniques to support business intelligence (BI). 
In the following release, introduced in 2010, SharePoint supported multi-browsing 
(platform and device-independent browsing), My Site was improved, and a new 
user interface provided better usability. The new improvements were based on 
the emergence of cross-media and the success of new social media platforms 
like Facebook and Twitter. This version was named Microsoft SharePoint Server 
2010. The release introduced in 2013, named Microsoft SharePoint Server 2013, 
again featured improvements to increase usability. From a user perspective, the 
main improvements were to the user interface, the support of drag and drop, and 
the ability to now follow and share documents, sites, persons, etc. With the most 
recent release, Microsoft SharePoint Server 2016, the focus is on the architecture 
of SharePoint and the underlying provision model. Now, SharePoint is not only 
available on-premise but also in the cloud. This version is available as a standalone 
enterprise content management system and also as an Office 365 application.

The aim of this chapter is to discuss the underlying technologies of the most 
recent release of SharePoint theoretically, but also to consider the possibilities 
and limitations of SharePoint 2016. The first section of this chapter begins 
by detailing the technology of SharePoint. This includes a discussion of the 
applications provided, the user interface, and the My Site technology. In the 
subsequent section, the available templates in SharePoint will be covered. 
This includes a discussion of which types of templates exist, how these are 
different, and for which scenario is which template most suitable.
SharePoint Technology
Since the third release of SharePoint in 2007, it has been an ECMS. With each 
release of SharePoint, new techniques have been implemented, and the existing 
functionalities constantly improved. To do this, Microsoft considers the trends 
in the IT sector and transfers those into its ECMS. Because of the constant 
improvement, SharePoint is one of the most comprehensive ECMS, according 
to the related market research reports published by the research institutions 
Gartner Inc. and Forrester Research Inc. This section presents the underlying 
technologies of SharePoint. It includes a discussion of the basic elements of 
SharePoint, one about the technology of SharePoint, an explanation of My Site, 
and, finally, an explanation of the different administration levels.
Basic Elements
In contrast to other ECMS, SharePoint does not illustrate its ECMS capabilities 
as recommended by the Association for Image and Information Management 
(AIIM) but inside an autarchy model, called the SharePoint Wheel. With the 
improvements of the last five releases, the wheel has correspondingly changed, 
as illustrated in Table 2-1. The recent release, Microsoft SharePoint Server 
2016, combines six core capabilities inside the wheel:3
• 
Sites provides templates to manage the different types 
of content, as well as the users themselves. Different 
templates exist to improve collaboration, enterprise 
tasks, and publishing. In addition, high granular rights 
management is provided, and an individual site for each 
user (My Site).

• 
Composites aims to improve the efficiency of users and 
teams. This is done through techniques providing forms to 
create and edit content directly in the browser. In addition, 
it allows for metadata techniques and the integration of 
workflows to automatize tasks and reduce error rates.
• 
Insights are capabilities to analyze data. Here, the 
focus is on business intelligence services. This includes 
the integration of server-based Excel spreadsheets into 
SharePoint, to visualize data using dashboards, and the 
ability to initiate performance measurements, so-called 
key performance indicators (KPI).
• 
Communities 
provides 
techniques 
to 
improve 
collaboration between users and teams. It includes the 
integration of Outlook, templates to set up community 
sites, such as blogs and wikis, as well as services that allow 
collaborative work on documents or tasks, including 
notification services.
• 
Content offers capabilities for managing content. These 
include those to manage paper-based documents as well 
as digital assets, the ability to track transactions and 
business records, as well as those to manage content to 
be published on the internet.
• 
Search provides intelligent search services. The search 
centers and services provided in SharePoint allow faceted 
search, i.e., the ability to search for different types of 
objects, such as persons or data. In addition, the search 
centers are scalable, adjustable according relevance, and 
support eDiscovery.

As with other applications, SharePoint is available under different license and 
provision models. However, SharePoint is not available as an open source 
CMS. The enterprise must always pay a fee to use the CMS. To use SharePoint 
2016, two different provision models are distinguished:4
• 
SharePoint Online is the cloud-based version that does 
not operate on its own hardware. Its license model is on 
a per-user basis, which can be standalone or integrated 
as an application in Office 365, in addition to other 
applications, e.g., Microsoft Dynamics CRM.
• 
SharePoint On-Premise is the conventional variant 
not operating in the cloud, or not completely in the cloud. 
To use it, an enterprise must pay for the global license. 
The hardware to run SharePoint must be administrated 
by the enterprise itself or by another supplier, e.g., the 
Azure cloud computing service provided by Microsoft.
From a functional perspective, many different versions exist, especially for the 
version of SharePoint being provided online and its integration in Microsoft 
Office 365. The different versions differ according to the templates provided 
out of the box, the underlying features, and the provided SharePoint services. 
However, in summary, two core versions exist:
• 
SharePoint Standard is the version including only 
the core capabilities of SharePoint (sites, communities, 
content, and search). Extended techniques, such as to 
allow business intelligence processes, are not included. 
This version exists only for the on-premise one.
• 
SharePoint Enterprise is the version including the full 
capabilities of SharePoint (sites, communities, content, 
search, business solutions, business intelligence). This 
version allows complete ECMS processes. This version 
exists for both SharePoint provision models.
Core Technology
When discussing the core SharePoint technology, five main features are 
important. First are the hierarchies available to manage different site levels. 
Second are the applications made available in SharePoint to ultimately create,

Chapter 2 | SharePoint Technology
32
edit, and semantically structure the different types of content. Third are the 
technologies responsible for customizing the pages of sites on different levels. 
Fourth are the pages themselves, meaning the different underlying techniques 
to customize the site and the associated pages according to the look and 
feel dictated by a corporate design. Fifth is the navigation feature provided 
to navigate the information required. Those features are explained in detail 
following. A separate section presents detailed information on the templates 
used to create a site for a specific use case according to the needs of a firm.
SharePoint Hierarchy
In SharePoint, a fixed number of levels does not exist. This is because each 
installation can include various top-level sites or subordinate sites below. 
The sites can have subordinated subsites, and a subsite can itself have other 
subsites below. However, the following four types of levels are important and 
allow any conceivable kind of hierarchy to be built, as shown in Figure 2-1:
• 
SharePoint farm is the lowest level in the SharePoint 
topology. This is the installation of SharePoint performed 
on the selected hardware. One farm can be installed on 
one server or on multiple servers. However, multiple 
farms cannot be installed only on one server.
• 
Web application is the second-lowest level in the 
SharePoint topology, below the SharePoint farm. One 
farm can have multiple SharePoint web applications. For 
example, if one enterprise has two different companies, 
it will most likely have two web applications with two 
different root domains.
• 
Top-level sites are the third lowest level in the SharePoint 
topology, below the SharePoint web application. For each 
web application, multiple top-level sites can be defined. 
Each top-level site starts with a site collection, e.g., 
one site collection for the internet and another for the 
intranet.
• 
Subsites are the fourth-lowest level in the SharePoint 
typology. As the name implies, subsites are child sites of 
the above-mentioned site-collections. However, a subsite 
can also be a subsite of another subsite, subsuming the 
site collection, and so on. Subsites usually inherit the 
settings of their parent sites.

Manager’s Guide to SharePoint Server 2016
33
The contents existing on a single site, no matter the level of the site, can be 
controlled by using Site Contents. Here, the included subsites are listed, as 
well as the included applications. In addition, the pages being included on a site 
can be controlled, by using the list application known as Pages.
At each of the above-mentioned levels (except SharePoint farm), pages and 
applications can be created:
• 
Applications are the most specific level in SharePoint. 
Each application is a list or library structuring content, 
i.e., the items of a list or library. Each application provides 
functional features to store and manage content and 
information.
• 
Pages are the web sites in SharePoint. Each page is a 
container having static and/or dynamic content to be 
displayed. Each page consists of different blocks including 
the content. In SharePoint, these blocks are named web 
parts.

SharePoint Applications
An application in SharePoint is a small piece of software providing functional 
features to store and manage content according to type of information, i.e., 
a web application. In SharePoint 2016, 18 different applications exist out of 
the box that can be added to the level of a site collection or to the level of 
a SharePoint site. Additionally, applications can be added by order from the 
Microsoft app store. Some of the applications provided by the store are open 
source; for others, a fee has to be paid. Each application is of the type list, 
library, or calendar (also a list), whereby each type is focused on one specific 
type of content, namely, to store items, files, events, or tasks. The provided 
applications are as follows:
• 
Announcements is a list to let people know what 
is happening in the department, project, etc.5 Such 
announcements are usually displayed on the home 
page of the site, but the actual storage occurs in the list 
mentioned.
• 
Asset Library is aimed to store all media in one place, 
including images, audio, or video files.6 Through this, the 
media can be reused on any page. The library includes 
different features: thumbnail-centric view, overlay callouts, 
digital asset content types, and automatic metadata 
extraction for image files.
• 
Calendar is a list including events, very similar to the 
calendar provided in Microsoft Outlook. Each event can 
receive a title, location, start and end time, description, 
and category. In addition, an event can be set to be a 
repeating event and/or an all-day event. Different views, 
also similar to Outlook, exist.
• 
Contacts is a  library to store contact information of 
other persons. Each contact can be stored in a very 
detailed manner. Besides the standard information, such 
as name, company, phone, and e-mail address, additional 
information, such as notes to a person, can be stored or 
individual columns created.

• 
Custom List is a list of items without any predefined 
purpose. By contrast, the administrator, by configuring 
the list, as required, should define the aim of such lists. 
For example, a custom list can be created to store staff 
holidays or to list all peer companies or all sales activities.
• 
Custom List in Datasheet View is similar to the 
preceding, but the items on the list can be created, 
edited, or removed inline. In most cases, this improves 
usability. However, it should not be used for sensitive 
information, as a quick solution to edit existing items is 
always error-prone.
• 
Discussion Board is a list to create discussions. It is 
used to support communication between users. Such lists 
are used for exchanging experience and knowledge or to 
develop ideas. In SharePoint, users can reply directly in 
single discussions or can rate discussions and answers as 
best reply.
• 
Document Library is a library storing document files. 
It is similar to the library for storing assets, but with a 
focus on paper-based files. For example, Word files, Excel 
spreadsheets, Power Point presentations, or PDFs should 
be stored using this library. All files can be synced to your 
personal computer.
• 
External List is a list showing an external content type. 
External content types must be defined beforehand to 
be used in the discussed list. For example, an XML file 
outside of SharePoint can be an external content type, or 
a relational database of another information management 
system.
• 
Form Library is a library that stores forms. Such forms 
can be created using InfoPath, another application outside 
of SharePoint that creates the forms in XML format.7 
Once, the form is published inside this library, users can 
employ it to create and fill out InfoPath forms.

Chapter 2 | SharePoint Technology
36
• 
Import Spreadsheet allows users to import data into 
SharePoint from an existing Excel spreadsheet. To do so, the 
spreadsheet should not include blank cells; representative 
headers should be included; and the cell formats should be 
consistent.8 Please note that the input is static.
• 
Issue Tracking is a list of items performing as issues. 
Issues are small tasks with a priority and due date that 
can be assigned to persons. In addition, each issue gets 
a unique identifier, a title, and a status. Through this, 
the user can filter for active issues, as well as for issues 
assigned to him/her.
• 
Links is a list of items. The items can be any type of link, 
inside or outside SharePoint. For example, a marketing 
and sales department can create a list of links having 
interesting posts of events as link items.
• 
Picture Library is a library very similar to the library 
for storing assets. However, here the focus is more on 
storing only pictures and figures. In addition, non-print-
based documents can be stored in this library, such as 
PowerPoint slides.
• 
Promoted Links is a list to tag artifacts as important. 
The tagged artifacts are afterward summarized as a 
specific few using tiles. It is, for example, used to provide 
a summary of the most important links inside an 
emphasized view.
• 
Survey is another list in SharePoint. It provides a quick 
and clear representation of answers to a survey. In addition, 
the resulting answers can be (automatically) analyzed using 
this application. The results can be graphically enhanced, 
and the fulfillment of the survey can be displayed.
• 
Tasks is a list in SharePoint to create, manage, and assign 
tasks to other users, for example, when setting up tasks 
for implementing a project. This list includes columns to 
store the creator of the task, a description of the task 
to be performed, the degree of fulfillment, as well as the 
user responsible for fulfilling this task. The tasks can be 
visualized using a time line, and workflows can be added 
to the single tasks.

37
• 
Wiki Page Library is a library that includes wiki sites. 
Such sites are aimed to quickly capture and share ideas, by 
creating simple sites and interlinking different wiki sites.9
In addition to the above-mentioned applications, which can be created or 
removed by an administrator, other applications exist that can be added to 
the site according to the template chosen. These applications cannot be 
removed from the site, as they are responsible ensuring the functionality 
of the underlying template. Logically, the automatically included applications 
differ according to the aim of the template. The most important applications 
that are automatically created are as follows:
• 
Micro Feed is an application required in the team site 
to store the social interactions happening on the site. By 
default, the home page of the team site includes the site 
feed web part newsfeed. All the conversations published 
as feed, and the reactions of other users on it, are stored 
as micro feed items.
• 
Style Library is a library to store style files. Such style 
files can, for example, be Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) to 
style text stored in Hypertext Markup Language (HTML). 
The files stored here can be used to style master pages 
and page layouts in the recent site or the subsites 
inheriting the settings.
• 
Categories is a list to create, edit, and delete categories. 
Such categories are used to classify the different blog 
posts according to subjective or objective criteria. By 
default, three categories exist: events, ideas, and opinions. 
To share experiences, for example, such a category can 
be created.
• 
Comments is a list storing comments replying to an 
existing post. New items cannot be created in this list, 
and existing items cannot be edited or deleted. Through 
this list, each comment can be linked to the underlying 
post. In practice, this is often used to filter for the most 
interesting posts.

38
• 
Posts is a list of all posts of a site. In contrast to the 
list storing the comments, new items can be created, and 
existing items can be deleted or edited. For each post, 
the title, the person who created the post, the publishing 
date, the category used to classify the post, the number of 
comments, and the number of likes are stored.
• 
Content and Structure Reports is a list to customize 
queries performing as reporting about a site collection or 
site. The reports are based on the physical structure of 
the SharePoint site.
• 
Documents is a library to store paper-based documents. 
The library aims to store documents used on separate 
pages.
• 
Images is a library to store pictures and figures. The 
library’s aim is to store images used on separate pages.
• 
Pages is a library to store created web pages.
• 
Reusable Content is a list containing information (in 
HTML, or as text) that can be reused on included pages.
• 
Site Collection Documents is also a library to store 
documents. However, its aim is to store documents that 
are used throughout the complete site collection.
• 
Site Collection Images is also a library to store images. 
However, its purpose is to store images that are used 
throughout the complete site collection.
• 
Workflow Tasks is a list storing workflow tasks.
SharePoint Pages
Pages in SharePoint are web sites. Each page is a container displaying static 
and/or dynamic content. The pages in SharePoint are customized using two 
different techniques. Both are responsible for adjusting the look and feel of 
SharePoint, according to the needs of an enterprise. The two techniques are 
the following:
• 
Master Page controls the general elements of a 
SharePoint site, i.e., elements shown on each site. 
It specifies the different navigations available, the 
visualization of standard content (e.g., a logo), the editing 
modes allowed, the security levels allowed, and the 
allowed web parts to be used on pages.

Manager’s Guide to SharePoint Server 2016
39
• 
Page Layout controls the more specific elements of a 
SharePoint site, i.e., elements not shown on each site. Its 
aim is to create analogs to templates used for WCMS. 
Through this, a page layout includes predefined boxes and 
web parts tailored to the specific aim of a page.
SharePoint Web Parts
Web parts are single units of reusable components that can be employed on 
a SharePoint page to perform a specific task and, ultimately, to customize the 
pages.10 Each web part includes specific functionality to modify the textual 
and graphical content, appearance, and behavior of a SharePoint page.11 All 
content shown on a SharePoint page is realized using web parts. Each page 
includes various web part zones including web parts. The web parts can be 
positioned into the zones by using the browser or by using the Microsoft 
SharePoint Designer editor. Each web part has its own configuration menu to 
perform customization of the web part (see Figure 2-2). Here, the dimensions 
of the web part, the title of the web part, or specific functionalities, such as 
which content has to be queried using this web part, can be customized. 
Each configuration can be validated for every user or only for a recent user. 
In practice, web parts are often used for integrating dynamic content on a 
recent page—for example, to query the content of an application to appear 
as a summary on a recent site. SharePoint 2016 distinguishes ten of the most 
important types of web parts:12
• 
Apps web parts to display the content stored inside 
an application. These are required if, for example, the 
starting page of a site collection should provide a quick 
view to the newest documents, the most recent tasks, or 
important events.
• 
Blog web parts to display the content of a blog site. 
It is used if, for example, a page should summarize the 
most discussed blog entries, instead of having the entries 
isolated.

• 
Business Data web parts category specialized to display 
business information, such as status or other indicators. 
In addition, this category includes web parts to embed 
information from Excel and Visio documents, as well as 
information from external sources.
• 
Community web parts to improve community features, 
e.g., to display the memberships of users for groups or 
information about a community.
• 
Content Rollup web part to aggregate information. The 
aggregation is performed by searching other sites, e.g., to 
provide a summary of most critical tasks. Most important 
for this category is the Table of Contents web part.
• 
Filters web parts that are combined with other web 
parts (mainly search web parts). Their aim is to filter for 
relevant information, instead of showing the complete 
number of structured information inside a library or the 
complete items in a list.
• 
Media and Content web parts used for displaying 
digital assets. In SharePoint, such assets are stored in a 
separate application (library). The query is performed 
using this type of web part, as an analog to the previously 
mentioned web parts.
• 
Project Web App web parts that focus on administrating 
projects using Microsoft Project Server. The web parts 
can visualize specific Project Server artifacts, such as 
issues, tasks, time sheets, and status.
• 
Search-Driven Content web parts that allow dynamic 
content by using search queries. The search queries 
can be defined using different metadata techniques, e.g., 
whether a block should contain all recent items of a 
specific user group. Most important here is the Content 
Query web part.
• 
Social Collaboration web parts designed to display the 
content stored in social features of SharePoint, such as 
note board, tag cloud, user tasks, or contact details.

SharePoint Navigation
Navigation in SharePoint includes control elements and links on site-
collection, sites, and subsites to simplify the orientation for users. Through 
this, users can navigate more efficiently to the content and information they 
actually require. In SharePoint, the navigations included on the site-collection, 
sites, and subsites are controlled by the underlying master page. For example, 
one master page includes two navigations, wherein one includes only one 
navigation. The navigation can finally be customized in Navigation Settings.
From a user’s perspective, two types of navigations exist. Both can be 
customized according to the subsites and pages shown. The two types of 
navigations existing in SharePoint are the following:
Figure 2-2.  Browser user interface for editing the functionality, design, and/or behavior of 
SharePoint web parts

Chapter 2 | SharePoint Technology
42
• 
Global Navigation is showing the top links, meaning 
the links to appear on the complete web site application, 
including the underlying site collections and sites. It 
should be used for global items and very important pages.
• 
Local Navigation is showing the recent links, not the 
links to appear on all sites and site collections subsuming 
the recent site collection or web application. It should be 
used to show all pages of the recent site.
In addition to the two preceding navigations, a further differentiation can be 
made, i.e., a difference from a functional perspective. As such, two types of 
navigations exist:
• 
Structural Navigation is the traditional navigation. 
Independent of the physical structure (hierarchy) of 
the pages, a virtual structure can be created. With this, 
pages are listed by using a title to be displayed inside 
the navigation. The different levels of navigation can be 
realized by using superordinated headings. Using this 
traditional technique, local and global navigation can be 
differentiated.
• 
Managed Navigation is available since the SharePoint 
release presented in SharePoint 2013, a navigation realized 
by this technique is based on an underlying taxonomy. 
The term set can be edited using the Quick Launch 
Bar available directly from the shown navigation or by 
using the Term Store Management Tool. Using this 
metadata-driven technique, local and global navigation 
cannot be differentiated.
Each of the preceding navigations can be adjusted according to five criteria, 
namely, if the recent site should inherit the navigation of the more general site, 
if a managed navigation should be used for a structural navigation, if subsites 
and pages should be included in the navigation, and the maximum number of 
items in the navigation. The current navigation can, in addition, specify whether 
the items of the current site should be displayed only or if sibling sites should 
be shown as well. The structural navigation is a conventional navigation and 
not a formalist one. The administrator of a site can decide in a flexible manner 
the physical structure of the navigation, by creating a virtual one. In contrast, 
when using the metadata navigation, the navigation is defined by the formalism 
of the site collection, using its underlying taxonomy, known in SharePoint as 
Term Store.

Manager’s Guide to SharePoint Server 2016

SharePoint Master Page and Page Layouts
Master Pages control the core elements shown on SharePoint pages, such 
as local and global navigation, visualization of the site title, visualization of a 
logo, the sign-in process, ribbon, functionalities of the site, etc. Page Layouts 
control the elements to be shown in the content area and, of course, control 
the layout of these elements. Both master pages and page layouts can be 
managed by using the areas Look and Feel and Web Designer Galleries 
(see Figure 2-3).
Figure 2-3.  Explanation of elements and their relationships, used for realizing and 
customizing the look and feel of a SharePoint web application
Out of the box, two master pages are provided in SharePoint, compared 
in Table 2-2. A third master page exists, to be used exclusively for page 
development. Which master page to use can be defined in the Site Master 
Page Settings. Here, the master page used for the pages shown to every 
user and the master page used by administrative pages can be distinguished. It 
is recommended that for both types of pages, the same master page be used. 
The three master pages that can be used for both types of pages out of the 
box differ, as follows:
• 
Oslo is intended to support content rendering and to 
focus on the layout of the page. For this reason, it should 
be used in a multichannel context, i.e., for publishing on 
the internet.

Chapter 2 | SharePoint Technology
44
• 
Seattle supports collaboration. This is achieved by 
connecting management processes provided in SharePoint. 
It should be used for establishing an intranet.
• 
Minimal does not have a specific aim. It is reduced to the 
main elements for supporting an empty master page to 
be used on a development basis.

Page layouts define how the final content should be displayed, including the 
underlying templates for rendering the content, and positioning the web parts 
and information. The page layouts provided can be managed by the Page 
Layout and Site Template settings. Here, the site templates have to be 
defined, which in turn allow choosing the included page layouts.
SharePoint Branding
Adopting the look and feel of a site according to a corporate design is 
known as branding. In SharePoint, branding can be quickly performed by using 
Composed Looks and its underlying Themes. The settings in SharePoint 
can be managed by using the area’s Web Design Galleries and Look and 
Feel.
In addition to the master page, which defines the core elements to be used by 
the composed look, the themes feature plays a crucial role. Themes use tags 
to define how the elements included on a page should be displayed. There are 
two types of themes:
• 
Color Theme defines hex values to clarify the color 
used by single elements on a page, i.e., it is defined by 
the underlying master page. The hex values are stored in 
XML file format, in what are called palettes.

Manager’s Guide to SharePoint Server 2016
45
• 
Font Theme is analogous to the preceding but aim to 
define the fonts used by the elements. It’s also stored as 
an XML file.
Composed looks are managed in the accompanying list. Here, each look is 
defined by five attributes: name, URL of the master page used, URL of the 
color theme used, URL of the background image used (optional), and the URL 
of the font theme. For defining which look should be used, the accompanying 
menu must be used. Here, different looks are listed, which can be configured 
by the attributes mentioned before.
For more detailed branding, the master page can be customized; the page 
layouts can be modified; or CSS files can be included. However, this requires 
that source code be developed and is much more time-consuming than the 
alternative presented above. Modified files can be managed by using the 
Design Manager, part of the Look and Feel menu. Here, the look and feel 
of the site in a multi-channel context, the migration of master pages, as well 
as the migration of page layouts, and display templates are considered. When 
creating such a new file, a gallery for storing snippets appears. Here, single 
HTML code is provided in the form of snippets representing the elements 
being allowed on a SharePoint page. The snippets can be used together on an 
individual page.
SharePoint Multilingualism
As SharePoint is often used in very large enterprises with locations in 
different countries, it is necessary to support multilingualism. In SharePoint, 
this is realized using the so-called Multiple Language Interface and 
the underlying Language Packs. These ensure the necessary changes to 
the display language of the following UI elements: web parts, site title and 
description, menu and actions, default columns, custom columns, navigation 
bar links, and managed metadata services.
The initial content is not affected by the preceding. This must be done by 
using Variations, which also make use of Language Packs. Variations allow the 
creation of different pages for the different languages.
SharePoint Pages
Pages in SharePoint are mainly used for publishing content for the web 
(internet, intranet, or extranet). For creating a page, different page layouts, 
such as article page, image left, body only, blank web part page, etc., exist. The 
page layouts provided on a site depend on which subsite template is actually 
being used. Each page to be created in SharePoint can be further defined by 
giving it a name, which is used to automatically create the URL of the page. All 
pages of site are managed by using a separate list.

Chapter 2 | SharePoint Technology
46
Each page in SharePoint can be edited. To ensure a controlled process, the 
pages that are recently edited are Checked Out. This means, that only the 
person editing the page can view it. Logically, if the editing is completed, the 
page has to be Checked In accordingly, before it is finally Published. The 
editing process is further supported by providing a Preview of the page. 
When a page is edited, the editor panel appears. This reveals a status bar and 
a menu for performing the editing. This menu is changed according to which 
part, i.e., which web part, of the page is to be edited. To limit the editing 
process to only the necessary users, eight standard Permission Levels exist 
for SharePoint pages, with the following rights: full control, design, contribute, 
read, limited access, view only, approve, manage hierarchy, and restricted read. 
During the creation process of a page, it can adopt a different status, which 
can, of course, be controlled and automatized by using a workflow, more 
precisely, the publishing approval workflow:
• 
Checked Out means that the page has status of being 
edited. Only the editor is able to see a page with this 
status.
• 
Draft highlights that the page is stored but that editing is 
not complete, or that the page has already been approved 
but is outdated, because of it not having been published.
• 
Pending indicates that the editing is complete. However, 
the page requires approval before being published.
• 
Approved means that the page has been approved, and 
everyone having access to the page can view the page.
• 
Rejected is the opposite of the preceding status. The 
page is not approved and must be edited further or 
removed.
• 
Scheduled is another status highlighting that the page is 
approved. However, pages having this status are not yet 
published. Publication depends on a schedule.
SharePoint Search
SharePoint provides different techniques to support its search-driven 
applications. These aim to greatly improve the search experience for users.
The entry to a search query in SharePoint is the provided search slot (see 
Figure 2-4). At any time, this slot is in the same place and is accessible 
everywhere. The slot can query for three types of phrases: full-text search, 
keyword search, and person search.

Manager’s Guide to SharePoint Server 2016
47
After typing and sending a search query, the user is forwarded to the result 
page. This result page includes the detected search results and provides the 
state-of-the-art techniques for search-driven applications:
• 
Dynamic Taxonomies are represented as search 
verticals. The user can further filter the results by limiting 
the search to a specific range or object: Everything, 
Conversation, People, and This Site.
• 
Multilingualism is supported. The user can filter for 
results expressed in a specific language.
• 
The results are finally presented by a Title and a text 
snippet, as well as by the place where the result is stored, 
i.e., its URL. For each result, a Result Preview is shown, 
appearing if the user hovers with a mouse over the title 
of the result.
• 
Search Statistics informs the user of how many 
relevant items are detected. If a larger number of results 
is detected, not fitting on a single page, Pagination is 
provided.
Figure 2-4.  Structure of the SharePoint result page, including different page elements to 
further help find the desired data

Chapter 2 | SharePoint Technology
48
• 
Additional settings can be performed to customize the 
search by using Search Preferences or to set up a daily 
or weekly summary to be sent by e-mail (Alert Me), in 
the event of new results being found or existing items 
having changed.
• 
Faceted Search is provided to further refine the 
detected results. In SharePoint, this technique is named 
Refiner, which can be set up by the administrator.
The query and the result page are in SharePoint, based on a what is called 
a search center. Two types of search centers are distinguished. The Basic 
Search Center provides a page for showing the search results. The 
Enterprise Search Center does not look very different, except that it 
automatically provides the visualization of dynamic taxonomies, i.e., the search 
verticals. In addition, both types of search centers include an advanced search 
feature that has to be activated in the central administration before it can 
be used. This includes the other previously mentioned techniques, as well as 
techniques to exclude phrases, to define the language, and to define content 
types, illustrated in Figure 2-5.
Figure 2-5.  User interface to set up advanced search features, including searches for specific 
words or phrases, to define the language used, set up the result type, and, finally, add property 
restrictions

Manager’s Guide to SharePoint Server 2016
49
Whether using the Enterprise Search Center or the Basic Search Center, 
the result page is based on the included web parts. Through this, the result 
page can be customized in detail, by adding further web parts or by editing 
existing web parts. Different web parts to improve search are provided for 
the following: to provide a search field for person search, to provide a field for 
advanced search, to provide search statistics, to summarize the search results, 
or to highlight the most fitting search results.
All the preceding features can be used and customized by the Site 
Collection Administrator. However, the underlying technique also has to 
be considered for customizing and improving the search experience. This must 
be performed by the more technical Central Administrator, inside the 
central administration of SharePoint, more precisely, the area named Manage 
Service Applications. Here, the administrator can analyze and monitor the 
crawling process, set up and tune the crawling schedule, and monitor and 
analyze the performed search queries.
SharePoint Authorization Concept
The authorization concept in SharePoint can be managed on different levels. 
This allows users to be managed precisely and to give only single users the 
permissions to enter the site that they actually require. Four levels exist to 
manage the users precisely:
• 
Roles/Levels can be assigned to SharePoint groups, or 
to single SharePoint users. The role is defined by the 
underlying permission level, which actions the user is 
allowed to perform on the SharePoint site, and which 
sites she/he can actually access.
• 
SharePoint Groups allow summarizing different users. 
This is very helpful, as usually not only single users have a 
unique level of permission.
• 
Permission Levels are assigned to the SharePoint 
groups or to single users (see Table 2-3). Each permission 
level is a collection of single types of permissions (see 
Table 2-4).
• 
Unique Permissions can be set up for single libraries, 
sites, or lists. Through this, the user or group has 
permission more or less to perform specific actions 
inside this object.

Chapter 2 | SharePoint Technology

integration features, open and edit personal user information
Personal Permissions

In addition to the preceding, permission levels can be inherited over different 
site levels. For example, if a user is assigned to a group that is able to 
contribute to the site, and another subsite exists inheriting the permission 
levels, such users are also allowed to contribute to the subsite. Of course, on 
a subsite level, unique permission can also be created for specific objects, or 
the inheritance can be removed.
SharePoint Metadata Techniques
The classical features being supported inside SharePoint for managing 
information, e.g., documents, use folders, lists, filters, and create various views 
that build upon the filters. However  such traditional techniques are not 
sufficient at present for intuitively structuring a large amount of information. 
Therefore, SharePoint also supports both metadata-driven techniques: 
folksonomies and taxonomies.

Manager’s Guide to SharePoint Server 2016
51
In SharePoint, taxonomies are created and managed with the Term Store 
Management Tool. Inside this tool, term sets can be created, which consist 
of hierarchically ordered terms. Through these, each term set depicts a 
taxonomy consisting of terms. Such term sets can be assigned to libraries or 
lists for hierarchically structuring the list items or documents. Logically, each 
single item or document can be assigned with one specific term.
The folksonomies are created and managed inside SharePoint using the 
Enterprise Metadata feature. In contrast to the preceding, this metadata 
technique does not support a hierarchical structure, as the creation of the tags 
is an informal one. The feature has only to be activated for lists or libraries 
before each user (depending on the permission level) can assign her/his own 
tags to the items and documents, or use existing ones.
SharePoint Workflows
In SharePoint, many SharePoint  Workflows, which are all sequential 
workflows, exist out of the box. Workflows in SharePoint can be assigned to 
lists, items of lists, libraries, single documents of libraries, folders, and pages. 
Each workflow in SharePoint consists of two lists: a task list for managing 
the tasks to be performed within the workflow and a workflow history for 
controlling the current progress. In addition, for each workflow, a page exists 
to summarize the aforementioned lists, as well as to effectively control the 
recent status of the workflow. Such pages can be used to analyze bottlenecks 
in business processes in the form of regular reports.
Before a workflow can be initially executed in SharePoint, it has to be assigned 
(associated) to a list, library, document, item, or page. To do so, the user 
responsible to associate the workflow must have the required permission level. 
Of course, not every user should be allowed to associate workflows. Usually, 
the owners of the site or explicit users managing workflows are responsible 
for this. When associating a workflow, different options exist. For example, 
the workflow can be defined by a unique name, specific lists to administrate 
the workflow tasks and the workflow history can be specified, the options 
responsible for starting the workflow can be clarified, and how the tasks will 
be communicated can be addressed. In total, six different workflows exist in 
SharePoint out of the box, each of which has a different purpose:
• 
Approval forwards a document or item to another group 
or user. The group or user has the task of approving the 
document or item. Alternatively, they can also reject the 
document or item before the workflow is finished.
• 
Collect Feedback collects feedback for a document, or 
an item, as the name implies. This is useful when various 
users are part of a specific business process.

Chapter 2 | SharePoint Technology
52
• 
Collect Signatures forwards an Office document 
to other users. Those users have the task of digitally 
assigning the sent document.
• 
Three-State tracks processes. It is used for tracking 
business process, such as problems, or for tracking 
sensitive elements.
• 
Publishing Approval is similar to the first-mentioned 
workflow. However, now the approval process for pages 
to be published on the web is considered.
• 
Disposition Approval supports data-repository and 
data-disposition processes. It is used for automatically 
removing or archiving outdated information.
My Site Technology
During the last decade, social networks have exploded. The social platforms, 
which are realized through Web-2.0 applications or portal systems, are used 
to connect with friends or for following colleagues. Some important social 
networks include Facebook,13 LinkedIn,14 and Twitter,15 to name only a few. 
All provide the typical features: having a personal user profile that can be 
completely or partially shared with other users; possibilities for writing one’s 
own articles in blogs, news, posts, or tweets; a contact list to link different 
users and automatically inform them of newsfeeds and facilitate messaging or 
chatting with other users.
My Site is the social network integrated into SharePoint. It provides social 
networking that includes a personal profile for each user, the possibility 
to set up newsfeeds or write one’s own blog, and, of course, the ability to 
follow other users. With this, it combines most of the capabilities of other 
well-known social networks but adds the new possibility of having its own 
unique aim within SharePoint, namely, to strongly support collaboration, by 
avoiding isolated applications and documents and improving motivation. The 
capabilities of My Site can be quantified as two. First is My Site itself, which 
provides a profile to the owner in which to edit personal information and to 
connect with other users. Second are the features included in My Site that 
distinguish it from other social networks. These include the capabilities to use 
applications and provision of a place for managing documents in a centralized 
manner, instead of having them spread over different file systems and storage 
places.

My Site Profile
As with other social networks, each user gets his/her own user profile, i.e., 
her/his own My Site. The owner of the My Site can edit it, and the information 
can be shared with other users. Five types of information can be edited, and 
most of the integrated attributes and text fields can be specified according to 
which users can see this information (everyone or the owner; see Figure 2-6):
• 
Basic Information allows for editing general information 
about the My Site owner. The attribute Name can’t be 
changed. In the text field, About me, the user can add 
a personal description. In the Picture attribute, the user 
can upload a portrait. And, in the Ask Me About field, 
the user can edit information related to her/his main area 
of expertise.
• 
Contact Information includes attributes to edit 
contact details. Here, the user can add the following 
contact numbers: Mobile phone, Fax, and Home 
phone. The user can also edit Office Location, using 
informal metadata (tags). In addition, the user can edit 
Assistant, using the address book.
• 
Details includes attributes to highlight the specific skills 
of the user and her/his experience. In the text field Past 
projects, a user can edit information about previous 
projects. The text field Skills allows for inclusion of 
technical or soft skills. The text fields Schools, Birthday, 
and Interests are geared toward more personal details 
about the My Site owner. All information maintained 
in Details field of the profile can be used in the global 
search center of SharePoint. This is important, for 
example, if someone does not know the name of a user 
but is searching for someone with specific skills.
• 
Newsfeed Settings lets the My Site owner specify 
what content he/she wants to follow (Followed Tags), 
how she/he should be informed (E-mail Notifications), 
if other users see friends of the user (People I follow), 
and which activities should be shown in the profile 
(Activities I want to share in my newsfeed).
• 
Language and Region allows the user to specify the 
language of his/her My Site, as well as its relevant time 
zone and region.

Chapter 2 | SharePoint Technology
54
The Following feature of SharePoint My Site facilitates connections with 
other people, allowing users to follow documents, track sites, and follow 
tags. Following people also allows users to track their activities and detail 
their skills, knowledge, or recent projects. This is very helpful, for example, 
if a project manager is seeking prospective employees who satisfy specific 
requirements. Following documents allows users to know at all times what 
is happening to documents that are important to the owner of the My Site, 
e.g., if new versions have been created, workflows for management of the 
documents have begun, or if the document has achieved a specific workflow 
status. The Following feature is mainly used for summarizing in a centralized 
manner the sites the My Site owner requires. And, finally, following tags allow 
specific issues that are managed by using tags, e.g., keywords, to be followed. 
The following of people, documents, sites, and tags can be performed by 
searching for the objects, or searching directly on the objects themselves. 
For example, if the user is on a site, a button exists to activate the following 
of this recent site, which can in turn also be deactivated again. The activities 
of followed people, as well as documents, sites, and tags, can all be tracked 
and summarized inside the Newsfeed area of My Site (see Figure 2-7). Here, 
postings, blog entities, and the like of other users are shown, and recent 
activities related to sites, documents, and tags are summarized. In addition, the 
user can start conversations on My Site using the newsfeed area and thereby 
mention other persons directly.

My Site Features
As with other SharePoint sites, new applications and subsites can be created 
in My Site (see Figure 2-8). The user can choose from applications that are 
also available on other sites, such as those to create a library, or of a number 
of subsites based on site templates, such as a site for a team or project. In 
practice, the application capabilities provided by My Site are often used in two 
types of scenarios. First, to allow users to create their own blogs, an own site 
template is utilized. It can be used to share with specific colleagues experiences 
about projects or to discuss personal topics. Second is the application for lists, 
which can be used, for example, to manage the addresses of contacts.

has been, recently following appears at the right side of the figure

Site out of the box

56
In addition to the preceding, My Site integrates advanced document 
management capabilities, by giving each user his/her own central document 
workspace (see Figure 2-9). This can be used for uploading, creating, storing, 
versioning, administrating, editing, removing, and sharing any kind of document. 
The workspace is available using the integrated Documents application. This 
workspace is based on OneDrive, and includes document workflows (e.g., for 
approving documents), metadata management, as well as sharing features. Here, 
users can upload new documents, as provided by the documents application. 
The documents can be classified using folders, as provided by file directories. 
In addition, the documents included in the folders can be shared with other 
users. Other features, such as versioning and metadata features, are provided, 
which makes the workspace a comprehensive document management system.
Figure 2-9.  OneDrive document management interface integrated into the SharePoint My 
Site environment out of the box
Another My Site feature worth mentioning is the capability to manage Links 
(see Figure 2-10). Each user has an individual profile, as discussed. However, 
this does not only summarize the latest news from colleagues. It also provides 
a ribbon for managing links. With it, the user can create her/his own links to 
quickly navigate to the SharePoint sites required or to external links outside 
of SharePoint.

Administration Levels
Administrating a CMS means customizing the CMS according to three 
requirements: technical requirements, functional requirements, and creative 
requirements. Technical requirements concern, for example, the relevant 
server farm, hardware, and the databases used to store the content. Functional 
requirements are that the sites fulfill the claim to support the business task, for 
example, to have the right template on specific sites, to have the navigation on 
the site as needed, to support metadata technologies used for search, but also 
to customize the applications according to the needs of the users. Creative 
requirements are mainly that the look and feel of the CMS are in the same 
form as on other platforms used in the form, as well as on other channels. In 
general, this is defined under the umbrella term corporate design (CD).
In information management systems, administration is performed in the back 
end. The WordPress web content management system, for example, has a 
back end to manage web content, and the front end is only used to visualize 
the content. In SharePoint, the administration must be performed differently. 
The reason is that the system is more comprehensive, as well as the server 
farm behind it. The server farm and the main functionalities, such as crawling 
services, have to be defined in one back-end environment, known as Central 
Administration. Here, the technical settings are found, as well as the more 
general functional settings. Selected users perform the customization in the front 
end, performing as an additional back-end section, named Site Settings. Here, 
the more site-specific functional settings are performed, as is customization. 
Administration in SharePoint can be performed on all topological and global 
levels. For example, if an enterprise uses one web application, including three 
site collections in which each collection has three sites, then on seven places, 
the administration can be performed. In addition, the settings defined for a 
single site can be inherited by subsites. With this, the customization must not 
be performed for each site, as the specification of the site above is used.
Typically, in SharePoint administration, roles are distinguished among three 
types, as follows16:
• 
The SharePoint Farm Administrator (known in 
Office 365 as the SharePoint Online administrator) has 
full access to the SharePoint farm. This administrator 
manages the farm completely from a technical perspective, 
including setting server roles, defining external content 
types, and creating/removing web applications or top-

• 
The SharePoint Site Collection Administrator can 
be designated by the administrator explained above. This 
type of administrator has full access to one complete site 
collection. Usually, for a single site, more users are this 
type of administrator, but only one user is the primary 
site collection administrator. Of course, one person 
can be administrator across multiple site collections. 
SharePoint Site collection administrators should not 
have access to the farm. Their responsibilities are to 
give users permissions to the site collection, to manage 
the site collection, to manage the included pages, and to 
customize pages and applications.
• 
The SharePoint Term Store Administrator can 
be designated by the adminstrator mentioned above 
for a single site collection. This administrator’s role is 
to manage the taxonomies in SharePoint to be used to 
manage the content with metadata.
Site (Collection) Administration
In SharePoint, the administration of site collections and sites is performed 
with Site Settings. This page includes settings to administrate the recent 
SharePoint site from a functional perspective. The page is automatically set up 
when a site or site collection is created. The page should only be accessible 
to users having full access to the site. Depending on the level of the site, site 
settings can be inherited from a more general site to a more specific site. 
For example, users having access to the site collection should often also have 
access to the children sites of the site collection. The site settings, including 
the main subsettings, are as follows:
• 
Users and Permissions includes pages to give users 
access to the sites and to manage the different types 
of permissions.17 Using the People and Groups page, 
the administrator can invite users to the site. The level 
of access is established by using Site Permissions, 
classifying the users into groups. With this feature, 
existing groups can be used or new groups can be 
created. In addition, one page exists to define additional 
Site Collection Administrators, and one page to 
administrate app content.

Web Designer Galleries manages the reusable 
components of sites using galleries.18 In the gallery’s Site 
Columns link, columns that can be used for all lists 
of the site can be created. The gallery’s Site Content 
Type link stores collections of columns, according to 
the content type. The gallery’s Master Pages feature 
stores master pages and page layouts that define the 
general structure of the pages. The gallery’s Themes 
option contains style files to change the look and feel of 
the site. The gallery’s Solutions link stores customized 
functionalities, and the gallery’s Composed Looks link 
stores themes that differ according to the master page, 
font, and style files.
• 
Site Administration is a section that manages various 
functional settings. Regional settings can be changed by 
defining the time zone, region, sort order, calendar settings, 
and workweek for the entire site. Language settings 
allow changes to the site through multilingual packs. 
User-specific text can be exported and imported using 
the Export Translations and Import Translations 
settings, respectively. The Site Libraries and Lists page 
lists all libraries and the lists existing on the recent site.
• 
Site Collection Administration is only included for 
site collections. The main focuses of this setting are 
to improve the search experience and the techniques 
employed to manage the sites of site collections having 
multiple hierarchical levels. The Recycle Bin page lists all 
deleted items of the complete site collection. From here, 
the administrator can ultimately delete the items but also 
restore them. The search experience can be improved by 
the settings Search Result Sources, Search Result 
Types, Search Query Rules, Search Schema, and 
Search Settings. In addition, two settings exist to 
import/export already defined search settings: Search 
Configuration Import and Search Configuration 
Export. The setting Site Hierarchy lists all subsites of 
the recent site collection and allows the administrator 
to navigate to the site settings of the subordinated sites. 
The Portal Site Connection setting is used to link one

site collection to another site collection. SharePoint 
Designer Settings lets the administrator specify the 
access to this SharePoint tool.
• 
Look and Feel is a section including links to pages that 
affect how the site looks. Under Title, Description, 
and Logo, the title of the site and the logo can be 
changed. The setting Quick Launch is a page from which 
the site collection administrator can change the links of 
the launch. From the top page link bar, the site collection 
administrator can change the links of the Top Link Bar. 
Tree view is a page to additionally administrate the local 
navigation. Finally, Change the Look is a page from 
which the branding of the SharePoint site can be changed.
• 
Site Actions is a feature to help administrate the basic 
techniques of the site. The Manage Site Features page 
lets the administrator activate and deactivate features 
on site level. On the page Save Site as Template, 
the recent site can be saved as a SharePoint solution 
(template).
Central Administration
In SharePoint, Central Administration is the location that administrates 
the complete SharePoint farm, i.e., the back end of SharePoint. This type of 
administration is automatically set up when installing SharePoint. The tasks 
that can be performed here to define different types of settings require a 
deeper technical understanding of SharePoint. The main settings that should be 
administrated only by a SharePoint Farm Administrator are as follows19:
• 
Application Management allows managing the two 
most general hierarchical levels of SharePoint. This 
relates to create, edit, and remove web applications but 
also site collections. In addition, service applications can 
be managed and configured, as well as the used databases 
to store the content.
• 
System Settings handles the settings of used servers, 
messaging services, and the farm itself, including the 
management of services, server roles, the configuration 
of in-/outgoing e-mails and short messages, as well as 
the management of farm features and solutions and user 
solutions.

• 
Monitoring allows managing monitoring and reporting. 
Here, the Health Analyzer can be used to monitor the 
status of different services performed. In addition, Timer 
Jobs can be defined to decide when specific jobs should 
be issued, and reports can be created using the subsetting 
Reporting.
• 
Backup and Restore is essential to ensure the reliability 
of the SharePoint site. In this setting, the administrator can 
instruct to automatically perform regular backups, perform 
a manual backup, and check existing backups. Of course, 
the administrator can also restore the site from a backup.
• 
Security is essential to ensuring the stability of the site 
against attacks from inside or outside. This assurance 
is achieved through subsettings to administrate users, 
general security settings, and information policy. This 
includes antivirus settings, the management of blocked 
file types, and web part security.
• 
Upgrade and Migration is required if an upgrade from 
one version of SharePoint to another must performed. 
This is necessary if more functionalities must be supported 
by migrating from the standard to the enterprise version, 
or if a more recent version should replace an older one.
• 
General Application Settings are used to configure site 
collection overlapping settings. These includes External 
Service Connections, SharePoint Designer settings, 
Search Settings and Crawler Impact Rules, Content 
deployment, and PWA settings.
• 
Apps is utilized to manage the applications to be used 
in the web application. To do so, the SharePoint and 
Office Store setting is included, in which apps can 
be purchased and licenses of apps can be managed. In 
addition, the App Management setting controls used 
apps and configures the URLs of apps.
• 
Office 365 is a setting available only in the on-premise 
version of SharePoint. The reason is that the settings here 
are already defined in the online version. This includes 
the configuration of the social-profile portal Yammer and 
OneDrive features.
• 
Configuration Wizard is a step-by-step wizard to 
semiautomatically configure a SharePoint server. It is the 
same wizard used when initially installing SharePoint.

As central administration in SharePoint is also a separate site, it, too, includes 
Site Settings, which are analogs to the site settings for site collections. The 
settings provided are similar to the site settings provided on the site level, as 
summarized in Table 2-5.

Template Technology
In general, a template is a package that includes preconfigured properties. For 
publishing web sites, for example, different templates are available to simplify 
and standardize design and functionality. Using boxes that have a predefined 
style, predefined position on the page, or predefined levels of access achieve 
this. In SharePoint, templates also are available. However, the templates in 

Manager’s Guide to SharePoint Server 2016
63
SharePoint do not focus on styling pages but differ in a functional perspective 
by including different applications and settings. The templates are available as 
site collection templates, which means that a top-level site is created as a child 
of the web application.20 Or, similar templates can be used to create sites as 
part of the site collection, known as subsites. The most widely used templates 
are presented in this section.
Template Types
Each template is specialized to support a specific business task, by integrating 
the required functionalities in a starting setup. According to the license chosen, 
different templates are available. Some templates can be used for a site collection 
and subsite, others only for a site collection, as summarized in Table 2-6. Each 
template differs mainly from another in its predefined applications, including 
lists, libraries, and so forth, the site collection settings, and the predefined levels 
of access to the site. SharePoint 2016, as well as its predecessors, summarizes 
similar templates by differentiating between four distinct types21:
• 
Collaboration Site Templates aim to improve 
collaboration among users. For example, users who work 
together as part a team, a group of users who share 
ideas inside a blog, a group of developers who develop 
applications, a group of product owners and developers 
who work on projects, or a community that discusses 
different topics of interest.
• 
Enterprise Site Templates focus on managing sensitive 
content and information. Such data can be documents that 
are structured using semantic technologies (taxonomy, 
folksonomy), records to document transactions, or 
search centers to allow users to find the things they need 
at the right time.
• 
Publishing Site Templates are designed to publish 
information on any other type of portal. For example, the 
web presence of an enterprise can be published on the 
internet, where anonymous users can access information 
about the firm, or information for staff can be published on 
an intranet, which is not accessible to anonymous users.

• 
Custom Site Templates are templates that are not 
preconfigured out of the box but are defined by the 
administrator of the site him-/herself. Such templates 
contain exactly the libraries, lists, views, and workflows, 
etc., that the enterprise requires for a specific task.22 
Customizing an existing template and saving it as a 
custom site template achieve this.

Collaboration Templates
The collaboration templates are designed to improve collaboration among 
users working together in any way. In SharePoint 2016, the following 
collaboration templates, with their different scopes, are available:
• 
Team Site is a place where a group of users can work 
together. In practice, this template is usually used to 
represent a static group, illustrated inside an organization 
as a department, or as a more general sector. However, it 
can also be used to represent a dynamic team with users 
in different departments or sectors.
• 
Blog is a site template allowing users to quickly share and 
discuss any topic of interest. For example, it allows users 
to post ideas or observations and to share expertise. In 
addition, a blog allows various users to contribute to the 
posts of others, for example, by leaving a comment.
• 
Developer Site is a site for developers working on 
applications for Office. This site makes it easier to create, 
test, deploy, and publish apps. It can be used to manage 
the creation of small development projects. For larger 
development projects, more comprehensive tools should 
be used.
• 
Project Site is a site for processing smaller projects. 
In enterprises, it is used to store project documents, 
milestones, status, and communications in one place. For 
larger projects, other applications should be used, e.g., 
Microsoft Project Server or Microsoft Team Foundation 
Server.
• 
Community Site is a place to discuss topics of common 
interest. It provides different filters and metadata features 
that allow users to see the most relevant posts, categorize 
posts, or rate posts. As such, it is similar to the template for 
managing a blog, but with more comprehensive features.
Team Site
The Team Site template is one of the most famous templates in SharePoint. It 
is aimed to improve collaboration and knowledge exchange by connecting a 
group of users to the information, content, and applications they rely on daily.25
25Microsoft, “What Is a SharePoint Team Site?” https://support.office.com/
en-us/article/What-is-a-SharePoint-team-site-75545757-36c3-46a7-beed-
0aaa74f0401e, accessed March 14, 2017.

Chapter 2 | SharePoint Technology
66
The group of users having access to a team site can be more or less fine-
grained. For example, each sector of a firm can have its own site for a team; 
each department can have its own site; or each group with an even more 
specialized focus can have a separate site. Naturally, users can also be members 
of different such sites. For example, a user can be in an Inside Sales site for a 
team, collaborating with her/his direct team, but also in a Marketing and Sales 
site for another team, wherein the users of Inside Sales and the users of Key-
Account Management can also collaborate.
To improve collaboration between users having access to such a site, the 
template includes by default the following applications: site pages, documents, 
and site assets. In addition, two mandatory applications are provided allowing 
the functionality of this template: micro feed and style library.
Blog Site
By using the Blog Site template, a site is created to quickly discuss topics in 
posts. In practice, the topics discussed in blogs are vary greatly. For example, a 
product of the firm can be discussed in a blog.
The home page of a site collection using this collaboration template lists all 
published posts. Additionally, it shows different blog tools to lead the user to 
the accompanying function. The Create a post function navigates a current 
user to the list to create a new post item. Manage posts navigates a current 
user to the list to manage the different existing posts. Manage comments 
navigates a recent user to the list to manage the different comments, i.e., a 
reply to an existing post. Manage categories navigates a user to the list storing 
all categories. Such categories are used to classify the posts according their 
content. Change post layout specifies how the summary of the posts on 
the home page should look like. Three different layouts are provided out of 
the box: basic, boxed, inline.
To facilitate quick discussion of any topic, the Blog Site template includes 
the following standard applications: photos and four mandatory applications 
are used to support the administration of different blog posts: categories, 
comments, posts, and style library.
Project Site
By using the Project Site template, a site is created to manage projects. From 
the technical side, this template is very similar to the team site template but 
includes additional features to focus on a dynamic team.

Manager’s Guide to SharePoint Server 2016
67
The home page of a site collection or site using this template gives a summary 
of the project using the Project Summary web part. Here, tasks provided 
by the tasks application can be included. For example, this web part can be 
customized to show all project members the tasks in progress or the most 
important deadlines. The home page also displays recent news inside a web part, 
showing the newsfeed. Inside this web part, users can start new conversations. 
For example, if a software developer has a question for the product owner 
about the requirements of a module, she/he can create a conversation using 
this web part. In addition, the home page using this template lists relevant 
documents. The documents are provided via the documents application. In 
the end, the template includes some of the functionalities provided by other 
project management tools, such as Microsoft Project Server, or provided by 
issue tracking systems like Atlassian Jira.26 The template can be used to manage 
smaller projects or projects with less agility. For larger projects and agile 
software development projects, the aforementioned systems should be used.
The included applications are as follows: site assets, tasks, calendar, micro feed, 
and style library.
Enterprise Templates
Enterprise templates aim to provide sites for aggregating, analyzing, and finding 
content. In SharePoint 2016, the following enterprise templates, with their 
different scopes, are available:
• 
Document Center is a site to manage documents, 
including paper-based documents and assets. It provides 
the same features as standalone DMS.
• 
In-Place Hold Policy Center is a site to manage 
business or compliance regulations.27 By using this 
template, an enterprise can manage policies to preserve 
content for a fixed period.
• 
eDiscovery Center is a template to create sites to 
manage the preservation, search, and export of content 
for legal matters and investigations.
• 
Records Center is a site to help enterprises control 
the management of records. It provides the same features 
as a standalone ERMS.

• 
Compliance Policy Center is a site to manage policies 
to delete documents after a specified period of time. 
Such policies can be used over specific site collections 
and templates.
• 
Enterprise Search Center is a search center covering 
the entire enterprise. It provides faceted search and can 
be customized according to search queries and relevance.
• 
My Site Host is a site on which to host My Sites. Through 
My Site, each user can have a personal page. Such personal 
pages perform like well-known social media pages.
• 
Community Portal is a site to list all community sites 
in one directory.28 It allows users to find the community 
that most fits their interests.
• 
Basic Search Center is similar to the Enterprise 
Search Center but without faceted search and with 
fewer customization capabilities. Additionally, it will not 
appear in site navigation.
Document Center Site
The Document Center Site is a SharePoint site collection and site template 
for managing documents at the enterprise level, as provided by a DMS.
In contrast to the SharePoint Documents application, the template should 
be used autarchically. This means that the application can be included as one 
performing in parallel to other applications, but the template should be used 
only to manage documents, i.e., different types of documents. The home page 
of a site collection using this template gives a list of the newest documents and 
a list of the recent documents modified by the recent user. Both lists are web 
parts performing on the underlying applications. To effectively manage the 
documents, five techniques are most important.29 First is the integration of the 
Managed Metadata service to formally classify each document (taxonomy) 
and to use the categorization for navigation. Second is the Documents 
IDs service to classify each document with a unique identifier. Third is

Document Versioning included to create a unique version for each step 
of the document. And fourth is the included Content Types service, which 
enables a document to be specified automatically to the appropriate setting.
In total, eight applications are included to manage the different types of 
contents, as well as to support the previously mentioned services: documents, 
site collection documents, style library, workflow tasks, content and structure 
reports, reusable content, site collection images, tasks.
Business Intelligence Center Site
The Business Intelligence Center Site is a SharePoint site to store, administrate, 
and visualize business intelligence (BI) content.30 BI content is used in 
enterprises to analyze data and support decision making.31
BI Center sites have different characteristics than most other templates. The 
reason for this is that the focus of such a site is not a single application but the 
techniques to enable BI. In SharePoint, the capabilities of BI are achieved by 
using mainly four features.32 First, BI center provides prebuilt lists and libraries 
for BI content, to improve the organization and usage of BI content. The 
main libraries/lists are the Dashboard library, which stores related reports; 
the Data Connections library, used for data from outside SharePoint; the 
Documents library, to store, for example, Excel spreadsheets that are used 
in dashboards, and the Pages library, containing a list of pages stored by the 
BI Center. Second, Performance Point Services content ultimately creates 
the BI reports, scorecards, and dashboards to support decision making. Third, 
the service named Sample files is used to support users unfamiliar with the 
subject of BI. Here, files, including dashboards, spreadsheets, etc., can be used 
to familiarize users with BI. Fourth is the Links service, which offers helpful 
information about BI tools and has a similar aim as the preceding BI center 
site component.
Search Center Sites
Search Center Sites help users to quickly find the content and information 
they specifically require. This is a very important task, as in our digital era, the 
amount of content is rapidly increasing.

In SharePoint, the search centers are a central site from which to perform 
search queries. The types of searches that can be performed in SharePoint are 
full-text search, keyword-based search, and person search. The presentation 
of the search results in the search center sites is also manifold. The results 
can be additionally reduced, using facets performing as filters. The results are 
additionally displayed, not only by the name, but by using the format symbol, 
the data title, a snippet highlighting the first text of, for example, a document, 
and by using its URL to show the storage location. Pagination is shown if the 
results do not fit on one page. In addition, a result statistic is shown, displaying 
the number of detected results. Apart from the intelligent filters and the 
manifold visualization, the user can create a search agent and can define search 
preferences. In the search agent, the user can specify queries. If a new content or 
information is available satisfying the query, the user is automatically informed.
In SharePoint, two templates exist to support search. The Basic Search 
Center, on the one hand, and the Enterprise Search Center, on the other. 
The latter template includes all functionalities of the other search center but 
also additional predefined filters, as follows: Everything, to get results for any 
type of content; People, to restrict results only to persons; Conversations; 
and Videos. New filters can also be created with this template. Both templates 
also include a technology named Advanced Search. It allows users to 
designate filters, word fragments to be included, word fragments to be excluded, 
the definition of the used language, and the specification of new content types.
Publishing Templates
Publishing templates provide sites creating, modifying, and, finally, publishing 
content on an intranet or the Internet.33 In SharePoint 2016, the following 
publishing templates are available:
• 
Publishing Portal (or Publishing Site, as a site 
template) is a site to manage publishing content intended 
for the web. Publishing can be performed on the Internet 
(anonymous access) or an intranet (restricted access).
• 
Enterprise Wiki is a site to manage knowledge. In 
enterprises, wikis allow knowledge sharing by the staff 
inside the system, instead of having the knowledge 
decentralized.
• 
Product Catalog is a site that allows the administration 
of product-related content. It provides the same features as 
standalone Product Information Management (PIM) systems.

Publishing Portal
The Publishing Site template, and the site collection template known as 
Publishing Portal, is a place to publish web-based content, as provided by a 
WCMS. This content can be published on an extranet, an intranet, or on 
the Internet, either for selected or anonymous users. An overview of some 
Internet presences realized with SharePoint can be found on the SharePoint 
demo site.34
At the site level, two different templates exist. First is the Publishing Site 
template, which does not include the capability to use workflows. However, 
such a capability can be activated as site collection feature. Second is the 
Publishing Site, which has an existing active workflows feature. Workflows 
are necessary, if the publishing process requires an approval process. For 
publishing web-based content, four features are crucial and covered in the 
SharePoint Publishing template. First, templates must be available, to quickly 
design the web pages. This is achieved in SharePoint by using master pages, 
which is responsible for structuring the main content of the web pages, and 
through Page Layouts, which defines the position of different attributes. 
Second, the web pages must be organized hierarchically, for example, whether 
one page is a child page of another page. This is achieved in SharePoint 
through different navigation features, such as Quick launch and/or Tree 
View. The third feature concerns the usage of workflows, if the web page 
must be approved before publishing. In SharePoint, this is achieved through 
approval workflows. Fourth, the web pages should not only contain static 
information, if information is reused often on multiple web pages. This is 
achieved in SharePoint through web parts. Web parts exist to query content 
and to show the queried content.
In the SharePoint publishing portal/site template, the above-mentioned 
requirements are supported by the following applications: content and 
structure reports, documents, images, pages, reusable content, and site 
collection documents. Most important is the Pages application, as it is listing 
all pages with its accompanying status. In Site Settings, the most important 
areas are: web designer galleries, for administrating the layouts, as well as look 
and feel, to customize the branding of SharePoint.

Enterprise Wiki
The Enterprise Wiki is a place to share knowledge. For example, the experience 
about a product, or documentation about a module developed or purchased, 
can be stored as a wiki entry inside a wiki portal.
For wiki portals, three requirements are crucial. First, the wiki portal should 
improve the communication of information (knowledge). This is achieved 
when too many communications are considered in the wiki portal. Second, 
the wiki portal should improve the exchange of information. This is achieved 
through techniques enabling to share wiki entries with other users. Third, the 
search ability of information should be improved to help users quickly find 
the wiki entry required. This is achieved through formal metadata (tags). Such 
tags allow the creator, but often also the readers, of the wiki entry to describe 
the content of the entry in his or her own words, on the one side. On the 
other side, the tags help other users, but also the user that created the tags, 
to quickly find or recover the wikis desired through using multiple tags as a 
query.
The above-mentioned requirements are satisfied using the interlinking 
between multiple applications. In addition, other applications are included that 
allow the use of figures in wiki entries or automatize entries using workflows: 
content and structure reports, documents, images, pages, reusable content, 
site collection documents, site collection images, style library, and workflow 
tasks.
Product Catalog
The Product Catalog template is a cross-site feature in SharePoint. It provides 
the same functionalities as a product information management system, i.e., a 
system to semantically structure products.
In SharePoint, and in general, cross-site means that the content is stored in 
one database (system) but can be published on multiple devices and channels. 
Typical cross-site scenarios are referred to as multichannel, cross-media (or 
cross-channel), and omni-channel, depending on the interaction between the 
channels and devices. As such, the Product Catalog in SharePoint is not a 
typical template focusing on specific applications, as it is more an architectural 
template focusing on allowing different types of cross-site use cases and the 
semantic storage of products. To provide cross-site scenarios and different 
types of metadata techniques, different techniques are considered in this 
SharePoint template. This is mainly achieved through three web parts that 

Manager’s Guide to SharePoint Server 2016
73
aim to dynamically search for the products stored on this site and taxonomy 
technologies.35 The Content Search Web Part allows users to build their 
own content search queries. An example of this is a product that includes 
different text attributes (e.g., title, short description, long description, article 
information) but for which not every description should be displayed on the 
published web site (e.g., the query product text should only contain a title and 
short description). The Search Results Web Part is the counterpart to 
the preceding web part. Essentially, it allows to finally publish the searched 
content on the web site. For example, the search query product text is defined 
once but should be used on the web site summarizing all products and on the 
site showing only the recent product with additional queries. The Managed 
Metadata Service (also referred as Term Store) is the most important 
technique of the template to semantically structure the products and to 
ultimately find them.
The managed metadata service in SharePoint provides Managed Metadata 
Navigation and Faceted Navigation links. The first uses the taxonomic 
structure stored as Term Store as local or global navigation on the site. 
The latter uses the taxonomic structure also stored as term store to show 
so-called facets on the site. Facets are contextual refiners for the single terms.
Conclusion
This chapter reviewed the SharePoint technology of Microsoft’s most recent 
release, SharePoint Server 2016, as well as the technology of its templates. 
First, the basic elements of the recent release were explained, including a 
comparison with previous releases. Additionally, a comprehensive discussion 
of the core technologies of SharePoint was presented. Afterward, the core 
element of SharePoint for improving collaboration was discussed, namely, the 
My Site technology. Preceding that was a discussion of the different levels 
of administration. Next, the various types of templates were explained in 
detail. The underlying ideas behind collaboration, enterprise, and publishing 
templates were discussed, as were the different types of templates that can be 
used in real-world business cases.

Hands-On 
Tutorials
This chapter offers practical experience of the core capabilities of the 
SharePoint enterprise content management system. It includes various 
tutorials concerning the main technologies of SharePoint, on the one 
hand, and the most-widely used techniques required in most use cases, 
on the other. The aim of the tutorials is mainly to increase the learning 
process, not only about the technologies covered in the second chapter, 
but also to prepare readers for the best practices presented in the fourth 
chapter. The tutorials presented in this chapter are all based on real-world 
requirements. Thus, a fictitious firm is featured that is nonetheless quite 
similar to one in the real-world. The fictive firm is based on a software 
service provider located in Germany that has almost 25 members.  
Of course, the firm has different departments as well as different roles. 
This allows simulation of the most widely applied functionalities available 
with SharePoint.
The focus of the tutorials is principally on seven main SharePoint capabilities, 
which translate into seven tutorials. Each successive tutorial increases 
in complexity, and each includes exercises that must be performed by 
the reader (user). Again, the complexity of the exercises increases with 
each exercise. All the tutorials and included exercises are aimed at 
readers who have little or no experience with SharePoint. Because of 
this, the focus of the tutorials is on readers who have never customized

a SharePoint site before. Depending on the complexity of the exercise, 
greater or less detailed explanations are provided. After completing all 
the tutorials and exercises, the reader will be able to understand the 
core SharePoint responsibilities. Of course, the reader will not be able to 
perform all tasks as performed by a site or site collection administrator, 
who is typically responsible for customizing a site. However, the reader 
will get an idea of what an administrator has to do to improve the usability 
of the application according to an enterprise’s needs. In addition, she/he 
will experience a methodical progress, meaning that the reader will be 
able to imagine how SharePoint works and how it can help improve a 
firm’s chances of success through its core capabilities. Through this, the 
reader will acquire an idea for which types of her/his business tasks she/
he could use which type of SharePoint technology. In the end, the focuses 
of the tutorials are as follows:
• 
Permissions are discussed to experience SharePoint’s 
possibilities for managing different users with different 
roles inside the firm. As such, tutorials including exercises 
to treat permissions are required for the later tutorials, 
because they treat the different permission levels available 
in SharePoint and the different user groups required to 
assume different roles across an enterprise.
• 
My Site is discussed so that readers can experience 
SharePoint’s possibilities for improving social networking. 
Readers will be able to better understand what My Site 
is and how it can be used to improve communication 
between staff, to more quickly share information with 
others, and have a place for each user to collect news, 
discuss topics, etc.
• 
Look and Feel is elaborated, so that the readers will 
experience how they can quickly adapt the SharePoint 
site according to the needs of their firms. This includes 
techniques to use the already existing themes, to change 
information about the site, as well as techniques to 
integrate personal styles into the SharePoint site.
• 
Applications is discussed, because it will help readers 
to better distinguish between the different types of 
applications and to determine when to use one of 
these types. In addition, readers will experience which 
possibilities exist, to extend, and also to customize the 
lists and libraries created.
• 
Enterprise Metadata and Managed Metadata 
tutorials will help the readers experience how they 
can integrate metadata techniques into SharePoint 

77
Manager’s Guide to SharePoint Server 2016
applications. In addition, readers will consider how both 
techniques differ and, of course, which benefits both types 
of metadata technologies have in real-world scenarios.
• 
Search Center is discussed, as finding the desired 
information quickly is a crucial factor in our digital age, the 
tutorials presented on this subject focus on integrating a 
search center template into SharePoint. In addition, different 
techniques are discussed to customize the SharePoint 
Search Center according to the needs of a specific firm.
• 
Tasks are the scope of another type of tutorial presented. 
These tutorials focus on how to quickly set up one’s own 
project workspace. This includes exercises to create new 
task items in SharePoint and how to nest different tasks as 
subtasks. In addition, exercises are included to assign tasks 
to different users and to administrate the project time line.
The remainder of this chapter is organized as follows. The first section starts 
by detailing the fictitious firm. In the second section, the technical preparations 
to be able to perform the tutorials are explained. In the third section, seven 
tutorials are presented. The tutorials explore how to manage different types 
of users inside SharePoint, how to improve social networking using SharePoint, 
how to customize the SharePoint look and feel, how to use and customize 
SharePoint applications, how to integrate enterprise and managed metadata 
technologies, how to set up and adapt the SharePoint search center, and how 
to administrate and manage tasks of projects.
Tutorials Methodology and Preparation
The tutorials presented in the next section, are based on a fictitious firm called 
ShoptiExperts, a software service provider located in Germany. We’ll assume 
that ShoptiExperts was founded in 2005 and has a staff of 20. In addition, let’s 
assume that two external partners exist, who are mainly provided to highlight 
strategic questions.
The main goal of ShoptiExperts is to implement and optimize e-commerce 
solutions in a B2B (business-to-business) context. The focus of the firm is on 
front-end design and modules to be used in the e-commerce system, named 
Shophouse.1 Because ShoptiExperts wants to improve internal processes, the 
company has decided to use SharePoint. In the section at hand, the firm is 
presented in detail, that is, the expectations the company has of its systems 
are explained. In addition, the preparations required to perform the tutorials 
are also explained.

Tutorials Methodology (Fictitious Firm)
In the past, ShoptiExperts had used only a web content management 
system (WCMS) to organize its online presence. The WCMS was isolated 
from other information. The information and content to be used by employees 
was mainly dispersed over different file directories, mails, or made available 
as printed documents. Overall, all members of staff had problems finding the 
information they required, and, often, the information was uniquely in the 
head of a single employee instead of being available in a system. Those are the 
reasons the firm has decided to invest in an enterprise content management 
system (ECMS). Through using such a system, the firm expects to improve 
the effectiveness of the employees. The main focuses in the selection of an 
ECMS were on effectively managing users, having possibilities to improve 
social networking, having a system able to be customized in terms of its look 
and feel, integrating easily applications similar to the handling provided by 
Office products, having a system capable of using metadata techniques to help 
find information, having a system providing an improved search experience 
to quickly create and manage a project, and automatizing some of the daily 
business tasks by using workflows. Finally, the firm decided to use SharePoint, 
as it covers all those criteria. The firm elected to use the standard on-premise 
version of SharePoint 2016. At a later date, the firm will consider using 
Microsoft’s SharePoint Online.
Depending on the responsibilities, leadership, and productivity, the employees 
have different roles. In total, five roles exist (see Figure 3-1).

Manager’s Guide to SharePoint Server 2016
Across all departments, ShoptiExperts has a total of 22 employees (see Table 3-1  
and Table 3-2):
• 
Director is the paramount role, subordinate to no other. 
This role assumes the most leadership responsibility and 
has no direct influence on daily business tasks.
• 
Manager is the role subordinate only to that of the 
director. Managers have strong leadership responsibilities 
but lesser influence on direct productivity, except during 
escalation phases.
• 
Team leader is the role subordinate to that of the 
manager of the software engineering department. The 
leadership is low, but their influence on daily tasks is strong.
• 
Expert is a position without any management 
responsibilities. Power and influence depend on the power 
of the department an employee is a permanent member of.
• 
Technician is another role having no management 
responsibilities. Their tasks include developing modules 
and front-end design.

Each employee is a member of one in a total of six permanent departments. 
The departments are classified into three hierarchical levels, including sub and 
superordinate departments:
• 
Strategic management is the top-level department of 
the firm having no superordinate department. The main 
responsibility of this department  is the acquisition of 
projects and clients, as well as key-account management. 
In addition, the development of hiring plans and the 
recruitment of staff, depending on new strategies, is 
among its main responsibilities. Only directors belong to 
this department.
• 
Operations management is the department 
subordinating the department explained above. In contrast 
to the latter, it controls business processes on a daily basis. 
The main responsibility is product ownership. In addition, 
customer service and support during the project phase are 
among its main responsibilities. The department is made 
up of a manager, who leads the department, and a group 
of experts.
• 
Office management is another department subordinate 
to the strategic management department. Its intervention 
power is limited, as its focus is on supporting the two 
aforementioned departments. Its main responsibility 
is to issue invoices to clients. The director (of strategic 
management) directly manages the experts of this 
department.

• 
Software engineering is also subordinate to strategic 
management. However, its focus is not on administration. 
It manages the software developers and intervenes if 
development processes are disturbed. In addition, the 
team provides technical consulting before and during 
the project phase. One assistant (expert) supports the 
manager.
• 
Design and support is a department subordinate to the 
software engineering department. Its main responsibility 
is to develop templates to be used by the Shophouse 
e-commerce system arm of the company. Logically, 
another responsibility is the adaptation of templates 
used by the Shophouse. A team leader, who assigns tasks 
to template experts, manages this team. In addition, the 
team leader is also involved in processing issues.
• 
Module development is another department subordinate 
to the software engineering department. The main 
responsibilities of this department are the development 
of modules to be used in the Shophouse e-commerce 
system. Another responsibility is the development of 
data interfaces interacting with the database used by the 
Shophouse. A team leader, who assigns tasks to module 
experts, manages this team. In addition, the team leader is 
also involved in processing issues.
Tutorials Preparation
To take the tutorials presented in the following sections, it is necessary to 
have access to a SharePoint application and to create users.
If no access is already provided to a SharePoint environment, SharePoint 
can be installed locally by using on-premise version of SharePoint. To install 
SharePoint locally, SharePoint must be downloaded, and the Windows Server 
2012 R2 or Windows Server 2016 operating systems must be installed on 
your personal computer or virtual machine. A complete explanation of the 
install instructions can be accessed directly from the relevant Microsoft page.2 
In addition, a very comprehensive video provided to the public explains the 
complete process in great detail.3 As a detailed explanation of SharePoint

Server 2016 is not within the purview of this book, I refer the reader to the 
recommended video.
As an alternative to the preceding, and recommended for starting the tutorials 
quickly, a trial version of Office 365 can be used. A trial version includes the 
online version of SharePoin. Both possibilities include the same functionalities 
required to perform the tutorials and the corresponding exercises. Office 
365 is a cloud service provided by Microsoft. In addition to other useful 
applications, such as Outlook, Excel Online, PowerPoint Online, etc., it 
includes SharePoint. Through this, no installation of SharePoint is required in 
order to gain access to a SharePoint platform. Only an e-mail address must 
be provided. Depending on the type of mail address, the trial expires after 
one month (personal mail), or after three months (professional mail). One 
thing to be critically considered is that the SharePoint provided inside Office 
365 provides another user interface as the on-premise version, known as the 
modern interface. To overcome this, the user must choose Return to classic 
SharePoint, when prompted. After doing this, the look and feel of SharePoint is 
the same as those provided by SharePoint On-Premise.
The firm presented in Tables 3-1 and 3-2 consists of 22 users. There is really 
no need to create an account for every user. For the two managers, at least, 
an account should be created, to allow for the purpose of demonstrating 
minimal collaboration. The creation of a 22-user account (or of two user 
accounts) can be performed by importing Active Directory (AD) or by using 
AD manually. To do so, for each member of staff, a last name and first name 
must be specified, using Table 3-1 and 3-2 as guides. In addition, for each user, a 
login name must be specified, as well as a password. Using SharePoint Online, 
users can be created using the user interface, or through an AD importer.
■
■Note  For all the tutorials presented in the following section, the reader is assumed to be the 
employee named Operation Manager, with full access to all SharePoint features.
Hands-On Tutorials and Their Use Cases
The tutorials presented in this section are designed to provide readers with 
practical experience with the core capabilities of SharePoint 2016. Specifically, 
this section includes tutorials concerning the main technologies of SharePoint, 
and through these, it covers the most widely used techniques required. The 
tutorials aim mainly to increase the learning process with regard to the 
technologies outlined in the second chapter and to prepare the reader for the 
best practices and more detailed technologies presented in the fourth chapter.

83
Manager’s Guide to SharePoint Server 2016
In total, seven tutorials are offered in this section. A tutorial relates to a 
specific goal that an enterprise has. The goals presented as tutorials are to 
set up user management, improve social networking, customize the look and 
feel of a site, integrate applications, use metadata techniques, improve search 
experience, and manage tasks. To better distinguish between milestones 
ultimately required to satisfy a tutorial’s goal, different use cases are included 
in each tutorial. For example, the goal of the tutorial to improve social 
networking includes two milestones (use cases). The first milestone (use case) 
is to maintain the My Site profile. The second milestone (use case) is to use 
My Site features. Each milestone can be considered independently, but both 
milestones (use cases) are required to satisfy the goal of the tutorial. Finally, 
as each milestone requires different steps to be performed, these are treated 
as single exercises. Through this, each main technique being required to be 
completed in SharePoint is considered independently. This has the benefit of 
allowing a success control to be performed after each main step and that not 
too many different requirements are mixed. For example, the milestone (use 
case) to use My Site features includes three exercises to treat three main steps: 
to create a blog, manage documents, and customize links. After each exercise 
has been performed, the milestone (use case) is finally completed. Note that 
the solutions presented in the fifth chapter follow the same conventions.
■
■Note  Solutions to the tutorials can be found in the fifth chapter. For all tutorials, the goal is to 
explain the main techniques necessary to perform the related exercises. Each exercise can include 
practical components and/or functional questions. Depending on the complexity of the exercises, 
either the main steps involved in performing the exercise are presented or complete steps are 
provided. It is assumed that the tutorials will be performed in consecutive order. Because of this, 
not every step is repeatedly explained, as it already has been in a previous tutorial. Please also 
note that important steps to be performed inside SharePoint are highlighted in italic. The same for 
natural words, those are also highlighted in italic. To better find the main techniques to be used in 
SharePoint, the techniques are written as provided in SharePoint, normaly starting with an upper 
case letter (e.g. Site Settings).
Tutorial 1: User Management
The SharePoint user management is available in Site Settings and the included 
menu named Users and Permissions. Using the menus included under this point, 
the administrator of the site can manage different types of permission levels. 
The level of access is achieved by classifying the users into different groups, 
whereby each group can have a different type of permission level. Here, 
existing groups can be used or new groups can be created. The use cases 

Chapter 3 | Hands-On Tutorials
84
presented in this section handle the process of inviting users to the recent 
site classifying those users according to their responsibilities in the various 
departments of ShoptiExperts.
Use Case 1.1: Manage Site Owners
Each user should be classified into a group having an underlying permission 
level. The most widely used groups out of the box are visitors, members, and 
owners. The following three exercises are specific to this use case:
• 
Exercise 1.1.1—Analyze “SharePoint Permission 
Levels”: Navigate to the Site Permissions menu. By clicking 
the Permission Levels button, the accompanying page 
appears, on which all out of the box types of permission 
levels are listed. Have a look at all these and take note of 
the different levels.
• 
Exercise 1.1.2—Utilize “SharePoint Permission 
Levels”: Based on the preceding exercise, mention the 
members of ShoptiExperts who should be granted the 
accompanying level of permission.
• 
Exercise 1.1.3—Grant Permission to “Owners of 
ShoptiExperts”: Click the Owners group and list all 
users who are classified as part of this group. Add the 
user Software Manager to this group. At the end, two 
users should be classified as Owners of ShoptiExperts.
Use Case 1.2: Manage Users’ Permissions
As noted above, different user groups exist. Until now, only the site owners 
have had access to SharePoint. To invite other users, other groups should be 
used, as in the following two exercises:
• 
Exercise 1.2.1—Grant Permissions to “Readers, 
Designers, and Approvers”: Navigate to the People 
and Groups menu and add the users External Director1 
and External Director2 to the accompanying group, so that 
those users have permission to read information, including 
list items and documents. Classify users Office Expert1 
and Office Expert2 into the accompanying group, so that 
they can design, which means also that they can view, 
add, update, delete, approve, and customize information. 
Finally, classify users Strategic Director, Operative Manager, 
and Software Manager as users in the accompanying group, 
so that they, too, can approve content, pages, items, etc.

85
Manager’s Guide to SharePoint Server 2016
• 
Exercise 1.2.2—Grant Permissions to “Contributors”: 
The permanent staff not already invited to the SharePoint 
site should be able to contribute to it. Navigate to the 
People and Groups menu and invite those users into the 
related group, so that they can view, add updates, and 
delete list items and documents. If no such group already 
exists, create a new group.
Tutorial 2: Improve Social Networking
The social network in SharePoint is named My Site. After adding a user to 
the SharePoint farm, a My Site site is created for the user. This My Site site 
combines most of the features provided by other social networks; however, 
My Site adds new possibilities for focusing on the professional user, instead 
of focusing on personal ones. From a functional perspective, the My Site site 
can assume two directions: the profile of the owner of the My Site site and 
the features of My Site. The following two tutorials relate to the editing of 
the profile, on the one hand, and, on the other, the use and customization of 
features.
Use Case 2.1: Maintain My Site Profile
My Site is available by clicking About Me. As with other social networking 
sources, the user can maintain different types of details. To experience the 
possibilities, perform the following five exercises:
• 
Exercise 2.1.1—Maintain “Basic Information”: 
After navigating to your My Site and to the Edit page, 
use the Basic Information tab. Use the accompanying fields 
to describe yourself, write a short statement, upload a 
portrait, and describe your main areas of work.
• 
Exercise 2.1.2—Maintain “Contact Information”: 
After navigating to your My Site and to the Edit page, 
use the Contact Information tab. Use the accompanying 
fields to maintain your mobile phone number, your home 
phone number, your location, and your representative, 
as outlined in Table 3-1. Note that your phone number 
should only be visible to you.
• 
Exercise 2.1.3—Maintain “Details”: After navigating 
to your My Site and to the Edit page, use the Details tab. 
Use the accompanying fields to maintain your last ten 
projects, skills, two highest degrees, and three of your 
personal interests.

• 
Exercise 2.1.4—Maintain “Newsfeed Settings”: 
After navigating to your My Site and the Edit page, use 
the Newsfeed Settings tab. Here, indicate which topics 
you want to follow. Specify that you always want to be 
informed of information related to it and that friends can 
see the people you are following.
• 
Exercise 2.1.5—Save Profile and Connect: After 
saving your profile settings, navigate to the link Persons, 
which will navigate you to the Following feature. Click 
the accompanying button and follow all members of 
your department. In addition, follow all members of the 
executive board, all managers, and all team leaders.
Use Case 2.2: My Site Features
In addition to the profile for each user and the capability to connect with 
others, My Site provides additional techniques that clearly distinguish 
SharePoint from other social networks. To experience those, perform the 
following three exercises:
• 
Exercise 2.2.1—Create a “Blog”: After having 
navigated to My Site, click Blog and Manage Categories 
Remove existing categories but create two new ones: 
Data Mining, and Text Mining. Return and create your first 
post about your experiences in agile project management. 
Add the related categories before publishing the post by 
end of day.
• 
Exercise 2.2.2—Manage “Documents”: Using the 
Apps link, navigate to the application called Documents. 
Create a new folder named Shophouse, which should 
be shared with the team leader of deparment module 
development and all your team members. Upload two 
documents named Strategy and Experience, respectively, to 
the folder. Share the first document with the director of 
the firm, so that she/he can view the file.
• 
Exercise 2.2.3—Customize “Links”: Until now, 
SharePoint has automatically created the links shown on 
your My Site. To customize the links according to your 
needs, add the link to any web page. Maintain the link with 
related text.

Manager’s Guide to SharePoint Server 2016
Tutorial 3: Customize Look and Feel
Here, SharePoint branding solutions are considered, to customize your own 
SharePoint environment according to the look and feel required. For example, if 
your company has its own corporate design, including company-specific colors, 
the colors of the menu in SharePoint should be identical to those of the other 
applications you are using. Also, your company logo should be maintained and 
displayed in SharePoint, instead of the default logo. In SharePoint, branding can 
be considered on different levels. The first is to change the logo, name, and 
quick configuration settings. The second level is to change colors, according 
to your corporate design. The third level is to change the master pages used.
Use Case 3.1: Using and Customizing Themes
The minimum customization of the look and feel of SharePoint is to change 
the title of your site, its description, and its logo. In addition, the user can 
choose from a set of predefined themes. Those types of customizations can 
be launched after navigating to Site Settings and using the web part named 
Look and Feel. To customize the SharePoint application, do the following three 
exercises:
• 
Exercise 3.1.1—Change “Title, description, and 
logo”: Navigate to the Title, description, and logo menu. 
Type the name of the fictitious firm. Upload any logo of 
your firm.
• 
Exercise 3.1.2—Change “Master Page”: Navigate to 
the Master Page menu. Open a new tab in your browser 
and navigate to your SharePoint site. Have a look at this 
site and describe the principal elements that you can see. 
Mainly, describe the different navigation menus available. 
Now, choose the other available master pages (they 
should be Seattle and Oslo) and describe the different 
navigation menus available now. Based on the preceding 
step, choose Oslo as the master page for all channels. In 
addition, specify that the master page you have defined 
should be used by all sites inheriting from this recent site.
• 
Exercise 3.1.3—Customize “Change the Look”: 
Navigate to the Change the look menu. Describe the main 
options you can see, that is, the boxes that allow you to 
edit your site to achieve a new look and feel. Note how 
many different themes exist out of the box. Choose a 
color, orange, and choose a sans-serif font. Move on to 
your site and have a look at the changes.

Chapter 3 | Hands-On Tutorials
88
Use Case 3.2: Customizing Navigation and Links
The elements structuring a site can also be customized. The main element 
most often customized is the navigation, as it is the principal means of 
finding information quickly. To customize the navigation, do the following five 
exercises:
• 
Exercise 3.2.1—Customize “Page Layouts”: Click 
Add a page. Type Welcome to ShoptiExperts Intranet for your 
new page to be created. Move to the page and navigate to 
the button Page Layouts ➤ Page Settings. Specify that the 
page layout should be Splash.
• 
Exercise 3.2.2—Customize “Homepage”: Navigate 
to Page Image and upload a figure illustrating the building 
that your company is in. Click Preview and describe what 
happens. Now, define that this page should be the starting 
page.
• 
Exercise 3.2.3—Publish “Homepage”: Describe 
whether the site is already available or if there are any 
issues mentioned. Decide to Store the page and to Check it 
in. Finally, decide to Publish. the web site, so that everyone 
can actually see it.
• 
Exercise 3.2.4—Customize “Links”: Navigate to the 
top root of your site. Move to the top-level menu and 
decide to Edit Links. If not already available, add a link 
for the page you have created in the preceding exercise. 
Define the link and the name of the link, which should 
be Departments. The button to be created should be the 
first level of the navigation.
• 
Exercise 3.2.5—Customize “Managed Navigation”: 
Repeat the preceding four exercises, to create a page for 
each department. After that, each link will be on the same 
level, which is wrong, as the different departments should 
be displayed as child elements of the link Departments. 
To change this, first navigate to the Navigation menu. 
Describe what you can see and edit in here. Move to 
the Managed Navigation Term Set menu and navigate to 
Site Navigation. Right-click one existing term and describe 
the options you have. Now, move the terms, so that the 
department pages appear below the departments link. 
Finally, decide to again Edit Links. Change the order of the 
links accordingly.

Manager’s Guide to SharePoint Server 2016
Tutorial 4: Integrate Applications
Each application in SharePoint provides functional features to store and 
manage content according to the type of information to be administrated. 
Two main types of applications exist. The persons having the attendant right 
can create an application. On a site level, this is usually the site collection 
administrator. Any application can be added by using the Add an app button.
Use Case 4.1: Adding and Customizing Lists
Each list can be customized according to the content types to be included, 
the rights to manage the list, and its views, i.e., the way in which the list is 
presented to different types of users. To experience the functionalities, do the 
following five exercises:
• 
Exercise 4.1.1—Understand “Custom List”: Add a 
list application named List. Have a look at the ribbon of 
the list you created. List the buttons included in the List 
button, with a brief explanation.
• 
Exercise 4.1.2—Create “Columns”: After you have 
experienced the functionalities of a list, create one column 
of the type Single line of text with the name Surname. 
Rename the Title column Name using List Settings. Modify 
View, so that Surname has the first position and Name has 
the second position. Then, create an item for each of 
your colleagues.
• 
Exercise 4.1.3—Create “Metadata Columns”: Until 
now, the columns Department, Role, and Representative 
have been missing. The two former columns are stored 
as formal metadata (taxonomy). To integrate them, 
create two columns of the Managed Metadata type, with 
the names as given. For each of the two columns, create 
a new term set, using Customize your term set, with the 
relationships provided in Figure 3-1, respectively. Finally, 
assign to each item (person) the accompanying metadata 
(see Table 3-1 and Table 3-2).
• 
Exercise 4.1.4—Create “Person Columns 1”: The 
column still missing is the Representative column. To 
resolve this, create a column of type Person or Group. 
The representative should be included in the list using 
the Last name of the other person. Finally, for all items 
in the list created, maintain the representative, as 
indicated (see Table 3-1 and Table 3-2).

Chapter 3 | Hands-On Tutorials
90
• 
Exercise 4.1.5—Create “Custom Views”: Finally, 
create a new default view that has limited information. 
More precisely, this is a list named Roles that only lists the 
Role and Name of the person and her/his Surname. To do 
this, click Create View in the List tab and add a Standard 
View. Edit the position of the columns. Edit the position 
of the columns having Role as the first column and sort 
items by this column.
Use Case 4.2: Adding and Customizing Libraries
Libraries store different types of documents. Like lists, each library can be 
customized according to your needs. To experience the functionalities, do the 
following four exercises:
• 
Exercise 4.2.1—Understand “Document Library”: 
Add a Document Library with the same name. Have a look 
at the ribbon of the library you have created. Here, the 
tab Library is included, to customize the library according 
to your needs. List the buttons included in this tab, with 
a brief explanation.
• 
Exercise 4.2.2—Create “Person Columns 2”: 
After you have experienced the functionalities, create 
one column of the type Person or Group, with the name 
Consultant. In addition, enable Enterprise Keywords for this 
library, using Library Settings and Enterprise Metadata and 
Keyword Settings. Do not share the keywords with your 
My Site. Modify the view of your library, so that a new 
column is created to manage Enterprise Keywords.
• 
Exercise 4.2.3—Create “Metadata Columns”: Add 
the columns Check In Comment, Created, Created By, Edit, 
and Version to your library. Afterward, upload five Excel files.
• 
Exercise 4.2.4—Create “Personal View”: Finally, 
create a new view that only shows documents uploaded 
by you. To do so, filter in the accompanying column for 
your own account, using Library Settings. Create another 
view, to see the documents created by your team 
members.

91
Manager’s Guide to SharePoint Server 2016
Use Case 4.3: Adding Workflows to Applications
Integrating workflows into SharePoint allows standardization of processes. In 
business, work often has to be approved. In SharePoint, this is realized with 
Approval Workflow. Automatize the process as follows:
• 
Exercise 4.3.1—Activate “Workflows”: Navigate to 
the site collection features menu included in Site Settings 
and select Site Collection Administration.” Activate the 
feature named Workflows, which allows you to access the 
desired workflow.
• 
Exercise 4.3.2—Manage “Approval Workflow”: 
Navigate to the document library implemented in the 
preceding use case. In Library Settings, decide to Add a 
Workflow. Describe which workflows are available. Decide 
to use the workflow named Approval—SharePoint 2010” 
and name it Document Approval. Define that the workflow 
can be started manually, that, when uploading new items, 
the workflow will start automatically, and that changing an 
item will also automatically restart the workflow. Decide 
that the documents administrated using this workflow 
should be assigned to the manager of the operations 
management team. Request that the document be 
checked and approved. Specify that any change to the 
workflow will result in a rejection of a document.
Tutorial 5: Using Metadata Techniques
In SharePoint, two main types of metadata techniques exist: Managed 
Metadata (taxonomy), and Enterprise Metadata (folksonomy). The former 
technique is based on formal concepts summarized inside a set of terms. The 
latter technique is based, in general, on informal concepts that are part of a 
folksonomy, and, in most systems, on what are known as tags.
Use Case 5.1: Using Managed Metadata Techniques
Imagine that you are the manager of the operations management department 
and that you want to create a uniform document workspace for all the 
members of your team. You have realized that the ordinary functionalities of 
folders are not sufficient, as all your members must manage various projects. 
Because of this, you want a document workspace that considers managed 
metadata (see Figure 3-2). To do this, do the following three exercises:

Chapter 3 | Hands-On Tutorials
92
• 
Exercise 
5.1.1—Add 
“Managed 
Metadata 
Document Library”: Add a new column named 
Taxonomy of type Managed Metadata, to your library, as 
created in the previous use case. Add the column to the 
default view.
• 
Exercise 5.1.2—Customize “Term Set”: Move to 
Term Set Settings and decide to Customize your term set. 
Implement the taxonomy illustrated in Figure 3-2 (instead 
of Document Workspace, the root concept Taxonomy can 
remain). Return to your library and explain the changes.
• 
Exercise 5.1.3—Understand “Metadata Document 
Library”: Add a document, Specification to your library. 
Decide to add the accompanying term Specification 
Documents as a property of the document to be uploaded. 
Add to your library additional documents describing change 
requests, documenting modules, and describing project plans. 
For the new documents, assert the accompanying (unique) 
term. Filter for different documents, using this column, and 
explain the experience.

93
Manager’s Guide to SharePoint Server 2016
Use Case 5.2: Using Enterprise Metadata Techniques
As it is often not sufficient to use only formal metadata, it is preferable to 
add informal metadata to each document. For managing projects, for example, 
those tags can define the name of the project or the name of the client. For 
integrating informal metadata, do the following three exercises:
• 
Exercise 5.2.1—Allow “Enterprise Metadata”: 
Move to the library you created in the preceding 
exercise. Navigate to Library Settings and to the menu 
named Enterprise Metadata and Keywords Settings. Decide 
to add an Enterprise Keyword column. Edit the existing 
documents and assert for each document the Client as 
Enterprise Keyword. Note that the keywords should be 
in the form Customer 1, Customer 2, and Customer 3, and 
two documents should have the same customer. Filter for 
client-specific documents.

• 
Exercise 5.2.2—Integrate “Three State Workflow”: 
Add an additional column Three State, which should be of 
the type Choice. Define that the first choice should be 
Draft, second choice In Revision, and third choice Accepted.
• 
Exercise 5.2.3—Start “Three State Workflow”: 
Navigate to Workflow Settings and decide to Add a workflow 
of the type Three State Workflow, named Document Status. 
Choose that a new item added to the library will start 
this workflow. On the next page, leave the settings as 
default. Add a new document to your library and describe 
what happens with the Three State column. Describe the 
workflow history.
Tutorial 6: Improving Search Experience
Finding the right information at the right time is the most critical issue in 
information management. The techniques to find the right content are 
supported by metadata techniques (treated in the preceding tutorial) but also 
through intelligent search centers. SharePoint offers two templates to support 
intelligent search. A basic search center, on the one hand, and an enterprise 
search center, on the other, allowing more customization. Regardless of which 
of these two centers is used, a center can be added to a site, by adding a new 
subsite or creating a distinct site collection.
Use Case 6.1: Creating an Enterprise Search Center
Creating a search template based on a template is the condition for improving 
the search experience. To do so, and to integrate the center, do the following:
• 
Exercise 6.1.1 —Add “Enterprise Search Center”: 
Navigate to Site Settings ➤ Site Collection Administration, 
and, finally, Site Collection Features. Activate the feature 
named SharePoint Server Publishing Infrastructure. Navigate 
to Site Contents and decide to Add Sub Site of the type 
Enterprise Search Center. Give the subsite the title Search 
Center, which will have the URL .../searchcenter. 
Decide to use the top link bar from the parent site.
• 
Exercise 6.1.2—Modify “Search URL”: Navigate to 
Site Settings ➤ Search ➤ Search Settings. Enter the URL of 
your center, created in the preceding exercise, as Search 
Center URL.

95
Manager’s Guide to SharePoint Server 2016
• 
Exercise 6.1.3—Analyze “Result Page”: Go to your 
top-level site and search for Operative Management. You 
should afterward be directed to the result page showing 
your search query results. Describe how your search 
results are displayed. Edit the page using the dial, which 
will now highlight the already included web parts.
Use Case 6.2: Customizing a Search Center
As we have created an enterprise search center in the previous use case, 
the search center can be customized according to specific requirements. To 
customize the search center do the following two excercises:
• 
Exercise 6.2.1 —Customize “Result Page”: Navigate 
to the result page and edit this page. Navigate to the 
Search Results web part and decide to Edit Web Part. Using 
the settings tab, specify that Show View Duplicates link and 
Show sort dropdown should be active. Describe the other 
settings that you could modify by using this tab.
• 
Exercise 6.2.2—Customize “Faceted Search”: 
Navigate to the Refinement web part and decide to Edit 
Web Part. Decide to Choose Refiners. Mention all the 
refiners that you could add. Finally, from the “Available 
refiners,” choose the refiners named Languages, Size, and 
Tags. Decide to newly sort the refiners and to further 
specify the refiners. For the refiner Languages, define that 
the maximum number of refiner values should be ten. For 
the refiner Size, define that the Display name should be File 
size. For the refiner Tags, define that the Display template 
should be of the type Multi-value Refinement Item. For all 
three refiners, mention the other settings that you could 
further define (not duplicated settings). Finally, make the 
new and customized search center for all users visible.
Tutorial 7: Managing Projects
Managing tasks is essential in projects, to ensure that particular aspects are 
performed on time and on budget. SharePoint provides its own project 
workspace, which is aimed at supporting the main functionalities required for 
project management. Its main element is the preconfigured application named 
Tasks, which is a list in SharePoint to manage tasks on different levels.

Chapter 3 | Hands-On Tutorials
96
Use Case 7.1: Creating Tasks in Projects
Tasks in projects can be stored in the corresponding application. The tasks, 
which are list items, can have dependencies between each other, for example, 
if one task must be completed before another can begin. For creating tasks in 
projects absolve three exercises:
• 
Exercise 7.1.1—Add “Project Workspace”: Navigate 
to Site Contents and decide to Add Sub Site of the type 
Project Site. Give the subsite the title Project Workspace, 
which will have the URL .../projectworkspace. Decide 
not to use the top link bar from the parent site.
• 
Exercise 7.1.2—Manage “Project Dashboard”: In 
the main navigation of your SharePoint site, go to Edit 
Links, so that you can add the project that you created 
in the preceding exercise as first-level link to your global 
navigation. Decide to use unique permissions for this 
subsite. Describe the start page of the workspace that 
you have created. On your start page of this subsite, click 
the Working on a deadline box and describe what happens 
to your start page.
• 
Exercise 7.1.3—Manage “Main Project Tasks”: Edit 
the list named Tasks. Add two tasks: Task A, and Task B. 
Both tasks should be assigned to technicians. Through 
using Show More, specify that Task B is the Predecessor of 
Task B.
Use Case 7.2: Managing Tasks in Projects
Often, tasks in projects consist of other tasks performing as subtasks of a 
bigger task. This can also be managed inside SharePoint. In addition, each 
subtask can also be assigned to other SharePoint users. For managing tasks in 
projects absolve two exercises:
• 
Exercise 7.2.1—Manage “Sub Tasks”: For each task, 
subtasks should be created. For Task A, create the subtasks 
Task A.1, Task A.2, and Task A.3. For Task B, the subtasks 
Task B.1, Task B.2, and Task B.3 should be created. All 
subtasks of Task A should be assigned to the leader of the 
team being responsible for developing modules. All the 
subtasks of Task B should be assigned to the leader of the 
team being responsible for design and support.

97
Manager’s Guide to SharePoint Server 2016
• 
Exercise 7.2.2—Manage “Project Timeline”: For all 
tasks and subtasks, specify any start and due date. For 
each task, decide that it should be added to the time 
line (Add to Timeline). Navigate to the timeline menu and 
decide that the time line should be Display as Callout. 
Describe the changes.
Conclusion
This chapter presented hands-on tutorials to practically experience the 
capabilities of Microsoft SharePoint Server 2016. In total, seven different 
tutorials including various use cases were presented, all based on real-world 
scenarios. Before starting with the tutorials, the methodology informing the 
tutorials was presented. A fictitious firm was presented, for which hands-on 
use cases were built. In addition, preparations required to perform the use cases 
were also given. Afterward, the tutorials were discussed, including various use  
cases concerning user management, for improving social networking, 
customizing the look and feel of SharePoint, integrating applications, using 
metadata techniques, improving search experience, and managing tasks in 
projects.

Best Practice 
Scenarios
The functionalities of SharePoint are extensive, as it is a leading enterprise 
content management system and, as such, handles different aspects of content 
management within one application. Because the functionalities of SharePoint 
are extensive and are supplemented by a huge number of users with different 
knowledge and familiarity who use the application more or less frequently, 
it is absolutely necessary to define how the application should be used in 
general and to define how the underlying workplaces are differentiated from 
one another. Both aspects avoid uncontrolled and unregulated use of the 
application, which would, of course, lead to negative aspects, such as user 
dissatisfaction and uncontrolled growth. To avoid these, rules governing how 
to manage and administrate the application must be set up before use. In 
addition, a mechanism that constantly and frequently scrutinizes the initial 
setup rules and adjusts those, according to the feedback of the users or in 
cases of anomalies, must be supported. However, understanding which issues 
should be part of such rules, and how the mechanism to achieve and implement 
adjustments must be made manifest, is not straightforward, because of two 
principal barriers.
The first barrier exists because it is crucial to understanding the purpose and 
elements of such rules and mechanisms in detail. Often, rules are set up that 
do not cover all aspects: existing rules overlap or the mechanism to constantly 
scrutinize them disappears after a while. The second barrier exists because 
the aim of the SharePoint templates, including the underlying technologies, 
must be interpreted correctly with regard to the use cases to be considered.

Chapter 4 | Best Practice Scenarios

Often, users employ the provided functionalities in an impetuous manner. 
This is because they do not consider the global impacts of using a specific 
technique but focus instead on the quickest solution at a particular moment. 
This chapter is presented to help users scale both barriers and to ultimately 
avoid user dissatisfaction, uncontrolled growth of an application, and the 
wrong utilization of SharePoint techniques. The solution to the first barrier 
is covered by explaining best practices with regard to the methodology of a 
so-called governance model. Such a model defines the rules to be set up and 
gives advice about control and adjustment of the rules. Giving best practices 
regarding the use of the different types of SharePoint templates lifts the 
second barrier. How the most widely used templates are utilized to support 
the different use cases is discussed in detail, to that end. In addition to an 
explanation of how to control the usage and differentiate between particular 
techniques, various additional tools allowing for improved manageability of 
the web application, customization of the web application, standardization 
and automation, usability and integration of data being provided outside 
SharePoint, and structuring a huge amount of data using metadata techniques 
are explained in this chapter.
The remainder of this chapter is organized as follows. The first section begins 
by discussing various governance best practice models. These include an 
explanation of how to set up a governance committee and, of course, the 
associated governance plan. Afterward, best practices regarding the final 
use of the different types of site collection and site templates are given in 
the second section. In the third section, tools to more effectively manage a 
SharePoint web application are discussed, including the underlying SharePoint 
site-collections, sites, and pages. This includes a discussion about tools 
provided directly by Microsoft to manage and customize the SharePoint web 
application. In addition, tools presented by third party solution providers, which 
extensively expand the SharePoint out of the box functionalities regarding 
the most important aspects, are presented. These regard the integration and 
usage of more complex workflows, the effective connection of SharePoint 
with external data sources, as well as a more effective use and integration of 
metadata techniques. The chapter concludes with this section.
Best Practices Governance Model
A governance model refers to roles and processes inside an enterprise that 
serve as a guideline for fulfilling, sustaining, and extending the IT planning.1 
Such a model is important to define and control how users of your SharePoint 
environment will employ the site(s). The benefits, in detail, as well as the 
elements of the model are explained in this section.

Manager’s Guide to SharePoint Server 2016
Benefits of a Governance Model
Setting up a governance model before starting to use the application, and 
through constantly adjusting the rules, will mainly avoid uncontrolled growth 
of the application and support its correct use. The four main improvements 
are as follows2:
• 
Organizing content will improve the application, as it  
lets the site user know when a new subsite should be 
created, instead of creating another list or library to 
store information on a site already storing a large amount 
of heterogeneous data.
• 
Storage reduction will be improved, as a governance 
model includes rules for semiautomatically removing 
unnecessary content and subsites. This reduces costs and 
provides a controlled amount of storage space, which, 
in turn, limits obsolete content from being resulted for 
search queries.
• 
Access management will be improved, as the model 
includes rules ensuring that those having access to a 
page, subsite, etc. Are actually the people who should 
have access to it, and that they can only perform allowed 
operations.
• 
Template usage will strongly be improved, as the model 
ensures that owners of a subsite or site collection are able 
to use the templates only as required, instead of allowing 
site owners to use any template for single use case.
Elements of a Governance Model
Each model consists of two elements: a governance committee and a 
governance plan. The committee is a group of users responsible for defining, 
setting up, and constantly improving the model. The governance plan is the 
collection of the rules ultimately defining the governance model.

Chapter 4 | Best Practice Scenarios
102
Establishing a Governance Committee
For developing a governance plan, a governance committee should be 
appointed.3 This committee should be a group of SharePoint users with 
different knowledge of the system, having varying familiarity with the system, 
and having different levels of access to the system. It is not recommended to 
have only SharePoint experts on this committee, as different types of feedback 
are required to constantly improve the SharePoint web application.
The aim and responsibility of the committee are to set up the governance 
policies (i.e., the rules) to discuss the SharePoint issues and anomalies, to collect 
users’ feedback, and to constantly and frequently update the governance plan. 
Even if there are no problems with the site, users’ feedback must be reviewed 
constantly. By holding regular meetings, each plan becomes not merely a 
written document. Moreover, a governance plan is an ongoing process that 
must be perpetually improved. Logically, it is also very important to forward 
any changes in the governance plan to users and to train users according to 
the new rules and processes.
Establishing a Governance Plan
The amount of governance usually depends on the type of site.4 Personal 
sites, e.g., My Sites, require the lowest amount of governance, illustrated in 
Figure 4-1. Sites for administrating projects or workspaces, in general, require 
the second least amount of governance, as usually not as many users have 
access to a single workspace. Sites being provided to groups or teams require 
more governance, as the number of users having access to these types of 
sites is usually greater. Logically, sites to which a whole department has access 
require more governance, as do other team sites. Finally, the top-level site of 
the SharePoint environment requires the most amount of governance, as all 
users have access to this site. The issues of most concern to a governance 
committee can be divided into 12 main areas, as follows5:

Manager’s Guide to SharePoint Server 2016
• 
Information architecture considers how the 
information and content are organized and ultimately 
shown to users. Having a hierarchical structure of the 
web application achieves this. Such a structure considers 
the included site-collections, the subsites, as well as the 
included pages and applications. The main topics are 
what kind of content will be managed on the different 
site levels, how the information will be presented, how 
the different levels are considered in the navigation, how 
specific audiences will be targeted, and how users will be 
able to find the content stored on different levels.
• 
Storage limits are important if the amount of storage 
is limited. If so, it must be ensured that no obsolete or 
redundant information is stored in SharePoint. In addition, 
criteria must be defined that clarify when content is 
outdated and, based on that, how the outdated content 
must be removed or archived semiautomatically.
• 
Site creation considers strategies to be adopted by 
users in creating subsites. The main considerations are 
who should be allowed to create subsites, if the subsites 
must be approved before their creation, which templates 
should be allowed, how much information can be stored, 
and when should the site be deleted.
• 
Site life cycle and retirement are considerations that 
are required in any review of existing sites. These are 
important, as, often, sites are not used permanently, for 
example, a project site of a completed project. Logically, 
this site should be removed.
• 
Permission management considers the roles and 
types of access users can be granted to a site. In general, 
the level of permission a user is granted should be the 
lowest level required to perform his or her assigned 
tasks. It is also recommended that people be added to 
standard groups having the already existing permission 
levels. For managing the access to different levels of sites, 
the permission levels and the assignment of users to 
specific groups can be inherited.

Chapter 4 | Best Practice Scenarios
104
• 
Classification of information is required to help people 
find the desired data and information. In SharePoint, two 
types of metadata techniques exist to classify information. 
Managed Metadata lets users classify the information 
via taxonomy. Enterprise Keywords lets users classify 
the information being stored via folksonomy. Mixing both 
techniques is the best practice for quickly finding the desired 
information promptly.
• 
Data protection is necessary to protect data from 
accidental loss. To overcome accidental loss, back up data 
regularly and store the backups according to different 
rules and systems.
• 
Navigation is a necessary consideration, as it is, after 
the search center, the main element to help users find the 
information and data they desire. The navigations to be 
included should be precise but not too extensive. Global 
navigation should not extend beyond three levels. 
Local navigation should be a maximum of two levels, 
preferably only one level, to quickly find the information 
required for this fine-granular place.
• 
Search must also be considered, as it is the core element 
in the search for information. Having large amounts of 
information on the web application requires that search 
results be filtered. The filtering must be performed 
automatically, by showing only the results of a specific site 
or, manually, by providing advanced filtering techniques 
(e.g., faceted search).
• 
Customization is a required consideration, as each 
enterprise usually has its own corporate design. This 
design provides a consistent look and feel over all 
channels used by the firm (e.g., intranet and internet).
• 
Roles and responsibilities must ensure that the site is 
performing consistently and that all users know what they 
are doing. This involves the issues of setting up a team 
capable of supporting and training users, for example, by 
having a designated application manager.
• 
Automatization is an important consideration, as many 
tasks are performed automatically by the system itself. 
The main issues here are to consider the workflows 
required for automatizing and standardizing tasks.

105
Manager’s Guide to SharePoint Server 2016
Best Practices Template Usage
In SharePoint, various templates exist to create site-collections and sites. The 
three different types of site collection and site templates can be considered 
as preconfigured workplaces that include applications and settings to 
satisfy a specific business task. The collaboration templates aim to improve 
collaboration when different persons work on a project, want to share 
knowledge, or work together as a team. The enterprise templates manage 
sensitive information, for example, documents and records, or administrate 
the search process. Publishing templates, in contrast, are aimed at publishing 
content destined for the web, instead of known users. To better help readers 
decide which template to use for a specific goal, the most important templates 
are discussed in detail following.

Chapter 4 | Best Practice Scenarios
106
Using Collaboration Templates
Collaboration templates improve collaboration between staff working in any 
kind of constellation. The most widely used templates in this category are 
the team site template and the project site template. Other templates are the 
blog template, the developer site template, and the community site template, 
which, in contrast to the other two templates, are more rarely used.
Using the Team Site Template
The Team Site template provides a preconfigured place, including relevant 
applications and settings, to work together as group users. In practice, this 
template is used to represent a static unit of a firm, e.g., a team, a department, 
or a more general sector. As such, the use of this template highly depends on 
the type of team, how many of its members are using this site, and the flexibility 
users are allowed in using the site. In general, it is recommended that the 
content stored on the team site be organized, and the access by single users 
be as limited as possible. For example, users should be allowed only to do what 
they really have to do, and the customization and creation of new lists and 
libraries should be restricted to a small number of users, e.g., site owners and 
designers. In addition, as this is one of the more complex templates, a training 
plan should be established to show each user how to use the team site and 
what the purpose of this type of site is. In summary, the following suggestions 
should be considered and should be part of the overall governance model7:
• 
Permission levels to be used on the site  should be 
established. As permissions levels, the levels of the parent 
site can be used, or unique permission levels can be created.
• 
Consistency and intuitiveness must be considered. 
These are mainly achieved through a clear differentiation 
between the applications and pages used and by not 
having multiple places to administrate similar types of 
information.
• 
Functional navigation allows quick browsing through 
the site and will highly support users in finding the 
right information at the right time. Therefore, it is very 
important to distinguish between the types of SharePoint 
navigations (local and global) and decide on the underlying 
technique (managed or custom).

107
Manager’s Guide to SharePoint Server 2016
• 
Metadata will strongly support structuring the 
content and data to be managed. In practice, it is 
highly recommended that both metadata techniques, 
folksonomy and taxonomy, be used in tandem. Therefore, 
it is crucial to avoid ambiguity between folksonomical 
tags and to have a semantically rich taxonomy. It is best 
practice to use both techniques in common.
Using the Project Site Template
The Project Site template provides a preconfigured location, including relevant 
applications and settings, from which to work with other users on a project. 
In practice, this template is used in the workplace, to share project-related 
documents, to see the status of a project, and to manage the tasks related 
to the project. In contrast to the template for managing a team, this type of 
site should be used for dynamic constellations, rather than for permanent 
teams. It is highly recommended to use this site only for active projects and 
to have a separate project site for each project. This will avoid mixing tasks 
of different projects, mixing documents required for different projects, and, 
of course, losing control over an active project. The template provided by 
SharePoint is mainly focused on administrative tasks, managing documents, 
and determining the project status, not to replace issue-tracking systems. For 
managing projects in SharePoint with the Project Site template, the following 
suggestions are offered8:
• 
Informative start page is important, as it performs 
as a dashboard, giving members a summary of work, 
goals, project status, as well as highlighting upcoming 
events. The start page should summarize only the most 
important details and events. It should not show details 
relevant only to specific members.
• 
Project planning is crucial to effectively manage the 
project. In SharePoint, global navigation can be used for 
planning a project. The navigation can include a list of 
brief status updates to inform stakeholders, a document 
library storing project documents, and a task list to 
schedule the project in detail.
8Billy Guinan, “Using SharePoint for Project Management—An Overview,” BrightWork, 
www.brightwork.com/blog/using-sharepoint-2013-project-management-
overview, January 27, 2017.

Chapter 4 | Best Practice Scenarios
108
• 
Task tracking is important for meeting deadlines. To do 
so, it is most important that each member knows exactly 
what his/her tasks are and their status. In SharePoint, this 
can be achieved by having different views for the task list, 
for example, one global view for the project manager and 
separate views for each team member, showing only the 
tasks that are assigned to the user.
• 
Visualization and reporting are necessary to quickly 
communicate the status of a project. In SharePoint, this can 
be achieved by setting up project status reports, including 
key performance indicators (KPIs) with red, amber, green 
indicators, and by including comment columns.
Using Enterprise Templates
Enterprise templates aim to help manage sensitive content and information. 
The most widely used templates of this category are the document center 
template and the enterprise search center template. Other templates in this 
category are: in-place hold policy center, ediscovery center, records center, 
compliance policy center, my site host, and community portal, in addition to 
the basic enterprise search center template.
Using the Document Center Template
The Document Center template offers a site to manage documents at the 
enterprise level, via a document management system. Therefore, it is important 
to distinguish between this and the document library application, which is 
also used to store and administrate documents. In contrast to the library, the 
document center site and site collection template is a global place to store 
documents, instead of an application that is used by single sites. As such, it 
allows users to focus only on documents and collaborate on documents in 
a single place. This is important, as depending on the size and purpose of 
the enterprise, many different documents may exist that concern multiple 
teams. For managing documents, the establishment of document taxonomy 
is inevitable. This taxonomy should consider all possible types of documents, 
so that each document is assigned the right formal concept. In addition, 
folksonomical keywords can be used to distinguish even better between the 
documents sharing a single taxonomical concept, or to more quickly filter for 
documents. For managing documents inside a document center, the following 
five suggestions should be considered9:
9Gregory Zelfond, “The Top 5 Best Practices for Document Management in SharePoint,” 
SharePoint Maven, http://sharepointmaven.com/top-5-best-practices-document-
management-sharepoint/, January 15, 2014.

109
Manager’s Guide to SharePoint Server 2016
• 
Metadata usage is the most crucial element when storing 
documents. Structuring documents in folders, as provided 
by file systems, has to be strictly avoided, as those do not 
support quickly finding the desired documents. For using 
metadata to administrate documents, it is recommended 
to have a mix of taxonomy and folksonomy.
• 
Content types can be used for automatically assigning 
documents with the right metadata information. For 
example, if a document entitled “Meeting Minutes” is 
uploaded in a PowerPoint file format, SharePoint can 
automatically recognize the underlying content type and 
assign the related keywords.
• 
Alert usage is helpful to avoid abuse of the site and 
misleading operations. The owner of the site should 
always be automatically informed about what is happening 
on the site. In SharePoint, this can be achieved by setting 
up alerts, always informing the relevant users of what is 
happening.
• 
Versioning control ensures restoration of previous 
versions of a document and allows users to check which 
changes have been made across versions. Therefore, it is 
necessary to use SharePoint’s Check-In/-Out feature to 
prevent accidental modification of the same version by 
multiple users at the same time.
• 
Creating views can support faster finding of desired 
information. Therefore, different views based on the 
underlying metadata are recommended. In addition, 
views for different purposes or persons/teams should be 
created, allowing for quicker browsing through document 
libraries.
Using the Enterprise Search Center Template
The Enterprise Search Center template helps users to find the content and 
information they require more quickly. A search center in SharePoint is similar 
to other well-known search engine machines. Like those, a SharePoint search 
center provides a starting page that includes a search slot to perform search 
queries. After querying for a term or phrase, an overview of search results 
appears, listing all results satisfying the query. From a user’s perspective, the 
most important steps when implementing a SharePoint search center are the 
establishment of faceted search techniques. In SharePoint, this is achieved 
by setting up what are known as search verticals and refiners. The former 
technique is displayed under the search slot. By default, there are four verticals: 

Chapter 4 | Best Practice Scenarios
110
everything, people, conversations, and videos. Through these, the user can 
limit the displayed search results, by filtering for the relevant type of content, 
except if the user is filtering for everything. The last-mentioned technique 
is shown in addition to the search results. Default refiners are, for example, 
result type, author, modified date, and size. By using these refiners, a user can 
additionally filter for the desired documents. Both types of faceted search can 
be configured in SharePoint, depending on the purpose of the search center. 
For improving the search experience, the following should be considered:
• 
Search center integration means that the search 
can be performed directly on the site, instead of by 
performing search queries isolated in the search center.
• 
Metadata usage is another crucial aspect to improve 
this type of site. If the data is organized in a structured 
manner, and the information is consistently assigned 
with the correct metadata, the search experience will 
be greatly improved. The reason is that the underlying 
crawler uses this metadata information to index the 
possible query results.
• 
Using refiners will additionally improve the search 
experience. In SharePoint, a large number of predefined 
refiners exist, which just have to be added to the search 
center. Additionally, personal refiners can be created to 
customize the search experience.
• 
Crawling schedules has two benefits: (1) larger distances 
between the schedules, which save resources but have 
the drawback of not always giving the latest status of the 
query results; and (2) smaller distances, which, in contrast, 
require hardware resources but ensure that the latest 
status for the query results is always provided. In practice, 
to crawl and index the documents every day, e.g., every 
night, is recommended.
Using Publishing Site Templates
Publishing templates provide an environment in which to publish information 
on the web as an internet, intranet, or extranet presence. Again, two templates 
are most widely used. The most popular site collection template is pubishing 
portal, which is known as publishing site, if the template is used on a site level. 
Other templates are the product catalog template, to administrate product-
related content, and the enterprise wiki template, to provide a place for 
managing intellectual property.

111
Manager’s Guide to SharePoint Server 2016
The publishing site template is geared toward publishing content on the 
web. As such, two templates exist. The first template is the Publishing Site 
template. The second template is Publishing Site with workflow. Both 
templates are similar. The only difference is that the latter template includes 
a workflow for approving the pages to be published. In practice, not many 
internet sites are realized using SharePoint. The reason is that SharePoint is 
an enterprise content management system (ECMS), and publishing web sites 
are only a single aspect of ECMS. Other systems, in contrast, focus only on 
publishing sites for the Web—web content management system (WCMS). 
Setting up an Internet site with WCMS is, in practice, much faster than with 
SharePoint, as they are less complex. In addition, recent WCMS provide much 
better branding technologies. Thus, SharePoint’s publishing template is mainly 
used by publishing sites as an intranet, or by enterprises that do not want 
to use another system for publishing on the web, and through this avoid 
redundant content. The following issues must be considered before setting 
up a SharePoint publishing site:
• 
Intuitive navigation allows visitors to browse through 
the site quickly and will strongly support finding the 
desired information. Therefore, it is most important to 
have a semantically rich navigation that is not too big. In 
addition, it is good practice to have only a single navigation 
on internet sites. In SharePoint, the used Master Page 
can consider this.
• 
Approval process is necessary to ensure that the 
right information is published and that this information 
does not include any errors. In SharePoint, this can be 
achieved by using the related workflows, i.e., Approval 
Workflow.
• 
SharePoint branding is required to have the site 
take into account the corporate design of a firm. In 
SharePoint, branding can be performed on different 
levels. First, another Composed Look can be chosen. 
Second, using specific color Themes can customize the 
composed look. Third, the underlying Master Page can 
be customized.
• 
Web parts are needed to make the site dynamic. Web 
parts in SharePoint allow the querying and, ultimately, 
displaying of content stored on other pages. In addition, 
the web parts can be configured to always query for the 
latest content, for the most relevant content, or content 
published by specific persons.

Chapter 4 | Best Practice Scenarios
112
Best Practices Additional Tools
Different tools exist to more effectively manage SharePoint web applications. 
These deal with the integration of more complex workflows, instead those 
provided out of the box, allow a more effective connection of SharePoint with 
external data sources, instead of those provided out of the box, as well as 
techniques to more effectively deal with the administration of metadata. For 
all three purposes, the additional tools are either provided by Microsoft itself 
or by third party solution providers. The following section presents the most 
popular and useful tools.
Microsoft Products
To better manage SharePoint web applications, and to customize the 
SharePoint site, Microsoft provides its own tools. The most important tool is 
the Microsoft SharePoint Designer, which helps to more effectively manage the 
SharePoint web applications, instead of using the browser. Another important 
tool is Microsoft SharePoint Color Palette Tool. This tool is designed for 
branding the SharePoint web application according to a corporate design 
(corporate identity across different channels and applications). Both tools are 
available open source.
Managing SharePoint with SharePoint Designer
As noted, SharePoint Designer is a tool to manage SharePoint web applications 
more efficiently, ensuring better structure and, by this, less time-consumption, 
rather than the browser, desktop application shown in Figure 4-2. The 
tool allows for modification of the application from a functional perspective, 
such as creating, importing, and editing page layouts, templates, styles, sites, 
pages, applications, data sources, and workflows. Therefore, this software 
strongly supports building and customizing the SharePoint sites, not only the 
design of SharePoint, as the name might misleadingly imply. No fee must be 
paid to download and use this very helpful editor.10

application 2013, showing the editing of source code11
All operations performed on the SharePoint site itself can also be performed 
with SharePoint Designer. Advanced SharePoint users, usually the owners 
of the SharePoint site, avail themselves of this software to more quickly 
customize the site, including pages, lists, and libraries, instead of always clicking 
through the sites on the browser. The most important tasks that can be 
performed using this tool are the following: creating and customizing lists 
and libraries, managing and creating new workflows, managing site pages and 
assets, administrating and customizing content types, creating and modifying 
site columns, managing external content types and data sources, editing and 
creating master pages and page layouts, managing site groups, and, finally, 
administrating and creating subsites.

first-look-at-branding/, accessed September 24, 2017.

Chapter 4 | Best Practice Scenarios
114
The editor plays also a crucial role in branding the SharePoint site. It includes 
an Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) editor, in which Master Pages 
and Page Layouts can be directly edited like other editors, e.g., Microsoft 
Expression Web. In addition, Color Themes can be directly imported, 
and the creation of style sheets in Cascading Style Sheet (CSS) format is 
supported. Those files can be used to further customize the look and feel of 
the site or to overwrite elements of the theme.
Branding SharePoint with Color Palette Tool
SharePoint Color Palette Tool is very helpful for branding the SharePoint  
site according to a corporate design. The desktop application is shown in 
Figure 4-3. no fee has to be paid for downloading and using the application.12

115
Manager’s Guide to SharePoint Server 2016
With the SharePoint Color Palette Tool, the existing themes can be edited, and 
new color themes can be created. The tool lists as div containers all elements 
of the page and all color attributes that are included on a SharePoint site, e.g., 
the color of the text boxes (title, body, etc.), background colors (header, hover, 
selection, etc.), the color of lines to be used (strong lines, dialog borders, etc.), 
the color of the navigation (accent, hover, pressed, etc.), the color of the tab 
bar, color of buttons, and so on. Single color values can be defined as a hex 
value or can be chosen with a color picker, which automatically specifies the 
hex value of the color to be picked. The tool contains a WYSIWYG (what you 
see is what you get) editor, so that the changes are directly visible in the tool. 
After exporting the modified or created color theme, and uploading the file 
into the accompanying SharePoint list named Theme Gallery, those can be 
chosen to Change the Look of the SharePoint site.
Third Party Tools
Third party tools extend the functionalities provided by SharePoint out of the 
box, or to improve the provided services. Two critical aspects when using an 
ECMS are the integration of workflows and connection to the ECMS with 
external data sources. One other aspect is to effectively manage metadata. For 
this reason, most widely used third party tools are reviewed in the following 
sections.
Integrating Complex Workflows with Nintex
The workflows available in SharePoint out of the box have the drawback 
that all are sequential workflows. This means that they are aimed at very 
general workflow scenarios not having loops, are not designed for very 
large workflow operations, and are mainly based on standard processes. To 
allow customization of workflows, including out of the box workflows, four 
possibilities are considered by Microsoft:
• 
Out of the box workflows can be customized in the 
Browser. However, here, only nontechnical properties 
can be customized, e.g., the name of the workflow to be 
associated, etc.
• 
Out of the box workflows can also be customized with 
SharePoint Designer. Here, the logic, or included 
forms, of the workflows can be modified. Additionally, 
using the designer, new tasks can be included for existing 
workflows, or completely new sequential workflows can 
be created.

Chapter 4 | Best Practice Scenarios
116
• 
Personal activities can also be added to workflows, 
by using Microsoft Visual Studio. These activities 
must now be provided as custom code, in order to be 
included. Additionally, non-declarative workflows can be 
created using this development application, to provide 
the workflows as a SharePoint solution.
• 
As an alternative to using a development platform, 
workflows can also be created by using a graphical tool, 
i.e., Microsoft Visio. The workflows to be created 
within this application can be imported into SharePoint 
Designer or Visual Studio, for further development.
The drawback of the Microsoft technologies is that the workflows are 
either only sequential workflows or must be developed. The latter is a very 
expensive undertaking, as it must be performed by a software developer 
and is, of course, very time-consuming. To allow more complex workflows 
in SharePoint without the need to develop them is to refer to other 
workflow management tools supporting SharePoint. The most important 
third  party provider for SharePoint workflows is Nintex. This firm, based 
in Melbourne, NSW Australia, specializes in expanding Microsoft SharePoint 
products. Nintex has had the vision to increase productivity and efficiency 
of enterprises by making techniques easier to understand and to customize 
and implement.13 The Nintex workflow engine has a graphical editor with 
the aim of functionally extending the workflow engine already provided out 
of the box by SharePoint. Through this, it provides a direct integration into 
SharePoint and its workflow foundation. In contrast to the above-mentioned 
possibilities provided by Microsoft, Nintex facilitates the creation of extensive 
state-machine workflows without any line of coding, as each workflow can be 
defined graphically. It provides many templates, and the predefined steps can 
be added simply via drag and drop.
Connecting SharePoint with Layer 2 BDLC
SharePoint provides Business Connectivity Services (BCS) out of the box. 
With BCS, external data resources can be integrated in SharePoint lists. For 
integration of external data resources, the external resource must be verified.
BCS requires a good technical understanding, and the handling required to 
perform these operations with SharePoint Designer must be learned. A much 
quicker solution for integrating almost any type of external data is to use the

Nintex vs. K2,” Collab365 Community, https://collab365.community/choose-best-
sharepoint-workflow-tool-ootb-vs-nintext-vs-k2/, accessed January 12, 2017.

117
Manager’s Guide to SharePoint Server 2016
Business Data List Connector (BDLC) provided by Layer2.14 The BDLC allows 
different database interfaces, e.g. Open Database Connectivity (ODBC), 
connection strings, as well as an editor to include SQL queries. The core 
benefit of using BDLC instead of BCS is the possibility to modify content 
types, more precisely, its columns, as well as the possibility of integrating 
workflows and the opportunity to update lists.
Managing Term Sets with Taxonomy Manager
SharePoint provides out of the box the Term Store Management Tool, 
to maintain taxonomies (term sets). It allows the basic functionalities, such 
as creating new term sets, modifying single terms, or extending existing sets.
For dealing with taxonomies to be used in SharePoint more efficiently, Layer2 
provides a Taxonomy Manager.15 This allows advanced export and import 
functionalities and supports the most widely used format, Simple Knowledge 
Organization System (SKOS), instead of only allowing taxonomies expressed in 
Comma Separated Value (CSV) file format. In addition, it allows management of 
additional SharePoint attributes, such as content classification rules, and allows 
updating of existing SharePoint term sets without losing classified information.
Conclusion
This chapter presented valuable best  practice scenarios for Microsoft 
SharePoint. First, advice to be considered before implementing SharePoint 
inside an enterprise was given, but also suggestions on what to consider when 
SharePoint is already functioning. The improvements discussed were mainly 
achieved by explaining how a governance model should be established, including 
the foundation of a governance committee, and the concrete ways of setting 
up a comprehensive governance plan. Next, best practices regarding the use 
of different templates were given. Here, the most widely used collaboration, 
enterprise, and publishing site templates were discussed. At the end of this 
chapter, additional tools were identified and discussed. Such tools can help to 
more effectively brand, customize, and utilize SharePoint applications. These 
included different products provided by Microsoft, as well as various products 
provided by third party providers.

Hands-On 
Solutions
To experience the core capabilities of the SharePoint 2016 enterprise 
content management system practically, seven tutorials were presented in the 
third chapter. Specifically, tutorials were included to offer readers hands-on 
experience with SharePoint’s different functionalities for the following: 
managing users’ different levels of access to the web application; improving 
social networking in firms by creating social profiles and by using social 
features; more or less complicated customizing of the look and feel of the 
application being shown to users; integrating different types of applications, 
including customizing those for effective management using workflows; 
utilizing different types of metadata techniques to help find and structure 
heterogeneous information (content, documents, data); and, finally, managing 
and administering different types of tasks occurring in projects and teams. 
With the help of the tutorials, readers gained practical experience of which 
areas are most important for managing enterprises’ content and how those 
areas can be covered using Microsoft SharePoint Server 2016. To help readers 
better translate them into a real-world environment, the tutorials were based 
on a fictitious firm, albeit with very real-world features.
In this chapter, solutions to the tutorials in chapter 3 are discussed in detail. 
Different use cases for each tutorial presented in chapter 3 are considered, 
including a number of exercises. This has been done to differentiate 
methodologically between the different existing core techniques. The solutions 
are presented using the same convention of not obscuring the overview and to 
quickly find the answers required. Because of this, each solution again includes 
5

several use cases. In turn, each use case includes several exercises. Logically, the 
solutions to the tutorials and the exercises increase in complexity. However, 
different from the tutorials in chapter 3, each exercise is presented in detail, 
regardless of its complexity. By having performed the tutorials in chapter 3, 
this chapter can be used as a learning control or answer key, if the reader has 
not performed all the exercises. After doing the tutorials, and by using this 
chapter, readers will understand SharePoint’s main capabilities, regardless of 
their expertise.
The remainder of this chapter is organized as follows. The first section starts 
by detailing how the solutions are presented. In the second section, solutions 
to the seven tutorials are presented. Of course, these include solutions for the 
use cases and exercises included in each tutorial.
Solutions Methodology and Preparation
The solutions presented aim to help understand the main technologies of 
SharePoint, based on those presented in chapter 3. This means that for 
the tutorials, which include different use cases, a step-by-step explanation 
is given, including how to perform and operate various techniques. In total, 
solutions are presented for seven areas of SharePoint 2016, covering most 
of the most important areas and tasks supported and covered by SharePoint: 
user management, improving social networking, customization of the look and 
feel, integration of applications, using metadata techniques, improving search 
experience, and managing tasks.
All the tutorials presented in chapter 3 are based on a fictional firm named 
ShoptiExperts. The main objective of ShoptiExperts is to implement and 
optimize e-commerce solutions in a B2B (business-to-business) context.1 The 
focus of ShoptiExperts is on front-end design and the Shophouse modules 
used by the e-commerce system. Because ShoptiExperts wants to improve its 
internal processes, the company decided to use SharePoint. All the tutorials 
and, likewise, all the solutions, are based on real-world requirements to improve 
companies’ efficiency in or by the seven areas and tasks previously mentioned. 
In this section, the general characteristics of the firm are outlined. These 
include the expectations the company has of its systems and the preparations 
required to implement them.
Solutions Methodology (Fictional Firm)
ShoptiExperts has 22 staff members. The different staff is organized according 
to different roles. Of course, the staff also is organized hierarchically in formal 
departments. For more details about the firm, including departments and staff, 
see chapter 3.
1Fictivious e-commerce system.

Manager’s Guide to SharePoint Server 2016
121
Before having implemented SharePoint 2016, ShoptiExperts had only used a 
web content management system (WCMS) to handle its online presence. In 
contrast to SharePoint, the WCMS focused only on one specific requirement, 
namely, establishing an online presence. Other information and data that the 
enterprise generated was spread over different file directories, electronic mail, 
or as printed documents. Because of this, before having implemented SharePoint, 
staff had problems finding the information they desired, information got lost, 
and, often, the information was imparted only to individual employees rather 
than system-wide. Those are the reasons why the firm decided to invest in 
Microsoft SharePoint Server 2016. After SharePoint was finally implemented, 
the first internal projects were to customize and use the system to get the 
most out of its application. These initial steps, meaning the adaptation of the 
application in accordance with ShoptiExperts’s requirements, were performed 
through the tutorials.
Solutions Preparation
For understanding the solutions presented in the next section, no technical 
preparation is required. The solutions can also be understood without having 
access to a SharePoint environment, as the most important steps are also 
illustrated as screenshots. However, it is highly recommended that the reader 
complete the tutorials as preparation to understand the solutions.
Hands-On Solutions and Their Use Cases
This section allows readers to experience the solutions to the different 
tutorials firsthand. The solutions for the different areas of SharePoint 2016 
are presented using the same convention as the tutorials themselves.
For each of the tutorials, a solution bearing the same name is presented. 
Again, each solution is divided into different use cases. The use cases have 
the same name as the tutorials presented in chapter 3. Use cases belonging 
to a related solution cover the same area of SharePoint. However, those differ 
according to the techniques used. For most solutions, the use cases build upon 
the use case(s) belonging to an identical resolution. As such, the use cases 
can be considered as phases required to achieve a functionality required in 
a real-world context. In addition, by dividing the tutorials into separate use 
cases, they can be performed independent of one another. Of course, the 
steps ultimately explained are presented through the exercises. Again, the 
same titles are used. The exercises allow the reader to understand which 
steps are required to fulfill a use case, that is, the steps that are necessary to 
satisfy a real-world and concrete requirement with SharePoint. The individual 
exercises and the discussion of each step required to perform these are 
discussed in a comprehensive manner. It follows, then, that the explanations 

Chapter 5 | Hands-On Solutions
122
are based on the same methodologies as for the tutorials, meaning that they 
reference the fictional firm and that the user assumes the role of site owner. 
In the end, the reader can switch between chapters (3 and 5), without losing 
sight of the overview and without ignoring steps that must be performed with 
SharePoint. In addition to the steps being explained in detail, illustrations are 
also provided. This graphical representation illustrates the core results that 
occur during the fulfillment of a use case. For this, the front end of SharePoint 
is shown.
■
■Note  For all solutions presented in the following section, the reader is assumed to be the 
employee named Operations Manager, with full access to the site. The author, Heiko Angermann, 
implements the solutions as Operations Manager. Because of this, the screenshots often refer to 
Heiko Angermann. Please also note that important steps to be performed inside SharePoint are 
highlighted in italic. The same for natural words, those are also highlighted in italic. To better find 
the main techniques to be used in SharePoint, the techniques are written as provided in SharePoint, 
normaly starting with an upper case letter (e.g. Site Settings).
Solution 1: User Management
SharePoint user management is available in Site Settings, under the section 
titled Users and Permissions. From the menus included, the administrator of 
the site can manage permission levels. In addition, the administrator can invite 
other users to the recent site. The level of access is established by classifying 
users into different groups, whereby each group can have a different type of 
permission level. Here, existing groups can be used, or new groups can be 
created. The solutions presented in this section refer to use cases in which 
users invited to the recent site are granted full access, and other users are 
classified into additional user groups granted different degrees of more limited 
access.
Use Case 1.1: Manage Site Owners
In the Site Permissions menu, all types of permission levels are listed. From the 
site People and Groups, the groups that have already been created are listed. 
The solutions for the exercises are as follows:
• 
Exercise 1.1.1—Analyze “SharePoint Permission 
Levels”: Seven permission levels exist out of the 
box (see Figure 5-1): Full Control contains all available 
SharePoint permissions. Design allows for viewing, adding, 
updating, deleting, approving, and customizing. Essentially, 
this means that users with this type of permission can 

Manager’s Guide to SharePoint Server 2016
123
create lists and libraries but also are allowed to edit 
existing pages or change the look and feel of the site.  
Edit, allows for lists to be added, edited, and deleted, as well 
as for users to view, add, update, and delete list items and 
documents. Contribute allows for viewing, adding, updating, 
and deleting list items and documents. Read allows for 
viewing pages and list items and downloading documents. 
Create new subsite allows for creating subsites. View Only 
allows users to view pages, list items, and documents but 
does permit editing of any of the preceding. Note that 
there can be additional permission levels, depending on 
the version and license of SharePoint.
• 
Exercise 1.1.2—Utilize “SharePoint Permission 
Levels”: The owner of the site should be assigned the 
Full Control level. Based on our fictional firm, only the 
Operations Manager and the Software Manager should 
be granted this level of permission. All technicians and 
experts should be granted the Read permission level. 
All team-leaders should be assigned the Contribute 
permission level. Directors should receive the Design 
permission level.
• 
Exercise 1.1.3—Grant Permission to “Owners of 
ShoptiExperts”: By navigating to Site Settings, users 
can administrate the different user groups, via the Site 
Permissions menu, under Users and Permissions. Here, all 
groups are listed, and all groups are ascribed a specific 
level of permission. In the group named Owners of 
ShoptiExperts, the user named Operations Manager is 
listed. Using the New button, a new user can be added 
to this group. By typing the name of the other owner, 
named Software Manager, and clicking Share, this user can 
be classified as the owner of the recent site.
Figure 5-1.  Permission levels in SharePoint existing out of the box

Chapter 5 | Hands-On Solutions
124
Use Case 1.2: Manage Users Permissions
By navigating to Site Settings ➤ Users and Permissions, the owner can access 
the user-management menu named People and Groups. The solutions for the 
exercises are as follows:
• 
Exercise 1.2.1—Grant Permissions to “Readers, 
Designers, 
and Approvers”: 
By 
clicking 
the 
corresponding group, an overview appears, wherein all 
members who are part of this group are listed. The group 
that allows the permission level for reading is the group 
named Visitors. The group that allows the permission level 
to design is the group named Designers. The group that 
allows the permission level to approve things is the group 
named Approvers. By clicking the accompanying group, 
new users can be added (see Figure 5-2).
• 
Exercise 1.2.2—Grant Permissions to “Contributors”: 
Until now, no group has been assigned the permission 
level allowing contributing. The Create Group button is 
used to forward permissions to a new site. A name for 
the new group to be created can be defined, as well as an 
optional description. Using the section Owner, an owner 
of the group can be specified. The owner should be the 
one user having full control of the site, i.e., a site collection 
administrator. Under the section Group Settings, who can 
view the membership of the group and who can edit the 
membership of the group can be specified. These settings

Manager’s Guide to SharePoint Server 2016
125
do not have to be changed. Below, another section is 
shown that allows for specifying Membership Requests. 
The final section, named Give Group Permission to this Site, 
is provided to assign the group to be created the right 
type of permission level. Here, the permission level titled 
Contribute—Can view, add, update, and delete list items and 
documents must be chosen. By clicking the accompanying 
group, new users can be added, as described in the 
preceding use case.
Solution 2: Improve Social Networking
For each user, a My Site is created in SharePoint. This can be accessed by 
clicking the link leading the user to her/his profile, titled About Me. Alternatively, 
by using the Newsfeed button in the SharePoint ribbon, the user is forwarded 
to her/his My Site.
Use Case 2.1: Maintain My Site Profile
By clicking the photo of the My Site owner, or by clicking the Edit Profile 
button, the user is forwarded to a new view, where she/he can edit her/
his own profile. Right away, different editable part areas appear as tabs to 
customize the profile. The different areas and subelements included in these 
areas can be modified as to which person can view the content. The solutions 
for the exercises are as follows:
• 
Exercise 2.1.1—Maintain “Basic Information”: 
From the Basic Information tab, the user can enter a 
personal description with About Me (see Figure 5-3). 
In the Picture variable, the user can upload a picture to 
help others easily recognize the owner of the My Site. In 
the variable Ask Me About, users can maintain tags about 
topics they can help others with, such as responsibilities 
or areas of expertise. Each of the variables cannot be 
adjusted according to who can see the mentioned 
variable. All variables are visible for every user of the 
SharePoint site. There are two other variables: Name and 
Manager (optional). Both cannot be modified, as they are 
assigned when setting up the user, or when another user 
designates the recent owner as the assistant of another 
person.

Chapter 5 | Hands-On Solutions
126
• 
Exercise 2.1.2—Maintain “Contact Information”: 
In the Contact Information tab, the user can maintain 
information about how she/he can be contacted (see 
Figure 5-4). The Work email variable cannot be edited, 
as it is provided when setting up the user profile. With 
the Mobile phone variable, the user can enter a contact 
number of a mobile device. To this number, text messages 
will be sent, for example, if notification is activated. In 
the variables following, the user can enter a Fax number, 
a Home phone number, her/his Office Location, and one 
Assistant. The variable to specifiy the location of the office 
is baded on taxonomy. Therefore, the user can choose 
only from locations maintained as a term of a term set. 
Similar for specifying an asisstant. This is not based on 
taxonomy, but only existing users can be choosen. The 
variables Fax, Home phone, and Office Location can be 
adjusted according to the persons allowed to see this 
information. The other variables mentioned are visible 
by Everyone.

• 
Exercise 2.1.3—Maintain “Details”: From the Details 
tab, the user can maintain five variables, which are all 
adjustable according to the persons allowed to see them 
(see Figure 5-5). In the Past projects variable, the user 
can enter information about previous projects, teams, 
or groups. In the Skills variable, the user can enter, for 
example, skills that are necessary to perform her/his job. 
In the Schools variable, the user can enter her/his previous 
academic institutions. Additionally, she/he can use the 
Birthday variable, to enter her/his month and day of birth, 
and the variable Interests, to enter personal and business-
related interests. For maintaining the latter variables, tags 
must be used.

• 
Exercise 2.1.4—Maintain “Newsfeed Settings”: In 
the Newsfeed Settings tab, the user can modify how she/he 
wants to be informed, and about what she/he should be 
informed (see Figure 5-6). In the Followed #Tags variable, 
the user can enter the Enterprise Keywords, she/he wants 
to follow. This variable can be adjusted, according to 
its visibility. From the Email Notifications tab, users can 
specify how and when they should be informed, if there 
is new content related to one of the above-maintained 
keywords. Using the People I follow variable, the user can 
decide if other users are permitted to see the people 
they are following. Finally, using the variable Activities I 
want to share in my newsfeed, users can specify what they 
want to share. After editing the profile using the four 
tabs, the changes must be confirmed, by clicking the Save 
all and close button.

Exercise 2.1.5—Save Profile and Connect: In the 
upper right corner of My Site, the headlines People, 
Documents, Sites, and Tags appear. All four list which 
artifacts (people, documents, etc.) the recent user is 
following. Using the People button, the user is navigated 
to an overview showing all people the user is following. 
Using the text box, and the button Follow, the user can 
add multiple users who also have access to the recent 
SharePoint site. Those users are recognized by their 
e-mail address or their name. The added users are the 
followers of the My Site owner, i.e., the people she/he is 
now connected with.

Use Case 2.2: My Site Features
In addition to those that maintain a user’s personal profile, My Site provides 
additional features. In the following use case, the creation of a blog is considered, 
including a document management library and the customization of links. The 
solutions for the exercises are as follows:
• 
Exercise 2.2.1—Create a “Blog”: In the local 
navigation of the newsfeed environment, the Blog link 
is already integrated. After clicking the link, the user is 
forwarded to her/his own blog. Here, it is shown that 
different categories of blog entries already exist. However, 
using the Blog tools button, the user is forwarded to a site 
wherein she/he can remove the existing categories and 
also create new categories as list items. Using Blog tools 
again, the user can Create a post, i.e., a blog post. These 
posts can be classified into the categories entered in the 
Category variable in the previous step (see Figure 5-7). 
Using the Title variable, which is mandatory, the author 
can write a title for the post. Using the Body variable, 
the user can write the text of the post message. Finally, 
the mandatory variable Published, lets the author of 
the recent post specify when the blog entry should be 
published (see Figure 5-8).
Figure 5-7.  Managing categories for a blog post

Manager’s Guide to SharePoint Server 2016

• 
Exercise 2.2.2—Manage “Documents”: In each 
SharePoint My Site, the SkyDrive (also named OneDrive) 
functionality is already included. In SharePoint 2016, 
this functionality is available via the already integrated 
app named Documents (shown in Figure 5-9). This gives 
every user a centralized place for storing and managing 
documents. The documents can be structured into 
folders, and the documents and folders can be shared 
with other users. In addition, documents that the owner 
of the My Site is following are shown, and workflows can 
be added to the documents. By default, the Shared with 
Everyone folder exists, which means that every document 
stored inside this folder is visible to every user. Using the 
Files ribbon, the user can create a New Folder by specifying 
its name. Using the Shared With button, the owner can 
precisely specify who is allowed to see the documents 
being stored inside this folder. The added persons are 
notified by e-mail. Inside the folder (also outside folders), 
a New Document can be added. Using the Share function, 
the document can also be released to people who do not 
have access to the global folder.

132
• 
Exercise 2.2.3—Customize “Links”: Using the Edit 
Links button, part of the local navigation of My Site, the 
user can quickly edit the shown links and also add new 
links to this navigation. The pages to be added can be 
specified according the Text to display and according to 
the Address, meaning that the URL of the site is to be 
included as a link (see Figure 5-10).
Solution 3: Customize Look and Feel
Very often, the look and feel of SharePoint must be customized. This is 
referred to by the term SharePoint branding. The branding can be performed 
on different levels, depending on the budget. If SharePoint is only used as 
an intranet, the techniques provided out of the box are often enough to 
customize the look and feel. In SharePoint, this type of customizing can be 
performed as part of the Site Settings, from the Look and Feel menu.

Use Case 3.1: Using and Customizing Themes
The first steps are to customize the basic information shown to the users: title 
of the site and the logo. In addition, what are called themes are used. These 
allow quick customization of the application according to a color palette 
more appropriate to an enterprise’s corporate identity. The solutions for the 
exercises are as follows:
• 
Exercise 3.1.1—Change “Title, description, and 
logo”: By navigating to the Site Settings page, all possible 
settings appear. In the top right of this site, the Look 
and Feel menu appears. By clicking the submenu Title, 
description, and logo, a new site appears (see Figure 5-11). 
Here, the user can specify the Title of the SharePoint site, 
including a Description of it. Below, using Insert Logo, a logo 
can be uploaded to SharePoint. Here, the user can upload 
a new logo, or use a logo already uploaded to SharePoint. 
Figure 5-11.  Editing the title, description, and logo of the SharePoint site

Chapter 5 | Hands-On Solutions
134
• 
Exercise 3.1.2—Change “Master Page”: Navigating 
to Site Settings, the Look and Feel menu appears at the top 
right. The section allowing editing the master page does 
not appear yet. To overcome this, the SharePoint Server 
Publishing Infrastructure and SharePoint Server Publishing 
features must be activated. To do so, the Site collection 
features submenu of the Site Collection Administration menu 
must be chosen. A site appears in which the previously 
mentioned feature can be activated (see Figure 5-12). 
Afterward, the Manage site features submenu of the Site 
Actions menu must be chosen. Here, the SharePoint Server 
Publishing feature must be activated (see Figure 5-13). 
Afterward, the Master page submenu appears below the 
Look and Feel menu. On clicking this submenu, a new site 
appears. Here, two main sections appear (see Figure 5-14).  
In the first section, the Site Master Page can be defined. 
This means that the master page, which is used by all sites 
and visible to every user, is defined. In the second section, 
the System Master Page can be defined. This means that 
the master page, which is used by all sites and includes 
the techniques used to administrate the site, is defined. In 
both sections, the user can choose two existing master 
pages, Seattle and Oslo, by using a drop-down menu. Each 
section further includes two click boxes. In the first 
box, the user can choose whether the page should be 
inherited from its parent site, or vice versa. The first 
option is grayed out, as it is only possible to inherit from 
parent sites, if you are not customizing the top-level site 
of your SharePoint environment. In addition, a further 
click box appears below the drop-down menu in the 
two sections, where it can be specified if the subsites 
must be reset, inheriting this master page’s setting(s). 
After clicking OK and looking at the other browser tab, 
it becomes obvious that the navigation has completely 
changed. Now, the global navigation appears at the top, 
and the top navigation does not exist anymore.

• 
Exercise 3.1.3—Customize “Change the Look”: 
Navigating to Site Settings, the Look and Feel menu appears, 
including its Change the look submenu. After clicking this 
submenu, 18 styles are shown. The templates differ 
according to color and the navigations and fonts used. 
After clicking one template, a new site appears (see 
Figure 5-15). Here, the user can change the image shown 
on the SharePoint site, a new color palette can be chosen 
(Colors), a Site layout can be defined (i.e., the master page), 
and the utilized Fonts can be chosen. After choosing the 
template Orange, Oslo as layout, and Century Gothic  as 
font, the SharePoint site takes on a look and feel more 
similar to those required by the firm.

Use Case 3.2: Customizing Navigation and Links
Apart from using a more fitting theme, the structure of the content to be 
displayed on the sites and pages can be customized with out of the box 
techniques. The most important element here is the navigation, as this is the 
first element that helps users find the desired place and data. The solutions for 
the exercises are as follows:
• 
Exercise 
3.2.1—Customize 
“Page 
Layouts”: 
Navigating to the tile gear, a new menu pops up, including 
Add a page. After clicking on this button, a new window 
pops up again. Here, the user must specify a name for the 
new page to be created, using the variable Give it a name. 
After clicking OK, the user is forwarded to the new page, 
which is only recently visible to the user who created 
this page. The Page Layout menu is part of the Page menu 
(see Figure 5-16). For choosing the page layout named 
Splash, the user must scroll down to the drop-down 
menu showing all page layouts.
Figure 5-15.  Site for editing the chosen theme

Manager’s Guide to SharePoint Server 2016
137
• 
Exercise 3.2.2—Customize “Homepage”: At the 
top of the page, the name of the page is shown. Below, 
a box appears, in which this title can be modified (see 
Figure 5-17). Below the title, another box is shown, 
named Page Image. Here, the user can insert a picture 
from SharePoint. If the image does not already exist in 
SharePoint, the image can also be uploaded from another 
storage place. The Preview menu is part of the Page menu. 
After clicking this button, the site is shown in preview; 
however, not much has changed, as each part can still be 
edited. The button to define this page as a home page is 
named Make Homepage.

138
• 
Exercise 3.2.3—Publish “Homepage”: Until now,  
the site is not yet available, as it is not yet checked-in 
(Figure 5-18). Only the creator of this page can see it. 
After saving the changes, the Publish button should be 
clicked. Finally, the page is now visible to every user, and it 
is the home page of the site.
• 
Exercise 3.2.4—Customize “Links”: After navigating 
to the home page created in the preceding step, the user 
can Edit Links (possible on each page, if the user has the 
required permissions). Using this button, a new pop-up 
appears, with which the user can specify a Title of the 
navigation element to be included and an Address, meaning 
the URL. The functionality of the link can be tested by 
using Try Link. All links can be moved in the navigation by 
drag and drop.
• 
Exercise 3.2.5—Customize “Managed Navigation”: 
Navigating to Site Settings and then to Navigation, as  
part of the Look and Feel menu, the user is forwarded 
to a new page on which to change Navigation Settings 
(see Figure 5-19). Here, different sections appear. In the 
first section, the user can modify the Global Navigation. 
More precisely, the user can specify the navigation items 
to display in global navigation for the SharePoint site. 
The second section has the same aim, but for Current 
Navigation. In both sections, the user can define whether 
to Display the same navigation items as the parent site 
(only for subsites; otherwise, grayed out), select Managed 
Navigation, or Structural Navigation.  In addition, in both 
sections, the user can specify if Structural Navigation is 
activated, whether to Show subsites, and whether to Show 
pages. If Structural Navigation is chosen, the user can define 
whether the navigation should Sort automatically or Sort 
manually. Using the section below, Structural Navigation: 
Editing and Sorting, the navigation can be sorted manually. 
Here, new links can be added by using Add Link. New 
headings can be added by using Add Heading (placeholder 
links), which can be defined as to whether a page should 
be hidden, links can be edited, and the position of the 
Figure 5-18.  Publishing a single page in SharePoint

Manager’s Guide to SharePoint Server 2016
139
pages can be changed. For the latter, the buttons Move Up 
and Move Down should be used. Those also allow links 
to be nested in other links or headings, resulting in child-
parent relationships. The last section defines if the ribbon 
of the SharePoint site should be shown or not (Show and 
Hide Ribbon).
Solution 4: Integrate Applications
For allowing specific functionalities for storing and managing data, SharePoint 
provides apps. Different apps fall into three main categories: list, library, and 
calendar. The two former types of applications are most often used and 
customized.

Use Case 4.1: Adding and Customizing Lists
Adding a list can be achieved by navigating to Site Contents. Here, all the 
existing apps are listed. For customizing a list, columns are the main element 
to be adapted according to an enterprise’s requirements. The solutions for 
the exercises are as follows:
• 
Exercise 
4.1.1—Understand 
“Custom 
List”: 
Navigating to the tilegear, a new menu pops up, including 
the Site Contents menu. After clicking the Add an App 
button, a new site appears, showing all Your Apps. After 
clicking the Custom List button, a pop up appears from 
which a Name for the list to be created can be picked and 
then confirmed (see Figure 5-20). The button List allows 
the following operations to be performed: View Format, 
Manage Views, Tags and Notes, Share & Track, Connect & 
Export, Customize List, and Settings. Under View Format, the 
user can Quick Edit the view. Using Manage Views, a new 
view can be created (Create View), the recent view can be 
modified (Modify View), a new column can be added to 
the recent view (Create Column), and the Current View can 
be chosen. Under Tags and Notes, the Enterprise Keywords 
for the list can be modified. Share & Track allows users 
to E-mail a Link, including the link of the recent list, to 
other users and to modify RSS Feed. Connect & Export 
exports the list to Excel (Export to Excel). Customize List 
includes buttons to modify Form Web Parts; to Edit List, 
using Microsoft SharePoint Designer; and to add a New 
Quick Step. Finally, Settings navigates the user to the List 
Settings, which is the most important setting for the list. 
Additionally, the user can edit the share settings (Shared 
With) and modify Workflow Settings. Other buttons exist 
but are grayed out, depending on the configuration of the 
SharePoint farm. The Items button allows New creations. 
All other options in both buttons (Items  and List) are 
recently grayed out; however, they are no longer grayed 
out if content is added to the list, by creating a New Folder 
to Manage the existing items, including View Item, Edit 
Item, Version History, Shared With, and Delete Item. Under 
Actions, a new file can be attached to a list item (Attach File). 
Under Tags and Notes, the Enterprise Keywords used for a 
recent item can be modified. And, finally, under Workflows, 
buttons are included to start workflows or, if the approval 
workflow is already started, the list item can be directly 
approved or rejected with the Approve/Reject button.

Manager’s Guide to SharePoint Server 2016

• 
Exercise 4.1.2—Create “Columns”: A new column 
can be created with the List button and by clicking Create 
Column. Afterward, a pop up appears, from which the 
new column to be created can be specified. In the first 
section, Name and Type, the name of the column (Column 
name) can be specified, as well as the type of the column 
(see Figure 5-21). Here, the type can be Single line of text, 
meaning a string; Multiple lines of text, meaning a larger 
string; Choice, resulting in a click box; Number, meaning an 
integer value; Currency; Date and Time; Lookup, meaning a 
lookup to already existing information; Yes/No, meaning a 
boolean value; Person or Group, whereby a SharePoint user 
or group can be added to the list item; Hyperlink or Picture, 
meaning to maintain an URL leading to a page or figure; 
Calculated, meaning to maintain a formula automatically 
resulting a value; Task Outcome; External Data, meaning 
to link the list item to data outside of SharePoint; and 
Managed Metadata, meaning to specify a term for the 
recent list item. In the section below, Additional Column 
Settings can be configured. These include specifying 
a Description for the column: if it is required that the 
column contain information, if unique values must be 
enforced, what the maximum number of characters is, 
and the default value for the column. After clicking OK, 
the column is asserted to the recent view. To modify 
the column, the user must click the Modify View button, 
before the side to Edit View appears. In the first section 
Figure 5-20. Adding a list application to a SharePoint site

Chapter 5 | Hands-On Solutions
142
of the side, Name can be edited. Below, the modifications 
for the columns can be performed. Each column is listed 
by its Column Name and can be specified, according to 
whether it has to be shown. In addition, a drop-down 
menu is shown for all columns, in which the position can 
be specified. Other sections exist to sort the list items. 
Also, to the previously mentioned sections (functions), 
the list can include a filter; the view can be switched to a 
tabular view; items can be grouped; totals can be modified; 
the style can be adjusted; folders can be specified; an item 
limit can be specified; and the view can be adjusted for 
mobile display.

• 
Exercise 4.1.3—Create “Metadata Columns”: A 
new column can be created using the List button and 
clicking Create Column. Afterward, a pop up appears, in 
which the new column to be created can be specified. 
In the first section, Name and Type, the name has to be 
defined. As type, Managed Metadata must be chosen. 
For this type, a Description can be maintained, using the 
section Additional Column Settings. If the recent column 
should be a Multiple Value field, this can be specified in the 
section below, using the check box Allow multiple values. 
In the Display format section, whether the complete path 
of a term (including subterms) should be displayed in this 
column, or only the actual chosen term, can be specified. 
The most important section of this type of column is Term 
Set Settings. Here, the user can finally specify the term 
(taxonomy) being used for this column. If the column 
should use the date of an existing taxonomy, the check 
box Use a managed term set should be chosen; otherwise, 
the user can create a new taxonomy using “Customize 
your term set,” illustrated in Figure 5-22. Clicking this 
box, a term is created as a root concept, having the same 
name as the name of the column. Clicking on the root 
concept, and using Create Term, creates a term that is 
a sub concept of the root concept. Here, the user can 
define a name for the term to be created. Clicking the 
recently created term, the user can also create a term 
for this term, that is, a sub concept of the concept or a 
sub concept of the root concept. Through this, endless 
hierarchies can be simulated in SharePoint, performing as 
term sets of the taxonomy. It also can be specified if fill-in 
options should be supported. Additionally, a default term 
can be specified below, before finally creating this type of 
column by pressing OK.

Chapter 5 | Hands-On Solutions
144
• 
Exercise 4.1.4—Create “Person Columns 1”: The 
final required column can be created using the List button 
again and clicking Create Column. Afterward, a pop up 
appears, from which the new column to be created can 
be specified. In the first section, Name and Type, again, the 
Column name and Column Type can be specified. In contrast 
to the preceding exercise, now the column type should 
be Person or Group. The section below named Additional 
Column Settings has different options than the other 
column types. A Description can be defined. This section 
also lets the user specify if this column should require 
information, enforce unique values is required, and if 
Figure 5-22.  Specifying/adding a term set to a column of type managed metadata

Manager’s Guide to SharePoint Server 2016
145
multiple values are allowed in this column. Below (Allow 
selection of), whether the column should contain People 
Only or People and Groups can be specified. In addition, 
the user can specify whether any user can be input in this 
column, or if only users from a specific SharePoint group 
can be input. Finally, how the person or group should be 
displayed in this column can be specified.
• 
Exercise 
4.1.5—Create “Custom Views”: A 
completely new view for a list can be created by using 
the Create View button shown under the List ribbon. 
After clicking this button, the user is forwarded to a new 
site, from which she/he can choose different types of 
View Type. The Standard View is one of several different 
view types, including: Calendar View, Datasheet View, Gantt 
View, and Custom View in SharePoint Designer. Using the 
Name section, the name of the view to be created can 
be entered. In addition, the user can specify if she/he 
wants to Create a Personal View or Create a Public View, as 
opposed to all users having access to this list. This option 
is available in the section named Audience. Most important 
for this exercise is the Columns section. Here, it can be 
indicated that the cited columns should be displayed, and 
the position for each column can be modified.
Use Case 4.2: Adding and Customizing Libraries
Adding a library can be performed when navigating to Site Contents. For 
customizing a library, columns are the main element that can be adapted 
according to an enterprise’s needs. The solutions for the exercises are as 
follows:
• 
Exercise 4.2.1—Understand “Document Library”: 
Navigating to the tilegear, a new menu pops up, including 
the Site Contents menu. After clicking this menu, a new site 
appears, listing the Site Contents, including Lists, Libraries, 
and other Apps. After clicking the Add an App button, a 
new site appears, showing all apps. After clicking the 
button Document Library, a pop up appears, from which 
a Name can be picked for the library to be created and 
then confirmed with OK (see preceding Figure 5-23). 
The Library button allows the following operations: View 
Format, Manage Views, Tags and Notes, Share & Track, Connect 
& Export, Customize Library, and Settings. Under View 
Format, the user can Quick Edit the view. Using Manage 

Chapter 5 | Hands-On Solutions
146
Views, a new view can be created (Create View), the recent 
view can be modified (Modify View), a new column can be 
added to the recent view (Create Column), and the Current 
View can be chosen. Under Tags and Notes, the Enterprise 
Keywords for the list can be modified. Share & Track allows 
users to E-mail a Link, including the link of the recent list, 
to other users and, to modify RSS Feed. Connect & Export 
facilitates exporting the list to Excel (Export to Excel). 
Customize Library includes buttons to modify Form Web 
Parts, to Edit Library using Microsoft SharePoint Designer, 
and to add a New Quick Step. Finally, Settings navigates 
the user to Library Settings, which is the most important 
setting for the list. Additionally, the user can edit the 
share settings (Shared With) and modify Workflow Settings. 
Other buttons exist but are grayed out. Those depend on 
the configuration of the SharePoint farm. The Files button 
allows the following operations to be performed: Create 
New document, Open & Check Out, Manage documents, 
Share & Track documents, manage Copies, as well as specify 
Workflows and administrate Tags and Notes. For new lists, 
only the New menu is not grayed out.
• 
Exercise 4.2.2—Create “Person Columns 2”: A 
new column can be created using the Library button and 
clicking Create Column. Afterward, a pop up appears, from 
which the new column to be created can be specified. In 
the first section, Name and Type, the name of the column 
(Column name) and its type can be specified. The type can 
be a Single line of text, meaning a string; Multiple lines of 
text, meaning a larger string; Choice, resulting in a click box; 
Number, meaning an integer value; Currency; Date and Time; 
Figure 5-23. Adding a library application to a SharePoint site

Manager’s Guide to SharePoint Server 2016
147
Lookup, meaning a lookup to already existing information; 
Yes/No, meaning a boolean value; Person or Group, from 
which a SharePoint user or group can be added to the 
list item; Hyperlink or Picture, meaning to maintain a URL 
leading to a page or figure; Calculated, meaning to maintain 
a formula automatically resulting in a value; Task Outcome; 
External Data, meaning to link the list item to data 
outside of SharePoint; and Managed Metadata, meaning 
to specify a term for the recent list item. Logically, the 
column to be created should be of the type Person or 
Group. In the section below, Additional Column Settings can 
be performed. This includes specifying a Description for 
the column, if it is required that this column contain 
information, if unique values must be enforced, if multiple 
selections are allowed, and if the column is limited to 
a specific user group, or if all users can be inserted in 
this column. In addition, it can be specified to whom the 
column should be shown. After clicking OK, the column is 
asserted to the library. The setting Enterprise Keyword can 
be specified, using Library Settings and going to Enterprise 
Metadata and Keywords Settings. In the first section, named 
Add Enterprise Keywords, it can be specified if an Enterprise 
Keywords  column should be asserted to the library. In 
the section below named Metadata Publishing, it can 
be specified if the keywords should be saved as social 
tags. Finally, the accompanying column, which is already 
added to the library, must be visible in the recent view. 
To ensure this, Modify View must be used, which leads to 
the page named Edit View. In the second section, named 
Columns, the accompanying column can be added to the 
view named Enterprise Keywords.
• 
Exercise 4.2.3—Create “Metadata Columns”: All 
the mentioned metadata columns are already available 
for the library. However, those must be added to the 
recent view. To do this, Modify View must be used, which 
leads to the page named Edit View. In the second section, 
named Columns, the accompanying columns can be added 
to the view, which are named Check In Comment, Created, 
Created By, Edit, and Version.
• 
Exercise 4.2.4—Create “Personal View”: To create 
a view that only shows documents uploaded by oneself, 
the view must be modified. The page that allows for 
modifying the view is available by enlarging the ribbon 
named Library and clicking Modify View. Afterward, the user 

Chapter 5 | Hands-On Solutions
148
is forwarded to the Edit view page. Using the Filter section, 
different settings to filter content are provided. By default, 
the filter is able to Show all items in this view. This must 
be changed to Show items only when the following is true. 
Afterward, the column Consultant can be chosen, using 
the functions Show the items when column ➤ Consultant ➤ 
is equal to ➤ Operations Manager. To create another view, 
where only content from the team members is shown, 
the Create View button must be clicked. Afterward, the 
page View Type  appears. Here, five views are displayed. 
To create the list, as required, the view type Standard 
View has to be clicked, which forwards the user to the 
page Create View. Using the Name section of the Create 
View site, the name of the view to be created, which is 
Operations Management, can be maintained. In addition, 
the user can specify if she/he wants to Create a Personal 
View or to Create a Public View, as opposed to all users 
having access to this list. This option is available in the 
section named Audience. As the view is to be shared by all 
team members, we Create a Public View (see Figure 5-24). 
To filter for documents only uploaded by operative 
management staff, the section named Filter must be used. 
Again, the different names of the team members must 
be filtered, as described previously. Filtering for various 
team members requires that multiple filters be created. 
This means that each person must be specified, and the 
filters work together using Or. More convenient would 
be to filter for groups instead. This allows, in addition, 
that the filter would be more dynamic, for example, 
to accommodate new team members or to remove 
members who have left the team. To manage this, a group 
must be created in advance, so that the filter can perform 
on the group level instead.

Use Case 4.3: Adding Workflows to Applications
Workflows help to automatize and standardize processes. In SharePoint, 
workflows can be activated (added) to any type of app. The different workflows 
that are available out of the box can be further customized. The solutions for 
the exercises are as follows:
• 
Exercise 
4.3.1—Activate “Workflows”: When 
installing SharePoint from scratch, some features are not 
automatically activated. The reason is that the features 
are chosen according to the template used for a site-
collection or subsite. To activate the feature named 
Workflows, the user has to navigate to the Site Settings, Site 
Collection Administration, and, finally, Site Collection Features. 
A new page, then appears. Here, all features performing 
on the site level are listed. Each feature has a status, 
either Deactivate or Active. Logically, clicking the latter 
mentioned button, shown in Figure 5-25, can activate the 
required feature.
• 
Exercise 4.3.2—Manage “Approval Workflow”: By 
clicking on Site Contents, an overview of all applications 
already created are listed, including the Document Library. To 
add a workflow, the Library ribbon must be enlarged, before 
clicking Workflow Settings. Afterward, a new page with the

Chapter 5 | Hands-On Solutions
150
same name appears, including the link to the page named 
Add a workflow. On this page, the first section, Workflow, 
allows selection from an existing workflow template 
(Select a workflow template), illustrated in Figure 5-26.  
Here, five workflow templates are listed: Disposition 
approval, Three State, Collect Feedback, Approval, and Collect 
signature. For each workflow template, a description is 
shown. In the section below, the user can enter a unique 
name for the workflow to be created. The section below 
named Task List must be used to collect all tasks required 
to perform the workflow. In this list, all workflow tasks 
for the responsible persons are listed. There is another 
section, named History List. Here, a list can be specified to 
summarize all steps occurring during performance of the 
workflow for a single item. The final section, named Start 
Options, provides different functionalities to specify when 
the workflow should be started.

Solution 5: Using Metadata Techniques
In SharePoint, two types of metadata techniques exist: taxonomy, and 
folksonomy. In SharePoint, metadata can be added to various content types. 
Often, the formal technique is used to classify documents or to hierarchically 
organize something, e.g., departments. The informal technique is often used in 
addition to the formal technique, for example, to further describe information 
or data.
Use Case 5.1: Using Managed Metadata Techniques
Managed Metadata is often used in libraries or lists to formally classify 
items or documents. To do so, a column of this type must be added to an 
application. The solutions for the exercises are as follows:
• 
Exercise 
5.1.1—Add 
“Managed 
Metadata 
Document Library”: A new column can be created 
using the Library button and clicking Create Column. 
Afterward, a pop up appears, from which the new column 
to be created can be specified. In the first section, Name 
and Type, the name of the column (Column name), which is 
Taxonomy, can be specified, as can the type of the column, 
which is Managed Metadata. To add the new column to the 
default view, the accompanying check box has to be active.
• 
Exercise 5.1.2—Customize “Term Set”: In the 
section named Term Set Settings, the taxonomy to be 
chosen for this column can be specified. Here, either an 
already existing taxonomy can be used (Use a managed 
term set), or a new taxonomy can be created (Customize 
your term set), as shown in Figure 5-27. Logically, the 
second option mentioned must be chosen. The root 
concept named Taxonomy already exists. To create new 
terms, the user must click the already existing concept. 
Afterward, the Create Term menu appears. By clicking this 
button, a subordinated term can be created. This allows 
the whole taxonomy to be created as a term set of this 
SharePoint library. After adding this column to the library, 
the new column is added to the view.
Figure 5-27. Adding a workflow to a SharePoint application

Chapter 5 | Hands-On Solutions
152
• 
Exercise 5.1.3—Understand “Metadata Document 
Library”: Adding new documents to a document library 
can be performed in different ways. The easiest way 
is to just drag and drop an existing document (e.g., an 
Excel file) into the library. After dropping the document 
into the library, the Name of the file appears, including 
the data for the columns Modified and Modified By. 
However, the column created in the previous exercise 
is not automatically filled, as we did not specify a Default 
value. To fill the column for the uploaded document, 
the document must be chosen from the library, before 
the Edit Properties button has to be clicked. A new page 
appears to edit the properties of the document. Here, a 
Title can be specified, apart from the already automatically 
defined Name of the file. In addition, the value for the 
column Taxonomy can be specified (see Figure 5-28). 
After clicking the Term Set symbol, a pop up appears that 
includes the taxonomy specified for this column. Now, 
the concept (term) required can be selected and, through 
this, can be added to the column of this document. After 
all files (documents) are uploaded to the Document Library, 
the column Document Taxonomy can be used to formally 
filter for all documents satisfying a taxonomical search 
query. Here there are different options. The search can 
include exactly one concept (term), or the query can be 
extended to also filter for terms being parent terms of 
other terms.

Manager’s Guide to SharePoint Server 2016
153
Use Case 5.2: Using Enterprise Metadata Techniques
Enterprise Metadata is often also used in libraries and lists. This type of 
metadata is useful to further describe a document or item. The solutions for 
the exercises are as follows: 
• 
Exercise 5.2.1—Allow “Enterprise Metadata”: For 
each list and library, enterprise keywords can be added to 
the application. To do this, Library Settings must be used, 
as well as the included settings in Enterprise Metadata 
and Keywords Settings (see Figure 5-29). After clicking 
this setting, a new page appears, including the section 
named Add Enterprise Keywords. By clicking the check 
box, an Enterprise Keywords column will be added to the 
library. However, this column is not automatically added 
to the Current View. This can be performed by using the 
Modify View button and choosing the column named 
Enterprise Keywords from the section named Columns. 
Adding Enterprise Keywords to existing documents 
can be performed by using the Edit Properties button.  
After clicking this button, a new page appears, from which 
Figure 5-28.  Specifying the term for formally classifying an item or document

Chapter 5 | Hands-On Solutions
154
the Enterprise Keywords can be specified (see Figure 5-30). 
The keywords can be used to filter for client-specific 
documents, for example.

• 
Exercise 5.2.2—Integrate “Three State Workflow”: 
Adding a new column to the library can be performed 
with the Create Column button. Afterward, a new pop up 
appears, from which the Name and Type of the column to 
be created can be specified. Here, the type Choice should 
be chosen. The most important section for this type of 
column is Additional Column Settings, more precisely the 
included field named Type each choice on a separate line. 
Using this, the choices being allowed can be specified. By 
default, three choices already exist, which have only to 
be renamed as required. Below, the display choice Drop-
Down Menu can be specified, and then the Default value 
should be Draft. After clicking OK, the new column is 
added to the current view.
• 
Exercise 5.2.3—Start “Three State Workflow”: 
By clicking the Workflow Settings button, a new page with 
the same name appears. Here, a button exists to Add a 
Workflow. After clicking this button, the user is forwarded 
to a new page, also having the same name as the button. 
In the first section, named Workflow, the desired workflow 
to be added to the library can be specified, which is for 
our tutorial of the type Three State. Using the section 
below named Name, the name for the workflow, which is 
Document Status, can be specified. That a new item added 
to the library is to start this workflow can be specified 
in Start Options. After clicking OK, a new page appears to 
Customize the Three-state workflow (see Figure 5-31).

Solution 6: Improving Search Experience
In SharePoint, the Enterprise Search Center template provides an improved 
search experience. It can be used, with fine granularity, to modify the search 
mechanism according to an enterprise’s needs. To do this, a new site or site-
collection must be created. Afterward, replacement of the existing search 
center with the improved search center must be specified.
Use Case 6.1: Creating Enterprise Search Center
For creating a place to improve search experience, the accompanying site 
must be created in advance. This type of site additionally provides techniques 
to modify the search experience and, ultimately, to help find the desired 
information at the right time. To allow such techniques, the accompanying 
feature has to be activated. The solutions for the exercises are as follows:
• 
Exercise 6.1.1—Add “Enterprise Search Center”: 
For activating the feature to allow modification of the 
search center, Site Settings must be used. After navigating 
to the Site Collection Administration, then the Site Collection 
Features section, the desired site appears. Here, the 
SharePoint Server Publishing Infrastructure feature can be 
activated. Afterward, the new subsite must be created. 
After clicking new subsite, a part of Site Contents, a new 
page appears. Here, the type of SharePoint site to be 
created can be chosen (see Figure 5-32). This type differs, 
depending on the template selected. In the first section, 
a Title and Description for the site to be created can be 
specified. Below, is the section named Web Site Address. 
Here, the URL name of the site to be created must be 
defined. Below is the Template Selection section. Here, a 
language for the subsite to be created can be defined. 
In addition, and most important, the template can be 
selected in this section. Four types of templates are listed: 
Collaboration, Enterprise, Publishing, and Duet Enterprise. The 
template for the search center to be created, which is 
named Enterprise Search Center, is listed under Enterprise. 
In the section below, Permissions can be specified. Here, 
users can decide to Use same permissions as parent site. 
The final section is Navigation Inheritance. Here, it can be 
specified if the subsite to be created has the same top link 
bar as provided in the parent site. After clicking Create, 
the new subsite of the type Enterprise Search Center is 
created.

Manager’s Guide to SharePoint Server 2016
157
• 
Exercise 6.1.2—Modify “Search URL”: After 
navigating to the Search Settings of the top-level site, a 
new page appears. This page includes two sections. The 
first section, named Enter a Search Center URL, defines 
the search center by its URL. Here, the URL of the 
site created above must be typed. The second section 
asks for the results page the queries should be sent to. 
Here, we decide to Use the same results page settings as my 
parent. This means that the search center is replacing the 
initial search center existing on the parent site and that a 
second results page is not created.
Figure 5-32. Adding an enterprise search center to a SharePoint site collection

Chapter 5 | Hands-On Solutions
158
• 
Exercise 6.1.3—Analyze “Result Page”: Typing 
a query on the top-level site forwards the user to the 
result page defined in the preceding exercise. The page 
consists of five main areas, shown in Figure 5-33. At the 
top, the search slot is displayed, including the queried 
string. Below, specification can be initiated, using one of 
four refiners. By clicking one of the refiners, the query is 
refined to the underlying content type, except if Everything 
is defined, which is the default refiner. Below the refiners, 
the search results are shown. In addition to the name of 
the search result, its link is shown. When hovering over 
a search result, an extraction of the result is shown. On 
the bottom of the page, below the search results, search 
statistics are shown. This highlights how many search 
results have been found. In addition, more settings can be 
performed, including the following: Alert Me, Preferences, 
and Advanced Search. The fifth section provides faceted 
search techniques. Three facets are provided: Result type, 
Author, and Modified date. Those facets can be used to 
additionally refine the search results.

Use Case 6.2: Customizing Search Center
For creating a place to improve search experience, the accompanying site has 
to be created in advance. This type of site additionally provides techniques 
to modify the search experience and, ultimately, to help find the desired 
information at the right time. To allow such techniques, the accompanying 
feature has to be activated. The solutions for the exercises are as follows:
• 
Exercise 6.2.1—Customize “Result Page”: The 
result page is analogous to other SharePoint pages. It 
is mainly a collection of web parts providing different 
services, as shown in Figure 5-34. With these, editing 
the results page is equal to editing another SharePoint 
page. To do this, Edit Page has to be clicked. Afterward, 
the page will be checked out, which allows users to edit 
the existing web parts and to add new web parts. The 
web parts already included on the page are divided into 
zones. Two zones exist: Navigation Zone and Main Zone. 
In the first mentioned zone, the web part Refinement is 
included, in which the facets can be edited or new refiners 
added. In Main Zone, three web parts are included: Search 
Box, Search Navigation, and Search Results. The web part 
Search Box shows the search slot. The web part Search 
Navigation allows for showing and editing the refiners. The 
last web part, Search Results, is responsible for displaying 
the search results. The settings for this web part can 
be edited by clicking Edit Web Part. The Settings are part 
of the Properties for Search Results  section. By clicking 
Settings, different check boxes are shown that can modify 
the settings for the search results. The check boxes 
are classified in two sections: Results settings and Results 
control settings. To specify that duplicate links should be 
displayed, the accompanying check box, which is Show 
View Duplicate link in the section Results settings, must be 
clicked. To specify that the drop down can be sorted, 
another check box has to be clicked, which is named 
Show sort dropdown, of the Results control settings section. 
All mentioned Settings are part of the Properties for Search 
Results. In addition to the Settings, the Search Criteria can 
be edited, as well as the Display Templates. Other 
modifications that can be performed when editing this 
web part are Appearance, Layout, and Advanced.

Exercise 6.2.2—Customize “Faceted Search”: The 
Refinement  web part is shown in the Navigation Zone. 
By clicking Edit Web Part, the refiners (facets) can be 
specified (see Figure  5-35). Under Properties for Search 
Refinement, the refiners can be chosen. After clicking the 
previously mentioned button, a pop up appears. Here, an 
overview of all available refiners is listed vs. an overview 
of all selected refiners. By default, six refiners are chosen: 
File Type, Content Class, Content Type Id, Web Template, 
Display Author, and Last Modified Time. The refiners named 
Languages, Size, and Tags are not yet selected. To do this, 
they have to be searched under Available refiners, and by 
clicking on the refiner, they will be added to the Selected 
refiners. Resorting the refiners can be performed by using 
Move up and Move down buttons. By clicking one of the 
refiners listed in Selected refiners, these can be configured 
in detail. By clicking the Languages refiner, the following 
configurations can be performed: Display name, Display 
template, Sort by, Sort direction, and Maximum number of 
refiner values. Logically, the last configuration mentioned 
is required to limit the maximum number of refiner 
values. Clicking the refiner named Size  allows for the 
following configurations to be performed: Display name,

Display template, and Intervals. By using Display name, the 
new name can be typed in a text box, which is File size. 
Clicking the refiner named Tags allows for the following 
configurations to be performed: Display name, Display 
template, Sort by, Sort direction, and Maximum number 
of refiner values. By using Display template, the required 
template can be defined.

Solution 7: Managing Projects
In SharePoint, the Project Site template provides a project workspace. This 
can be used to administrate small and medium-sized projects. To apply this, 
a new site or site collection must be created. It is not recommended to have 
a project workspace as a site collection but, rather, as a site performing as a 
subsite of a site collection.
Use Case 7.1: Creating Tasks in Projects
For creating tasks in projects, the accompanying site must be created 
in advance. This type of site additionally provides a project dashboard 
summarizing important information about the project and its status. Finally, 
a project consisting of different tasks requires that the tasks be created in 
a separated application (app). The solutions for the exercises are as follows:
• 
Exercise 7.1.1—Add “Project Workspace”: After 
clicking New subsite a new page appears. On it, the type of 
SharePoint site to be created can be chosen. Types differ, 
depending on the template selected. In the first section, 
a Title and Description for the site to be created can be 
specified. Below is the section named Web Site Address. 
Here, the URL name of the site to be created must be 
defined. Below is Template Selection. Here, a language for 
the subsite to be created can be defined. In addition, and 
most important, the template can be selected in this 
section. Four types of templates are listed: Collaboration, 
Enterprise, Publishing, and Duet Enterprise. The template 
for the project workspace to be created, which is named 
Project Workspace, is listed under Collaboration. In the 
section below, Permissions can be specified. Here, users 
decide to Use same permissions as parent site. The final 
section is Navigation Inheritance. From here, whether the 
subsite to be created is to have the same top link bar as 
provided in the parent site can be specified. After clicking 
Create, the new subsite of the type Project Site is created.
• 
Exercise 7.1.2—Manage “Project Dashboard”: The 
project workspace can be added as a link to the top-
level site, by navigating to the top-level site and clicking 
Edit Links, a part of the local navigation. After clicking 
the button, existing links can be removed or edited, 
by clicking the name of the link. In addition, links can 
be added. For links to be added, the URL of the page 
(subsite) must be defined, and a name provided. When 

Manager’s Guide to SharePoint Server 2016
163
navigating to the subsite created, a start page is displayed. 
Below the title of the subsite, which is Project Workspace, 
a Project Summary is shown. The summary is shown as 
a time line. Below, a section named Get started with your 
site  is displayed. To modify the site, the user can click 
the buttons shown (see Figure  5-36). Below, another 
section shows documents. This section is based on a 
document library including the latest documents to be 
added to this subsite. At the bottom of the summary 
page, is a Newsfeed. This aims to display the most recent 
conversations occurring on the subsite.
• 
Exercise 7.1.3—Manage “Main Project Tasks”:  
The Tasks list is based on a SharePoint list application (see 
Figure 5-37). The application consists of two parts. The 
first part shows a time line. In the second part, tasks, i.e., 
list items, can be created. To create tasks, the New Item 
button, which forwards the user to a new page, must be 
clicked. Here, the task to be created can be managed by 
different columns: Task Name, Start Date, Due Date, and 
Assigned To. In the first column, names of the task, Task 
A and Task B, respectively, can be defined. The following 
two columns are not mandatory. The fourth column 
assigns the task to a specific person, e.g., the product 
owner of the project. By clicking Show More, the tasks to 
be created can be specified in more detail: % Complete, 
Figure 5-36. The starting page of a project workspace in SharePoint

Chapter 5 | Hands-On Solutions
164
Description, Predecessors, Priority, and Task Status. Using the 
Predecessors column, dependencies between tasks can be 
specified. In our example, for Task B, the Predecessors is 
Task A.
Use Case 7.2: Managing Tasks in Projects
For effectively managing tasks in projects, it is often required to link tasks to 
other tasks, as a task often consists of other tasks. In addition, the tasks are 
often performed by different teams. The solutions for the exercises are as 
follows:
• 
Exercise 7.2.1—Manage “Sub  Tasks”: By clicking 
a task (item) in the Tasks list, a pop up appears. Here, 
the Create Sub task button is included. After clicking this 
button, a new item is automatically added to the list, 
which is listed below the item for which the subtask is 
created (see Figure 5-38). For each subtask, a name must 
be defined. The subtasks are not automatically assigned 
to a specific person. In fact, they are not assigned to 
anyone. To additionally assign subtasks to persons, the 
subtask has to be opened, and the accompanying column 
has to be filled.

• 
Exercise 7.2.2—Manage “Project Timeline”: A Start 
Date and a Due Date, respectively, can be added to each 
task and subtask when editing the list item when opening 
the subtask. By clicking the task, these can be added to 
the time line (see Figure 5-39).

Conclusions
This book has provided a hands-on introduction to the enterprise content 
management system SharePoint Server 2016. In this chapter, the conclusions 
that have been reached are reviewed.
The book began, in the first chapter, with an informative introduction to the 
general principles of content management. This included an explanation of 
the logical components of content management systems (CMS), the basic 
requirements for supporting finding information, as well as an introduction 
to the different types of CMS on the market. In addition, the chapter outlined 
the different types of licenses and provision models used to implement and 
operate a CMS and gave an overview of the available evaluation and research 
methodologies most widely used by enterprises. 
In the second chapter, the technologies provided by SharePoint and its principal 
areas were reviewed. This included the basic elements of SharePoint, the core 
technologies always required to implement and customize the system, an 
explanation of the included technology to improve social networking, as well 
as an overview of the different types of administration levels. In addition, the 
templates provided out of the box were explored in detail, for each type 
of site and site  collection template (collaboration templates, enterprise 
templates, and publishing templates). The most widely used templates also 
were comprehensively reviewed. 
To practically experience the capabilities of SharePoint, hands-on tutorials 
based on real-world scenarios were presented in the third chapter. This 
chapter began with an introduction to the methodology being used to present 
the tutorials and the underlying idea, as well as the preparations required 
to perform the tutorials. Afterward, the tutorials were finally presented.

Chapter 6 | Conclusions
168
In all, seven tutorials, including various use cases, were presented, covering 
the principal areas of SharePoint: managing users, improving social networking, 
customizing the look and feel, integrating applications, using metadata 
technologies, improving search experience, and managing tasks.
Based on the SharePoint technology presented in the second chapter, best 
practice scenarios were presented in the fourth chapter. Such best practices 
give advice concerning what is important before implementing SharePoint 
and after the system has been set up. The chapter began with best practices 
regarding how to set up and maintain a governance model, including how to set 
up a governance committee and the elements of a governance plan. Afterward, 
best practices regarding the use of the site and site  collection templates 
were presented, including the use and differences related to collaboration, 
enterprise, and publishing templates. Finally, best practices regarding the use 
of additional tools were given. Here, tools provided by Microsoft to help 
customize the system, as well as tools provided by third party providers to 
improve workflows, to simplify the usage of external data sources, as well as 
for better managing metadata, were reviewed.
Using the fifth chapter, solutions to the tutorials presented in the third 
chapter were given. Again, the chapter began with an introduction to the 
methodology being used to present the solutions. Afterward, the solutions 
for the different areas of SharePoint were provided in detail. Again, the 
solutions were divided into single use cases. In all, solutions for 15 use cases 
were presented. The most important use cases presented were the following: 
managing site owners’ and users’ permissions, maintaining My Site profiles and 
using My Site features, using and customizing SharePoint, using applications 
and workflows, using metadata techniques, creating and customizing search 
centers, and creating and managing tasks in projects.
