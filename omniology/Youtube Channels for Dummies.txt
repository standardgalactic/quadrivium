Introduction

aybe you’re looking to become a YouTube sensation with your next 
video or you simply want to share your insights or your particular  
expertise with the world. Perhaps you’d even like to use YouTube and video 
to help your business, which could be a local coffee shop or a Fortune 
500 company. No matter how you plan to make use of your video‐making 
skills, YouTube has made sharing the results of those skills easy. And with 
the tips and techniques included within the pages of YouTube Channels For 
Dummies, you’ll be ready to take full advantage of YouTube’s user‐friendly 
platform when creating your very own YouTube channel.
To get a better sense of how YouTube has changed the entertainment 
­playing field, cast your mind back to ten or so years before the turn of the 
­millennium — if you can remember back that far. Despite an explosion of 
ever better and ever cheaper video equipment for consumers, sharing a 
video still meant gathering family and friends around your giant 25‐inch, 
tube‐laden television screen so that everyone could watch your latest video 
masterpiece. Back in those days, someone who wasn’t in the room watching 
along was clean out of luck.
YouTube changed all that. It globalized the viewing experience, reinventing  
how people show videos by making it possible to share with audiences 
­considerably larger than that bunch of friends and family gathered around 
the TV set eating popcorn. Any viewer who wanted to see any video any-
where in the world only had to type www.youtube.com into their favorite 
browser, search for the video they wanted to see, and click the Play button — 
and there it was.
As easy as it is for a viewer to take full advantage of YouTube, it’s almost 
as easy for a contributor to become part of the YouTube mix. After setting 
up an account, it’s a snap to start uploading video. And, if the video you’re 
uploading takes off, you could become famous and even earn a good chunk of 
change from your YouTube exploits.
Notice that we said “if the video you’re uploading takes off.” That can be a 
very big if. Not just any video will do. The truth of the matter is that the  
low‐quality, badly shot videos that were still popular a few years ago no 
longer cut the mustard. Viewers expect higher quality these days, which is 
why you need to step up your game and produce the best possible content. 
This book can help show you the way.

YouTube Channels For Dummies 
About This Book
In some ways, reading a book to find out all about YouTube channels seems a 
bit odd. Isn’t YouTube the place that specializes in videos designed to teach 
you about any topic on earth? Why not just stick with the YouTube videos 
that are all about YouTube?
First off, it’s a bit self‐referential and incestuous to get all your information 
about YouTube channels from YouTube videos. Second, that video purport-
ing to tell you how to strike it rich on YouTube may have been shot and 
edited by the neighbor kid down the street who has never made a dime from 
YouTube and who may never move out of Mom and Dad’s basement. In other 
words, just as you shouldn’t believe everything you read on the Internet, you 
shouldn’t believe everything you see on YouTube. Sometimes it pays to listen 
to the true experts (like us) who have a track record in advising folks how to 
put their best foot forward on YouTube.
We also know that there are only so many hours in a day and that everyone’s 
schedules seem to be getting more and more hectic each day. That’s why 
we’ve written a book that doesn’t beat around the bush — in other words, 
it gets straight to the point so that you can get in and get out with the infor-
mation you need. In that sense, YouTube Channels For Dummies is the exact 
opposite of all those wordy instructional manuals that spell out a hundred 
ways to do something but never get around to telling you the best way. No 
matter if you’re looking to set up a channel, create an effective header, or 
figure out ways to maximize your monetization potential, we show you the 
quickest, most effective way to get the job done.
Foolish Assumptions
Whether you’re an experienced videographer or you just bought your first 
camcorder, you should treat YouTube with an open mind. Just because it’s 
easy to make a video and upload it to YouTube doesn’t mean that you won’t 
hit the occasional bump in the road, so don’t fool yourself into thinking you 
don’t need help from time to time.
That goes for pretty much everyone, from pros make a living producing video 
to ambitious students looking to showcase edgy movie shorts to absolute 
beginners looking to upload their first video. Regardless of whether you 
­identify with one of these situations or you have a truly unique one, you’ll

ouTube is the new business and entertainment frontier, which means 
there’s as much excitement and creativity associated with creating 
and managing a YouTube channel these days as had been the case during 
the early days of television, when the sky seemed the limit. YouTube — like 
television before it — is caught up in the same adventure that comes from 
defining its target audience as well as finding out what audiences are willing 
to watch.
For television, the adventurous nature of their early endeavors could be 
traced to the fact that TV was so new that audiences really didn’t know what 
they wanted. For YouTube, working in today’s market, it’s much more about 
meeting the diverse interests and needs of an audience that attracts more 
than a billion people from all over the planet.
Anyone that wants to show off their video prowess or share their vision 
with the world can hang a virtual shingle on YouTube by starting their own 
­channel. Of course, when television began, we humans had more toes than 
the TV had channels. These days, you can multiply those stubby digits by 
100 million to count the number of YouTube channels. That makes running a 
­successful YouTube channel seem a bit more daunting.
Having more than 500 million channels can make getting noticed on your 
channel feel like searching for a virtual needle in an online haystack. Yet, 
regardless of the steep increase in competition, the intention has always 
been the same — getting people to watch your channel. But it’s not all bad

news — you also have an advantage over your counterpart in the 1940s. Back 
then, it took a great deal of capital to get started on television. Today? Not so 
much. In fact, if you just want a platform for presenting some of your video 
work, YouTube can make that possible without you having to fork over one 
thin dime.
Knowing that YouTube is free should reduce some of your worries — at least 
from a financial perspective. Couple that with the size and diversity of the 
YouTube audience — and the endless number of topics that interest them — 
it’s easy to believe that you have a fair chance of success for your channel. 
That’s true, up to a point — the point being that, if you want your channel to 
thrive, you need to provide your viewers with compelling content.
Saying that your channel needs to host solid content that people actually 
want to see seems as glaringly obvious as saying a hamburger joint must 
make a good burger in order to survive. But content merely makes up the 
first part of the equation; the rest depends on how you bring viewers to that 
content — YouTube is free, video production certainly is not. Unless you 
want to shell out money from your own pocket, you need to generate some 
funds to produce content for your channel. In the world of YouTube, one 
major way to generate such funds is through advertising revenue — and 
it should come as no surprise that the more viewers you can attract, the 
greater your potential to generate advertising revenue. How much depends 
on your needs and ambitions, but increased revenue can lead to better 
­production values, which brings it all back to more revenue.
But before you start worrying about all that money you’re going to make, let’s 
take a look at what it takes to get started on a YouTube channel for you or 
your business.
The YouTube Phenomenon – Why You 
Need To Be on YouTube
Like snowflakes on a winter day, or episodes of Law and Order, there are 
more topics that viewers can appreciate on YouTube than any human can 
count. And since you already love making videos and most likely exhibit 
some expertise or viewpoint to share with the world, then YouTube may be 
your best creative outlet.
On the downside, you’re not the only one hoping to get noticed on YouTube. 
Many others with the very same intention are looking to build an audience 
for their YouTube channels, too. (“How many?” you ask. The number exceeds 

11

 Chapter 1: Making a Home on YouTube
the number of those pre‐approved credit card applications that plague your 
mailbox, so we’re talking lots.)
Your journey on YouTube begins with knowing your strengths. Some users 
relish documenting the quirks of their existence to the gentle amusement of 
others. Others have some type of expertise to share. Then you have perform-
ers who regard the video hosting site as their personal stage — the list could 
go on and on. Even businesses realize it’s a great place to inform consumers 
about their products or provide a great level of customer service. Regardless 
of your passion, a potential audience is waiting for you.
Audience, audience, audience
Have you ever noticed the repetitive way people describe what’s the most 
important thing about a piece of real estate? Yes, we know it’s all about 
­location, so much so that realtors, among others, feel compelled to say it 
three times, as though saying it once doesn’t get the point across.
Maybe that need for the special emphasis that comes with repetition is 
­justified, because when it comes to success on your YouTube channel, we’re 
of the opinion that saying the word “audience” just once doesn’t do justice 
to its importance. Paying homage to our real estate buddies, we can agree 
that success for your YouTube channel depends on . . . (drum roll, please) 
­audience, audience, audience!
So, what’s a YouTube audience actually like? You’ll find people from all walks 
of life, and you’ll soon discover that they can spend a great deal of time 
meandering through YouTube’s seemingly endless virtual walls, sometimes 
just entertaining themselves, sometimes educating themselves, sometimes 
engaging quite passionately with what they see, sometimes letting it all just 
wash over them. Given the amount of time folks spend on the site, there’s a 
good chance that someone ends up seeing your video. Not a great chance, of 
course, given the fact that there is so much content on the site and only so 
many viewers to watch that content, but still a good chance.
So, how do you move from “good” chance to “great chance”? First and fore-
most, your success depends on the strength of your content. Right behind 
strong content, though, you’ll find that you need to be a virtual wrangler, 
capable of bringing people who may not know anything about you to your 
channel. In order to do that, you need to know what excites your viewers, 
what they’re looking for in video content, and how they consume what they 
like. With that information in hand, you can fine‐tune your content to better 
serve your (current or potential) audience.

12
Part I: Getting Started With YouTube Channels 
Gathering information on the viewing habits of your audience is a crucial first 
step in determining what they want to see and how long they’re willing to do 
it. YouTube makes it easy to gather lots of information on your ­viewers — 
YouTube Analytics, covered in Chapter 11 is a big help here — but sometimes 
consulting friends and family about their viewing preferences is a good place 
to start.
Incorporating YouTube into your business 
and marketing plans
Just like cool sheets on a summer evening, YouTube goes perfectly with 
social media when it comes to your business and marketing needs. Why 
not? You already know that your presence on Facebook, LinkedIn, or Twitter 
keeps you connected with all the right people. Guess what? YouTube can 
help raise your social media profile as well. (See Figure 1-1.)
By integrating your video content with social media, you can drive interested 
parties to your channel; your channel, in turn, can point them back to your 
social media platforms and your contact information. This synergy helps 
build a strong following, because you can inform potential customers about 
your business through multiple avenues.
Video is the perfect partner when it comes to showing products, demonstra-
tions, providing tutorials, or other features designed to increase awareness 
of your brand. And YouTube is the perfect partner to host your videos.
When coming up with a plan to incorporate your YouTube‐based video 
content into your business and marketing plans, here are some areas to 
­consider:
✓
✓Have effective titles: Your video should have clear and succinct titles. 
They should get to the point about your product or service, so that 
people can easily find your video.
✓
✓Add more metadata: Having a strong title is a good place to start, but 
it doesn’t end there. You should also have a detailed description of the 
video, as shown in Figure 1-2, and use as many keywords as are appro-
priate for the content. The more information that’s included with each 
video makes it easy for viewers to find exactly what you have to offer in 
a Google search.
✓
✓Include your contact info on the video: Always add your business or 
personal information to the video and its description fields, such as your 
phone number, email address, and social media sites.

Becoming a star!
Are you ready for your close up? Or maybe framing one is your thing. It 
doesn’t matter, because YouTube gives you a platform right up there with 
radio, film, and television as yet another means of achieving stardom. By 
doing so, YouTube has created a dedicated community that offers one more 
way for the world to notice you.
The thought of stardom often leans toward actors and musicians — and the 
creators behind them. Many have found great success after being discovered 
on YouTube. (Can you say “Justin Bieber”?) The rock band Journey found its 
current lead singer on YouTube. Aerosmith guitarist Joe Perry also found a 
singer for his other band, The Joe Perry Project.

Actors have also found work by showcasing their clip reel, performances, 
and auditions. YouTube has even made some stars of its own — personalities 
offering everything from rap parodies to lip‐synching to video game analy-
sis and commentary have made a name for themselves on YouTube. Epic 
Rap Battles in History, to take one example, has been seen by hundreds of 
­millions of viewers. (See Figure 1-3.)
So, proof positive that YouTube can provide a stage big enough to start, and 
perhaps sustain, a career.
Going viral
If you’re a millennial or someone who remembers the world before the turn 
of the century, the phrase “going viral” could have two different meanings. 
So, in addition to meaning the spread of a virus, which is a bad thing, the 
term refers to the rapid spread of a video, and that’s a great thing.
When an uploaded video goes viral in the good sense, it becomes a sensation 
that users share and share and share — in the process gathering more num-
bers of viewers than there are grains of sand in an hourglass. Having your 
video go viral is like releasing a hit record or having your book make the New 
York Times best seller list, except that you’re unlikely to get anywhere near 
as rich from going viral even if you get a couple of million hits.

 Chapter 1: Making a Home on YouTube
Planning on a video going viral is like planning on winning the lottery. It could 
happen, but you shouldn’t bet on it. If you are seriously interested in earning 
some ad revenue from your video content, work on creating a range of com-
pelling content for your channel, rather than hoping on that one‐shot, grand 
slam home run.
While there’s no way of telling if a video will go viral, there are some traits 
that successful ones share. While we will discuss ways to improve the odds 
of your video going viral throughout the book, here are some factors that can 
make a video a runaway success:
✓
✓Spontaneity: There’s a real in‐the‐moment feel to a viral video that 
­captures a random and decisive moment that you could never repeat. 
The popular Sneezing Panda and its 200 million clicks comes to mind.
✓
✓Be light hearted: People love stuff that’s silly and that makes them laugh 
and think — or even consider trying something, much like the Coke and 
Mentos video collection that have drawn hundreds of millions of views.
✓
✓Get it out on social media: Yeah, you can rely on chance that someone 
stumbles across your video, but that’s sort of passive, like waiting by the 
phone for someone to “find you” for the job. A better tack would be for you 
to let social media know about your latest masterpiece. Just a few tweets 
here, a Facebook post there, and then maybe an announcement on Reddit 
could instantly start turning the wheels of virality.
Wasting lots and lots of time
One person’s waste of time is another’s quest for information, or someone’s 
need to laugh, or learn about something, so YouTube viewers simply spend a 
lot of time watching videos.
That’s a good thing, and a win‐win situation all around. The audience gets 
its dose of entertainment, education, and exploration. And your channel 
benefits because as viewership increases so does the potential for someone 
to find you, and when that someone finds your channel and you happen to 
have set it up for receiving advertising revenue (the YouTube term here is 
­monetization), you can earn some money.
Here are some numbers provided by YouTube that indicate how much 
(potential) time‐wasting is really going on:
✓
✓More than 1 billion unique users visit YouTube each month.
✓
✓Over 6 billion hours of video are watched each month on YouTube — 
almost an hour for every person on Earth.
✓
✓According to Nielsen, YouTube reaches more US adults ages 18 to 34 
than any cable network.

Seeing What Makes a YouTube  
Channel Unique
Four walls do not make a home — but it does provide a good start. How you 
adorn those walls and furnish those halls is what makes it uniquely yours — 
uniquely your home, in other words. Well, your YouTube channel is not 
much different.
When you first create a YouTube channel, it’s nothing more than an empty 
template on a page. Over time, you add videos, make playlists, and create 
a header with graphics, logo, and other information. Obviously, your video 
content plays a big part in what make your channel special, but so does the 
channel’s look and feel. Everything from the layout and font color to the type 
of content and its subscribers helps set one channel apart from the others.
Though this book takes pride in describing effective ways to create and main-
tain your YouTube channel for the next couple of hundred pages, let’s look at 
some basics first:
✓
✓Have people find your channel. If a tree falls in the forest and nobody 
hears it fall, does it make a sound? Who knows? More appropriately, if 
you create a YouTube channel and nobody visits it, it’s a safe bet to say 
that all your good work has come to nothing.
Viewers have to know that your channel exists before they can visit. The 
main way you have of letting people know you exist is by making sure 
your content shows up high in the search results of both Google and 
YouTube itself. (Don’t forget that YouTube is the second-most-popular 
search engine, just behind Google.) To get those high rankings, you have 
upper-left to associate tons of search‐engine‐friendly keywords with 
each of your videos — doing that will bring viewers searching for con-
tent in contact with your content, rather than someone else’s content. 
It’s also ­important that viewers watch, like, comment on, and share your 
video — yet more indications to the search engines that your content 
and channel are important. For good measure, use social media to prep 
your audience for content that’s coming down the pike — just like a 
movie studio creates a buzz for a big summer blockbuster by teasing 
you with previews and trailers weeks before release.
Users often take advantage of the Browse Channels feature, which they 
can access by clicking the drop‐down menu to the right of the YouTube 
TV icon in the upper-left corner of the home screen. (See Figure 1-4 for a 
view of that drop‐down menu.) The more appealing your channel looks 
at first glance, the more likely a viewer will stop to spend some time 
exploring your offerings.

17

 Chapter 1: Making a Home on YouTube
✓
✓Connect with your viewers. You definitely want to build a community 
of followers, and for that to happen, you need to actively communicate 
with them. That means everything from having them subscribe to your 
channel, engaging with them in your channel’s Comments section, and 
exposing them to your social media. You can do all this directly on your 
channel page.
Figure 1-4:

18
Part I: Getting Started With YouTube Channels 
✓
✓Provide them with a clear description of your channel. When viewers 
know what your channel has to offer, and if it appeals to their interests, 
they’re more likely to visit often, and maybe even subscribe to it. But 
you need to get the word out.
Angling for subscriptions
Viewers who like your content will come back and watch more, but ­viewers 
who love your content will want to subscribe. Why not? When you keep reach-
ing for the same magazine whenever you see it, eventually you just subscribe 
to it so it regularly comes to your door. YouTube offers repeat viewers of your 
channel the same option. Basically all they have to do is click the Subscribe 
button, as shown in Figure 1-5, on your channel’s home page.
After viewers subscribe to your channel, you have to make it worth 
their while to view it, or they’ll unsubscribe faster than you can say Jack 
Nicholson. Here’s what “making it worth their while” entails:
✓
✓Stay in touch subscribers. According to YouTube, viewers subscribe 
to millions of channels every day, so it’s important to stay in touch if 
you want to stay uppermost in their minds. Suggest that viewers follow 
you on social media so that you can let them know when new content 
is available. This strategy helps your audience grow as you amass a 
devoted fan base.
✓
✓Actively upload videos. It’s difficult to imagine a television station 
maintaining viewers if it doesn’t add new programs. Even if it were 
all Seinfeld all the time, chances are good that viewers would even­
tually drift off to something else. Well, the same concept applies for 
your YouTube channel. If you don’t upload new video content, you’ll 
lose the interest of your subscriber base. The takeaway here? Always 
­provide new content.

The

19

 Chapter 1: Making a Home on YouTube
✓
✓Pay close attention to tagging. Tagging is where you categorize your 
video after uploading it to YouTube. When a video is properly identified, 
it increases the possibility of someone else finding it, and that extends 
to future subscribers.
Establishing your brand
Whether it’s a consumer or a viewer, a brand makes your product or service 
immediately identifiable. Imagine that the Coca‐Cola logo looked different 
every time you saw it, or maybe the apple on your PowerBook wasn’t the 
same apple you saw one embossed on your iPhone. This lack of consistency 
could shatter your confidence in the product; you may start wondering if 
what you had was a cheap knock‐off of the real thing, rather than the genuine 
article.
Branding is designed to restore confidence in the product — that familiar 
logo makes us relax, knowing that we are sure to get the real thing. When it 
comes to your YouTube channel, branding becomes the identifiable element 
that lets viewers know who you are and what you’re all about, thus ­creating 
a similar feeling of confidence. Just like consumers flock to brands they 
­identify with, your audience will do the same with your brand.
Branding takes on many forms on YouTube:
✓
✓Intro clip: Before each video runs on your channel, you can insert 
a three‐second clip that acts as a label for your content. The torch‐­
carrying lady wrapped in a flag for Columbia Pictures and the roaring 
MGM lion are good examples of a branding element. Your job, if you 
choose to accept it, is to come up with an intro of your own that is 
equally compelling.
✓
✓Channel header: This element is the banner on top of your main 
page, and at first it’s as empty as a blank page. (See Figure 1-6.) You’ll 
­definitely want to click that Add Channel Art button to add a compelling 
picture or another graphic along with the name of your channel. The 
channel header can also include your contact info and specify how often 
you intend to upload new videos.
✓
✓Logo: Companies spend millions on branding when they have to come 
up with a new logo, because they have to track down and replace every 
single instance of the old logo. We’re guessing that’s not your problem — 
you just have to come up with your own logo, perhaps using a simple 
image and your name. If you feel graphically challenged, you can find 
places on the web to create one inexpensively. Or just have an ­artistic 
friend design a logo for you.

20
Part I: Getting Started With YouTube Channels 
✓
✓Playlists: If you have enough videos on your channel, you can create 
a running order of them. This playlist can provide an overview of your 
content or a specific sub‐topic of your videos. You can name every 
­playlist, and even re‐arrange them.
✓
✓Trailer: In a YouTube context, a trailer is a video that can automati-
cally play when visitors come to your channel. You can use the video 
most representative of your content as a kind of advertisement for your 
offerings, or you could make a short video that shows viewers what 
your channel is all about and how they can benefit from watching your 
videos.
Managing Channels for Fun  
and/or Profit
Everybody has a reason for making a video, and YouTube doesn’t discrimi-
nate as to why you do it. Whether you were influenced a little too much by 
the silly, everyday situations depicted on television series like America’s 
Funniest Home Videos, or you want to show off your post‐film-school ­prowess, 
or you’re looking to educate the masses with a series of how‐to videos — 
there’s a place for you on YouTube, and (you hope!) an audience that’s 
­willing to follow your exploits.
In addition to the pleasure that comes from a job well done, there’s also 
(potentially) a business side to running a YouTube channel. If you post 
videos that draw a lot of views, it’s worth your time for you to monetize your 
channel — generate some income from ad revenue, in other words. But that’s 
not the only business purpose YouTube channels can help with: They can 
serve as a great showcase for your particular skills or services, or act as a 
delivery system for product descriptions, tutorials, and testimonials associ-
ated with whatever your business is selling.

 Chapter 1: Making a Home on YouTube
Creating content
Whether you grab a 10‐second video of a gathering of friends, have some-
thing meaningful to say on your video blog, or plan a highly structured 
­production with sets and actors, you’re creating content.
Almost every topic under the sun is represented on YouTube. That diversity 
in topics is matched by an equally broad range of production levels. Some 
videos are quite sophisticated, displaying amazing production values, but 
many are fairly average. And a great deal are just poorly done and end up 
­getting shown in film classes as examples of what not to do.
Better production values increase your ability to grab viewers’ attention — 
maybe enough for them to watch the entire video and maybe enough for 
them to even consider watching whatever else you have to offer. The Holy 
Grail, of course, is having them feel so enthusiastic about what they see that 
they then share it with others.
But great video quality doesn’t happen accidentally; rather it’s done con-
sciously, from conception to upload. Though the topic is more thoroughly 
represented throughout this book, here are some key suggestions to always 
keep in mind.
✓
✓Plan before you film. Great videos begin in pre‐production. That means 
having an idea of the shooting location and working with some sort of 
script (or at least a storyboard of the kind of shots you want for the 
video).
Great planning leads to great production.
✓
✓Know your audience. When you’re just getting started, you try to make 
solid videos with good descriptions and hope that your audience finds 
you. After you have attracted a following, it’s still important to under-
stand who they are and whether your content is right for them. For 
example, if you start an entertainment blog that talks about  
up‐and‐coming hip‐hop artists, you should use language that’s consis-
tent with a younger demographic. Don’t overlook the importance of 
being highly aware of your potential audience.
✓
✓Keep viewers entertained. Regardless of the subject matter, it’s impor-
tant for viewers to enjoy the experience so that you hold their attention. 
Remember that hooking a viewer’s attention starts with the first ten 
seconds of the video (Why? Because viewers may leave before the good 
stuff and continues until it’s over).
✓
✓Let them learn something. People generally click on a video link in 
search of information. If they find it quickly and they were entertained, 
chances are good that they will love you.

Building an audience
After you create great content, you have to find people to watch it. After all, 
isn’t that the entire purpose of sharing your video with the world? Whether it 
starts with ten people who run across your student film, or a million people 
viewing your talking puppy video, building your audience is essential.
YouTube is no different from other media when it comes to emphasizing the 
importance of building an audience. For example, you may have the catchiest 
song of all time, but if no one has ever heard it or even knows it exists, then 
that song cannot by any stretch of the imagination be called a success. The 
same is true for your videos — you need to work at getting as many people as 
possible to watch them.
Successfully building your audience depends on understanding their needs 
and making sure you can deliver on what your channel promises. Catering to 
your audience — whether it consists of one person or ten million — centers 
on understanding them and satisfying their appetite. (For more on building 
your audience, check out Chapter 10.)
Building a business
In addition to letting you upload your videos to satisfy the fun side of your 
personality, YouTube can work wonders for your business side. You can 
easily set your account to monetize video content, as mentioned in the next 
section; as long as enough viewers click on your video, you can earn some 
extra money. If you’ve got something to sell or a service to offer, you can also 
leverage YouTube for some pretty cool and powerful advertising. As you’ll 
see in Chapter 13, it’s simple enough for anyone to do it.
Monetization
You can earn money with your YouTube channel every time someone clicks 
on your video. The more people who view your content, the more money 
you can potentially make, and YouTube makes it easy to do so. All it takes is 
an account in good standing, an understanding of the guidelines, and your 
­guarantee to upload only original content to get approval from YouTube.
Now that users have found the potential to make money on YouTube, it’s 
become like the California gold rush of 1849. Motivated entrepreneurs are 
setting up shop in the hope of striking it big with their YouTube channels.

23

 Chapter 1: Making a Home on YouTube
As you might expect, not everybody will strike it rich. In fact, very few will 
strike it rich. Nevertheless, it is possible to earn a goodly amount, especially 
if you take advantage of the multiple ways you can make money through your 
YouTube channel, including views of your video (an ad plays at the begin-
ning) or clicks on a banner or other display ad on your channel’s page. Just 
keep in mind that slow and steady wins the race — making money takes time, 
or at least it will take time until you build a massive following. (For more on 
monetization, check out Chapter 14.)

n the simplest sense, YouTube is a website designed for sharing video. 
Before YouTube’s founding in 2005, posting and sharing a video online 
was difficult: The bandwidth and storage needed to stream video were 
expensive, and many copyright risks were involved in letting people upload 
whatever they wanted. Because YouTube was willing to absorb the costs and 
ignore the risks, it provided the infrastructure for users to upload and view 
as much video as they wanted, for free. This proposition turned out to be a 
popular one.
Google acquired YouTube in 2006, and YouTube’s growth continued. As of 
2014, users watch more than 6 billion hours of video per month, and more 
than 300 hours of video are uploaded every minute.
Let us say that last part again: 300 hours of video are uploaded to YouTube 
every minute.
Given that amount of content, you, as an individual, could never watch every-
thing that’s available on YouTube. For every minute of video you watch, 
you’re 300 hours behind. For every work of genius, such as “Cat in a Shark 
Costume Chases a Duck While Riding a Roomba,” YouTube has literally tens 
of thousands of poorly shot, poorly edited videos of family vacations, dance 
recitals, and bad jokes that could possibly be of interest only to the uploader. 
This chapter serves as your (essential) guide to finding the good parts while 
skipping the bad. (Hey, it’s a tough job, but somebody had to do it, and that 
somebody was us.) We help you navigate the YouTube interface, establish 
Chapter 2

an account, and start looking ahead to planning a channel. If you’re new to 
YouTube or you need to dig a bit deeper as a user, this is the chapter for you.
What You’ll Find on YouTube
You’ll find, in a word, videos on YouTube. You’ll find, in several words, just 
about anything on YouTube. We would say that you’ll find anything you can 
imagine, but even we never would have imagined that anyone would make a 
10‐hour loop of the Nyan Cat meme video, and we definitely wouldn’t have 
imagined that it would have been viewed over 39 million times. The best way 
to describe what’s on YouTube may be to start with the categories YouTube 
lists on its home page.
Managing your identity
Your entire YouTube experience is driven by whether YouTube knows who 
you are. It doesn’t use any magic to figure that out. Instead, YouTube simply 
determines whether you’re logged in or logged out. When you log in, YouTube 
can make video recommendations based on your viewing behavior. In other 
words, after YouTube knows what you like, it does its best to bring more of 
that great video content to you.
YouTube and its parent Google are in the advertising business and are not 
­promoting online video for the betterment of mankind. (Though some channels 
on YouTube actually help achieve that goal.) By understanding your viewing 
behavior when you’re logged in, YouTube and Google are able to serve better 
and more relevant ads to you. That’s good for them, for the advertiser, and for 
the viewer. Sure, most people don’t like ads, but YouTube is truly trying to do 
a better job of targeting ads. (Chapter 13 covers this topic in more detail.)
As you can see in this chapter and throughout the book, you need to be 
logged in to do most of the important things on YouTube. Sure, you can 
watch videos without being logged in, but you’ll miss a good part of the expe-
rience. You need a Google account to log in, and we show you how to set up 
one of those a little later in this chapter. You also have the option of creating 
a YouTube channel that goes with your Google account.
You don’t need a YouTube channel to log in to YouTube, just a Google 
account. Having a channel though, as you’ll soon find out, will help you 
­organize your YouTube viewing without having to create any videos.

 Chapter 2: The Basics of YouTube
Navigating the home page
The home page of YouTube (www.youtube.com) is a fickle beast. It was 
once the fount of discovery for YouTube users. If you were looking for 
new content, the home page was the place to be. Over the years, though, 
YouTube changed the home page experience. Many changes have been tied 
to the company’s desire to know its users. Users who are logged in with 
accounts and who have a history of using YouTube see videos that might 
appeal to them based on past usage. New users and those not logged in see 
the things that are currently most popular on the site.
The logged‐in experience
As long as you’re logged in to YouTube when you watch videos, the site is 
busily keeping track of everything you see and trying to form an idea about 
what kind of videos you like. This information dynamically drives the home 
page you see, and YouTube tries to show you videos that it thinks you’ll like. 
Your home page will come to be dominated by material that is similar to 
material you’ve watched in the past.
Here’s a quick tour of what you’re likely to see when you log on to 
www.youtube.com after you create an account. (Again, we tell you more 
about creating an account later in this chapter.) Take a look at Figure 2-1 
to see how a YouTube home page looks when you log in, and then read the 
descriptions in the following list:
Along the top
✓
✓The YouTube button: Though it looks exactly like the YouTube logo, 
this button actually does something in addition to looking pretty; click-
ing it always brings you back to the YouTube home page.
✓
✓The Guide icon: This button, consisting of three horizontal bars with a 
small down arrow, sits next to the YouTube button. Clicking it brings up 
a guide of channels and topics that may be of interest to the viewer.
✓
✓The Search box: This is where you search for videos. Enter keywords to 
find videos that may match what you’re looking for.
✓
✓The Upload button: When you’re ready to upload a video, you get 
started by using this button. (Read more about the Upload button in 
Chapter 9.)
✓
✓The Notifications bell: As a YouTube channel manager, you can be noti-
fied when activity happens on your channel, including comments, video 
sharing, and more.

28
Part I: Getting Started With YouTube Channels 
✓
✓Channel icon: A round image button shows either the channel icon you 
come up with or an image associated with your Google ID when you’re 
logged in. Use this to get to Creator Studio, which is your YouTube 
­“mission control center,” or to configure your YouTube account ­settings. 
You’ll learn about both of those features in Chapter 3.
You can log into YouTube through your Google account, but we recom-
mend having an associated YouTube channel to get all the benefits 
of your YouTube experience, such as creating playlists. (For more on 
­playlists, see Chapter 3.)
Down the left side
The menu functions running down the left side of the screen complement 
the functionality of the ones that run across the top and focus more on 
content. You can toggle what’s shown on the left side by ­clicking the 
Guide icon.
✓
✓What to Watch: This option is selected by default when you arrive at the 
YouTube home page. When this section is selected, the main window of 
the site shows you lists of channels and videos that YouTube assumes 
you’ll like:

 Chapter 2: The Basics of YouTube
• My Channel: Clicking this link brings up the home page of your 
YouTube channel and shows you how other viewers see it. My 
Channel includes channel art, video trailers, sections, and chan-
nels you recommend. To handle all the behind‐the‐scenes manage-
ment, you use Creator Studio, which you learn about in Chapter 3.
• My Subscriptions: This is where you manage the channels you’re 
subscribed to. Subscriptions are a good way to keep track of the 
channels you like on YouTube, but the subscription model has 
changed a lot in the past couple of years. We talk about subscrip-
tions in detail in Chapter 10.
• History: Click here to review your YouTube history, which can be 
extensive. You can track which channels you’ve visited and which 
videos you’ve watched, and even see your comment history, all in 
one place.
You’ll end up seeing a lot of videos on YouTube and there’s going 
to be a point where you’ll want to go back to see what you’ve 
viewed or to watch a particular video again. The History section is 
a great way to keep track of what you’ve watched and analyze your 
viewing.
• Watch Later: This link leads to a list of videos you’ve flagged for 
later viewing using the creatively named Watch Later button in the 
YouTube player window.
✓
✓Playlists: Playlists are a great way to organize videos you’ve discovered 
on YouTube. This section highlights some of your playlists and has a 
clickable link to your Playlist Management page. There, you can create 
and edit playlists for your own consumption, or you can use them to 
organize the videos on your channel, as discussed in detail in Chapter 3.
✓
✓Subscriptions: This section highlights some of your subscriptions and 
has a clickable link to your Subscription Management page. You learned 
earlier that subscriptions are a good way to keep track of the channels 
you like on YouTube.
✓
✓Browse Channels: This link takes you to a page where YouTube makes 
suggestions of channels that may interest you based on your prior view-
ing habits. It recommends channels in many of the categories we look 
into in the “Logged-out experience”, later in this chapter.
• Manage Subscriptions: Click to go to the Subscription Management 
page, where you can control how your subscriptions are organized 
and how you’re notified about activity on the ­channels to which 
you subscribe.

30
Part I: Getting Started With YouTube Channels 
✓
✓You’ve now seen more than a few references to subscriptions in the 
Guide. Subscriptions and subscription management are a big deal on 
YouTube because they serve to support a strong connection between a 
viewer and a channel.
Advertisement
✓
✓Banner ad: Last but not least, the largest element on the YouTube land-
ing page is a banner ad — sometimes with and sometimes without its 
own, embedded video. The ad is probably not what you came to YouTube 
to see, but ad revenue keeps the lights on and the video flowing.
✓
✓If you’d rather not look at the big banner ad, you can usually close the 
ad by clicking the Close Ad button in one of the banner’s corners.
The logged‐out experience
When you arrive at YouTube before you’ve taken the trouble to create an 
account, you see the pure, innocent YouTube of the viewer with no view-
ing history. Treasure this moment, this innocence, this pure instant of 
seeing the site as it is. You’ll soon be a jaded viewer, with a viewing history 
filled with reminders of the hours spent watching One Direction videos. 
Have a look at Figure 2-2 to see what YouTube looks like to the user who is 
logged out.
Why does YouTube have ads?
It’s always flattering when people listen to you 
and seem to be interested in knowing exactly 
who you are. You might think that YouTube is 
a great listener, just because it takes a great 
interest in the kinds of videos you’re watch-
ing, but that’s not because YouTube has sud-
denly decided that you two are going to be Best 
Friends Forever. The truth is that YouTube’s 
product — the way it makes money — is not 
streaming video. In fact, the streaming video 
part costs the company quite a bit of money 
because it’s expensive for it to host the GoPro 
videos you made of your dog’s bath.
So if YouTube isn’t making money hosting 
and serving videos, how is it making money? 
Here’s the dirty secret: It’s making money 
selling advertisements! That means you are 
YouTube’s product. It’s selling your attention to 
advertisers, and that’s why YouTube wants so 
badly to know you. It wants to be able to tell its 
ad‐buying customers exactly who is watching 
their ads.
Though all this information may seem to be 
much like a dystopian police state, it turns out 
that it’s something that can work in your favor 
when you launch a channel with an eye toward 
making money from your content. We get to the 
details on grabbing your share of YouTube ad 
revenue in Chapter 14.


 Chapter 2: The Basics of YouTube
On the left side of the screen, you see a list of links to the Best of YouTube 
channels. These verticals, as they’re called, are the primary content divisions 
on YouTube. Verticals are sort of like the sections of a newspaper. Like a 
newspaper, YouTube is organized into sections so that you can find the type 
of content you want to watch. You can subscribe to any of these verticals like 
it’s a normal user channel.
The programming on YouTube is divided into verticals. (Anywhere else, these 
content divisions would be called genres.) Verticals are all a combination of 
YouTube native content (content produced by regular YouTube users) and 
content produced by traditional media companies like CNN and The Onion. 
One amazing aspect of YouTube is that individuals can still manage to have 
a voice just as loud as the major media players (which is one fundamental 
point of this book).
It’s time to see what the verticals have to offer:
✓
✓Popular on YouTube: This one is very much what it sounds like — a 
channel filled with what’s currently popular now on YouTube across 
diverse categories, from news to music videos and everywhere ­in‐
between. It’s also a great way to keep up with what’s hot in contempo-
rary culture.
Figure 2-2: 
The logged‐
out YouTube 
home page.

32
Part I: Getting Started With YouTube Channels 
✓
✓Music: Music is a big deal on YouTube. Twenty‐two of the 100 most‐­
subscribed channels are music channels. Though MTV once showed 
music videos, that niche is now filled by YouTube, and much of that 
traffic is dominated by VEVO, which offers music videos from big‐name 
entertainment conglomerates such as Universal Music Group and Sony 
Music Entertainment.
✓
✓Sports: Sports videos are also extremely popular on YouTube. The 
Sports vertical is an interesting blend of mainstream sports video from 
sources like ESPN, the NFL, and other major sports leagues, to ­parkour 
and extreme sports videos shot with the extremely popular GoPro 
camera line.
✓
✓Gaming: This vertical is one of the most mysterious. It has, of course, 
the content you’d expect, including promotional videos from game 
publishers, reviews and news from established video game voices like 
IGN, reviews from YouTube users, and content from some of the largest 
multi‐channel networks, such as Machinima. (You’ll learn more about 
multi‐channel networks, also known as MCNs, in Bonus Chapter 2.) 
The Gaming vertical is also the home of the Let’s Play genre, one of the 
most popular on YouTube. Creators such as PewDiePie and Sky Does 
Minecraft garner millions of viewers posting videos of themselves play-
ing popular video games and commenting on the gameplay as they 
play. These videos are hugely popular, and Minecraft demonstrations 
­especially have a huge audience of young people on YouTube.
✓
✓Education: In the Education vertical, you’ll find a wide range of educa-
tional videos. Universities and education foundations are very active, 
but it also has many YouTube natives, like the Khan Academy, CGP 
Grey, Minute Physics, Crash Course, and SciShow. Language learning is 
another immensely popular subsection of the Education vertical.
✓
✓Movies: This one is home to YouTube’s movie rental business. You 
can rent Hollywood releases for streaming here, but we’ve never heard 
of anyone doing that. Some free movies are available and are worth 
­checking out.
✓
✓TV Shows: In the TV Shows section, viewers can rent — you guessed 
it — streaming television shows.
✓
✓News: The News vertical consists of channels that cover a wide range of 
beats, including national news, world news, science, sports, entertain-
ment, and so on.
✓
✓Live: You can catch live events from gaming to music to sports and 
much more.

33

 Chapter 2: The Basics of YouTube
✓
✓Spotlight: This is somewhat different from “Popular on YouTube” in that 
it itemizes what’s new and emerging. Because it covers a collection of 
topics, you may find yourself spending more time in this section than 
you originally planned.
✓
✓Browse channels: Consists of a summary look at channels across 
­different categories and interest groups.
You can get a look at the home page without all the baggage of your past 
video views at any time. That way, you’ll be sure to see (unfiltered) what’s 
trending on the site. Just put your browser in a private browsing mode, such 
as Chrome’s incognito browsing, and you’ll see the YouTube home page 
with new eyes. You’ll see which videos are hot on the site without any of the 
­context of your past browsing.
In Apple’s Safari browser and Mozilla Firefox, incognito browsing is called 
­private browsing. In Internet Explorer, it’s called InPrivate browsing.
Watching a video
The reason that most people visit YouTube is to watch videos. That should 
probably be one of the first things you do when you arrive. After familiarizing 
yourself with the home page, try clicking on a video. You’re taken to a Watch 
page, which should look a lot like the one shown in Figure 2-3.
The Watch page is, first and foremost, for viewing videos, but it has a number 
of other functions as well. You’ll want to be familiar with a number of ele-
ments on this page:
✓
✓Video Player: Front and center is the video player, which you’ll use to 
watch the video.
✓
✓Video Info: Tucked beneath the video player you’ll see the video info, 
including the video’s title, view count, and a description field with 
­information about the video.
✓
✓Comments: Everybody has an opinion, right? What’s true about the 
world outside is equally true in the world of YouTube. Here’s where 
viewers can comment on and discuss the video, and where the uploader 
occasionally joins in the discussion.
✓
✓Suggestions: Along the right side of the screen are the suggested videos, 
which are YouTube’s best guesses about what you might want to watch 
next, based on the video you’re watching and your overall watch history.

34
Part I: Getting Started With YouTube Channels 
That’s the birds‐eye view. The next few sections take a closer look at some of 
these features in a bit more detail.
The YouTube algorithm, the mysterious piece of code that is responsible for 
guessing what you want to watch next, is uncannily effective a lot of the time. 
The suggested videos have the ability to suck you into what is known as the 
YouTube spiral, in which you can potentially lose hours of your life clicking 
on video after video and eventually end up watching infomercials from the 
mid‐1980s with no clear idea how you got there.
Figure 2-3: 
The Watch 
page.


 Chapter 2: The Basics of YouTube
The player
The most noticeable item on the Watch page is the video player. As with 
most video players, the YouTube version has a number of controls ranging 
along the along the bottom. Here’s an overview of what each control does:
✓
✓The Scrubber: This bar runs the length of the video player and allows 
the viewer to jump around in the video. Click on the white circle and 
drag it to the right to “scrub” forward in the video.
✓
✓The Play/Pause button: This button stops and starts the video stream.
✓
✓The Mute/Volume control: When you roll over the speaker symbol, 
the Volume bar appears. Click the speaker to mute the audio. Use the 
volume slider to adjust the volume.
✓
✓The Counter: This is the timer for the video. It shows you how much 
viewing time has elapsed as well as the total length of the video.
✓
✓Watch Later: This button looks like a clock, and it simply adds the cur-
rent video to the Watch Later playlist. The idea here is that, with this 
playlist keeping track of what you want to watch, you can easily wait for 
that perfect moment to watch the desired video(s).
✓
✓Closed Captions: This button, marked CC, toggles the captions. Not 
every video has good captions. (For more on captions — good, bad, and 
indifferent — check out Chapter 9.)
✓
✓Settings: You have to click the little Gear icon to access the Settings 
menu, but that’s not too hard to do. For most videos, the available set-
tings include toggling annotations on and off (we cover annotations in 
Chapter 10), changing the video speed, and setting the resolution of the 
video. We’re big fans of watching the videos at normal speed and at the 
highest available resolution.
✓
✓Display Controls: You can change the size of the default player to show 
across the width of the browser (Theater mode) or take over the entire 
display (Full screen).
Most videos do not default to 1080p or 720p HD. The default playback is 
often 480p or lower, which doesn’t look that great. If you want to watch 
videos in high definition, you have to become familiar with the Settings 
menu. Keep in mind that your Internet connection needs to be fast 
enough to stream HD video to avoid interruption.
The video info section
Directly below the video player, you’ll find a bunch of information about the 
video that we usually call the video info. You can see a lot of data about each 
video there, as you can see in Figure 2-4.

36
Part I: Getting Started With YouTube Channels 
Here’s a list of the most important information to pay attention to in the 
video info:
✓
✓Title: In large type just below the video player is the title of the video. 
(We talk more about titles — more effective titles, to be specific — in 
Chapter 9. For now, think “catchy and relevant.”)
✓
✓Channel information: Just below the title you’ll find the channel name 
and a logo known as the channel icon.
✓
✓Subscription status and control: In Chapter 10, you discover that sub-
scriptions are important to channel managers and viewers because 
subscriptions provide a better level of engagement among the two. The 
Subscribe button, which is to the right of the channel icon, appears 
in red with a subscriber count number if the viewer is not subscribed. 
Simply clicking the button enables the subscription, and the button 
turns gray while adding a secondary subscription setting button that 
looks like a gear. Click this secondary button to control how you want to 
receive updates from the channel. To unsubscribe to a channel, all you 
need to do is click the gray Unsubscribed button.
Figure 2-4: 
The video 
info section.

37

 Chapter 2: The Basics of YouTube
✓
✓Like or Dislike: The Thumbs Up and Thumbs Down buttons allow you 
a quick, simple way to let your feelings about a video be known. Just to 
be clear, punch the Thumbs Up button if you like the video; punch the 
Thumbs Down if you don’t.
✓
✓Add to: Over time, you’ll want to keep track and organize the video 
you’re viewing. If you’re using YouTube videos to help you with a 
kitchen renovation, you may want to keep all the videos about cabinet 
installation in one place. That place is the playlist, and you learn about it 
in Chapter 3 and Chapter 9. You can save a list of all the videos you want 
to watch later or videos that are your favorites.
✓
✓Share: Next up is the Share link. When you click the Share link, you’re 
shown a few different ways that you can share the video and get the 
world to look at it. (You can see the various Share settings in Figure 2-5.) 
Don’t forget that YouTube is also a social media platform that’s quite 
capable of letting you easily share to Facebook, LinkedIn, reddit, and 
other sites. YouTube also lets you share video on a website with simple 
HTML embed code, and if that’s not your style, you can simply email a 
video link to your friends.
Figure 2-5:  
Sharing  
videos.

38
Part I: Getting Started With YouTube Channels 
✓
✓More: This catch-all button lets you see more information on the video if 
the channel manager offers it up. This info includes statistics about the 
video and a transcript. You can also report this video to YouTube if you 
see something inappropriate in its content. This last piece should be 
used only sparingly — Chapter 10 covers the details.
✓
✓Description: The video description field should provide all sorts of help-
ful information about the video and a way for viewers to get additional 
information, which may include links to make a purchase or support 
your candidate, for example. Only part of the description is shown, so a 
viewer can click the Show More bar under the description summary to 
see the rest of the information. Chapter 9 shows you how to best orga-
nize the description field.
✓
✓Comments: Comments about the video are placed just below the 
description section. Regular YouTubers know that comments can 
be highly informative and occasionally pretty bad. Remember that 
YouTube is a social media platform and with it comes the good, the bad, 
and the ugly — especially in the Comments section. As a channel man-
ager, you definitely want comments, but keep in mind that you can filter 
out inappropriate ones or ban specific users who only cause trouble. 
(We tell you more on comments management in Chapter 10.)
Working with a YouTube Account
There are a number of reasons you’d want to open a YouTube account. 
Though the logged‐out experience is interesting, you need an account to 
subscribe to channels, create playlists, comment on videos, and gener-
ally become part of the YouTube community. Not to mention, you need an 
account to launch your channel where you will upload videos, run ads on 
those videos, and generate some revenue.
Be aware that signing up for a YouTube account means signing up for a 
Google account. Google owns YouTube, and recently, Google has been 
busy unifying its products under a single login, allowing you to use one 
username and password to log in to its complementary services like 
Gmail, Google Drive, Calendar, and Maps in addition to your new YouTube 
account. You’ll also create an account for Google’s almost universally 
unpopular social network, Google+. This Google+ integration has been 
a big deal at Google in the past couple of years, and Google+ has slowly 
infiltrated many of Google’s most popular offerings. This has caused some 
unhappiness among longtime YouTubers, but for the new user, it shouldn’t 
be too much of a burden.

39

 Chapter 2: The Basics of YouTube
Getting an account
One of the first things you notice when you arrive on the YouTube home 
page is the Sign In button in the upper-right corner of the screen. Google 
and YouTube want you logged in so it can monitor your viewing habits and 
provide more focused video recommendations and — ultimately — relevant 
advertising. If you already have a Google account and you want to use that 
account to house your channel, you can. If you’re creating a new channel, it 
may make sense to create a new Google account to go with it.
You’re going to be using this channel as your business and, as someone once 
said, “You should never mix business and pleasure.” Though not always 100 
percent true — many people have jobs they truly enjoy — this statement 
definitely applies in this case. If you take all the principles in this book to 
heart, and have a bit of luck, your channel could become very popular. You’ll 
then be in the unenviable position of running your new online video busi-
ness in your personal email account, and you’ll be stuck with the job of sift-
ing through the guilt‐inducing emails from your mother, the advertisement 
for the big sale at the store where you bought a gift for your ex once (like 12 
years ago), and, of course, stuff that might actually be important. Rather than 
deal with that hassle, just go ahead and start a new account. It’s free.
Follow these steps to get a Google account you can use on YouTube:
1.	Click the blue Sign In button.
Doing so takes you to the Google login screen, shown in Figure 2-6, 
where you can log in or create a new account.
Last time we checked, the big blue Sign In button was in the upper-right 
corner of the screen, but be aware that YouTube, like all other websites, 
tends to redesign things and move buttons around from time to time.
If you already have a Google account, you may already be logged in. If 
you’re creating a new account to go with a new channel, it may help to 
use a private browsing mode in your web browser to avoid confusing 
Google.
2.	Click the Create an Account link below the Username and Password 
fields.
Doing so takes you to the Create Your Google Account page.
3.	Fill in the necessary information.
The fields shown in Figure 2-7 are much what you’d expect, but here’s a 
description of each item anyway:
• Name: This is the name that will be associated with your account. 
You can use your real name here, or a made-up name that has 

40
Part I: Getting Started With YouTube Channels 
something to do with your account. Just be aware that the name will 
function as the public face of your channel, so sophomoric attempts 
at humor are probably not the way to go. Note that creating a new 
account here automatically creates a new (linked) Google+ account.
• Your current address: We like Gmail, so create a new Gmail address 
when setting a new account rather than using your current email 
address. It will make all your YouTube work easier. Below this field 
is a link that offers the option to create a new Gmail account.
• Password: You’ve probably done the Create a Password and Confirm 
Your Password song‐and‐dance a thousand times before, so we 
won’t offer any advice other than to recommend that you follow the 
sound password tips that Google offers during this process.
• Birthday: No ifs, ands, or buts — you need to choose a birthday. 
You may not wish to show your real age, what with YouTube 
largely being a young person’s game, but we’re also not going to 
encourage you to lie.
If you’re going to be a smart aleck and decide to give the age of 
your channel rather than your own age, make the age at least 18. 
Some content on YouTube has age restrictions, and giving your 
channel a birthday that makes it less than 18 years old can come 
back to bite you.
• Gender: Gender is truly up to you. It’s a sensitive subject these 
days, so we’re not going to joke about it here. Personally, when 
we’re creating business accounts, we usually choose Other, 
because we think of the channels as an inanimate object.
• Mobile phone: A mobile phone number is required for identity 
confirmation and account recovery processes. (You use account 
recovery when you’ve forgotten your password.)
• Prove you’re not a robot: Prove that you’re a human by typing in the 
alphanumeric code that’s shown in the image. Google does what it 
can to prevent computer programs (known as robots or ‘bots) from 
setting up accounts.
• Set your location: Google’s terms and conditions for YouTube are dic-
tated by country. When we think of the Internet, we don’t necessar-
ily consider borders, but it’s especially important for video rights.
• Agree to Google’s terms and services agreement: This is the requisite 
“fine print.” We’ll leave it to you and your legal representation to 
decide whether you’re comfortable with it.
• Email: If you’ve chosen to set up new Gmail email address, you’ll be 
asked to provide an alternative email, also for security and recovery. 
If you’re using your current email, then this field won’t appear.

4.	Click Next Step.
If Google doesn’t recognize your phone number or your current or alter-
native email address, you’ll need to verify your account via text message 
or a voice call. You’re given the choice on a page like the one shown in 
Figure 2-8. If it does recognize you, it will ask you to set up a Google+ 
profile. If that’s the case, you don’t need to verify and you may proceed 
directly to Step 7.
5.	Choose your verification method and then click Continue.
Whichever method you choose — Voice Call or Text Message (SMS) — 
Google manages to get a verification code sent your way.
6.	In the Enter Verification Code text field, enter the code that was sent 
to you (see Figure 2-9) and then click Continue.
The next screen requires that you create a Google+ account. This is not 
optional. Google has had trouble attracting users to its social network, 
Google+, and this is how it generates user interest — by requiring users 
of its more popular services to have a Google+ account as well. There’s 
no getting out of it, so don’t even try.

You can add an account picture by clicking the Add a Photo link. Note 
that you don’t need to create a public profile, but YouTube management

If you have completed all the steps to set up your YouTube account, includ-
ing clicking that Back to YouTube button to close out the process, you

 Chapter 2: The Basics of YouTube
the first thing you get to do is log in with the account you created using these 
steps:
1.	Click the Sign In button at the top of the YouTube main screen.
You’re taken once again to the Google Sign In screen (refer to Figure 2-4) 
and prompted to enter your account details.
2.	Sign in with the email address and password that you used when 
­creating your account.
You’re in! You’ll see a blue banner across the top that says “You are now 
registered with YouTube!”
At this point, you’re logged into YouTube, but don’t yet have your channel 
set up. We’ll cover that in the next section.
Creating a YouTube Channel
Building a channel is what you came here to do, and now it’s time to get to 
it. You can do the work to establish your channel after you’ve logged in to 
YouTube with a Google account. After that’s done, follow these steps to get 
your channel off the ground:
1.	Log in to YouTube, and click your channel icon in the top right to 
bring up the Creator Studio and YouTube Settings pull-down menu.
2.	Click the Gear icon.
You’re taken straight to the Account Settings Overview screen.
In most Google products, this Gear icon means “settings.”
You should now be looking at a simple overview of your account infor-
mation, similar to the one shown in Figure 2-12.
3.	To create your channel, click the Create a channel link next to your 
email address.
Doing so opens the Use YouTube As dialog box, shown in Figure 2-13, 
which prompts you to choose a channel name.
4.	Decide on a channel name.
Your choices are to go with the name associated with your Google+ 
account for your channel — click the OK button in the Use YouTube As 
dialog box to do that — or to choose a custom name. Most readers of 
this book are hoping to make a business of their YouTube channel, so 
you’ll probably want to choose a custom name.

5.	(Optional) To choose a custom name, click the link labeled To Use a 
Business or Other Name, Click Here.
Sometimes it’s okay to use your real name for your channel. If your con-
tent will be personality based (a vlog based around you, for example), 
this can work just fine. See the nearby sidebar, “Choosing a channel 
name,” for more insight on picking a good channel name.
6.	(Optional) Enter your custom channel name into the Create a New 
Channel dialog box, as shown in Figure 2-14.
7.	Choose a category for your channel from the drop-down menu below 
the channel name.
Your (rather limited) choices here are pretty much what you’d expect:
• Product or Brand
• Company, Institution, or Organization
• Arts, Entertainment, or Sports
• Other
Figure 2-14:

48
Part I: Getting Started With YouTube Channels 
Choosing a channel name
Take a reflective pause before you choose a 
username or channel name or other identify-
ing criteria you want as your public face for the 
whole YouTube world. An overhasty decision 
here could end up being one that you regret 
later. Many a creator has made the mistake of 
beginning to upload videos to what they thought 
would remain a low‐key, personal channel, 
only to have that channel take off in popularity, 
at which point they begin to feel trapped in a 
channel named after their cat. (Okay, just to be 
clear, this wouldn’t be a problem if the channel 
is actually about your cat). The Google+ inte-
gration actually makes changing the channel 
name on the fly pretty easy and painless, even 
after the fact. The channel URL, however, is a 
different story, and you’ll learn about that later 
in this chapter.
Keep the following advice in mind when making 
your reflections:
Don’t rush into anything. You should think 
hard about this decision. Though it seems 
like a light one, it really can impact the suc-
cess of your channel in the long run if you 
choose a bad name.
✓
✓Try to relate the name to your content. Are 
you creating a channel about video games? 
Try to work a gaming term into your title. If 
you plan to create fitness‐related content, 
try to integrate workout or sports terms.
✓
✓Avoid profanity, vulgarity, and inside 
jokes. Though you may find it hilarious to 
name your channel Dadfarts, a name like 
that will necessarily limit your market. It’s 
hard to predict what path your videos might 
take on their way out into the world, and a 
sophomoric name (or a downright obscene 
one) might deter your viewers from sharing 
your video. Note: You want people to share 
your videos!
✓
✓Make the name catchy. Your channel name 
needs to be memorable. People love puns, 
rhyming, and alliteration, but don’t try to 
integrate all three. That might be a little 
much.
✓
✓Make it easy to spell. People need to be 
able to find your channel, and choosing a 
word that’s difficult to spell can prevent 
people from finding you. Do not see this as 
a felicitous opportunity to create a recon-
dite channel name thronged with abstruse 
vocabulary that will confuse and confound 
your potential viewers.
✓
✓Make it easy for people to talk about. 
When you think you’ve hit on the perfect 
name, try reading it aloud a few times and 
make sure you can pronounce it. You want 
to have a channel name that people can 
talk about and make themselves under-
stood. The best test for this is to call a 
friend on the phone and direct her to 
your channel. If you can tell your friend 
the channel name and she can get there 
without your having to spell it, you’ve got a 
usable name on your hands.
✓
✓Make sure the name is available and 
that you won’t be confused with another 
business on YouTube or elsewhere. You 
should search the web in general and 
YouTube specifically to make sure your 
brilliant channel name isn’t already in use 
elsewhere. You should also ensure that 
the URL you prefer is available. YouTube’s 
allocation of URLs is not automatic, and you 
choose your custom URL in a later step. So, 
even if your channel name is available, your 
custom URL may not be available. Check 
this in advance, or else it can turn into a 
real problem.

49

 Chapter 2: The Basics of YouTube
After you’ve chosen a channel name and a category, YouTube notes that 
you’re also creating another Google+ account, this one in the name of 
your channel.
You can assign verticals or genres to each video individually when you 
upload it. For more about that process, check out Chapter 9.
8.	Agree to the terms and conditions for Google+ accounts by selecting 
the check box.
You’ll also get a new Google+ page by default. You don’t have to do 
­anything with this, but it’s a good place to share some of your YouTube 
and social media activity if you have a following there.
9.	Click the Done button.
You are now the proud owner of a channel with no content and a boring 
default layout. (Check out Figure 2-15 to see what we mean.) You’ll notice in 
the upper-right corner that the name has changed from your Google account 
name to your brand‐spanking‐new channel name. But all that is covered in 
Chapter 3. You have even more account setup tasks to complete.

Verifying Your YouTube Channel
Before you get around to beautifying your channel and making it your own, 
you need to verify your channel to prove that you’re a real human being and 
not some kind of Internet robot who has created this channel for nefarious 
purposes. Several steps are involved in verifying your account:
1.	Log in to YouTube and click your channel icon in the top right to 
bring up the Creator Studio and YouTube Settings pull-down menu.
2.	Click the Gear icon.
3.	Doing so takes you to the Account Settings Overview page.
Click the View Additional Features link (refer to Figure 2-12).
A long list of features appears, but you’re interested in the Verify 
­feature — you need to verify again before you can move on.
4.	Click the Verify button.
The Account Verification page appears, spelling out that account veri-
fication is a two‐step process. The first step of the verification asks for 
your country location and asks you to specify how you want to receive a 
verification code, as shown in Figure 2-16.
Figure 2-16: 
Verification, 
Step 1.

51

 Chapter 2: The Basics of YouTube
5.	Specify your country location, choose a verification method, and then 
click Next.
You can receive a verification code by text message or voice call. Since 
you needed a mobile number to sign up for your basic Google account, 
you’ll probably choose Text Message, but if you want the pleasure of 
listening to an automated phone system, you can opt for the voice call. 
Just pick an option and click Next, which takes you to Step 2, as shown 
in Figure 2-17. Whichever delivery method you choose, you’ll soon 
receive a numeric code.
6.	Enter your verification code and then click Submit.
You move on to a screen with a satisfying check mark that informs you 
that you’re verified.
7.	Click Continue.
You are now verified! You’re returned to the Additional Features page, 
where this whole verification thing began.
This simple verification unlocks a number of features within your YouTube 
account, many of which now have green dots next to them on the Additional 
Features page. We list only a few of the new abilities you’ve just unlocked for 
your channel:
Figure 2-17: 
Verification, 
Step 2.

52
Part I: Getting Started With YouTube Channels 
✓
✓Longer videos: You can now upload videos more than 15 minutes long.
✓
✓External annotations: Links to outside websites can now be placed in 
your videos. (For more on how to do this, check out Chapter 10.)
✓
✓Custom thumbnails: You can now upload custom images to act as 
the thumbnail for your video. (Chapter 9 also has more on custom 
­thumbnails.)
✓
✓Unlisted and private videos: Ever wanted to grant limited access to 
your videos to a chosen few? Now you can. (More on this neat feature 
in — you guessed it — Chapter 9.)
Setting Up a Custom Channel URL
By default, YouTube assigns your channel an ugly, random, and completely 
unmemorable URL. (URL, short for Uniform Resource Locator, is a fancy 
name for a web address.) You’d do well to replace this ugly URL with one 
that supports your branding and helps viewers remember your channel. 
Just note that, to update the URL, your channel must be in good standing. In 
some cases, YouTube may make you wait for 30 days to create a new channel 
name. (Not sure what “in good standing” means? Check out Chapter 9.)
Anyway, here’s how you get the customizing process started:
1.	Log in to YouTube and click your channel icon in the top right to 
bring up the Creator Studio and YouTube Settings pulldown menu.
2.	Click the Gear icon.
You’re taken straight to the Account Settings Overview screen.
3.	Click the Advanced link located right below your new channel name.
You progress to the advanced channel settings, which you can see 
in Figure 2-18. In the Channel Settings section, you see the randomly 
­generated URL.
4.	Under the Channel Settings heading, click the Create Custom  
URL link.
Doing so takes you to a page that prompts you to choose a new, custom 
channel URL, as shown in Figure 2-19.
5.	Choose a custom channel URL.
You get only one chance at this, so get it right. If you screw it up and choose 
a channel URL you hate, you need to delete your channel and start over.

Since you followed the advice earlier in this chapter and checked to make 
sure your URL was available before you chose your channel name (right? 
right?), you can just enter the name of your channel and you’ll be all set 
up with a nice, clean URL that matches your channel — something like 
http://www.youtube.com/user/mychannelname.
Joining the YouTube Partner Program
It’s possible to make money on YouTube. If you’re really successful, produc-
ing content for YouTube could be your full‐time, exciting job. But don’t run 
to the bank yet, because you’re going to need to create a great channel, fill it 
with wickedly good content, build a passionate community of fans — and join 
the YouTube Partner Program.
The YouTube Partner Program is a formalized way of helping content cre-
ators (which usually goes hand‐in‐hand with channel owners because they’re 
often one and the same) make money several ways:
✓
✓Advertising: You can allow Google and YouTube to place ads against 
your content and receive a share of the ad revenue. You learn all the 
details about this in Chapter 14.
✓
✓Subscriptions: You can offer paid subscriptions with viewers paying a 
monthly or yearly fee for access. This is not for everyone, and you’re 
going to need some unique content. Viewers on YouTube usually don’t 
like to pay.
✓
✓Sales: You can use your content to help sell your product and actu-
ally provide special links where viewer can go buy your stuff. This is 
done through a special clickable overlay?, called a Merch annotation. 
Though there are several types of annotations (see Chapter 10 for all the 
details), this one is available only to partners.
Though the monetary aspect of the YouTube Partner Program is the primary 
driver for most creators, YouTube also provides some support for content 
generation though places like YouTube Spaces, special studios built just 
for YouTube creators and advertisers around the world. Check it out at 
https://www.youtube.com/yt/space.
Our recommendation is to not rush into the partner program right away. 
Focus on your channel, content, and community, which you learn about in 
detail in this book. With all that in place, you can check out Chapter 14 to get 
the revenue engine humming.

A
 
 YouTube channel is where the creator can track activity, maintain 
account settings, and — most importantly for a creator like you — 
upload videos. The ability to find your way around your channel and under-
stand the different features that YouTube offers is essential to building your 
audience, and — drumroll, please — obtaining revenue.
Navigating Your Channel
A YouTube channel has two primary purposes. For most users, YouTube is 
for watching videos. When you log in to your YouTube account, you’re met 
with a page offering a lot of videos for you to watch. You’ll also see a large 
ad — no surprise there — as well as suggestions from YouTube for what you 
should watch. There are sections for some of the channels you subscribe to, 
and some guesses at stuff you might like. A lot of the logged‐in experience is 
covered in Chapter 2, but it’s time to dig a little deeper and look at what you 
can do with your channel.
YouTube’s initial page view defaults to the familiar What to Watch tab, but 
along the left side you’ll find the keys to the castle, so to speak — links that 
lead to all the important channel controls.
Chapter 3

56
Part I: Getting Started With YouTube Channels 
The My Channel link
The value of making your channel look really good can’t be overestimated. 
Though your videos are ultimately the most important tool you have for 
attracting viewers and subscribers, the look of your channel is a big deal, too. 
YouTube wants viewers to spend more time watching content. What better 
way to do this than by giving content creators like you the tools to make an 
awesome YouTube channel experience.
When you’re logged in on YouTube, clicking the My Channel link in the top 
left‐hand corner brings you straight to your channel in Edit mode, as shown 
in Figure 3-1. Note the following elements:
✓
✓The header bar: This element runs across the top of your My Channel 
page, and gives you access to some pretty important information.
• Subscribers: Since your channel may be new, you probably 
have zero subscribers — the link on the header that reads 
0 subscribers is at the top to point that out. Hopefully, that 
number won’t be 0 for long.
When you click the Subscribers link, you see a list of your sub-
scribers, where you can see who is subscribed to your channel and 
review the information that they share publicly.
• Video Manager: Clicking the Video Manager link leads you — no 
surprise here — straight to the Video Manager, which is the most 
useful place to manage the settings for your individual video 
uploads. You can read more about the Video Manager in Chapter 9.
✓
✓Channel art: The large, gray box with all the gray triangles as back-
ground is the default channel art for your channel. It has a picture of 
a computer, a TV, and a phone, and a large Add Channel Art button. 
Adding channel art is something you’ll want to do as soon as you can. 
(Before you do though, check out the later section “Customizing and 
Branding Your Channel.”) You can also add links to websites, links to 
social networks, and an email contact button to this area, all of which 
you can do later in this chapter.
✓
✓Channel icon: Overlaying your channel art on the left side is the channel 
icon. The default channel icon is a light blue square with a nondescript 
dark blue icon in the middle. This element is an important one because 
it acts as your channel’s identifying mark on YouTube and Google+; it 
appears next to your channel’s name all over both sites; it shows up in 
subscription lists; and it appears next to every comment you make. If 
your channel art is the face of your My Channel page, this icon is your 
face everywhere else on YouTube. Channel icons are typically a brand 
logo or a picture of the channel’s content creator.

57

 Chapter 3: Building Your Channel from the Ground Up 
When you roll the mouse pointer over the different areas of the My 
Channel page, a small, gray box with a pencil icon in it appears. This is 
the Edit button. When you get around to customizing your channel later 
in this chapter, the Edit button is what you’ll use to access the controls 
for each of these elements.
Figure 3-1 shows the basics of the My Channel page, but you can add more. 
Here’s a list of the kinds of things that you can display there:
✓
✓Channel trailer: You can add a channel trailer for unsubscribed ­viewers. 
(Think “trailer” as in “movie trailer,” not “trailer” as in “trailer park.”) 
This is a perfect opportunity to show your audience what your channel 
is all about, what content you cover, what days you publish and any-
thing else you think might help viewers subscribe to your channel and 
watch tons of your content.
✓
✓Sections: These are groups of videos that help viewers explore your 
content. Create sections to make it easy for your viewers to browse and 
find content that interests them. Think of them like bookshelves that 
Figure 3-1: 
The My 
Channel 
page.

58
Part I: Getting Started With YouTube Channels 
gather content of similar types. Sections can contain a playlist, your 
most recent videos, your most popular videos or other collections of 
content that you want your viewers to see. The default section on a  
new channel is Uploads — that’s just the list of your most recently 
­published videos.
✓
✓Channel Tips: YouTube wants you to succeed; they even give you best 
practice tips based on your current channel status. Find these at the top 
of the right‐hand section when logged in.
✓
✓Related Channels: This area will be blank until you add in channels 
that are related to your channel. This is optional, but also a very good 
opportunity to highlight any partnerships you may have formed with 
other YouTube creators. You can highlight your partners and your part-
ners can highlight your channel to help share audience between related 
­channels.
✓
✓Popular Channels on YouTube: YouTube recommends channels that 
are related to your channel for your viewers on your My Channel page. 
If you don’t want YouTube showing other channels, you can disable 
this feature. Simply hover over this section and a Disable button will 
appear.
✓
✓View as Public: Whenever you’ve made some changes to your channel, 
you’ll want to see how your channel is going to look to your viewers. In 
the top right‐hand corner, note the small planet Earth labeled View as 
Public. Click this link to view your channel like a normal YouTube user 
would see it. To go back to Edit mode, click the Done button in the blue 
bar on top.
Create sections with multiple playlists in addition to just shelves with 
individual videos. This will help your Playlist tab appear more orga-
nized, making it easier for viewers to find more content quickly. Be sure 
to have a strong thumbnail image for every video in a section and every 
playlist.
The Channel tabs
Just like a web browser, YouTube channels also have tabs. Tabs are helpful 
for viewers looking to navigate your channel quickly and efficiently. Each tab 
has a different functionality intended to help the viewing experience.
✓
✓Home: A viewer sees this tab by default when they click on your channel 
from a YouTube search or if they manually type in your channel address 
in their web browser. Your Channel Trailer and Sections all appear here 
on the Home tab.

59

 Chapter 3: Building Your Channel from the Ground Up 
✓
✓Videos: The Videos tab contains exactly what you’d expect — all public 
videos on the channel. The default view is Newest Videos First — the 
videos that were added to the channel most recently. The viewer can 
always sort by Oldest Videos First or Most Popular as well.
✓
✓Playlists: The Playlist tab is where all your channel’s public playlists can 
be found. As a creator, you can fill up playlists with your own content. 
You can also curate content from other YouTube channels for your 
­playlists.
Playlists also come up in YouTube search results, so be sure to always 
use descriptive thumbnails for your videos, as well as compelling playl-
ist descriptions. Playlists are a great way to extend your viewers’ ­session 
time on your channel. (Session time directly supports your channel 
ranking and discoverability on YouTube search.)
✓
✓Channels: If you have partnerships, this tab is the place to add all 
of those channels that you associate with. If you are a brand that 
owns many channels, you’ll want to make sure all of your channels 
are listed here for easy discoverability and reference for the viewers. 
This is a quick way to get interested viewers to consume more related 
content.
✓
✓Discussion: Viewers are sure to comment on your channel and videos 
if you are creating engaging content. You can follow along with all the 
channel comments here on this tab. When logged in, you can remove 
inappropriate comments or report spam comments directly.
✓
✓About: This tab acts as your opportunity to tell your viewers all about 
yourself and/or your business. You can include an email address for 
viewers to contact you outside of YouTube. You can also include any 
relevant social network sites that you might be active on. Your viewers 
can come here to see some quick stats on your channel, such as your 
total view count, number of subscribers, and the date you created your 
YouTube channel.
The My Subscriptions link
The My Subscriptions link on the left of the My Channel page (refer to 
Figure 3-1) takes you to a new page displaying a list of channels you’re sub-
scribed to. If your channel is new, this is listing is probably empty. As you 
subscribe to channels that you like (which you will, even as a creator), this 
page becomes a bit more populated — and a bit more complex. After you’ve 
subscribed to some channels, you can look at the information in a couple of 
different views. You’ll use the various links at the top of the My Subscriptions 
area (see Figure 3-2) to switch between views.

60
Part I: Getting Started With YouTube Channels 
Here are some brief descriptions of what each link does for you:
✓
✓Uploads Only: This link organizes the channels you are subscribed 
to in a list of videos. You’ll see a list of uploaded videos, showing the 
most recent first. All your subscriptions are in one long list, so if you 
have a lot of subscriptions, this can be an overwhelming way to look at 
things.
✓
✓All Activity: This view of your subscription feed can be even more 
­overwhelming. As its name implies, it shows all of the activity on the 
channels you follow — their uploads, their comments, their announce-
ments, and changes to their playlists all show up here if you’ve chosen 
to see all that activity. (Note that you can control what you see from 
each channel you subscribe to using the Manage Subscriptions page — 
see the next bullet item.)
✓
✓Manage Subscriptions: This link leads to a page where you can do some 
detailed management of the channels you subscribe to and control what 
sort of content you see from that channel. This is also its own section 
in the main menu on the left, so we cover it in more detail later in this 
chapter.

The History link
Clicking the History link takes you to a new page listing every video you’ve 
ever watched. This page can be deeply embarrassing to visit, because it can 
reveal to you just how many makeup tutorials and Let’s Play videos you’ve 
watched in the last week. But whereas this section can lead to feelings of 
shame and regret for time wasted, it can also be an interesting insight into 
your viewing habits. Luckily, it is only for you. As the section helpfully points 
out at its top, "Only you can see your history.” (Figure 3-3 shows a Watch 
History Listing example).
Your watch history is what YouTube’s algorithms pay attention to when 
­populating the suggested videos on the front page of your account.
Figure 3-3: 
The Watch 
History 
­listing.

62
Part I: Getting Started With YouTube Channels 
Unlike with real‐world history — the stuff recorded in encyclopedias and 
­history books — you do have some control over this list. A few controls here 
let you “rewrite history,” as described in this list:
✓
✓Clear All Watch History: This is the nuclear option. If you’re ready to 
undo everything you’ve ever watched and start over with a clean slate, 
this button does just what it says and deletes all the information from 
your watch history.
✓
✓Pause Watch History: This button puts your memory on hold, and 
allows you to watch videos without them being added either to your 
history or your video recommendations from YouTube. If you know that 
you’re about to binge‐watch a bunch of children’s videos and you don’t 
want to be recommended videos like these, this is the option to select. 
Of course, this strategy works only if you pause before you watch the 
videos. Otherwise, you’ll be in there clearing your watch history before 
you know it.
✓
✓Search History: This allows you to review all the YouTube searches 
you have conducted. This is helpful when you forget to save a video and 
you want to reconstruct the search history. These are clickable links 
that allow you to be taken right back to the YouTube search results for 
that query.
The Watch Later link
The Watch Later link opens to a new page that allows you to collect videos 
in a private playlist to watch later. Your channel subscribers won’t be able 
to see this playlist unless you make it public. After you have watched the 
content, you can quickly remove it from the list. If you use a streaming device 
attached to your TV, this can be your TV line‐up for the evening. You can 
easily add videos to Watch Later link as described in the following list.
✓
✓Add Videos: Click this button to add the selected videos to the Watch 
Later playlist. You can add videos by YouTube Search, URL or by using 
Your YouTube Videos. Playlists are useful for organizing the videos 
you like or want to watch later. For example, you can collect all the One 
Direction videos you’ve watched into one pop powerhouse playlist.
✓
✓Remove Watched: This is where you can clean up the playlist quickly. If 
looking through your Watch Later playlist is becoming tedious because 
of the number of videos listed, you can weed things out by simply  
clicking the Remove Watched button.
✓
✓Play All: This allows you to play all the videos in the Watch Later playlist.

The Purchases link
The Purchases link allows you to view all of the purchases you have made 
through Google Play or YouTube. You can watch any movies you have 
­purchased yet again at any time from this link.
The Playlist Section link
The Playlist section on the left side of your My Channel page is where you 
can see all the recent playlists you have either created on your channel 
or have recently watched. This section is more for your consumption of 
YouTube content; this is not one of the creator tools for Playlists. You can 
click on any one of your playlists from here to easily access the creator tools 
to modify the playlist.
The Subscriptions Sections link
This section on the left side of the My Channel page lists several of the chan-
nels you subscribe to; the number of new videos you have yet to view from 
this channel will be listed just after the channel icon and name. You have 
the option to sort these by relevance (the default setting — this highlights 
those channels from your subscriptions section you view frequently), by new 
activity, or in alphabetical order. This section is intended for you to utilize 
as a viewer of your own content collections, not a creator looking to manage 
your subscribers. You can learn more about your channel subscribers in 
Chapter 10.
The Browse Channels link
This option on the left side of your My Channel page takes you to a new page 
where YouTube suggests channels from the top 1 percent most popular 
channels on YouTube that week. Some of the recommendations are based on 
your recent viewing history.
The Manage Subscriptions link
This link has a clear and descriptive title — use it to go to a new page where 
you can manage the various YouTube channels you as a viewer have sub-
scribed to. (Figure 3-4 shows an example of a Manage Subscriptions page.)

64
Part I: Getting Started With YouTube Channels 
To do all this managing, you’ll make (frequent) use of this page’s extensive 
set of links, as described in this list:
✓
✓Collections: You can organize your subscriptions into custom groups 
called collections. For example, if a creator you follow has more than one 
channel, you can organize those channels into a collection that allows 
you to keep up with everything that person is doing across a number of 
channels. The possibilities are nearly endless, allowing you to organize 
by genre or almost any criteria you can imagine.
• The check box: This button at the top of the subscription list allows 
you to select all or none of the videos in your list. This is handy 
when you want to take action on several of your channels at a time.
• Actions: Clicking the Actions button reveals a number of choices, 
each of which has a check box on the individual channel level of 
the list. This Actions button is mainly for performing actions on 
more than one channel at a time. You could, for example, check the 
Send Me Updates option, which will send you email notifications 
when a new video has been released; checking Unsubscribe lets 
you unsubscribe from multiple channels at the same time. These 
actions can be taken on the individual subscriptions as well.
Figure 3-4: 
The Manage 
Subscrip­
tions page.

65

 Chapter 3: Building Your Channel from the Ground Up 
✓
✓Individual Subscriptions: Each channel you subscribe to has a line in 
the subscription list. The most important options are in the check boxes 
on each subscription’s line:
• Send Me Updates: Do you want to receive an email every time one of 
the channels you subscribe to uploads a video? Most subscribers 
don’t, so you can leave this box unchecked. If you have a lot of  
subscriptions, this option can pretty quickly overwhelm your 
inbox, so use this option with caution. The upside is that you can 
set it for each channel, so if you have a few channels that you really 
care about, this feature can be useful.
• Show Only Uploads in Feed: When this check box is selected, you 
see only new video uploads from that creator in your subscription 
feed. By default you aren’t notified in your subscription feed when 
this creator comments on videos, favorites videos, or takes any 
number of actions.
Keeping an eye on more than video uploads might be a good idea in some 
cases, especially as you’re learning about building your audience. For exam-
ple, seeing how often a channel you admire is commenting on videos and 
interacting with other creators can give you some insight into how success-
ful creators behave on YouTube. You might learn something about how to 
interact with your own potential audience.
Customizing and Branding Your Channel
Clicking the My Channel link in the menu along the left side of the YouTube 
Channel screen takes you straight to the My Channel page, which is where 
you’re going to do the bulk of the customization of your channel. This is a 
pretty important series of decisions you’re about to make, so pay attention 
to what you’re doing. Lots of viewers make decisions about the quality of a 
channel based on a glance at the My Channel page. If there’s one stereotype 
that pretty much holds true for YouTube viewers, it’s that they’re highly 
­distractible. A professional‐looking front page that holds a viewer’s interest 
indicates to potential viewers that you’ve put a lot of thought, time, and effort 
into creating your channel. So get to it!
Creating channel art
The channel art section is in the large gray box at the top of the My Channel 
page when viewing on a computer. (It will look differently on other devices 
like mobile phones and TVs, but a computer is the only device you can use 
to change your channel art, so start there.) By default, it has a few items in it, 

66
Part I: Getting Started With YouTube Channels 
and you’re going to change pretty much all those items. Before getting into the 
steps of creating your channel art, though, you should keep some important 
guidelines in mind. YouTube is available on a lot of different devices. Your 
audience may be watching on a TV, a computer, or a mobile device. Given that 
fact, YouTube has gone to a lot of effort to create a system that allows your 
channel to look good across all kinds of delivery platforms. It has come up 
with some guidelines for artwork that you would be wise to follow. If you pay 
attention to the size of the graphics needed, you should have no trouble with 
your channel looking good, no matter how your audience is looking at it.
Channel art is most effective when it is representative of the channel’s con-
tent. For example, if your channel is about the hottest new shoes, your  
channel art should include images of shoes.
Before you get around to adding the channel art, you need to create your 
channel art. This process requires some kind of image creation software. 
We recommend software like Adobe Photoshop to create custom channel 
art, but it’s an expensive option. If you’re investing in the Adobe ecosystem 
for editing, Photoshop is probably a good option for you. If you’re more 
interested in free tools, something like GIMP, an open source photo editor 
­(available for download at www.gimp.org) might be more up your alley.
YouTube has created a template (see Figure 3-5) that makes the creation of 
channel art that works across platforms much simpler to create. The tem-
plate calls for a 2560 x 1440 pixel image that is no larger than 2MB, and pro-
vides you with guidance on how to place text and logos to allow the image to 
work pretty much everywhere.
Figure 3-5: 
The 
YouTube 
Channel Art 
template.

67

 Chapter 3: Building Your Channel from the Ground Up 
When creating art destined for use in the YouTube channel art template, it 
is important to adhere to the advice it provides. You need to be sure that 
your text lands in the sections of the template that will not be covered up by 
your channel icon or channel links after you upload this image. If you edge 
too close to the top‐left‐hand corner, you’ll have a hard time maintaining the 
continuity of the image across devices and operating systems. Your text and 
logos might be cut off or unreadable on some devices, and that will contribute 
to viewers dismissing your channel and moving on to something else. Channel 
art is an opportunity to make a first impression, and the cold truth is that 
bad channel art can drive away viewers. Be sure to check how your channel 
art looks on several different devices.
If you find all this talk of pixels and formats confusing, it might be a good 
idea to consult with someone who has some graphic design experience. Even 
tracking down a graphic design student to help you tailor an image to the 
YouTube specifications can be helpful. If you don’t feel comfortable doing 
the art yourself, and finding help isn’t possible, YouTube does provide some 
stock options, which aren’t great, but are a far better choice than the place-
holder pattern of gray diamonds. If you do ask someone for help with your 
channel art, it’s important to remember that creative professionals like to be 
paid for their work. Just because your friend is a graphic designer, or your 
nephew is an art student doesn’t mean they want to work for you for free. 
Even if you don’t pay them the market rate, paying them something is the 
decent thing to do.
Managing channel art
After you’ve created the art for your channel (or received art from the nice 
person you convinced to help you), it’s time to add that art to your channel. 
YouTube has made this a pretty straightforward process; here are the steps:
1.	Back in your My Channel page, click the Add Channel Art button.
You shouldn’t have any trouble spotting this button. It’s the blue button 
that says Add Channel Art in the center of the placeholder banner.
If you’ve already set your channel art and want to change it, the Add 
Channel Art button is no longer an option. In this case, roll the mouse 
pointer over the banner, and a small box with the familiar pencil icon 
appears. Click this icon to edit your channel art and open the Artwork 
dialog box.
2.	In the dialog box that appears (see Figure 3-6), choose from one of the 
following options to add new channel art:
• Upload Photos: This is the default option for adding photos to your 
channel. If you’ve created your own artwork as spelled out in the 

68
Part I: Getting Started With YouTube Channels 
previous section, more likely than not your artwork is somewhere 
on your computer. To upload that artwork, click the Select a Photo 
from Your Computer button, use the dialog box that appears to 
navigate to the file’s location, and then select it. Alternatively, you 
can just drag and drop the file onto this window, and it should 
start the upload.
• Your Photos: Selecting this option allows you to choose a photo 
from your Google+ photo album. Since you’ve probably just created 
this account, it’s unlikely that you’ll have photos in any Google+ 
albums — the Your Photos option probably won’t be the option 
you choose. You can safely ignore this.
• Gallery: If you haven’t created your own channel art, the gallery 
section shown in Figure 3-7 provides you with some stock images 
that YouTube furnishes for your free use. Though none of them is 
great‐looking, and they’re unlikely to be excellent branding choices 
for your channel, they’re miles better than leaving the default 
placeholder image as your channels banner.
Figure 3-6: 
The Upload 
Photos 
­dialog box.

69

 Chapter 3: Building Your Channel from the Ground Up 
As you complete each step in the process of branding your channel, it’s 
a good idea to click on the View As Public icon on the top right above 
your banner art. (The icon has the shape of a globe.) Clicking here lets 
you look at your channel as the public would see it, without all the 
controls you see as the owner of the channel. This is the best way to 
understand how the changes you’re making will affect the look of your 
channel.
3.	(Optional) Crop your photo.
After you select a photo, you’ll see a preview with a cropping mask laid 
over it. If you decide that you want to crop your photo, you can move 
this cropping mask around to select the portion of the photo you want 
to use. (Note the Device Preview button that lets you preview what the 
image will look like on different devices.)
4.	After the size and placement of the image are to your satisfaction, 
click Select, and your channel art is in place!

Part I: Getting Started With YouTube Channels 
Creating the channel icon
The channel icon is an important aspect of your overall channel art and 
branding strategy. Though your channel art is the most prominent face of 
your channel page, the channel icon will be the face of your channel every-
where else. It’s also the icon associated with your Google+ account, which 
means that this icon will appear pretty much anytime your channel is listed 
on YouTube, and it will appear next to all of the comments you make on the 
site. So, creating an icon that works is important.
Creating a good icon can be tricky. You want something that is simple and 
easily recognizable — one that allows viewers to quickly recognize your con-
tent as your content, in other words. As usual, if you can’t pull all that off, at 
least don’t use an icon that will drive away viewers. Don’t use an offensive 
or obscene image, and definitely avoid foul language. Not only will that stuff 
alienate potential subscribers, it will get you in trouble with the powers‐that‐
be at YouTube. Keeping things simple is probably the best bet, and even a 
simple-colored background with the first letter or initials of your channel 
goes a long way toward adding a degree of professionalism. If you can add a 
little bit of themed art to that simple layout, all the better.
When creating an icon that’s going to work with your channel, follow a 
couple of basic guidelines:
✓
✓Image size: Your icon will appear on the site at 98 x 98 pixels most of the 
time, but you should create your icon as an 800 x 800 pixel square and 
upload that size. Let the site scale the image down for you, because it 
results in the best possible image quality for your icon.
✓
✓File format: YouTube recommends that you upload your files as JPG, 
GIF (no animated GIFs are allowed), BMP, or PNG. All these formats 
should be available in your image editor, so choose the one that works 
best for you.
Uploading the channel icon
The default channel icon is the blue box overlaying the left side of your 
banner art. It’s marginally okay, but nothing to write home about, so you’ll 
definitely want to replace it. When you have your icon all designed and ready, 
follow these easy steps to add the icon to your channel:
1.	Roll the mouse pointer over the large icon placeholder at the top of 
your page to make the familiar Pencil icon appear.
Technically, the Pencil icon is referred to as the Edit Channel Icon button.

71

 Chapter 3: Building Your Channel from the Ground Up 
2.	Click the Edit Channel Icon button.
Doing so brings up a dialog box informing you that your channel icon 
is also the icon for your Google+ page and that you need to go to your 
Google+ account to make the change.
3.	Click the Edit on Google+ button.
This button brings you immediately to the Upload page on Google+.
4.	Select a photo using the Google+ dialog box that appears.
As with most things related to YouTube and Google, you have a number 
of options for selecting a photo. Those options (displayed as a set of links 
along the top of the dialog box, as shown in Figure 3-8) are described in 
this list:
• Upload: This option is the one you’re most likely to use. In the 
best‐case scenario, you’ve created an awesome custom icon that 
truly encapsulates and embodies the spirit of your channel. You 
can drag and drop a photo onto the dialog box or click the Select 
a Photo from Your Computer button and navigate to the location 
where the icon is stored on your computer.
• Albums: If you select this option, you see a list of your Google+ 
photo albums. If you don’t have any, which is likely, you won’t use 
this option.
• Photos of You: This area is also likely to be empty if your Google+ 
account is brand‐new since this section will only be populated with 
photos that you tagged on Google+ as showing yourself.
• Web Camera: This option allows you to take a picture using your 
computer’s built‐in web camera (assuming it has one) and using 
that image as the icon.
We don’t recommend using a casual selfie as your icon if you are just 
starting out. A nicely designed logo looks more professional than a selfie. 
An exception is if your channel is a personality‐based vlog.
5.	After making your selection, click the Set As Profile Photo button.
You’ll be prompted to post this change as a status update on Google+.
6.	Skip the Status Update step, close the Google+ page, and return to 
your YouTube page.
Your new icon should be in place. If the icon isn’t showing up yet, you 
may need to refresh the browser window. The icon update can take up to 
24 hours in some cases.

72
Part I: Getting Started With YouTube Channels 
Managing your links
The last part of the channel art setup involves placing link overlays — the 
custom links pointing to your website or social media pages on your channel 
art. By default, your channel art has a link to your Google+ page in the  
bottom-right corner of the banner. You can add links to many social net-
works, merchandise providers, and even iTunes. You can also add a link to 
an email address or even your personal website. Adding links is, like many of 
the tasks in this chapter, accomplished in a few simple steps:
1.	Roll the mouse pointer over the channel art banner and click the Edit 
button (the Pencil icon) when it appears.
Doing so takes you to a dialog box for adding and/or editing your links, as 
shown in Figure 3-9.
2.	Enter an email address in the Email for Business Inquiries field.
Okay, the vast majority of email you’ll receive in this context will be 
spam, but you never know. A legitimate offer may pop up. Stranger things 
have happened.

The Google+ 
dialog box

­channel.

73

 Chapter 3: Building Your Channel from the Ground Up 
3.	In the Custom Links section, click the Add button to begin adding 
your custom links to your website and social media pages.
The dialog box that appears lets you overlay a link on your artwork. 
YouTube allows users to associate one external website with their chan-
nel, which means that you can send your viewers to an external site 
where they can get more information about you and your channel or 
maybe even buy merchandise.
4.	Use the drop‐down menus in the Social Links section to add your 
social media links.
You can also overlay links to many other social media sites and some  
e‐commerce sites, including Twitter, Tumblr, and Facebook, and even 
sites like iTunes, Google Play, and Café Press, where you can sell stuff 
to your audience.
5.	Specify your statistics preferences in the Statistics section.
Selecting the Show Views check box does just that — it displays the 
number of views your channel has logged. Neither is the Show Date 
Joined option much of a mystery. Selecting this check box reveals to the 
world when you started your channel. (Personally, we’d leave the Show 
Figure 3-9: 
Adding 
links to your 
channel art.

74
Part I: Getting Started With YouTube Channels 
Date Joined check box deselected, just because we think you’d prefer 
to keep the date you joined under wraps. There’s no need to tip off the 
audience that you’re new at this.) Any of these “show” options make the 
selected information public and allow your audience (as well as your 
competitors) access to this data.
Managing Uploads
Arguably, the most important part of building your channel is adding video 
content. That is, after all, why YouTube was created. We’ll talk more about 
the nuts and bolts uploading a video in Chapter 9, but we wanted to close out 
this chapter by at least giving you the big picture.
Before you upload anything to YouTube, it’s a good idea to familiarize your-
self with the kinds of things that you can’t upload to the site. There are 
several types of content that YouTube doesn’t allow, and uploading content 
that violates these guidelines can get you in trouble. You can even lose your 
account. YouTube reserves the right to remove any video at any time, but 
these types of videos are explicitly banned and will get you in trouble with 
the YouTube authorities:
✓
✓Pornography: YouTube doesn’t tolerate pornography or any sort of 
sexually explicit content. YouTube also points out that the company will 
report any videos of child exploitation to law enforcement if they are 
uploaded to the site.
✓
✓Illegal behavior: YouTube removes videos that show drug abuse, 
­underage drinking or smoking, animal abuse, bomb making, and a host 
of other illegal behaviors that people might want to document and 
share.
✓
✓Gratuitous violence: Videos that show people being attacked, hurt, or 
humiliated are also banned from the site.
✓
✓Hate speech: Videos that demean a group based on race, ethnic origin, 
disability, gender, age, or sexual orientation will be removed if flagged 
by the community.
✓
✓Threats or harassment: YouTube is also not a place for stalking, harass-
ing, or predatory behavior. Content of this type will be removed.
✓
✓Spam: Videos with misleading titles, descriptions, thumbnails, or other 
metadata will be removed. Misleading means that the title does not 
match the content of the video. A good example for a misleading title 
might be “Katy Perry at my house,” when the video is actually about a 
cat riding a skateboard. It is also unacceptable to post spam comments 

75

 Chapter 3: Building Your Channel from the Ground Up 
on videos — for example asking people to subscribe to your channel or 
to visit your website if it has nothing to do with the video you’re com-
menting on. This will typically lead to the comment being flagged as 
spam, and this will make it invisible to other users.
✓
✓Copyrighted material: You should only upload content that you own or 
have the appropriate licensing rights to use. Though the other commu-
nity guidelines are important to the smooth functioning of the YouTube 
community, the copyright restriction is hugely important to YouTube as 
a business. (See Chapter 16 for more information on copyright.)

ot that long ago, video was a far cruder, much simpler medium. At 
home, people had more fingers than television channels, and for those 
making their own movies, consumer‐level video came in two varieties: bad 
and worse. Maybe that’s a bit unfair, but the quality lagged far behind com-
mercial productions.
Clunky cameras that captured low‐resolution video were no match for the 
broadcast‐quality content found on television. And the quality of television 
was inferior to the look of a feature film. Not sure about that last one? Just 
watch a music video from the early days of MTV, circa 1982.
Since that time, technology has evolved to the point where you can now 
watch hundreds of channels and where most anyone who wants to has the 
ability to make a broadcast‐quality movie that can be seen by potentially a 
global audience. Consumer‐level camcorders not only come close to broad-
cast quality but can also even rival it. That means your YouTube video can 
look truly professional. Of course, can is the operative word here.
Clearly, technological advancements have allowed online video to change 
the rules of consumer‐level moviemaking. Yet, because of the relative ado-
lescence of online video, there’s some confusion about what makes a good 
video. Understandably, that criterion depends on the particular genre of 
video. For example, a music video has a different set of standards than an 
Chapter 4

80
Part II: Making Good Videos and Not Making Bad Videos 
instructional video on techniques for giving your date a goodnight kiss. And 
that differs significantly from the standards you’d apply to a video showing 
your cat chasing a red dot. Though diverse in content, there are still some 
fundamentals that every video should adhere to.
But what fundamentals are we talking about here? What makes a good video, 
in other words? Given the nature of human taste, coming up with clear crite-
ria for defining a good video may be a fool’s errand, so it might be better to 
concentrate on avoiding those factors that make a video nearly unwatchable. 
As a video producer, that makes your job relatively easy. Just eliminate the 
negatives — such as shaky camera work, distorted audio, or bad exposure — 
while providing entertaining content.
It sounds easy, but you’re right to suspect that it may be a little more com-
plex than that, due in part to some false conceptions that folks still hold 
about online video. Some people still believe that an online video, or one des-
tined for YouTube in this case, doesn’t require the same quality as any other 
production destined for broadcast. That’s simply no longer true. The way 
things have shaken out, more and more viewers are watching content online 
rather than on broadcast TV, and they are demanding better and better qual-
ity. This demand means that, with more people watching video on sharing 
sites like YouTube, the bar continues to rise when it comes to production 
value and content.
We talk a bit more about fundamentals later in this chapter, but right now we 
want to take a look at the most fundamental fundamental out there — your 
choice for capturing video.
Picking the Right Camera  
for Your Needs
Once upon a time, a video camera was that bulky device you bought to cap-
ture moving images on video tape. Over the years, the cameras got smaller 
and tape formats evolved from analog to DV and from HD to 4K, with corre-
sponding increases in the ease‐of‐use and quality categories. Not only that, 
but the prices dropped precipitously, which means that you can now buy a 
decent camera at an affordable price.
The only difference now is that there’s a wider — some might even say 
“bewilderingly wide” — selection of cameras. The following list describes the 
major categories:

81

 Chapter 4: What Makes a Good Video a Good Video? 
✓
✓Dedicated camcorder: Once it was the only way to capture video, but 
now the trusty dedicated camcorder has been relegated to simply being 
one option among many. Benefits include a time‐honored design for 
comfortable shooting, dedicated features and controls specific to mov-
iemaking, and a wide zoom range on a single built‐in lens, as shown on 
the Panasonic HD camcorder in Figure 4-1. It’s also designed to accept a 
variety of accessories — an on‐camera light, say, or an external micro-
phone or a handheld rig. On the downside, camcorders lack the ability 
to capture a wide‐angle view. Most can cover a long telephoto range but 
can barely fit all the subjects in a room into the frame. Another dilemma 
is its monomaniacal devotion to a single task — making movies. That 
means some users may pass on a camcorder simply because they can’t 
use it to send a text or make a call.
✓
✓Digital SLR: The digital single‐lens reflex camera (or digital SLR, for 
short) rightly dominates the still‐photography market, but it turns out 
that many models provide the ability to capture pretty good HD video. 
That’s a great thing because the image sensor (when compared to con-
ventional camcorders) is significantly larger, and therefore captures 
better quality. The camera can take advantage of all lenses that fit its 
mount, so you can capture movies using a wide range of lenses, from 
extreme telephoto to ultrawide‐angle. In addition, you can make a movie 
out of still frames and add an audio track and maybe some music. Many 
accessories are available, from mounting rigs to external microphones 
to LED lighting. On the downside, the camera controls and the way the 
camera fits in the hand favor still photography over moviemaking, and 
the accessories can be expensive.

✓
✓GoPro: This mini marvel is rugged, waterproof, and relatively inexpen-
sive, and it’s mountable on just about anything to capture amazing qual-
ity, from a unique perspective on a skydiving helmet to the rider’s view 
on a BMX bike, as shown in Figure 4-2. Some models can even capture 
4K video, the new standard for ultra‐high‐definition television. On the 
downside, the GoPro is limited to capturing an ultrawide‐angle view.
✓
✓Smartphone: Just a few short years ago, considering a cellphone as a 
means of capturing a serious video would earn you an eye roll because 
the results were often dismal. Not anymore, because serious works have 
been captured on a phone, including the Oscar‐winning documentary 
Waiting for Sugarman. On the downside, you have little control in  
adjusting the audio or video quality. You also have limited choices for 
accessories.
✓
✓Webcam: A webcam is inexpensive to purchase, on the off chance that 
you don’t already have one built into your computer. That makes it per-
fect for situations where you sit down in front of the computer. Just plop 
yourself down, check the lighting, and start talking. Since most can now 
capture in HD, you’re good to go. The downside is that you need to stay 
put or else you might position yourself out of the frame. The audio can 
sound “thin” if you’re not using an external microphone. And worse than 
that, if the lighting is too harsh, you can look really bad.
Purchasing a top‐quality model and instantly expecting to make great movies 
isn’t much different from thinking you can purchase a Gibson Les Paul and 
become a great guitarist without knowing how to strum a single chord.

 Chapter 4: What Makes a Good Video a Good Video? 
Both guitar playing and videography depend on understanding technique. 
Gone are the days of haphazardly handholding the camera while randomly 
shooting a movie on the fly. It will not only lack cohesion but can also make 
the audience feel like they’re having a seizure. As much as we like talking, 
thinking, and writing about cool cameras, we want to stress the fact that 
technique is crucial. That’s why we focus much more on technique in this 
chapter than on fancy hardware.
Knowing What Makes a Good Video
An immediate side effect of watching bad video is that you no longer want 
to watch it. But that still begs the question of what makes a YouTube video 
truly good. Sometimes, that answer is a little harder to figure out. The more 
obvious indicators of a good YouTube video are that it’s informative, depicts 
compelling situations, and, of course, makes people laugh. All these factors 
certainly contribute to the success of a YouTube video, but you have more 
pertinent issues to consider that deal with the technical aspects of making 
these videos enjoyable.
Keeping the camera steady provides a good start, as does making sure the 
lighting effectively represents the scene and that the audio is clear and pris-
tine for the viewer to understand. It’s also important to have a mix of shot 
types to keep things visually interesting — in an interview, for example, cut 
between the subject and a scene of what the subject is discussing. Though 
these attributes are somewhat “below the radar” when people are enjoying 
the video, they lie nonetheless at the core of an enjoyable experience.
Here are a few of the components that make a good video:
✓
✓Good lighting: “Let there be light” remains one of the oldest phrases 
ever. And for good reason. Without light of any kind, people clearly 
wouldn’t be able to see anything — though good video depends on more 
than just seeing the subject. Good lighting — as opposed to merely 
adequate lighting — needs to bathe the subject in a flattering way, as 
shown in Figure 4-3. It doesn’t matter if you’re using a sophisticated light 
kit or ambient illumination or depending on the sun, as long as the final 
product looks good.
✓
✓Top-quality audio: The better a video sounds, the better it looks. Less‐
than‐stellar visual elements can easily be accepted when the sound is 
clear. But the opposite statement rarely applies.

84

✓
✓Steady camera: Using a tripod (shown in Figure 4-4) or another means of 
stabilization clearly makes it easier to maintain a steady shot, but if you’re 
stuck without a tripod, at least try to keep your handheld camera as steady 
as possible so that you can avoid that annoying herky‐jerky motion.
✓
✓Shot structure: If you’re editing video, you should strive for a nice selec-
tion of shot types and angles in order to keep your viewers engaged. 
Think about it: Nobody wants to see the same exact shot and angle  
for 10 minutes.

Mastering the Genres in  
Your YouTube Videos
YouTube videos cover a wide range of subject matter that appeals to a wide 
range of viewers. Though each requires its own, special finesse to make it 
effective, all share the same need for quality.
The following few sections take a look at the different types of video and the 
special needs for each type.
Mastering music videos
Music as a subject pervades the YouTube landscape in many forms. These 
include everything from the official video for the song from a recording artist 
to live concert performances to high school musicals and musicians seeking 
viral exposure. When it comes to musicians creating that “breakout” video, 
consider the South Korean pop star Psy. He became an international sensa-
tion with his “Gangnam Style” video. To date, that song has been viewed 
more than 2 billion times and counting. Of course, music videos, official or 
otherwise, represent a large share of YouTube’s content, so you’ll have to be 
creative to stand out.
With any type of music comes copyright concerns, either about the song or 
the band performing it. See Chapter 16 for more details on copyright.
So when it comes to making your music‐based video, here are a couple of 
suggestions to consider:
✓
✓Get the audio right. If the music doesn’t sound good, the picture won’t 
look good. That statement applies to just about any video, but when the 
subject is music, it takes on an even greater purpose.
✓
✓Keep it visually interesting. Conventional wisdom suggests that some 
situations require compelling visuals, like in an MTV‐style music video, 
whereas in other situations, the performances are more straightforward 
and may work well with merely a limited number of camera angles. Just 
be sure that the visuals work with the music — just because you’ve got 
a great tune doesn’t mean that you should skimp on the camera work. 
Remember that it’s an audiovisual experience, so take advantage of it,  
as shown in Figure 4-5.

86
Part II: Making Good Videos and Not Making Bad Videos 
If you’re making a music video, here are a few tips to follow:
✓
✓Listen to the song. And do it over and over. That’s the only way you can 
get a true feel for the most effective way to visually depict it.
✓
✓Create a concept. After listening to the song, you should have a better 
sense of writing an effective script. Just don’t let your vision exceed 
your capabilities. You can run out of time, exhaust your budget, or 
maybe embark on something you’re not ready to accomplish.
✓
✓Find your locations. You have to shoot your video someplace, so why 
not find the best place possible? Uncovering the best spots to shoot 
the video, obtaining the necessary permissions, and observing the 
light and flow are all tasks you’ll want to do well in advance. For the 
music video shown in Figure 4-6, the area was scouted for proper  
lighting and setting.
✓
✓Communicate with the artist. A music video is a collaboration between 
the artist and you. That’s why it’s a good idea to make sure everyone is 
on the same page regarding concept and ideas. If a disagreement crops 
up during production, you could find yourself majorly frustrated.
Producing your very own vlog
Ever hear of a portmanteau word? It’s when two different words are combined 
to form a new one that best describes the situation. Think about Brangelina, 
the couple known separately as Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie, or staycation, the 
stay‐at‐home vacation, though it’s generally more home than vacation. In the 
video world, the portmanteau word of choice is vlog, the strange blend of  
consonants that brings together the words video and blog.

 Chapter 4: What Makes a Good Video a Good Video? 
Before the turn of the millennium, one might take the odd word vlog to mean 
something completely different. But these days everyone knows about the vlog. 
The vlog has in fact become a staple on YouTube. Some vlogs are quite funny, 
and others truly informative, yet way too many are simply not worth watching.
That’s because vlogs are either poorly produced, or they lack focus in their 
subject matter, or they suffer from a combination of both. Like most other 
staples, the bar has been raised on what’s now acceptable.
Here are some suggestions to maximize your potential when it comes to 
your vlog:
✓
✓Use a good‐quality camera. Though a DSLR produces the best quality, a 
webcam — as long as it can capture HD — works pretty well, as shown 
in Figure 4-7. Plus, it’s simple to use and requires little, if any, setup.
✓
✓Use a separate microphone. It may not always be easy to work with a 
microphone, but trust us — it’s often worth the aggravation. Why have 
your voice sound tinny and distorted when all it takes is plugging in an 
external microphone? Even a cheap one will make your voice sound 
better than the microphone on the webcam or your computer. You can 
even use a lavalier, as shown in Figure 4-8.
✓
✓Be consistent. If you’re looking for an audience, think of yourself as a 
brand. That means the format and setting should remain consistent with 
each video. Here’s an opportunity to show some originality with props, 
background, and set.
✓
✓Improve the lighting. If you think the overhead lamp and illumination 
from your monitor will suffice, think again. We strongly recommend 
adding some light outside of the video frame. If you don’t want to use 
photo lighting, a plain household lamp (with shade) that’s capable of 
providing bright, soft illumination is your best bet.

✓
✓Don’t ramble. The difference between a great blog and a terrible blog 
depends on several factors — the host’s sense of presence, the subject 
matter, and the length, for example — but it’s the host not getting to the 
point that often acts as the deciding factor for the viewer to move on to 
another video. Don’t be that person. Instead, plan in advance what you

want to say, and when the time comes to record it, be sure to manage 
your delivery effectively. Also, be sure to capture several takes so that 
you end up sounding as fluid as possible.
✓
✓Don’t count on needing only a single take. It’s not a sport, nor is it 
something you need to do live, so always take your time and reshoot 
parts that are not perfect — not just for getting your vocal delivery right, 
but also to make the video visually more interesting. You can do that by 
shooting each take from a different angle or by framing your  
subject a bit differently.
Making an educational video
YouTube has become a great place for people of all ages, education levels, 
and interests to learn. And why not? It’s a central location where viewers can 
find out about just about any topic; besides, though it’s one thing to read 
about a subject, watching it on video provides a whole new perspective. 
You’ll find history lessons, teaching aids, and coverage of current events all 
on YouTube.
Here are some tips for producing an educational video:
✓
✓Know your audience. Before Goldilocks tells you that one video was  
too hard to understand and that another had information she already 
knew, it’s up to you to make it just right. That starts with knowing your 
audience — knowing what they’re capable of and also knowing what 
your audience most needs to know.
✓
✓Keep it simple. There’s no reason to show or tell any more information 
than necessary. In other words, stay on topic. Have a singular focus and 
be sure to use lots of strong visuals.
✓
✓Be concise in your introduction. Potential viewers must have some idea 
of what they can learn. That’s why it’s important to have a clear descrip-
tion of the video. If you can’t explain it in two lines, you should consider 
reworking your idea.
✓
✓Write a good script. At its core, the educational video is still a movie. 
And like a great movie, its success begins with having a good script that 
both entertains and gets to the point. Make sure to write the narration 
as succinctly as possible and make the visuals consistent with your time 
constraints and budget.

Making tutorial and how‐to videos
Search on YouTube and you’ll find endless videos that explain how to do 
everything from kissing a girl after the prom and drawing a freehand circle 
to replacing an iPhone screen and making an epic movie trailer. YouTube 
even has videos on how to make a how‐to video. Some of these how‐to videos 
provide lessons that are quite informative; some are also quite entertaining, 
whereas others simply serve as examples of how not to make one.
If your goal is to make a good vide rather than the typical not‐so‐good one 
that’s too often found on YouTube, you’ll need to heed the following advice:
✓
✓Know the subject. It sounds obvious, but some of those less effective 
how‐to videos suffer from a lack of understanding of the topic from the 
production side. Stick to what you know best and take it from there.
✓
✓Prepare a script. A good script acts like a roadmap for making the 
movie, no matter what the subject matter. So, tutorials are no exception. 
Though everyone has their own method of tackling a topic, one idea is 
to create a skeleton of the entire process by writing down every step. 
After that, you can rewrite it as a script, taking into account video  
content and (of course) witty puns.
✓
✓Use title cards. Title cards are not only cool in an “old school” kind of 
way, they can also help viewers understand the topic. Using words in 
your video helps the lesson sink in. You can use title cards to introduce 
each step, and to provide a summary.
✓
✓Shoot cutaways. A cutaway is one of the most effective components in 
a movie. It’s basically a break in the current video by the insertion of 
another shot, one that’s often related to the action at hand. Close‐up 
and detail shots provide a clearer picture (pun intended) of the use of 
cutaways, but don’t do them while shooting the actual video lesson. 
Instead, shoot them afterward, or before if that’s the way you roll.  
Why? So that you have clean shots to edit later. It’s often jarring  
for the camera to zoom in during the lesson.
✓
✓Shoot multiple takes. Editing is your friend, so shoot several versions 
of the same scene to try out different approaches or simply to get it just 
right. These alternative shots give you enough content to work with 
while editing.
✓
✓Make sure the narration is clean. Clean means clear and concise speak-
ing, simple phrases, and no jargon. And one more thing: Read the text 
many times to get as comfortable with it as possible.

Let’s play (and make) gaming videos
Whether you’re explaining how to find a settlement on Durotar in World of 
Warcraft, battling the Archadian Empire in Final Fantasy, or simply providing 
some tips in Clash of Clans, chances are good that lots of people are look-
ing for these kinds of tips and more on YouTube. So if video games are your 
thing, and you want to share your exploits and advice with others or perhaps 
teach them something, why not make your own gaming video?
What’s a gaming video without a real example from the game? Boring. So you 
want to be able to capture the action using a screen capture program. The 
simplest way is to have your game loaded on a computer rather than on a 
gaming system.
Here are a few choices that are inexpensive and work pretty well:
✓
✓Snapz Pro X: Allows you to capture still images, audio, and video using 
a few keystrokes on your Macintosh computer. You can download it at 
www.ambrosiasw.com/utilities/snapzprox.
✓
✓Debut Video Capture: Works on both Mac and Windows comput-
ers and lets you record video (including streaming video) on your 
computer screen, as shown in Figure 4-9. You can download it at 
www.nchsoftware.com/capture.
Making animal videos
Take an informal survey and you’ll discover an insatiable fondness for videos 
that feature animals. People love to watch them over and over as well as share 
and share. That probably explains why the most viral content is content that 
Figure 4-9:

92
Part II: Making Good Videos and Not Making Bad Videos 
features our four‐legged friends. The recent Mutant Giant Spider Dog video 
has already attracted more than 125 million views. And spider dog is not 
alone. Numerous videos are dedicated to the feline accomplishments, too, like 
cats answering with meows, fraternizing with dogs, or just being cute.
But the animal video is not dominated entirely by dogs and cats. In fact, 
you’ll encounter every animal imaginable on YouTube. Horses, cows, mon-
keys, and even lions and tigers and bears are represented on YouTube.
So if you think your pet has what it takes to be a YouTube sensation, it’s time 
to break out the ol’ camcorder and make Fido a star.
Follow these tips for making animal videos on YouTube:
✓
✓Keep it short. Many of the most‐watched videos on YouTube are often 
less than a minute long. That, apparently, is all it takes for a major dose 
of cute. And shorter videos attract more clicks.
✓
✓Find a willing participant. Some dogs — and other animals, for that 
matter — are more inclined than others to ham it up for the camera, 
as shown in Figure 4-10. If you have one with the acting bug, consider 
taking out your camera because — who knows? You may have a  
potential star on your hands.
✓
✓Nail down the right location. That’s what they say it all comes down 
to — why else would they repeat it three times? We’re not sure whether 
that makes the saying triple‐ly true, but it does add value to the video 
when you find the right place. If it’s a house pet, that can mean a tidy 
space in a part of your place that has sufficient lighting and is free of 
clutter. For outdoor situations, choose an area free of clutter, and make 
sure the sun is at your back.
✓
✓Reward the participants. Dogs and cats work for treats, so when they 
do a good job, it’s important to compensate them.
Capturing sporting events
With the exception of professional sports leagues with a YouTube channel or 
a news organization granted rebroadcast consent by a professional league, 
most sports videos found on YouTube consist of extreme events and amateur 
sports. Because the latter often borders on boring for all but those connected 
to it (family members, participants, sadists), the former provides the best 
opportunity for the ambitious videographer.
These days, capturing extreme sporting events and activities has gotten 
easier, thanks to the GoPro. This durable little camera helps provide a fresh 
perspective by putting the viewer directly in the middle of the action, making 

93

GoPro videos some of the most compelling videos on YouTube. Besides, the 
GoPro is waterproof, captures amazing quality, and can mount to just about 
anything. (For a deeper dive into GoPro cameras, be sure to check out GoPro 
Cameras For Dummies, written by John Carucci and published by John Wiley 
& Sons, Inc.)
Here are some (extreme) ideas:
✓
✓Skateboarding: Since it’s a popular sport among young people, chances 
are good that there’s a good audience for your skateboarding video, 
as long as it’s compelling to watch. You can shoot with anything from 
a dedicated camcorder to your iPhone, or mount a GoPro to the board 
itself, as shown in Figure 4-11.
✓
✓Skydiving: Here’s another situation that was changed by the GoPro 
camera. Just mount the camera to your helmet and capture a perspec-
tive that has rarely been seen until now.
✓
✓Skiing: Wow, it seems like a lot of extreme sports begin with the letters 
sk, and although skiing is more common, it can be every bit as extreme, 
especially when a parachute’s involved and you’re skiing off a cliff. You 
can provide your audience with the skier’s perspective by mounting 
your GoPro in a variety of places, including your helmet, on a chest 
­harness, or directly on your ski pole.
✓
✓Water sports: Attaching a waterproof video camera to your surfboard  
or raft or on your person while waterskiing can result in some compel-
ling video content of places that a camera dared to tread — assuming,  
of course, that you don’t wipe out after the first three seconds.

✓
✓BMX: The possibilities are endless because you can mount cameras 
­anywhere from the bike itself to your helmet to strategically placing 
cameras on the course and from the crowd.
Film and animation
YouTube has liberated the stage or, more appropriately, the screen for film-
makers of all levels by allowing them to reach a global audience. Not that 
long ago, you would make a short film and then physically show it to your 
friends and colleagues in a dank screening room, a classroom, or (more than 
likely) your own basement.
On a good day, the screening may have seen scores of people. That would 
mean you would need dozens of showings, if not hundreds, to duplicate the 
reach of your YouTube channel moments after you upload a movie. Besides 
exposure to a large audience, you can also enter your film in various online 
film competitions.
Here are a few types of movies you can find on YouTube:
✓
✓Film shorts: One traditional gateway to directing a feature film comes 
from making a film short. But how a person actually ended up seeing one 
of these films remained one of the great mysteries in filmmaking. We all 
hear whenever they’re nominated for an Oscar, but never knew where 
you could see one. Nowadays you can view short films of all genres on 
YouTube, and maybe even see a future Oscar nominee.

 Chapter 4: What Makes a Good Video a Good Video? 
✓
✓Web series: These (mostly) scripted series are the YouTube version of a 
television show. And just like their broadcast cousins, they cover a wide 
range of topics, situations, and subject matter. Instead of the standard 30‐ 
or 60‐minute episode blocks, however, the web series is broken down into 
installments that range from five to ten minutes each. Popular web series 
include Between Two Ferns with Zack Galifianakis, the hipster comedy 
adventure, High Maintenance, and the award‐winning series The Guild.
✓
✓Animated movies: If you’re a fan of animé or you want a place to show 
it off, YouTube can help you reach your audience. Whether you’re 
going old school with cell animation, doing stop‐motion with objects, or 
venturing into computer-generated imagery, YouTube provides a great 
place to share your work with the world. You can even create an ani-
mated web series.
Entertainment
Most videos should entertain the viewer in some way, and that includes the 
ones that are about entertainment. Content that covers celebrities, movies, 
music, theater, and television should entertain the viewer beyond its subject 
matter. So although all video should be entertaining, videos on areas associ-
ated with the entertainment industry should be doubly entertaining.
Though entertainment covers a wide ranges of topics, here are some of the 
areas you’re likely to see:
✓
✓Celebrity interviews: These can cover a wide range of subjects, includ-
ing comments on specific projects, opinions on current events, and 
humor interest.
✓
✓Red carpet coverage: Stars attending their movie premieres, arriving 
at award ceremonies, or supporting their favorite charities are popular 
subject matter, as shown in Figure 4-12. Many make comments to the 
press, and some show off their fashion sense.
✓
✓Entertainment news: This one covers the news side of the industry, 
with coverage of areas like obituaries, divorces, babies, and impaired 
driving arrests.
News and information
YouTube offers far more content for viewers than perusing the latest music 
videos, marveling at people doing truly weird stuff, or looking at dogs 
dressed in costumes. Though these provide a pleasant escape, you can also 

96
Part II: Making Good Videos and Not Making Bad Videos 
use YouTube to stay informed when it comes to news and current events. It’s 
not live news, but that doesn’t really take the news out of it. Instead, it con-
sists of replays of newscasts, editorials on every imaginable topic, and news 
segments and packages that cover anything from business and national news 
to entertainment and health issues. That’s why almost every major news 
outlet has a YouTube channel where you can look at clips and watch video 
segments.
Here’s a brief list of news organizations represented on YouTube:
✓
✓Associated Press Television
✓
✓ABC News
✓
✓NBC News

Viral Videos versus Evergreen Content
One phenomenon created by the Internet is the spread of viral video. Just 
like a virus (except that it’s the good kind that won’t make you sick), a viral

 Chapter 4: What Makes a Good Video a Good Video? 
video spreads rapidly online and can garner a million views in a relatively 
short time.
On the opposite side of the spectrum lies the evergreen video: As its name 
implies, videos with this distinction usually remain fresh and vibrant for 
longer periods, providing a timeless quality to the content.
Your channel’s objective depends on being able to bring as many viewers 
as possible to your content. Sometimes that comes from a single, albeit 
extremely popular video, whereas at other times it’s more about having a 
healthy lineup of relevant content.
Creating a single viral video can bring a great deal of attention to your chan-
nel, and those visits can quickly monetize into big bucks, especially with a 
video that garners a couple of million views. On the other hand, evergreen 
videos (see below) lend themselves to less dynamic, though more steady 
buildup through a variety of content that keeps people coming back.
Don’t bet your YouTube strategy trying to create a viral video. When it comes 
to viral videos, there’s a random element to their success that cannot always 
be duplicated the next time around. Nevertheless, you can do some things to 
make success just a tad less random — we tell you more on that topic in the 
nearby sidebar “What makes a video go viral?”
Viral content
Viral videos usually consist of some trendy or contemporary aspect that 
allows it to build a huge audience quite quickly. For example, a new dance 
craze or music video sometimes makes for the most watched video, but it 
can also consist of a dramatic news event or wild stunt that people can’t stop 
talking about. Sometimes it fades away as quickly as it started, whereas at 
other times it sticks around.
Evergreen content
Like a tree of shrubbery that never turns brown, the evergreen video remains 
popular with its niche audience for a long time. That’s because it consists 
of content that people are going to search for often and over an extended 
period. If YouTube were a refrigerator, comparing the two, a viral video 
would have a shorter expiration date to more evergreen content. Though 
there’s less pressure to creating a successful evergreen video, it still requires 
a lot of work to gain a following. You have to let people know that it’s out 
there while keeping it relevant for them to venture out and find you.

The types of content that may have (potential) evergreen value include
✓
✓Instructional videos
✓
✓Educational videos
✓
✓Travel videos
✓
✓Overviews of holiday traditions
✓
✓Biographies of famous people
Most evergreen content — instructional videos or content associated with 
a historical event, for example — doesn’t usually go viral but can enjoy a 
longer run of popularity because the content will continue to attract a steady 
stream of viewers.
What makes a video go viral?
Viral videos usually have a humorous or quirky 
feel to them, and though most of the time they 
unintentionally gather a mass following, some 
corporations have managed to produce suc-
cessful viral videos quite intentionally. But 
there’s no guarantee that your video will find 
success, even if it’s a promotional video with 
big money behind it.
Like the countless grains of sand, millions of 
videos are uploaded to YouTube — but only a 
few become viral sensations. As with winning 
the lottery, the success of a viral video is more 
“hoped for” than “planned for.” Still, you can 
improve your chances by considering some 
attributes that other viral videos have displayed.
Consider these suggestions:
✓
✓Engage the viewer. You have to grab their 
attention before they know what hit them.
✓
✓Be relevant. Trends and pop culture refer-
ences have a wide appeal to audiences, so 
why not integrate them into your video?
✓
✓Add humor. Make ’em laugh and they’ll 
keep coming.
✓
✓Be brief. After grabbing viewers’ atten-
tion and holding their interest, don’t take a 
chance on losing by going on too long or 
having a lull in the action.
✓
✓Use popular subjects. The biggest YouTube 
video of 2014 showed a dog dressed as a 
giant spider. So consider animals as one 
popular subject.
After completing and uploading your video, 
here are some aspects that will help it along its 
viral path:
✓
✓Spread the news over social media. Tweet 
out your video link, post it on Facebook, and 
ask friends to share it.
✓
✓Send out emails. Send out an email blast 
with the YouTube link.
✓
✓Blog about it. If you have a blog, then blog 
about your video. Also reach out to other 
bloggers and ask them to do the same.
✓
✓Listen to feedback. It’s no secret that com-
ments found on YouTube can be hurtful, but 
some are actually helpful. Try to sift through 
them to find what people like about your 
video.

ouTube is a truly massive online community with over 6 million hours 
of video watched each month, where millions of new subscribers are 
added each day, and where a significant proportion of subscribers (both new 
and old) not only engage with YouTube creators but also frequently take 
some sort of action while on YouTube, such as buying a product. With so 
much content to choose from, you need to be authentic, well organized, and 
consistently active for your channel to attract a growing fan base. Effective 
planning and a continual review against your goals is critical to success on 
YouTube. Fortunately, getting your plan together is straightforward, but your 
goals need to be measured and adjusted on an ongoing basis.
Proper planning is about looking at the big picture first and then working 
your way through the details in a methodical way. YouTube audiences know 
the difference between great channels and mediocre ones because the best 
ones are always well planned. Planning makes all your other YouTube and 
marketing activities more efficient. You may feel the need to rush out and 
produce some videos, but you’ll be better served — and get better results — 
if you step back and think about how audiences, channels, and content all 
come together. This chapter is about planning your YouTube strategy.
Go back to the basics if your existing channel isn’t attracting or engaging 
viewers. Effective planning isn’t only about creating new YouTube chan-
nels and uploading more videos — it’s also about laying the groundwork 
for some cool marketing strategies. Fortunately, planning ahead goes a long 
way toward getting your present channel moving and your audience excited 
about your work. Don’t be surprised if some of your viewers want to collabo-
rate and offer to help you out.

Establishing Your Channel’s Mission
Your YouTube channel is a great way for you to present yourself and your 
brand to an audience (that’s potentially massive). You may balk at consid-
ering yourself a “brand,” but we’re here to tell you that it doesn’t matter 
whether you’re an independent creator, a Fortune 500 company, a cutting‐
edge digital agency, or a local business — every organization and YouTube 
creator has its own brand, whether they know it or not. Your brand value 
is tied to its uniqueness and how it appeals to your viewers. That’s why 
YouTube is so important and effective for showing what you or your  
company represent, far better than words can ever do.
Successful YouTube strategies incorporate a channel presence well beyond 
simply uploading your videos for free. Your channel is a place where viewers 
should come regularly to discover and consume content. This is an opportu-
nity to grow, engage, and inspire communities of passion.
Upon arriving on your YouTube channel, viewers should quickly understand 
what you and your channel are all about. The success of your channel is tied 
to making your brand and channel mission resonate loud and clear. Khan 
Academy, shown in Figure 5-1, is an excellent example of YouTube integra-
tion with its brand. Visit the channel at www.youtube.com/khanacademy 
to see a live example of a YouTube channel with a clear mission.
If you have other online properties, such as a website, Facebook page, or 
Twitter account, make sure your YouTube channel has consistent brand-
ing and messaging that aligns with all your social networks and websites. 
Viewers commonly move across these properties as they engage with you, so 
your mission must be unified and clear.

 Chapter 5: Making Plans Both Large and Small  
Determining your goals
Your YouTube channel showcases something you’re passionate about. What 
drives you to create a YouTube channel and content isn’t so different from 
what motivates you to do other things in life, such as
✓
✓Host a fundraiser
✓
✓Write a blog
✓
✓Support a cause
✓
✓Give something back to society
✓
✓Earn some income
✓
✓Learn a new hobby
The reason that YouTube is such a great place for you to share your passion 
is because video is a supremely effective medium for getting your audience 
to engage with you. Learn to put that medium to use for you.
Though building your channel is one major goal, you’ll likely have additional 
goals. Here are some other reasons for creating your YouTube channel and 
the content it contains:
✓
✓Build a brand. There’s no better way to show who you are, either as 
an independent creator or as an organization, than by way of a video or 
series of videos on your channel. The content might include different 
types of videos — something you’ve created, straight news, information 
about you, or a combination. Your motivation for brand building could 
be to obtain a new job, attract attention from industry luminaries, or 
make people feel good about your products.
✓
✓Educate your target audience. Most people love to learn, and much of 
the successful content on YouTube revolves around education and tuto-
rials. Educational content includes home repair, product configuration, 
justification for social causes, and many more topics. Educational con-
tent also helps drive brand awareness.
✓
✓Entertain the crowd. People love to laugh, enjoy music, and get 
engrossed in a good story. These genres are all forms of entertainment, 
and all work especially well on YouTube.
Many forms of entertainment are highly subjective, so be sure to tailor 
your content so that it connects with the specific audience you’re trying 
to reach.
✓
✓Sell something. It doesn’t matter whether you have a product to sell, a 
subscription to offer, or a candidate to elect, your YouTube channel is a 

102
Part II: Making Good Videos and Not Making Bad Videos 
great way to demonstrate to your audience that they want what you’re 
offering. People are turning to YouTube to make buying decisions about 
future purchases. Make sure you understand that YouTube is now a 
primary source of information used to influence a sale. In the past seven 
years, YouTube searches for video reviews have more than doubled.
✓
✓Earn a living. We’ve explained that your videos can make money by driv-
ing and influencing sales. You can also earn a living from people watch-
ing your YouTube videos by monetizing your channel (as explained in 
Chapter 14).
Don’t quit your day job — at least not yet. Making money from YouTube 
takes time, creativity, and persistence. Even the best‐laid plans can’t guaran-
tee results if you don’t (or your content doesn’t) resonate with your target 
audience. Don’t fret: Your YouTube channel may be a nice source of supple-
mental income, eventually.
Don’t feel that you have to keep your goals separate. Michael Stevens’ popu-
lar Vsauce channel (www.youtube.com/Vsauce) does a great job of com-
bining educational goals with entertainment to keep his audience (almost 
8 million subscribers) coming back for more.
Embrace discoverability
At the end of the day, YouTube is about one 
thing: getting people to watch your content. 
Simple, right? In theory, yes, but your challenge 
is to help viewers find your channel and your 
content. That’s what discoverability is all about: 
placing your content in front of the right viewers 
so that they can watch. Unfortunately, YouTube 
doesn’t share the secret sauce for getting 
found, but you can help improve the odds of 
your videos showing up in YouTube and Google 
Search as well as in Suggested Videos on the 
Watch page. What can you do in the planning 
phase for aiding discoverability? Make watch 
time an important goal.
Watch time is one of the most important fac-
tors that trigger YouTube to put your content 
in front of viewers. In 2012, YouTube made 
watch time more important to discoverability 
than the number of views the video received. 
So what exactly is watch time? In its simplest 
form, watch time is the total amount of time 
viewers spend watching your videos. People  
who watch your content are telling YouTube, 
“Hey, this is important stuff; make sure similar 
viewers know.”
Watch time doesn’t indicate whether your 
viewers watch the entire video (although that’s 
a good thing, too) — it indicates that a relatively 
high percentage of the video is being viewed. 
How much? Again, YouTube isn’t specific. Note 
that it doesn’t matter whether your videos are 
short or long; what’s important is that viewers 
are engaged. The secret is to make legitimately 
good content. Good content increases watch 
time, which increases discoverability.

103

 Chapter 5: Making Plans Both Large and Small  
Creating viral videos shouldn’t be your goal. Betting your YouTube strategy 
on producing viral videos is like betting your entire retirement savings on 
winning the lottery. Attain your goals through proper planning and execution, 
not through chance.
Being different, being valuable,  
being authentic
YouTube has over 1 billion unique visitors every month, and this number 
continues to grow. Now, that might sound intimidating, as in “How can I get 
anyone to notice me?” but our advice to you is to jump right in. The trick 
is that, you simply have to be different enough and interesting enough for 
people to care. Your content (or the content of those videos you choose to 
curate) must connect with your audience while tying into your brand. In an 
increasingly congested space, you need to be authentic to establish credibility 
and aid discoverability.
Yes, it’s possible to make a little money in the YouTube world by hiring your-
self out as a spokesperson for a third party, but being a paid spokesperson is 
a risky strategy. You’ll find that your YouTube audience is rather astute and 
will quickly weed out channels that lack authenticity from their subscriptions 
and playlists. If you get paid to include product placements in your videos, 
be sure to notify YouTube when updating your monetization settings. You 
must follow all of YouTube’s ad policies if you’re paid to include product 
placement in your editorial content. For more on monetization settings, see 
Chapter 14.
Surveying the YouTube landscape
Your channel‐planning blueprint must include a clear understanding of the 
community you’re aiming to reach. Ask yourself these questions:
✓
✓Who are the influencers and thought leaders? Discover spokespeople 
who share your passion to determine their tone, style, and content 
approach. Determine how they engage with their fan base and with 
whom they collaborate.
✓
✓What channels are popular? Use YouTube Search to determine which 
channels are the most popular with the subject matter planned for your 
own channel. Enter keywords into the search bar to discover popular 

104
Part II: Making Good Videos and Not Making Bad Videos 
channels and videos. Look at the number of subscribers, views, likes, 
and comments. Find out why these channels resonate by looking at 
style, branding, publishing, scheduling, collaboration level, and person-
ality. See how the channels organize videos and playlists, repurpose 
content, and promote new videos.
✓
✓How engaged is the community? You need to gauge how viewers are 
reacting to the content they watch. Determine what normal levels of 
likes/dislikes and comments are for your target audience. Identify the 
vocal members of the community and capture their constructive criti-
cism and content recommendations. Comments are a great source for 
telegraphing audience needs.
✓
✓Is my idea different enough? Figure out whether there are gaps in the 
content being produced. Assess whether your approach covers some 
of the fan base content recommendations now unfulfilled by existing 
channels.
The YouTube community is quite collaborative, especially among better 
channels and viewers. If you’re in a competitive market, your audience will 
provide a competitive advantage by promoting your channel and making 
­content recommendations. If you have a product or service, don’t be  
surprised if your audience gives you feedback on that as well.
With more than 100 hours of video now being uploaded to YouTube every 
minute, you’ll realize that you’ll have to search through, watch, and analyze 
a good deal of content so that you can determine whether your YouTube 
strategy is sound. YouTube is the second‐largest search engine in the world, 
so take a reasoned and disciplined approach to determine where you fit — or 
where your organization fits.
We recommend visiting comparable channels, watching their videos, and 
then exploring the video recommendations to determine whether your 
channel will be unique enough to build a following. You can use YouTube 
Search to track down the competition, or you can try one of the specialized 
tools recently made available, such as Pixability’s Video Marketing Software 
(www.pixability.com).
YouTube provides some valuable options to discover content that is impor-
tant to your target audience or relevant to your discovery. Working directly 
from the YouTube search bar can be helpful; anytime you begin typing a 
search query into YouTube, you see a list of possible search results displayed; 
these are the high‐volume searches that YouTube feels may be ­relevant to 
your current query.

105

 Chapter 5: Making Plans Both Large and Small  
YouTube’s basic search feature is a good tool to use if you want to gauge 
whether you’re creating content that is in high demand. Using the advanced 
search filters, however, is much more efficient if what you want to do is find 
specific channels and videos. Figure 5-2 shows an Advanced Search Filter 
query for the term monster trucks. (Note that it has nearly 1.2 million relevant 
videos — who knew?)
Mobile YouTube viewing and mobile search must be significant parts of your 
channel strategy. Understand that not all mobile apps have complete func-
tionality, including the advanced search filters referenced.
Be sure to look at recommended videos under the What to Watch section 
of the guide we describe in Chapter 2. Your previous viewing and search pat-
terns influence what shows up under your recommendations, so you may see 
a blend of content from different searches, both professional and personal.
Just as independent software tools, such as Adobe Creative Suite and 
Apple Final Cut, are important to the video production process, new inde-
pendent tools, including Pixability (www.pixability.com) and Tubular 
Labs (www.tubularlabs.com), are quite valuable to the channel dis-
covery ­process on YouTube. These third‐party products often combine 
YouTube data with information from social media sources, to offer a 
more granular analysis of important channels, demographic information 
about your targeted fan base, and a detailed look at what your audience 
watches and shares. Figure 5-3 shows the critical channels around a specific 
topic base.

Understanding Your Target Audience
Your channel’s success is linked to how well you know your audience. In Part 
III of this book, you can find out all about building your audience and deter-
mining whether they’re finding and hanging out on your channel. Your core 
audience on YouTube is a community of passionate individuals who collec-
tively care deeply about a specific subject.
To be truly effective on YouTube and get your audience to engage, you need 
to share their passion and be creative enough with your content, channel, 
and social interaction that your commitment comes through loud and clear 
to them. Your goals are to be either part of the community proper or an 
expert who provides value to the community.
Going narrow versus going broad
Sharing your passions most effectively often means focusing on your niche. 
Many aspiring YouTubers feel that going after the largest audience possible 
to start with is the clearest path to success. Not necessarily. In fact, we want 
you to consider a few factors that may make you reconsider your plans to try 
for the broadest audience possible:
✓
✓Getting found: It takes time for your channel and content to infiltrate a 
popular subject area. You’re likely competing with millions of videos, 
some of which have proven immensely successful and will dominate 
search results for some time.

107

 Chapter 5: Making Plans Both Large and Small  
✓
✓Producing unique content: With so many videos in a popular category, 
you’ll definitely have challenges standing out — at least initially. Channels 
that have been covering your topic space have also had time to refine 
their brands, another factor that makes their content stand out.
✓
✓Reaching influencers: Popular and important industry spokespeople 
and personalities are constantly being bombarded by creators and view-
ers. You’ll have a tough time attracting their attention at the beginning, 
no matter how insightful your vision or how creative your content.
✓
✓Having help: The channels at the top have lots of promotional help 
from subscribers or other advocates in social media. That didn’t happen 
overnight. Invest time in developing relationships and proving that you 
bring value to the table.
Start off being the big fish in the small pond, and choose a specific topic 
space carefully. Your channel and your content will be more discoverable 
and increase the likelihood of connecting with both key influencers and the 
fan base.
Knowing why your audience matters
Treat your audience as an adjunct to your marketing department, public 
­relations firm, sales organization, and design group.
The right audience will
✓
✓Spend time on your channel. The length of time that your audience 
spends viewing your content is important. Videos that receive more 
watch time are more likely to appear in YouTube search and watch 
­recommendations.
✓
✓Share your YouTube content with peers. Everyone dreams of having a 
popular video with millions of views. A video becomes successful when 
it’s unique and compelling enough with the target audience that one 
viewer eagerly shares it with peers, who then just as eagerly share it 
with other peers, and so forth.
✓
✓Subscribe to your YouTube channel. Subscribers watch twice as much 
of your content as nonsubscribers. They also receive updates about 
your channel activity (new videos, comments) in their subscription 
feeds, keeping them informed about all the exciting stuff on your chan-
nel. Ask your viewers to subscribe in the video, and include annotations 
where appropriate to subscribe to your channel.
✓
✓Engage with your channel. Likes (or dislikes) and comments comprise 
the avenue for building a community around your channel. Motivated 

108
Part II: Making Good Videos and Not Making Bad Videos 
audience members may also include your content on their own channels 
or websites, expanding your reach and your opportunity to build your 
audience even further.
✓
✓Be your creative advocates. A great audience truly cares about the 
channels they subscribe to and can be an important source of great 
ideas and content. Encourage your viewers to use the Comments section 
below the video to submit ideas; this strategy gives you more content 
ideas and helps engage viewer interest for the current video.
Defining your target audience as precisely as possible is an important com-
ponent of channel success. A target audience of “15‐ to 55‐year‐old men” is 
far too broad. Add a layer of detail to define a more targeted audience — for 
example “people who like cooking” is a much more defined audience.
Finding out the nitty‐gritty  
about your audience
If you haven’t yet thought about your online audience, we recommend 
Video Marketing For Dummies, by Kevin Daum, Bettina Hein, Matt Scott, and 
Andreas Goeldi (John Wiley & Sons, Inc.). It provides a more in‐depth look at 
audience needs and identification than we can offer here, but we do want to 
offer some food for thought. When planning your YouTube channel, have an 
image of your targeted fan base in mind at all times. Ask yourself these  
questions:
✓
✓Who are they? Marketing people like to use the term demographics to 
describe some of the characteristics of their target audience. Think 
about your audience and attributes such as age, gender, and interest. If 
you’re selling baby products, for example, your audience may be new 
mothers between 24 and 36 years old. Be specific.
YouTube now attracts more 18‐ to 49‐year‐olds than most cable net-
works. However, if you’re going after seniors, it may be a bit more dif-
ficult than if you were targeting a slightly younger audience. Fortunately, 
even some of our older friends are discovering YouTube as well!
✓
✓Where are they? YouTube works as well for small local business as 
it does for the big, international companies. Your social media efforts 
around your YouTube channel should involve influences in the geo-
graphic location you serve.
✓
✓How do they get their information? Make an effort to understand 
what your audience reads, where they go on the web for information, 
and what events they attend. This will influence the direction of your 
channel and its contents.

109

 Chapter 5: Making Plans Both Large and Small  
✓
✓Who influences them? What bloggers or YouTubers do your targeted 
viewers connect with? Pay attention to the style of how these web celeb-
rities communicate.
Be authentic. Don’t feel that you need to mimic an influencer, because 
your audience will see right through it.
If you have other properties, such as a website, Facebook page, or Twitter 
account, you likely have much of the audience information you need for your 
YouTube planning process. As your channel grows in popularity, don’t be 
surprised if your audience changes as well.
Defining Desired Actions
Your channel‐planning blueprint must spell out the type of action you want 
your audience to take. That’s activation. You need clarity around the type of 
action you want because it influences the type of content you create and the 
steps you want your audience to take. We cover both of these topics in detail 
later, in Chapter 10, but you should identify these actions during the planning 
phase.
No matter how intelligent and independent your fan base, you need to guide 
them through the experience with your channel and its contents. Believe it or 
not, your viewers want you to tell them what to do. Some of that supervision 
may be as explicit as a Subscribe button, or more implicit with the automated 
viewing of a playlist.
This is an area where many people and organizations struggle. Define what 
you want the viewer to do and determine how you’ll help them do it. If your 
audience is aligned with your mission, they’ll entrust you to guide them 
through your channel and give them a call to action (CTA, for short). Look at 
the following CTA options and determine which one sums up what you want 
your viewers to do:
✓
✓Subscribe to your channel. Subscribers are much more valuable view-
ers because they statistically consume more content and engage more 
on YouTube and social media.
Don’t be shy! Make sure to ask viewers to subscribe.
✓
✓Watch more of your videos. Content is often related. If a viewer has just 
watched a video of yours on house painting, chances are good that they’ll 
watch a video on paint options or brush selection if you ask them to.  
In Chapter 10, we show you that playlists and annotations can help you 
guide viewers to watch more.

110
Part II: Making Good Videos and Not Making Bad Videos 
✓
✓Do something. What do you want your viewers to do? Vote? Volunteer? 
Run marathons? Cook Thai food from your recipes? Video is a strong 
motivator, so use that factor to drive your viewers to take action.
✓
✓Make a purchase. YouTube is now one of the places that people go to 
make buying decisions. If you’re selling something, ask them to buy what 
you’re selling, and be sure to let them know where they can close the 
sale — whether it’s a physical location or a “virtual” store on the web.
✓
✓Share their experience. If a viewer enjoyed your channel or content, 
help them tell others about it. It’s another helpful way to attract  
subscribers and views.
Planning an Outstanding  
YouTube Channel
YouTube rewards you with higher search rankings and supplementary video 
recommendations based first and foremost on your channel and individual 
video watch times. In addition, YouTube looks at factors such as viewer 
engagement and video sharing rates. Your job in the planning process is to 
identify and coordinate each component so that you’re in a position to keep 
your channel active.
Having a spokesperson
Okay, you’ve analyzed your target fan base and figured out what motivates 
them on YouTube. Now you need to determine whether a specific channel 
spokesperson would be the right fit for your target fan base. This is a critical 
decision for both independent creators and organizations.
Typically, an audience gravitates toward either a personality or content, but 
not toward any old personality or content. Whatever you choose to priori-
tize, it has to have a high level of authenticity. If the viewers in your topic 
area engage more with personality, for example, be sure to choose a spokes-
person with credibility and appeal.
Aim for the same voice across your content because it will provide the  
consistency that your audience needs across different types of video.
A good example of a brand with a consistent voice is the personal care com-
pany e.l.f. Cosmetics (www.youtube.com/eyeslipsfacedotcom), which 
consistently uses Achelle Dunaway as the voice of its videos. Achelle isn’t 

111

 Chapter 5: Making Plans Both Large and Small  
­terribly famous, but the fans of e.l.f. have come to know her and expect to see 
or hear her in every video the channel produces. They trust her and associ-
ate her with the e.l.f. brand. Often, they give her both feedback and praise in 
the individual video comments.
Branding
Branding can be a large and complex topic, but we’re going to keep it simple: 
Branding is about naming and design that is unique to you. Need an example? 
Think about Apple. You see consistency in all its products, naming conven-
tions, website, and packaging. Over time, that branding symbolism — the 
look and feel — becomes synonymous with who you are. Want to learn more? 
Check out Branding For Dummies, by Bill Chiaravalle and Barbara Findlay 
Schenck (John Wiley & Sons, Inc.).
Your YouTube channel and videos are powerful extensions of your brand. 
If you have an existing website, logo, or color pattern, bring it over to your 
YouTube channel and use it for the branded elements of your videos as well. 
If you give your viewers a great experience on YouTube, chances are that 
they’ll end up on your website, too. Keep the branding consistent. Your view-
ers will appreciate it.
Planning the channel layout
Your channel must be visually representative of the video content you 
create. When a viewer first visits your channel, it’s important that they 
understand what kind of videos your produce or curate. You also want view-
ers to be in a position to quickly find out when new content is expected from 
your channel. A great design layout makes these tasks a lot easier.
When coming up with a design layout, keep these elements in mind:
✓
✓Channel art: The banner you see across the top of your YouTube chan-
nel’s home page is the welcome mat for your viewer, so make it as 
appealing as possible. A good channel art design is device agnostic — it 
looks good on mobile devices, desktops, smart TVs, or what‐have‐you. 
To help you make the creation of your channel art easier, you can 
download a customized graphical template for your YouTube channel at 
https://support.google.com/youtube.
✓
✓Channel trailer: The channel trailer is the first video that visitors see 
when viewing your channel. This is where you need to captivate your 
new viewers and get them to subscribe to your channel. You can cus-
tomize the channel trailer for subscribers or nonsubscribers.

✓
✓Channel icon: This icon indicates who you are when you post a com-
ment, release a new video, or show up in search results and many more 
locations across YouTube and Google+.
The channel icon can be changed only from the Google+ account associ-
ated with your YouTube channel.
✓
✓Channel links: The small icons that live in the lower-right corner of 
your channel art direct viewers to your other digital properties, such as 
Facebook, Twitter, or Pinterest. The complete list of digital properties is 
under the About section of your YouTube channel, and you can choose 
whether to display icons for some or all of your properties.
✓
✓Custom sections: Visually dividing your channel page into sections is a 
great way to help your viewers find the most relevant content on your 
channel. One way to customize your sections is to create unique  
playlists or groupings of videos per section.
✓
✓Custom thumbnails: Thumbnails are visual snapshots of your video, sim-
ilar to a poster for a movie. They are chosen by default by YouTube — 
three optional frames from the beginning, middle, and end of your video 
are provided for every video asset that’s uploaded. You can, however, 
create a custom thumbnail for each video. If you do so, choose a  
thumbnail that is illustrative of the content in the video.
Thumbnails have a tremendous impact on a video’s view rate. With that 
fact in mind, always choose or create a good thumbnail, especially for 
videos shown in sections.
✓
✓Featured channels: Channels that you own or like or that are simply 
relevant for your audience are best included in the Featured Channels 
section on the right side of your channel page.
Under Featured Channels, you control the additional section Related 
Channels, which YouTube populates with channels that it considers to 
be like yours. Though YouTube doesn’t disclose the exact criteria, it’s 
likely based on content type and what viewers search for. You can turn 
off this feature, but by doing so, YouTube won’t put your channel on the 
Related Channel feeds of other users. You benefit only by keeping it on.
✓
✓Verified name: A verification badge, identified by a gray check mark, sig-
nals viewers that a channel associated with a celebrity or brand is legiti-
mate. You need a Google+ account with the name authorized to receive 
a verified name for your channel.
With so many channels on YouTube, viewers may think they’re viewing 
the appropriate channel for an organization or famous personality. The 
verification badge shows up to the right of the channel name and helps 
alleviate any viewer concerns about the legitimacy of the channel.

Crafting a Content Strategy
Coming up with a mission for your channel is important, as is defining 
your audience and planning how your channel could best serve your target 
­audience’s needs, but at some point you have to define the content that 
brings it all together. Well, there’s no time like the present, so get ready to 
tackle that task.
Recognizing that content includes  
video and more
When establishing a content plan, consider these factors that influence how 
your audience discovers your content and what action viewers take as a 
result of watching:
✓
✓Video: The channel trailer is the first video visitors see when viewing 
your channel. This is where you need to captivate your new viewers  
and get them to subscribe to your channel. You can customize which 
channel trailer is shown for subscribers or nonsubscribers.
✓
✓Intro and outros: Create consistent intro and outro styles for your 
videos. Think of intros and outros as what you see at the beginning and 
end of your favorite television show. In the first five seconds, a viewer 
should know that this is one of your videos; this consistency can be 
something as simple as the way you say hello and greet your viewers or 
as complex as an animated logo. Outros should be similar across your 
channel as well — a goodbye ritual or animated end cards, for example.
✓
✓Metadata: Metadata, or the words you use to describe your video, 
include the video title, keyword tags, and video description. In 
Chapter 9, you can see how to add and modify your metadata content.
Though the term metadata sounds like something out of a Star Trek epi-
sode, it’s important for discovery and YouTube Search. Viewers can also 
find more information about the video or links back to your website if 
they want more information.
✓
✓Thumbnails: Thumbnails need to be descriptive of the content that a 
viewer could find in your video. Make custom thumbnails to help  
viewers discover your content above the rest.
✓
✓Annotations: Annotations are overlay elements that you can add to your 
existing videos. They allow viewers to do something when they click on 
the annotation, such as subscribe or get more information about you or 
view more content.

114
Part II: Making Good Videos and Not Making Bad Videos 
Don’t worry about the nuances of making your videos interactive with 
annotations. You can see how easy this task is and understand the art 
and science of annotations in Chapter 10.
✓
✓End cards: An end card is a collection of one or more annotations at the 
end of a video that drives viewers to do what you want them to do when 
the video is completed. As part of your branding, you want your end 
cards to be consistent in both their layout and CTAs.
✓
✓Links: Use clickable links in your video description to drive viewers to a 
specific location on the web or somewhere within YouTube.
Your planning process should consider the viewer who wants more 
information from a specific video. Providing links in the video descrip-
tion or annotations is a great way to give the audience more information 
when they want it.
✓
✓Web assets: Where you send your viewers after they click on a video 
description or annotation is important for both your viewers’ experi-
ence and for your channel goals. Your planning must take into account 
where you send your viewers and what you expect them to do when 
they arrive at your chosen destination. Be creative! Your target might be 
a Facebook contest, a Twitter page, a scientific journal, or anything else 
you can link to that is relevant for your viewers.
Looking at content formats
If you’ve been mulling over jumping into the YouTube world for a while, 
we’re pretty sure that you’ve spent a lot of time wrestling with how to pro-
duce all that content to keep your channel fresh and active. With YouTube, 
you have several options for your content strategy:
✓
✓Creation: Regularly produce your own content. You can certainly build 
a channel without a stitch of your own content, but if you’re going to 
stand out, your viewers need to see your genuine stuff.
✓
✓Curation: Mine the YouTube universe for content that complements 
your channel, and organize it in a logical way using sections and  
playlists for the viewer.
Think of curation in terms of what a museum does: Collect all this 
great art (content), and then pull it together into a themed exhibit. 
The YouTube playlist is the museum’s exhibit. That’s why museums 
put French Impressionist paintings together: because it’s all about the 
viewer/visitor experience. Would you want to see an impressionist 
painting together with contemporary pottery? Probably not.

115

 Chapter 5: Making Plans Both Large and Small  
Channel owners generally love it when their videos are included in 
­playlists, because it helps promote their channels and gets viewers 
watching their content. Done right, your curation favor will be returned 
many times over.
✓
✓Collaboration: You don’t have to do everything yourself! Team up with 
other channel owners and create joint content. It’s a popular and effec-
tive way to grow an audience and gain subscribers. Since a YouTube 
video can be associated with only one channel, your collaboration plan-
ning should take into account content that you’ll own (create) and  
content that you’ll help share (collaborate).
Here are some examples of different types of content you can utilize for your 
channel:
✓
✓Episodic content: The idea here is to have reoccurring content that 
­creates a series or a body of work on a specific topic. This is great 
content to produce for your channel because it’s highly attractive to 
channel subscribers. Subscribers can be notified every time you release 
a video.
✓
✓Short‐ and long‐form content: Creating a mixture of short‐ and long‐
form content can help you understand the sweet spot for your viewers. 
YouTube Analytics (described in Chapter 11) helps you plan better by 
identifying the optimal total run time for your videos. If you’re creating 
ten‐minute videos with short watch times, consider adding in annota-
tions to lead viewers to a different video on a similar topic where you 
start to see the watch times decline.
✓
✓Create new edits, recycle footage: Don’t be afraid to think outside the 
box when it comes to content creation. Reuse video outtakes, behind‐
the‐scenes, and additional footage (called B‐roll) to make new edits. 
Recycle your content when it makes sense for your viewers.
✓
✓Playlists: Reengage viewers with old videos in new playlists. Highlight 
videos that are still relevant on your channel page and in new playlists. 
You can choose to include your playlist updates in your channel feed to 
update your fans.
✓
✓Plan for Mobile: Mobile viewership accounts for 40 percent of global 
YouTube video consumption. Make your content easy to consume on 
mobile devices. Easy‐to‐see thumbnails and text onscreen are important 
for your mobile audience. Shorter titles are easier to read and under-
stand on mobile as well. In Chapter 11, you can see how to use YouTube 
Analytics to check your channel traffic sources and understand what 
percentage of views are from mobile.

116
Part II: Making Good Videos and Not Making Bad Videos 
Curation recycling
Multi-channel networks aggregate many similarly themed YouTube channels 
and personalities. Frequently, they help promote their managed channels’  
content on a single primary channel. To see what we mean, check out 
Tastemade (www.youtube.com/tastemade), which is a great example of 
an MCN curating its channels’ content — they group videos from different 
channels into a unified theme and make it much easier for viewers to watch 
them. You don’t have to own or be affiliated with a YouTube video to include 
it in your own channel playlist lineup. You can simply enjoy recipes and col-
lect and curate them from your audience. There are no limits to what you can 
curate, although some content will resonate better with your audience.
Create sections and playlists on your channel that include videos from other 
creators. As long as it makes sense for your channel to include outside con-
tent, curating content is a great way to expand your channel’s appeal and 
keep it active even if you aren’t creating unique content.
Adidas, for example, has a ton of channels; it made a conscious decision to 
link many of its subchannels to sections and playlists on its primary channel, 
at www.youtube.com/user/adidas. Doing so encourages cross promotion 
of its other assets and channels.
Above the beauty crowd
We conducted a major research study of the 
Beauty category on YouTube, analyzing 168 
companies and their YouTube channels, 45,000 
independent creators and their channels, and 
more than 800,000 total videos. We found that 
even in this very crowded part of YouTube, 
channels with a clear but authentic and dif-
ferentiated mission had far superior channel 
performance. They had more views, subscrib-
ers, and engagement than many much larger 
beauty brands. The more savvy beauty brands, 
though, were quick to understand this new 
dynamic and then began including content 
from independent creators.
For example, Bobbi Brown, the beauty 
brand, put together an additional YouTube 
channel dedicated to beauty vloggers look-
ing to create inspiring looks for their view-
ers. Check it out at www.youtube.com/ 
ilovemakeupOFFICIAL. The brand pro-
vides products and inspiration to the vloggers, 
and the vloggers then go on to create videos 
for the I Love Makeup channel. This may sound 
convoluted, but it works well because each of 
the vloggers already has a dedicated audience 
following their content, each one is a trusted 
advisor to their audience on all things beauty, 
and now their fans watch them create content 
for one of their favorite cosmetic brands. It’s a 
win for both vloggers and the brand.

117

 Chapter 5: Making Plans Both Large and Small  
Programming for Success
Suppose that you create a good channel and produce ten excellent videos 
that your audience would likely watch, share, like, and comment on. 
Uploading those ten videos all at one time translates into only one measly 
real event for your audience, meaning that you’ve left nine marketing  
opportunities unexploited.
The moral of the story? Don’t rush to upload all your content to YouTube 
at one time. You’ll get better audience engagement if you space out your 
uploads, in essence delivering your content on a regular basis. Programming 
dictates how best to deliver your content to your fan base.
Keeping your subscriber feeds active is an important part of programming 
strategy, but it doesn’t need to be video based. Your other channel activity 
(such as playlist modification) and engagement (which includes likes and 
sharing) also keeps your subscriber feed flowing.
Delivering content consistently
A famous philosopher once spoke rather disparagingly about foolish con-
sistencies and the danger of conformity. That may be a good philosophy for 
your branding and content, but not for your YouTube channel programming. 
Though YouTube differs significantly from broadcast television and cable 
networks, your viewers will want consistency and predictability of content 
scheduling.
The better YouTube creators put up content on their channels regularly. 
That’s what a publishing schedule is: your upload plan. Check out the grid 
shown in Figure 5-4 — it shows the publishing schedule for Dulce Candy 
(www.youtube.com/DulceCandy87), a beauty‐and‐style personality with 
a popular channel. From the pattern, you see a continual stream of content 
being added. Her average is every 3.1 days between uploads.
Figure 5-4: 
The Dulce 
Candy 
publishing 
schedule.

118
Part II: Making Good Videos and Not Making Bad Videos 
Upload regular content weekly. Don’t hide it. Let the audience know your 
publishing schedule on YouTube, and use social media to alert them when 
your content is live.
In addition to your social media outreach, remember that your channel feed 
will alert your subscribers whenever you upload new content.
Being flexible and reactive
Just because you’re producing regular, addictive, episodic content that 
amasses both subscribers and views doesn’t mean that you can’t generate 
some additional excitement around your channel. You may want to consider 
certain triggers:
✓
✓Tentpole events: Significant cultural or industry events may play well 
into your channel and content strategy. If you sell zombie paraphernalia, 
Halloween is a perfect tentpole event for you. Identify regular events 
or happenings in your topic area. If your channel covers auto racing, 
consider certain events such as the Daytona 500 and Le Mans as tent-
pole events. Industry events may be a great way to capture footage with 
industry leaders and personality.
Make sure you have important YouTube apps installed on your mobile 
devices, especially at tentpole events. There are several apps avail-
able on both Android and IOS that allow you to work on the fly. Use the 
Capture app to record, edit, and upload video on the fly. Manage your 
channel with the Studio app. Just want to watch some YouTube videos? 
The YouTube app is great for that.
✓
✓Reactive: You should be prepared to leverage nonplanned events for 
your channel, which should drive additional traffic and viewership. 
Nonplanned events are about news, but only if it’s relevant to your chan-
nel. Marques Brownlee (www.youtube.com/marquesbrowlee) is a 
major video reviewer who covers the consumer electronics business.  
If someone announces a new smartphone, you can be sure that Marques 
will have something on YouTube relatively fast.
Time‐sensitive content may help you in search and recommended videos 
because YouTube likes to put trending content recommendations in 
front of relevant viewers.
✓
✓Momentum: You can repackage your content into video trailers to help 
drive channel promotion. Just did a YouTube live event? Put together a 
highlight reel to keep your channel active and your subscribers’ channel 
feeds flowing. Don’t be afraid to craft outtake videos, behind‐the‐scenes 
content, and more personal pieces to let your audience know that you’re 
excited for this new content. This will help personalize and enhance the 
authenticity of your channel.

119

 Chapter 5: Making Plans Both Large and Small  
Going live for more engagement
You can deliver a much more interactive experience with your most passionate 
viewers by taking advantage of YouTube live events. You can live‐stream any 
number of events, but remember that they should align with your channel’s 
mission.
There are channel restrictions and some technical requirements for live 
streaming. Ensure that your account is in good standing with no strikes and 
that you meet the technical requirements. Don’t forget to test sufficiently 
before using this service.
Consider the following statements before adding live streaming to your 
YouTube programming mix:
✓
✓Promotion is important: YouTube live streaming is clearly different 
from regular YouTube video — your viewers must show up for the live 
event to experience it as it happens. If they don’t know about it, they 
won’t show up, and all your prep work may be for naught. Be sure to get 
the word out, and don’t be shy about asking your YouTube subscribers 
to help.
✓
✓Adjust in‐flight: Your audience will provide feedback on the fly as  
your event occurs, so be sure to watch the comments and respond 
accordingly.
✓
✓Repurpose event content: A livestreamed event is a great way to cap-
ture rich and engaging content for use on your channel. Figure out how 
it fits into your channel after the event is over.
Reuse your livestreamed content and divide it into multiple videos if it makes 
sense. If you’re going to include the event on your channel, don’t feel the 
need to save the event as one video.
Before you use content derived from a live event on your channel, you will in 
some circumstances need the legal right to use the content. Don’t worry: You 
won’t need to hire a lawyer, because you can read all about it in Chapter 16 
when you’ll learn all about copyright.
Planning Doesn’t End
Your channel is live. You created great content. You have views. Your audi-
ence is engaged. It’s all smooth sailing, right? Hopefully, yes, but as the 
saying goes, “You have to inspect what you expect.” Look to see whether 
your audience

120

✓
✓Watches your videos all the way to the end
✓
✓Stays on your channel and views more content
✓
✓Comments and provides creative suggestions
✓
✓Shares your work on social media
✓
✓Includes your videos in their playlists
“Well, how do I all that?” you may ask. Fear not: You’ll find the answers to 
all these questions (and to a few others as well) when we help you explore 
YouTube Analytics in Chapter 11.
The YouTube world constantly changes with new channels, new contents, 
new personalities, and new trends. Your channel makes you part of this 
world, and you’re responsible for adapting to changes in order to stay rel-
evant. Pay attention to what the viewers are telling you, and feed it into your 
ongoing planning process.

et’s face it: Making video is easier now than it has ever been, and that 
trend is growing. Cameras, editing software, and computers that can 
edit video are now relatively cheap and available, which means that, follow-
ing a few best practices, almost anyone can make a decent YouTube video 
with equipment they may already own. This chapter looks at a few of those 
best practices and helps you make a decision about price versus quality by 
examining the advantages of new camera and recording formats. To close out 
the chapter, we also take a look at the production tools you’ll need in order 
to produce great video for YouTube.
Checking Out Your Camera Options
Let’s get the good news out of the way right off the bat: There’s a good 
chance that you already own a High Definition (or HD) camera. Video cam-
eras are everywhere. According to the Pew Research Internet Project, as of 
January 2014, 58 percent of American adults own smartphones. Pretty much 
any modern smartphone has an HD camera, as do most modern laptops 
and all‐in‐one desktop computers. But just because access to cameras is 
easy doesn’t mean that choosing the right camera is simple. Quality varies 
widely, and there are some tools and techniques that can help even a basic 
camera shoot good video. We talk about several types of cameras specifi-
cally, but you have to take a few (mostly universal features) into account 
Chapter 6

122
Part II: Making Good Videos and Not Making Bad Videos 
when shopping for cameras. For the most part, we talk about these three 
types of cameras:
✓
✓Camera phone: We use the term camera phone as a catchall term for a 
camera built into a mobile device. (So don’t write in to tell us that your 
tablet or music player isn’t a phone; we are well aware of that fact.) 
When we say camera phone, you should see in your mind “a camera 
that is built into your iPhone or Android or Kindle Fire or whatever.” 
A camera phone may not produce the absolute best images out there, 
but when the moment comes to capture the footage of one of your dogs 
sitting on your other dog and howling the tune to “Total Eclipse of the 
Heart,” the best camera is the one in your pocket that you can start 
shooting with immediately.
✓
✓Camcorder: The venerable standalone camcorder was for many years 
the average person’s entry point to the home video market. In recent 
years, camcorders have been pressured from both sides because camera 
phones are generally good enough these days to satisfy the needs of the 
casual video shooter, and the very high quality (and dropping price) 
of digital single‐lens reflex (DSLR) cameras has captured the interest 
of shooters who are interested in higher video quality and feature con-
trol. Camcorders can be quite convenient, though, and the best of them 
offer a happy medium between features and ease of use. Camcorders 
also range widely, from the most basic entry‐level devices to full‐blown 
­professional machines that cost tens of thousands of dollars.
✓
✓DSLR: DSLRs have exploded in popularity in recent years. DSLRs have 
traditionally been used for still photography, but now all DSLRs include 
an array of video features and settings. You can capture great-quality 
video and easily stay under a $1,000 budget for your camera gear.
Working through the (camera) basics
Before getting into a detailed discussion of the pros and cons of the different 
camera types out there, we want to talk a bit about a few features and ele-
ments that all cameras share. That way, we can get some terminology out of 
the way that may prove helpful when you’re comparing cameras:
✓
✓The sensor: The heart of any digital video camera is its sensor. The 
larger the sensor, the better the image quality. That’s because a larger 
sensor has larger pixels, which capture more light, resulting in higher 
image quality. Currently, a “big” sensor is a full frame sensor measuring 
in at 36x24mm, the same size as a 35mm film negative.

123

 Chapter 6: Acquiring the Tools of the Trade
When people talk about megapixels, that’s something of a red herring. 
A 10 megapixel camera with a larger sensor can likely capture better‐­
looking video than a 12 megapixel camera with a smaller sensor. Though 
this description can be confusing and technical, the important thing to 
note is that a larger sensor is generally better.
✓
✓The lens: The pros will tell you, it’s all about the glass. The lens in a 
camera is a huge factor in image quality, and it’s a factor that can be dif-
ficult to understand. The most important feature of any lens is its aper-
ture capability. The aperture of a lens controls how much light enters 
the camera body and hits the sensor. Basically, along with shutter speed 
and ISO, this is the control that makes the picture brighter or darker.
The aperture is also called the f‐stop (or t‐stop on cinema lenses), and 
aperture ranges are denoted as f2–f24 or similar language.
The most popular look on YouTube currently is an f‐stop of 5.6; this 
draws the viewers’ attention to the foreground, keeping it in sharp 
focus, while leaving the background soft.
Try to use lenses that have a fixed f‐stop, not a variable f‐stop. Such 
lenses often are a much higher quality — with a price tag that reflects 
that fact. A Canon 50mm 1.8 is a great starting lens and usually will cost 
you around $100.
✓
✓Resolution and format: The YouTube player supports High Definition 
(HD) video and you really should have an HD camera to take advantage 
of that support. Most modern video cameras are capable of shooting full 
1080p HD (1920x1080 resolution), and that is what you should look for. 
Some cameras have variable frame rates, but as long as they can shoot 
the standard rates, such as 24p, 30p, and 60i, you should be able to find 
something you like. Look for all these numbers in the specs when shop-
ping for cameras.
The numbers before the letters indicate how many fields per second 
are shown. As for the P, it stands for progressive, where the video image 
is drawn progressively line after line. In 30p, to take one example, one 
whole frame is typically shown every 1/30 of a second. The I stands for 
interlaced, meaning the odd or even rows in the picture show every 1/60 
of a second. 60i is typically used for sports or fast paced videos, because 
it results in less of a flicker feel. 30p is often perceived as higher quality 
for less action‐based footage because its resolution brings with a clearer 
image. 24p is the frame rate of film — but getting that “film look” also 
depends on lighting and composition.
The latest and greatest DSLRs can shoot in the format 4k (4k is short for 
4,000 pixel resolution), which is a much higher resolution than 1080p 
HD. Though footage shot in 4k is beautiful, the cameras that shoot 4K 
tend to be expensive. The reality of shooting video for YouTube is that 
4K resolution is, for the moment, overkill. The site can display 4k, but 
the vast majority of views are on computer screens or mobile devices 
incapable of displaying 4k or 8k content.

124
Part II: Making Good Videos and Not Making Bad Videos 
✓
✓Codecs: Most cameras compress the captured video to save space on 
whatever recording media you’re using. The compression software that 
the camera uses is a codec. In the past, different codecs could result in 
wildly variable performance when the time came to edit. Often, footage 
would need to be transcoded to a different format in order for the edit-
ing suite to understand it. Thanks to improvements in editing software 
and hardware, transcoding is largely a thing of the past. All the major 
editing packages these days can handle just about any codec you care 
to throw at them. Just be sure to record in the highest quality codec for 
your device — which generally means the least compressed video.
✓
✓Monitoring: You need to be able to see your video as you shoot it. 
Most modern video cameras have an LCD screen for monitoring video. 
Usually, manufacturers talk about these screens in terms of pixels. When 
choosing a camera, make sure you can tell if the image is in focus from 
the view on the LCD. Built‐in focus assist options will also help when 
using a smaller LCD. If you cannot tell if your image is in focus, you may 
need an external HD monitor or you may want add an EVF (electronic 
viewfinder) from a third party for monitoring.
✓
✓Zoom: Zoom involves changing the focal length of the lens to make it 
seem as though the camera is closer to its subject. Though it’s a some-
what familiar concept, one important thing to remember about zoom is 
the difference between optical and digital zoom:
• Optical zoom is the actual telephoto effect produced by the physi-
cal change in the focal length of the lens, and it is the only zoom 
you would ever want to use. It allows you to zoom in on the ­subject 
with no significant degradation of picture quality.
• Digital zoom is usually a very high, seemingly impressive number, 
but it is a feature to avoid. Digital zoom doesn’t actually change 
the optics of the camera; it simply scales the image up, which 
­produces a lot of noise and artifacts in the picture. Stated simply,  
it won’t do anything but make your footage look bad.
✓
✓Memory, tape, and hard drives: Pay attention to how your camera is 
storing the footage you’re shooting. Each of the following formats has 
upsides, and downsides.
• Tape: Cameras that record on tape are less common these days, 
but there are still a few out there, and many used ones are avail-
able. Tape has a few upsides, in that it is durable, but its down-
sides are many. Generally, tapes are expensive because it’s really 
not a good idea to reuse them. After you use them once, the quality 
degrades significantly upon a second use. Tape also degrades over 
time, so it turns out not to be a great place to store your footage. 
Tape can also be difficult to deal with. Generally, taped footage 
has to be captured to your editing computer in real time, which is 
quite time consuming when compared to tapeless workflows.

125

 Chapter 6: Acquiring the Tools of the Trade
• Flash memory formats: The video industry is rapidly moving toward 
the use of the standardized flash memory cards for all kinds of 
cameras. These cards are inexpensive, almost infinitely reusable, 
and easy to use for both capturing and transferring footage.
There are still a few competing standards when it comes to 
memory cards, so make sure you purchase the right card for your 
camera. The two most popular memory card types are Secure 
Digital High Capacity (SDHC or SD, the more common title) and 
Compact Flash (CF). Both are excellent. They’re relatively cheap, 
reliable, and ubiquitous. You can buy them just about everywhere.
Our recommendation when it comes to memory is to choose your 
camera first — that will often determine what kind of memory card 
you need to purchase. When purchasing your memory card, either 
SD or CF, choose a card that can read and write data as quickly as 
your camera. An example of a write speed is 1000x; this means the 
card reads and writes at approximately 150MB/s.
• Proprietary digital memory card: Many high‐end professional cam-
corders use proprietary memory cards. For example, Panasonic’s 
pricey pro camcorders use either the P2 or Sony’s SxS‐1 format. 
Though these cards perform well, they work with only their cam-
eras, and they’re extremely expensive. These formats tend to be 
used on cameras that are also quite expensive, so it may not be a 
problem encountered by the YouTube beginner. But as your skills 
progress, you may want to upgrade your camera, so keep this 
information in mind.
✓
✓Image stabilization: Higher‐quality cameras often offer image stabiliza-
tion, a feature that does just what it says — it stabilizes images. One 
hallmark of footage from people who are new to videography is shaky 
footage. Image stabilization can help with this problem, and it comes in 
a couple of different flavors:
• Optical image stabilization: This type of correction features 
­gyroscopes and moving elements inside the lens itself. When the 
camera shakes, the lens detects the movement, and the lens ele-
ments roll with the punches, so to speak. The lens parts move to 
correct for the motion, and the sensor captures a stable image.
Internal gyroscopes can be noisy, so be sure to use an off-camera 
recording device when using optical image stabilization. (An inter-
nal camera mic is sure to pick up the noisy gyroscope sounds.)
• Digital image stabilization: This correction uses various software 
algorithms to reduce the impact of shaky hands on your video. 
Unfortunately, some to the tricks it comes up with aren’t that 
aesthetically pleasing. For example, the most common way digi-
tal image stabilization corrects an issue is by removing the edges 

126
Part II: Making Good Videos and Not Making Bad Videos 
of the frame. More often than not, you end up with a degraded 
image that’s just not worth keeping. Yes, you may be able to cor-
rect in post‐production, but your best bet is to collect the high-
est quality image while recording in the field.
✓
✓Manual controls: An important feature to look for in a camera is easily 
accessible manual controls. Though at first you’ll probably want the 
camera to manage most aspects of image capture for you, as your skills  
as a videographer develop, you’ll inevitably want to take control of the 
camera’s controls. The manual controls have to be easily accessible —  
ideally assignable to physical buttons on the outside of the camera. 
These physical buttons allow you to change settings quickly, which can 
be important when you’re trying to capture a moment. Controls that are 
buried deep in the camera’s settings menus aren’t truly useful.
Looking at DSLRs
DSLR stands for digital single‐lens reflex, but its initials are not the key con-
cept to understand here. The big reason that DSLRs are massively popular 
these days is that they can produce great image quality for a relatively low 
price; the many happy DSLR owners out there probably don’t know — and 
don’t care — what the initials stand for.
As with any camera, the DSLR has both upsides and downsides. The upsides 
are clear:
✓
✓The big picture: By a large margin, the most important advantage that 
the DSLR affords a filmmaker is the large sensor. Some DSLRs even have 
a sensor that is roughly the same area as a traditional frame of 35mm 
film — these are full‐frame sensors. Without getting too technical, the 
larger the sensor, the better the image quality. Also, the large sensor, 
when combined with the right lens settings, produces a shallow depth 
of field, which is desirable if you want your video to have that sheen of 
professionalism. This depth of field effect is, put simply, the phenom-
enon in which the subject of the video is in focus but the background 
is out of focus, which makes the subject feel separate from the back-
ground. This out‐of‐focus background — called bokeh by all the arty 
film school types — is an important trick to have in your repertoire.
✓
✓The lenses: Another great feature of the DSLR is its interchangeable 
lenses. A DSLR allows the operator to choose the type of lens that is 
required for the shot. Some lenses are better for action shots, and some 
lenses are great in low light; macro lenses shoot subjects in extreme 
close‐up, and zoom lenses allow you to capture distant subjects. This 
sort of flexibility, which is crucial in higher‐end filmmaking, can really 

127

 Chapter 6: Acquiring the Tools of the Trade
improve the visual quality of your videos. A nice bonus is that each 
manufacturer has a standard lens mount that most of its cameras use. 
For example, if you start with an entry‐level Canon camera and obtain 
several lenses for it, those lenses also fit the fancier Canon camera if and 
when you decide to upgrade.
✓
✓Manual settings: Most serious videographers will tell you that capturing 
the best image requires understanding and using the camera’s manual 
settings, and setting characteristics such as ISO, aperture, and shutter 
speed. We don’t get into explaining all the details of how to use a camera 
in this chapter. The important point here is that even entry‐level DSLRs 
have robust manual controls that are usually easy to use and under-
stand. Advanced videographers want to make changes to these settings 
quickly and easily, and most DSLRs have dedicated buttons on the 
camera body to change each of these settings quickly.
As proof that not everything is hunky‐dory in DSLR‐ville, check out these 
things that folks love to hate about DSLRs:
✓
✓The sound: Though this situation is slowly changing, DSLRs have tra-
ditionally been reviled for their inability to capture sound well. Audio 
is extremely important to making a watchable video, so this is kind of a 
big deal. We will say up front that no DSLR on the market today has an 
acceptable built‐in microphone. We believe that you should not use the 
built‐in mic on the camera when you can avoid it — we recommend you 
buy more stuff to accompany your camera. There are a couple of ways 
around this problem.
• An external microphone: This is the simplest solution to the DSLR 
audio problem. Most DSLRs have a connection that allows the user 
to plug in a separate microphone. Because this audio problem is 
widespread in the DSLR market, quite a few options are available 
that are designed to work specifically with DSLRs. There are many 
choices in this space, but we find one solution to be the Rode 
Video Mic Pro; it has an excellent cost‐to‐value ratio.
• An external audio recorder: Even with an external microphone, 
many DSLRs still don’t have a great way to monitor the audio 
you’re recording. This is a very big deal. If you don’t know what the 
audio sounds like as you’re recording the footage, you can quickly 
ruin the shoot and waste a lot of time and resources. A number of 
digital recorders on the market are designed for this very purpose. 
These recorders come in a wide variety of price points, but they 
do confer a lot of advantages. Going down the list, they offer bal-
anced inputs (eliminating hiss and hum noises), phantom power 
for professional mics (recommended is the mkh416), more control 
of audio levels, and compressors and limiters for keeping levels 
from clipping.

128
Part II: Making Good Videos and Not Making Bad Videos 
	
	Recording the audio externally does mean that you have to syn-
chronize the footage and the audio recording in editing, which 
introduces more work and an opportunity for problems to arise. 
Just because you’re using on off camera recording device doesn’t 
mean you should turn off the in camera audio recording. You’ll 
want audio from both devices captured for reference when syncing 
in post production.
✓
✓Manual settings: Extensive manual controls can be both a blessing and 
a curse. The best part about shooting manually is the amount of control 
you have over the quality of light in every shot. You can choose how 
bright you want the shot to feel based on the emotion of the scene, 
whereas if you use an automatic setting you may lose some of the mood 
you could have created with your lighting setup. The sheer number of 
settings and the fine gradations of adjustment can be overwhelming to 
an inexperienced user. Though DSLRs generally have a full automatic 
mode that will allow you to point and shoot quickly, we recommend 
working in the manual controls and maintaining control over the quality 
of each shot, even if it takes more time.
✓
✓Record time limitations: One long‐standing complaint about DSLRs is 
that all of them have some kind of record‐time limitation. Admittedly, 
popular cameras like the GH4 or a7s do not have duration limits, but in 
some cases, a camera can shoot only 29 minutes of continuous video.
Before planning a long video, be sure to check the upload limits for 
your particular YouTube channel. To do so, point your browser to 
https://youtube.com/my_videos_upload to check your limits  
or extend your limits.
✓
✓No autofocus: Not all DSLRs can autofocus while shooting video. This 
can be inconvenient, especially when you’re shooting a moving subject 
with a shallow depth of field. The fact is, it doesn’t take much for your 
subject to move in and out of focus; it doesn’t have to move far at all. 
This is most problematic when shooting scenes with lots of action and 
movement at low aperture settings.
✓
✓Manual zoom only: The only way to zoom with most DSLRs is to manu-
ally adjust the zoom ring on the lens barrel. This can cause a number 
of problems while shooting video. Touching the lens more than likely 
is going to produce a shaky image; it takes a steady hand to make a 
smooth manual zoom. If you’re planning to do lots of zoom shots, a 
DSLR may not be for you.
✓
✓The expensive aftermarket: A lot of the issues we’ve described with 
DSLRs do have solutions, but you’re going to have to pay a pretty penny 
for them, or try to build them yourself.
For most YouTube video creators just starting out, a DSLR may be just  
the ticket for you. If you have no experience with video production or 

129

 Chapter 6: Acquiring the Tools of the Trade
­photography, be patient, the DSLR will have a learning curve. The inexperi-
enced creator often can use a simple webcam to get started. If you do have 
experience creating video, and you’re making content that requires the best 
image quality for your buck, a DSLR is the way to go.
Several manufacturers are in the DSLR market, including Canon, Sony, 
Nikon, and Panasonic. Though all these companies make good DSLRs for still 
images, we generally recommend the Canon DSLRs for shooting video. In our 
estimation, they offer good features for the price. Start by looking at some 
entries in the Canon line:
✓
✓Canon EOS 5D Mark III: Though this option is a bit pricey, running 
around $3,000 for the camera without a lens, this is a truly excellent 
camera choice for shooting video. The 5D Mark III has made huge 
improvements to its video capture capabilities, and its full 35mm sensor 
gives you the ability to capture beautiful video. As with any DSLR, you 
need to have at least an external microphone, and maybe even an exter-
nal audio recorder; but as far as image quality goes, the 5D is hard to 
beat. The latest Canon DSLR cameras have done a lot to improve the 
on‐board audio capture quality.
✓
✓Canon EOS Rebel t5i: The Rebel series is Canon’s more affordable DSLR 
line, and the t5i is certainly cheaper than the 5D. The t5i is widely avail-
able for under $600, and it delivers excellent image quality. It features 
a somewhat smaller sensor than the 5D, but the sensor is considerably 
larger than can be found on any camcorder.
✓
✓Panasonic GH4: Currently the only DSLM (digital camera without a 
mirror) that shoots 4k video. This camera is known for reduced noise 
and great color reproduction. This is a great camera for both novices 
and professionals at around $1,500.
✓
✓Sony a7s: Sony’s very popular a7s, coming in under $3,000, is currently 
the world’s smallest full-frame camera with interchangeable lens capa-
bilities. Since lenses are truly the part of the camera that you can con-
tinue to invest in, it’s best to stick with one camera manufacturer. Most 
DSLR lenses can be used on many different models within the same man-
ufactures products. Double‐check your manufacturer of choice before 
making large investments in lenses.
Checking out camcorders
A camcorder is an all‐in‐one camera that is dedicated solely to shooting video. 
For the vast majority of users, a camcorder is what comes to mind when they 
think about video cameras. Camcorders have traditionally recorded to video-
tape cassettes, but pretty much any camcorder you can buy these days uses 
some sort of file‐based system utilizing digital media.

130
Part II: Making Good Videos and Not Making Bad Videos 
There are generally two types of camcorders that are at all relevant to 
YouTube creators. The consumer camcorder is the type of camera available 
at big box electronic retailers. Prosumer is the term for cameras that add 
many of the features of professional cameras while retaining at least some 
semblance of affordability.
The professional range of video cameras tend to be the cameras that are 
designed for news gathering for television stations; those cameras can run 
into the tens of thousands of dollars, and they aren’t really cost effective 
for creating YouTube videos. For the purposes of this book, we focus on 
­consumer and prosumer camcorders.
The consumer camcorder
First off, let us point out that consumer camcorders have come a long way in 
the past ten years. The video cameras that you can buy in an electronics store 
these days affordably deliver a lot of great features. They have some downsides, 
but if you’re just starting out shooting videos, excellent consumer camcorder 
choices are out there. As usual, these cameras have positives and negatives.
First, the positives:
✓
✓Low cost of entry: The greatest appeal of the consumer camcorders is 
by far the price. The market for these types of cameras is competitive, 
which means that manufacturers have really packed a lot of features 
into these cameras for very little money. A basic camera is less than 
$200, and the best of the best consumer cameras generally cost less 
than $1,000.
✓
✓Ease of use: Consumer camcorders are designed to be easy to use. They 
are intended for consumers who may not know a lot about shooting 
video, and, as a result, they do a lot of work to make up for that. These 
cameras generally have effective automatic settings that do a good job 
of capturing usable video in a wide variety of situations. Both the video 
and the audio recorded by these cameras tend to be pretty decent. 
It won’t win any cinematography awards, but it can get the job done, 
depending on the job. Especially for vlog‐style videos, these consumer 
camcorders may be all you need.
Now for the bad news:
✓
✓Picture quality: If you already have experience in shooting video, and 
you like to control the image, you’ll find a consumer camcorder annoy-
ing. These cameras generally have unremarkable lenses, and very, very 
small sensors. This means that anything you shoot on these cameras 
will likely look like a home video. That works for some formats, but if 
you’re making short art films, this may not be the camera for you.

131

 Chapter 6: Acquiring the Tools of the Trade
✓
✓Lack of manual control: Part of the consumer camcorders ease of use, 
which is generally a positive, can be a negative for someone who wants 
to manually control settings. For the most part, manual controls are non‐
existent, and if a consumer camcorder does have manual controls, they 
can be very hard to use. They are often buried in onscreen menus and 
are difficult to operate. Users who want to fine‐tune their footage won’t 
find much to love here.
✓
✓Feature bloat: One of the most annoying aspects of the consumer cam-
corder market is the feature arms race that goes on between the various 
manufacturers who operate in this market. Rather than improve lenses 
or sensors on their models year over year, they focus on silly features 
like built‐in projectors, Wi‐Fi connections, digital zoom, and near field 
communication. All this stuff is useless when it comes to improving your 
footage.
The prosumer camcorder
Prosumer camcorders aim to be a true all‐in‐one solution for capturing video, 
and most of them are flexible enough to address a wide variety of shooting 
scenarios with aplomb. We tend to think of prosumer camcorders as the 
happy medium of video cameras. They combine a lot of the ease of use of 
a camcorder and can produce a picture quality that can rival some DSLRs. 
They have weaknesses and trade‐offs, of course, as does any camera.
Here’s why prosumer camcorders have a dedicated fan base:
✓
✓Picture quality: In almost all cases, a prosumer camcorder will produce 
a better image than a consumer version does, primarily because of the 
larger sensors and the better lenses that these models tend to have.  
Any decent prosumer camcorder will capture a sharper image than its 
consumer counterpart.
✓
✓Ease of use and manual control: The best of the prosumer camcorders 
are straightforward to use and have a lot of useful automatic settings. 
Videographers are able to capture images on the fly without a lot of fuss. 
However, they also have extensive manual controls. On the good ones, 
those controls are operated with buttons on the camera body.
✓
✓Robust audio capture: Most prosumer camcorders do a good job of 
capturing digital audio, and they often have a robust set of inputs for 
getting your audio into the camera. In most situations, you’ll use an 
external microphone, and a prosumer camcorder should have plenty of 
connections for those mics. As a bonus, the external mic audio is often 
recorded on a separate track from the internal camera microphone — 
both in the same video file. That means you don’t have to sync the audio 
and video later.

132
Part II: Making Good Videos and Not Making Bad Videos 
✓
✓Long record times: Unlike the DSLRs with their recording time limi-
tations, most prosumer camcorders can record as much footage as 
your memory cards can hold. This makes them suitable for shooting 
longer events and in other situations calling for longer recording 
times.
✓
✓Excellent monitoring: The prosumer camcorder niche seems to be 
crowded with cameras that have bright, clear, articulate displays that 
swing out from the body of the camera. This makes monitoring what 
you’re shooting a breeze, with no need for an external monitor.
Here’s why prosumer camcorders have generated some critics:
✓
✓Image quality: The relatively small sensors found in prosumer cam-
corders is the most common complaint. Though they do have larger 
sensors than consumer camcorders, their sensors are dwarfed by 
the DSLR sensors. Although this is not always the case anymore, it is 
important to point out that Canon c‐series cameras have super 35mm 
sensors, as do the Sony NEX cameras and all in the prosumer camera 
range.
✓
✓Being stuck with one lens: The vast majority of prosumer camcorders 
do not allow for interchangeable lenses. This rule has a few exceptions, 
but generally the only cameras that have this feature are expensive. 
(Many videographers will use adapters to add on a better lens on those 
less expensive models.)
✓
✓Non-modular: In camcorders, it’s all or nothing. None of the parts are 
usually interchangeable, which means that after part of your camera is 
obsolete, the whole thing is obsolete. With a DSLR, at least the lenses 
can transition to your new camera when you upgrade (as long as you 
stick with the same camera manufacturer).
The mighty, miniature GoPro
Many specialty cameras are available in addi-
tion to the types we discuss in this chapter. 
One that is hugely popular for making YouTube 
videos is the GoPro. The GoPro is often used 
in extreme sports videos. It is extremely small, 
durable, affordable, and it comes with a water-
proof case. It also happens to deliver excel-
lent HD video, considering its miniature size 
and miniature price. The GoPro isn’t only for 
sports, though. It can be useful for captur-
ing risky shots for which you may not be will-
ing to use your fancy DSLR or camcorder. 
This can provide you with some freedom to 
try interesting cinematographic techniques.

Settling for smart phones
We won’t argue that the camera on your phone should be your primary 
camera. Smartphones aren’t the best video cameras, they can be difficult 
to stabilize, and the footage files they produce can often be difficult to work 
with. Still, sometimes in the heat of an amazing moment unfolding in front 
of you, the best camera is the one in your pocket. It may not have much in 
the way of manual control, and it may not produce the most beautiful image, 
but in a lot of cases, being quick on the draw is more important.
The specs for smartphone cameras are a moving target. Smartphone manu-
facturers are constantly trying to outdo each other by packing more power-
ful cameras into phones. We won’t make a specific recommendation, but we 
know pretty much any high‐end or flagship smartphone has a camera that 
can shoot passable HD video.
In many ways, choosing the camera that works for you is a matter of per-
sonal taste. If you’re just getting into videography, you should watch a lot 
of videos. Find the stuff you like on YouTube, and find out how those videos 
were made. The beauty of YouTube and social media is that the barrier is 
much lower for reaching out to creators. Find creators that make stuff you 
think looks good, and then ask them nicely how they shot it. Though you  
may not get a response from a creator with millions of subscribers, smaller 
creators are often happy to help out. Give it a try.
Stabilizing the Shot
One of the most important things you can do to give your video an air of 
professionalism is to stabilize your shot. Nothing says amateur video like 
extremely shaky handheld video. We’ve all watched home videos that induce 
motion sickness as the camera whips around. Many tools can help you lock 
down your shot:
✓
✓Tripod: The most useful stabilizing tool is the simple tripod. It has three 
legs; you attach your camera to the top, and your shot is as stable as 
stable can be. Tripods are readily available online, at camera stores, and 
at electronics stores, and they have a wide variety of price points. We 
recommend investing at least $50 here. It can be helpful to get one that 
has a built‐in level to keep your shots from being crooked.
When you’re shopping for a tripod, make sure you choose a model that has 
a fluid panning head. At some point, you’ll want to add a few camera moves 
to your repertoire, and you’ll need that fluid head when that time comes.  
A basic still photography tripod may be cheaper, but you’re going to regret 
it when you need to move the camera during a shot. Tripods with nonfluid 
heads cannot replicate the smooth motion that a fluid head can provide.

134
Part II: Making Good Videos and Not Making Bad Videos 
✓
✓Dolly: A dolly is simply a set of wheels for the camera. The simplest 
­dollies attach to the bottom of the tripod, and — voila! — your camera  
is now on the move, allowing you to create interesting motion and 
­following shots.
✓
✓Steadicam: A number of handheld Steadicam rigs are available these 
days, but they can be a little expensive. They also require a great deal 
of skill to use effectively. That means practice. If you want to get good 
handheld shots using a Steadicam rig, you have to practice, practice, 
practice to get the hang of using the thing. If you do put in the time and 
get good at it, you can create some pretty cool shots with these devices.
✓
✓Sliders/cranes/jibs: A wide variety of devices are also on the market to 
create moving shots. Sliders allow the camera to move on rails, provid-
ing a sense of smooth motion in the shot. Cranes/jibs allow the camera 
to move from side to side and up and down in space, creating a smooth 
sensation of flight. Many of these are available as add‐ons to tripods. 
Though they aren’t absolutely necessary, a few nice moving shots do 
provide a feeling of high production value to almost any project. Sliders 
start at around $200; if you are ready to build something in order to save 
money, search YouTube for some DIY glider videos.
Seeing Your Way with Light
Another super‐important aspect of creating a video with some level of profes-
sionalism is lighting. You don’t need to win any lighting awards, but decent 
lighting goes a long way toward making a watchable video. There are a 
couple of ways to approach lighting: You can buy specialized lights, which 
will probably produce the best results, or you can work with the lights you 
already have. Just using lamps from around the house isn’t ideal, but it can 
get you started, and there are ways to improve your video’s look just by 
­putting some thought into light placement.
Setting up 3‐point lighting
The simplest and generally most useful lighting setup for shooting a person 
inside is 3‐point lighting. As its name implies, this lighting setup involves  
three lights, and it illuminates a subject in what is considered a traditionally 
pleasing way.
We describe the three lights that are involved (see Figure 6-1) in the following 
listing:

135

 Chapter 6: Acquiring the Tools of the Trade
✓
✓Key light: The key light is the main (and brightest) light in a 3‐point 
lighting setup. It is usually placed to the right or left of the camera, and 
it points directly at the subject from a 30‐ to 60‐degree angle. The height 
of the light should ideally be set so that it points slightly down on the 
subject’s face, but not so high that it creates shadows on the face. It 
should point down from slightly above the subject’s eye level.
✓
✓Fill light: The fill light is a generally a softer light that should be pointed 
at the subject from the opposite side of the camera. The fill light 
shouldn’t be as bright as the key light. It is there mainly to create a more 
even light on the subject. Using only a key light would usually result 
in creating dramatic shadows on the subject’s face, and unless you’re 
shooting a horror movie or a serious drama, you probably should want 
to stick with somewhat even lighting.
✓
✓Back light: The back light (sometimes called a hair light) shines from 
behind the subject and casts a thin outline of light around the sub-
ject’s head, almost like a halo. This isn’t intended to give the subject an 
angelic look — it’s intended to create depth and separate the subject 
from the background. The back light can be directly behind the subject, 
but it can also be placed at an angle to the subject. Be sure not to get the 
light in the shot if you’re going to place it directly behind the person.
✓
✓Background light: We know, it’s confusing to add a fourth light into a 
section about 3‐point lighting, but the reality is that most 3‐point light-
ing setups also use a background light. This light does what its name 
implies — it lights the background. This is sometimes used to call atten-
tion to the background, but it is most often used to light the background 
separately from the subject. This can help create a sense of distance 
between the subject and the background, and can help enhance the 
separation between the two.

Three‐point 
lighting.

Part II: Making Good Videos and Not Making Bad Videos 
Setting up high‐key lighting
Another viable, if less popular, lighting scheme is high key lighting. This 
involves using multiple high‐powered key lights and turning them all on very 
brightly. This setup basically floods the subject with light. Though this setup 
lacks subtlety, we recommend it because it is simple. It also allows for quick 
production, as pretty much all shots require the same lighting setup. No 
one will comment on your beautiful lighting if you use this setup, but it does 
make things easy.
Capturing Sound
A crucial factor in creating an air of professionalism in a video is the sound. 
In this sense, audio is truly king. Capturing good audio to accompany your 
video is essential. Good sound is, in most cases, transparent. If you’re able 
Working with the lights you have
Your video will look best if you have actual 
video lights. The problem with this strategy is 
that video lights are expensive. So why can’t 
you just use the lights you have in your home? 
The good news: You can. You can create a 
simple 3‐point lighting system using lamps from 
around your house. If you use them, though, you 
should follow a few guidelines:
✓
✓Move the lamps. Using home lights is the 
easy way out, but it’s usually not quite as 
easy as just turning on the lights and roll-
ing the camera. You need to move the lights 
around into something resembling the 3‐
point setup. You also might have to move 
some lamps from other rooms because 
house lamps don’t have the same bright-
ness as video lights.
✓
✓Standardize. When possible, try to use the 
same type of bulb in all the lamps you’re 
using to light the scene. LED lights are very 
popular with a color temperature you can 
manually change. Mixing fluorescent and 
incandescent lights can cause weird‐looking 
results in your picture, so you should choose 
one or the other and make sure your bulbs 
are all the same color temperature (color of 
the light is measured in temperature). Each 
different type of light bulb emits a different 
temperature; mixing bulbs can make skin 
tones look very unnatural for example.
✓
✓Lose the shades. Lampshades can cause 
uneven lighting, so you should take those 
things off while you’re using your lamps 
as video lights. This will also help with 
­maximizing the limited power of household 
lighting.

to record your talent’s voice clearly and cleanly, the audience won’t notice, 
which is exactly the reaction you’re looking for here. If you record echo‐laden 
bad audio, the audience will notice, and not in a good way.
Looking at microphones
The single biggest thing you can do to improve the audio in your videos is to 
obtain a decent external microphone. Though some camcorders do have a 
decent built‐in microphone, you’ll almost always obtain better results by using 
an external microphone. You can use a few different types of microphones:
✓
✓Lavalier: The lavalier mic — or lav mic, for short — is also known as a 
lapel mic. A lav mic’s primary advantage is that it is small. The micro-
phone can be attached to the speaker’s clothing, and it’s small enough 
to be unobtrusive. Most viewers are accustomed to seeing newscasters 
and other video subjects with visible microphones, so it isn’t generally 
off‐putting for the audience. Lav mics are usually omnidirectional, which 
means that they pick up sound from every direction: You cannot only 
hear your subject, but you’ll also hear every sound in your recording 
environment.
Lavs work best in quiet environments or controlled studios. The nice 
thing about the lav mic is that it is, for the most part, a set‐it‐and‐forget‐it 
solution. After the lav mic is attached correctly to the talent and the 
levels are set, you only need to check periodically to ensure the levels are 
maintained.
✓
✓Shotgun mic: A shotgun microphone (or boom mic) is a highly direc-
tional mic that is often used to record voices in videos. The shotgun mic 
is designed to record audio from a single direction, and it’s less sensitive 
to sound coming from behind the mic, to the sides, or elsewhere around 
the subject. This type of mic is especially useful for isolating sources in 
noisy situations, where background noise can overwhelm the subject’s 
voice. Shotgun mics, which are a lot larger than lav mics, need to be 
pointed at the talent from just off camera, no more than a foot from the 
speaker’s mouth. This is usually accomplished by a boom operator, who 
is a human who holds the shotgun mic attached to the end of a pole and 
points it at the talent, or a c‐stand with a clamp.
✓
✓Handheld: You often see onscreen talent using a handheld microphone. 
A handheld mic can be a practical solution for capturing audio, but it is 
clear that the talent is using a microphone. This is completely accept-
able in newsgathering situations, and it can be a great solution for 
videos of that type.

Capturing good audio
Capturing good audio is important, so it’s worthwhile to look at a few factors 
that go into capturing it. You may already know that you need a decent mic, 
but a couple of other factors go into it:
✓
✓The recording environment: Modern audio‐editing software allows you 
to make quite a few changes and fixes to your audio after the fact, but 
the best way to end up with good audio is to capture good audio. A huge 
part of capturing good audio is controlling the environment in which 
you shoot. If you shoot your video in a busy coffee shop, it’s difficult to 
keep the sounds of the coffee shop out of your video. Make sure you’ve 
chosen a quiet place for your video recording, away from traffic, refrig-
erators, air conditioners, pets, crying children, televisions, and so on.
✓
✓Monitoring your audio: Another key aspect to capturing good audio 
is to listen to what you’re recording while you’re recording it. Though 
a good camera will have an onscreen monitor visually representing 
the audio you’re capturing, it is essential to listen to the audio in head-
phones as you’re recording. Ensuring that everything sounds good,  
and retaking shots with audio glitches and noises, is much more  
time‐effective than trying to fix all that stuff in post‐production.
Wired or wireless?
Most microphones for video can be purchased 
in either a wired or wireless version. The wired 
version is connected directly to the camera 
with a microphone cable, and the wireless 
version uses some kind of radio signal to send 
audio to the camera or audio recording device 
without wires. The wireless option can be very 
useful, and it certainly feels futuristic, though 
it can be impractical. As with any device that 
relies on radio transmission, interference can 
be a problem, especially in crowded urban 
areas. Wireless devices also use batteries, and 
dead batteries can be just one more thing to go 
wrong. Wireless mics are necessary for appli-
cations where the subject moves around a lot, 
or is far from the camera, but in other situations, 
it may be wise to consider wired mics. They 
may not have the same level of tech appeal, but 
they can remove a couple of layers of complex-
ity from your shoot.

he big day has arrived and it’s time to shoot some video! You’re ready to 
stride onto the set as the big‐shot director or producer and yell “Action!” 
It’s all a breeze from this point, right?
Not quite. A video shoot can be an incredibly high‐pressure environment, 
with too much to do and too little time to get it done. You must perform an 
amazing juggling act that keeps the cast, crew, camera, script, set, props, 
­costumes, and all those inevitable but unplanned events all moving forward 
to get your video “in the can” by the deadline.
The good news is that a video shoot can also be one of the most creative 
and rewarding experiences you’ll ever have. When all the elements click and 
you see that outstanding performance or fantastic camera angle, you’ll feel 
a sense of deep personal satisfaction and pride that you nailed it. When the 
shoot is going well, the payoff far outweighs the pain.
This chapter explains how to prepare for the shoot — from developing a 
checklist the night before to setting up on the big day. We lay out the steps 
involved in every good camera take, and we list the little details that every 
first‐class director must keep an eye on in order to capture the outstanding 
footage you need.

Setting Up for a Shoot
Directing or producing a video is similar to running a marathon — you must 
be rested and ready before you can go the distance. The night before you 
run 26.2 miles, for example, you don’t want to begin wondering whether 
you should have bought new running shoes. Similarly, the night before the 
big shoot, you want to be as prepared as possible. The more you prep, the 
smoother your shoot — and the better you sleep the night before.
Getting organized
Buy a production notebook to make your film or video production extremely 
well organized. We recommend a good old‐fashioned, three‐ring binder,  
the type often carried by schoolchildren. It’s the perfect one‐stop spot to 
store all your shoot‐related information, and it will soon become your new 
best friend.
Stock your production notebook with these items:
✓
✓Dividers: Add instant organization, and make the items you need during 
the shoot easy to find.
✓
✓Pens and pencils: Pens are the first thing you lose, so be sure to have 
more than one.
✓
✓Blank paper: You may need scratch paper or sheets of paper to 
­illustrate shots.
✓
✓An envelope: Store the receipts from your expenditures.
Completing your checklists  
and “shoot sack”
After you have the basic items for your production notebook (as described 
in the preceding section), expand its contents by storing these items in it  
as well:
✓
✓Script: Your copy of the dialogue to be used in the shoot should always 
stay with you so that you can make notes, change the dialogue, or stay 
abreast of scenes that have been shot.
✓
✓Call sheet: This is a list of your cast and crew’s arrival times on set.  
If you expect them to arrive at different times, keep track of their 
­schedules.

141

 Chapter 7: Putting It All Together to Capture Some Video 
✓
✓Cast and crew contact sheet: This list of contact information (such as 
email addresses and phone numbers) is the easiest way to ensure that 
participants can contact each other.
✓
✓Schedule: A schedule is useful when a number of cast or crew members 
are arriving on the same day and you want to better schedule the shoot, 
by determining which scenes to shoot and when, and when to let  
everyone take a break.
✓
✓Storyboard: This series of panels shows the individual shots within a 
scene. Keep the storyboard handy to show your crew the shots you want.
✓
✓Prop and costume list: Double‐check this list after the shooting day ends 
to ensure that all items are returned to the appropriate person or place.
✓
✓Script breakdown: List cast members, props, costumes, and types of 
shots for every individual scene, and specify whether the scene is an 
interior or exterior.
✓
✓Cast breakdown: This reverse version of the script breakdown lists 
actors and the scenes in which they appear. Creating this list helps you 
schedule the shooting order of scenes.
Though the script breakdown and cast breakdown may be unnecessary for 
a simple shoot, if you have multiple scenes and actors, consider the break-
downs as insurance against losing important elements of the shoot. (We’ve 
seen actors released from a shoot for the day only to find that they were still 
needed for another scene later the same day.)
The night before your shoot, complete these tasks:
✓
✓Charge all batteries. Charge up all related devices, such as your camera, 
lights, laptop, and cellphone.
✓
✓Clear out any reusable media. If your camera records video to SD or CF 
cards, format them (otherwise known as erasing them) and clear some 
space.
✓
✓Double‐check your equipment. Quickly test your camera, lights, and 
audio equipment. Ensure that every item works and that you know the 
exact location of all your equipment and accessories.
✓
✓Pack props and costumes. Don’t wait until the morning of the shoot to 
pack everything!
✓
✓Make copies of the script. While you’re at it, take the extra step of 
­labeling every copy individually for your cast and crew.
✓
✓Stock up on petty cash. Withdraw cash from a nearby ATM so that you 
can purchase food, water, extra batteries, last‐minute cab rides, coffee, 
and any other necessities you may need for the shoot. This is where the 
receipt envelope comes in handy.

142
Part II: Making Good Videos and Not Making Bad Videos 
✓
✓Confirm call times. Call, text, or email all participants to ensure that 
they know when and where to show up.
✓
✓Check the weather forecast. Make sure that the atmospheric conditions 
will not affect you adversely. Pay attention to rain forecasts, storm warn-
ings, and make sure you’re prepared for all conditions.
While you’re charging batteries and anxiously awaiting the last of the cast to 
confirm their call times, turn your attention to another vital element of the 
shoot: the shoot sack. Simply fill a gym bag, large backpack, or (our favorite) 
rolling suitcase with the following essential items, and then you can take this 
film‐production survival kit with you anywhere:
✓
✓Batteries and chargers: Store any batteries that aren’t already installed 
in your equipment, and add any extra AA or AAA batteries you may need.
✓
✓Extension cords: Bring along at least two heavy‐duty cords.
✓
✓Power strips: Bring two of these also.
✓
✓Gaffer tape: This heavy-duty tape has a million uses.
✓
✓Lights and mic: As long as these items fit into your shoot sack, add them.
✓
✓Screwdriver and knife: You never know when you’ll need to tighten the 
tripod plate or cut some rope on set.
✓
✓Gloves: The lights may get too hot to touch after being on for a while.
✓
✓Tripod and monopod: Even if these items don’t fit in the bag, pack them 
as part of your preparation ritual. (A monopod is a one legged tripod, 
typically used for shots requiring a more dynamic feel, or a quick paced 
live event or production.)
✓
✓Laptop (and optional external hard drive): These devices are likely to 
have separate cases, but you should make them part of your prepara-
tion ritual, too. You may need them for transferring footage among cards 
on the set.
Take a moment to look over everything you’ve packed. You’ve created a pro-
duction notebook, double‐checked equipment, charged batteries, confirmed 
schedules and locations with your cast and crew, and made for yourself the 
world’s best shoot sack. You’re ready to go, so take a deep breath, and get a 
good night’s sleep.
Arriving on set
Whatever call time you’ve given your cast, plan for your crew to be on‐site at 
least one hour earlier. Even if the hour is more time than you need to set up, 
having enough time to get ready without feeling pressured starts the shoot-
ing day on the right note. Besides, you’ll quickly fill that hour.

143

 Chapter 7: Putting It All Together to Capture Some Video 
Every shoot requires these three distinct spaces:
✓
✓Shooting area: This area should be ready for use when you arrive on the 
set so that you can begin setting up camera angles and lighting. Be polite 
but firm about claiming your space, and remove any items that don’t 
belong in the scene.
✓
✓Equipment area: Designate a quiet corner in which to store equipment, 
props, and costumes and to serve as a charging station for batteries.
✓
✓Green room: Give your cast and crew (and perhaps certain equipment) 
a place to relax — and stay out of the way — between takes. In an office 
space, for example, a conference room is the perfect spot, but you may 
have to take whatever you can get. The green room is also a good spot 
for setting up an alcove to serve coffee and water to your cast and crew.
After you determine the boundaries of your space, you can set up the following 
equipment in it:
✓
✓Charging station: Plug in a power strip, and set up your camera’s bat-
tery charger (and the chargers for light batteries, if you’re using them).
✓
✓Data station: Plug in your laptop and external hard drive so that you can 
periodically “dump” footage.
✓
✓Camera, tripod, lights: After you unpack these items, you can start 
­setting up the first shot. Check the natural ambient light in the room by 
looking at the camera’s viewfinder to see what adjustments you need to 
make. Experiment to find the camera angles that work best.
Planning a realistic shooting schedule
When you watch a short scene in a video, you may believe that creating 
the scene was a simple task. And if the video is no good, it probably was a 
simple task. Virtually anyone can flip a switch on a camera and ask an actor 
to speak. Finding a unique and memorable way to shoot a scene takes time to 
prepare and pull off — even for simple scenes — and this amount of time has 
to be figured into your shooting schedule.
Two forces are at work in every film and video shoot: the creative need to 
make the production special, and the technical need to complete the produc-
tion as quickly and inexpensively as possible and still look good. These needs 
are equally important. If you can’t complete the shoot on schedule, you’ll 
have nothing to show, but if you rush to complete the video with no regard 
for creativity, what’s the point in even making it?
We would love to boil down the standard schedule to the simple mathe­
matical formula “x number of shots divided by y setup time equals z,”  

144
Part II: Making Good Videos and Not Making Bad Videos 
but scheduling simply doesn’t work that way. (Besides, math is not our 
forté.) To come up with a realistic estimate of the time you need, consider 
these ­factors:
✓
✓The number of shots your production needs
✓
✓The length of each shot
✓
✓The amount of time you need to realistically set up, shoot several takes, 
and break down the set
Shooting usually takes longer (often, much longer) than most people antici-
pate. The technical setup can be complex, and actors may need a few takes 
to nail their performances. If you’re working with non‐actors, you may want 
to add an extra 30 to 60 minutes to their scenes, just in case it takes longer to 
get the performance you need.
These guidelines can help streamline the shoot:
✓
✓Spend no more than 5 minutes setting up a shot. A 5‐minute limit keeps 
the setup process lean and mean. You should have enough time to 
adjust the lights and position the camera. Obviously, some shots require 
more time than others, but when you’re working on a deadline, time 
magically passes faster than normal.
✓
✓Shoot scenes out of order. Few film productions shoot scenes in the 
exact order they’ll appear in the finished product. Usually, the shooting 
schedule is created by determining which resources (such as locations, 
actors, props, or lighting) can be reused in other scenes. Those scenes 
are then filmed consecutively.
By shooting out of order, you can schedule certain actors’ scenes one 
after the other and then release the actors when they finish, leaving 
fewer people to manage as the day progresses.
✓
✓Shoot “big” scenes first. If you’re shooting a crowd scene or another 
type of complicated shot, get it out of the way early in the day. Your cast 
and crew will be more energized, and you’ll have that worry out of the 
way as the day wears on and pressure grows to wrap up the shoot.
✓
✓Experiment. Once, anyway. If you want (or a cast member wants) to try 
a radical idea, just to see whether it works, do it. But shoot the scene as 
specified in the script, too. Don’t get too creative at the expense of the 
clock.
✓
✓Cut freely. If you find that your schedule is overstuffed, pull out the 
script and storyboard and cut some shots. Not scenes, mind you, just 
shots. We generally encourage you to shoot scenes with multiple shots 
(called coverage, which we address later in this chapter, in the section 
“Determining the best shot”). If time is running out, be prepared to 
change the shot list.

145

 Chapter 7: Putting It All Together to Capture Some Video 
✓
✓The fewer people who are on the set, the faster you can shoot. The 
more people who watch a scene, the more your shoot can turn into a 
party rather than a production. When something strange or funny hap-
pens on the set (and suddenly everyone is laughing or chatting and no 
longer working), you have to play the role of benign dictator. Firmly, but 
with a friendly smile, ask all bystanders to clear out — pronto. When 
you have a camera, you wield power!
Practicing good habits before a shot
Your camera is set up, your actors are in place, and all eyes are on you. 
You’re ready for the first take of the day. What do you say and when do you 
say it? You can actually set up a smooth, productive workflow by using a 
series of commands to move through each shot within a scene.
Draw from this handy list of words and phrases to communicate with your 
cast and crew — and to help them to communicate with you:
✓
✓“Quiet on the set.” When you let everyone know that you’re about to 
“roll camera,” the only audible sound should come from whatever is hap-
pening in front of the camera. Side conversations, coughing, and mobile 
phones can all spoil a take, and you should have zero tolerance for them.
✓
✓“Roll camera.” When your actors and crew are set, cue the camera 
person to start shooting.
✓
✓“Camera rolling.” The camera person should reply to “Roll camera”  
with this phrase after shooting begins. If you’re doing the shooting,  
just say “Camera rolling.”
✓
✓“Sound rolling.” Someone who is listening to sound separately on 
­headphones says this phrase to indicate that the audio sounds good.
✓
✓“Action.” Finally! This famous cue tells actors to start the scene and 
lets everyone else know to remain quiet. Wait a few seconds after the 
camera and sound are rolling to say it.
✓
✓“Hold.” If a sudden event (such as a passing police siren) interrupts a 
shot, call “Hold” to let everyone know to stop what they’re doing until 
the interruption ends. Then call “Action” again.
✓
✓“Cut.” After a scene ends, wait a few seconds to say this famous cue so 
that the crew continues shooting video and recording sound until the 
moment you say it.
After a few tries, your cast and crew will have the order and rhythm of these 
cues down pat, and your set will quickly sound professional (as long as an 
actor doesn’t announce, “I’ll be in my trailer”).

146
Part II: Making Good Videos and Not Making Bad Videos 
Every take of a shot should have handles on it — a waiting period of a few sec-
onds before you say “Action” and after you say “Cut.” This way, an editor (who 
may be you) who works on the scene in postproduction has a clearly defined 
segment of video to work with. “Action” and “Cut” are also cues for them.
Don’t wait to press the Record button immediately after calling “Action”  
or “Cut” (a mistake typically made by novice filmmakers). This bad habit 
leaves the editor with a scene that is potentially missing its first and last 
seconds — a huge amount of editing time. (Applying a cool transition effect, 
such as a dissolve or a fade‐in, during the editing process is then impossible.) 
Also, actors shouldn’t break character until you say “Cut.” As they finish 
their lines, they should remain in place until you stop shooting.
Maintaining continuity
Continuity is the purely technical requirement of maintaining a consistent 
look and action in every shot, including the background and lighting of the 
set and the actors’ costumes, hair, and (most frequently) movement. A 
mobile phone that’s held in a character’s right hand in one shot and shifts to 
the left hand in the next shot jars the audience out of the moment.
If continuity mistakes happen to you, you’re in good company. Many 
­successful Hollywood movies are full of continuity mistakes. Throughout 
The Wizard of Oz, for example, the length of Judy Garland’s hair and dress 
changes several times. If that type of huge production can slip up, your  
video can, too.
A simple way to keep an eye on actors’ positions between shots is to call 
“Hold!” (refer to the list in the earlier section “Practicing good habits before 
a shot”) and quickly set up for the next shot. You can also show actors an 
earlier take so that they can position themselves to match their own move-
ments. If your characters are drinking from a glass, for example, make the 
liquid level consistent from shot to shot (to prevent the audience from won-
dering how the glass was seemingly refilled). If you’re shooting over several 
days, take a photo of your actors in full costume so that they can match their 
looks for the next day.
Continuity has an additional meaning for actors. It refers to their characters’ 
mental and emotional states from scene to scene. When you’re shooting 
scenes out of order, matching these states from the previous scene can be 
challenging. As a director, it’s your job to keep actors on track from scene 
to scene by reminding them of their previous circumstances, such as where 
they’re coming from, what has just taken place, and where they’re headed. 
You can even draw a timeline for reference. Actors should see the big‐picture 
view of their entire performances and their scene‐to‐scene progress.

 Chapter 7: Putting It All Together to Capture Some Video 
Shooting a Great‐Looking Video
To say that camerawork is a technical process, and not a creative one, is a 
mistake. Film and video are visual media, and the camera resembles a paint-
brush. A huge dose of creativity determines where to place the camera. If you 
look at the camerawork in the films of Alfred Hitchcock, Steven Spielberg, 
or Peter Jackson, for example, you see one stunning memorable image after 
another. This section tells you how to use your camera effectively, from 
choosing angles and specifying movement to framing scenes and capturing 
extraordinary imagery.
To illustrate the techniques we describe in this section, we use the following 
familiar scenario to show how to use the camera and the frame (the rectangu-
lar image you see on a movie, TV, or computer screen) to better tell a story: 
When a young child plays ball in the house and his mother warns him to 
move outside, he ignores her request and instead breaks an expensive vase. 
Oops! The child’s unhappy mother confronts him.
Composing and dividing the screen
Composition is the process of creating a picture that helps to effectively tell a 
story within the camera frame for each shot. Just as a photo needs composi-
tion to possess more visual power, a moving picture needs composition to 
help tell the story more powerfully.
The rule of thirds (a visual arts composition guideline) divides a rectangular 
picture, such as a camera frame, into nine smaller rectangles of equal size — 
three across and three down. Though this concept originated in photography 
and painting, it has its place in film and video production.
Using the rule of thirds to position the subject one‐third of the way from the 
edge of the frame (rather than in the center of the frame) makes the picture 
stronger and more interesting visually.
Because the rule of thirds also applies to framing the background of an 
image, you can create beautiful, symmetrical images in outdoor shoots by 
positioning the ground across the lower third of the frame and positioning 
buildings and trees and the sky in the upper two‐thirds of the frame.
The rule of thirds is an artistic concept related to the way the human brain 
interprets imagery. It simply makes images “look better.”
In the example, you can create tension in the shot (again, because of the way 
the brain processes images) by moving the camera so that the child is one‐
third of the way from the edge of the frame. When the child tosses the ball, 

148
Part II: Making Good Videos and Not Making Bad Videos 
you see the nearby empty living room, full of breakable objects, and you start 
to anticipate the ball flying from his hands and into Aunt Bertha’s expensive 
Ming vase.
If you have a photo camera, try this experiment for capturing a better, 
­stronger image. Frame the subject in the center of the shot, and take a 
­picture. Then move the camera to frame the subject approximately one‐third 
of the way from the edge of the shot, and compare the photos.
Determining the best shot
Your selection of camera angles, or shots, is limited, technically, only by your 
imagination, though you should master the basic principles before trying any 
fancy tricks. This section explains the building‐block shots you see in most 
film and TV productions, and most scenes are built using a combination of 
these shots. In Hollywood, coverage is the practice of shooting a scene from 
various angles.
When you start shooting video, take these types of shots first:
✓
✓Master: The master shot is the foundation of your coverage. It shows 
everything — every important element of your scene. Place the camera 
far enough away to capture all the action, and shoot the entire scene 
from beginning to end. You can always cut back to the master shot to 
remind the audience where the characters are located in relation to 
each other.
✓
✓Medium: The medium shot moves in to show characters (or a single 
character) in an area from roughly just above their waists to a little over 
their heads. The medium shot is commonly used because it shows facial 
detail but still conveys a sense of the bigger picture.
✓
✓Close‐up: In the close‐up shot, the camera moves in tightly on a sub-
ject’s face or on an object, such as the bouncing ball in this section’s 
running example. The close‐up is a powerful tool to show lots of facial 
detail and to build tension and emotion in a scene.
✓
✓Extreme close‐up: In this type of shot, the camera (obviously) moves in 
even more tightly on a subject to show lots of detail. A shot of a char-
acter’s eyes or of fingers drumming on a table or of a doorknob turn-
ing slowly shows an intimate level of detail to drive home a particular 
moment. Though an extreme close‐up is rarely followed by a master 
shot (it’s too much of a leap for viewers to make from small to large), 
you can follow it with a close‐up or a medium shot.
These steps show one way to break down the scene in the bouncing‐ball 
example:

149

 Chapter 7: Putting It All Together to Capture Some Video 
1.	The master shot shows a child tossing a ball in the living room. The shot 
is framed to show the child positioned one‐third of the way from the edge 
of the frame. You can hear his mother say, “Don’t play ball in the house!”
2.	Cut to a medium shot of the child watching the ball move up and down. 
He smirks and says “No problem, Mom.”
3.	In the master shot, the child throws the ball high into the air. Uh‐oh.
4.	A close‐up shot of the child shows him watching the ball begin to 
descend.
5.	Cut to a close‐up of the child’s hand reaching for the ball — and  
missing it.
6.	An extreme close‐up shot shows his eyes widening as you hear a vase 
shatter.
7.	Cut back to a medium shot of the child looking at the floor, horrified.
8.	A close‐up shot of the broken vase shows the ball lying in the middle  
of the glass shards.
9.	Cut to a close‐up of the child as he gulps and his mother scolds him.
10.	Return to the master shot, as the child turns to face his mother and 
blurts, “It wasn’t my fault!” while she crosses her arms angrily.
These steps break down a scene, moment by moment, into shots that under-
score the emotion of every beat of the scene. We won’t win an award for this 
scene, but we can probably make an audience feel tension (and make them 
laugh at the child’s excuse). That’s how you “paint” a scene with your camera 
and the camera frame.
In any scene you shoot, keep your shots smooth and steady. In the age of 
point‐and‐shoot video cameras, people have a tendency to start the camera 
rolling and then point it at various characters in a scene, in one long take. 
They often attempt this all‐over‐the‐map approach with a shaky hand so that 
the scene ends up looking like an earthquake just occurred. Unless you’re 
shooting The Great Quake of the 21st Century, we recommend that you simply 
place the camera on a tripod. If your scene involves a lot of camera move-
ment, shoot it with a smooth, steady hand.
Moving and grooving the camera
Anyone can put a camera on a tripod, turn it on, and shoot the scene before 
them in a single shot. But this style amounts to simply recording a scene, which 
is boring, rather than true directing, which uses the different shot choices that 
are available to tell a story, controls what an audience is seeing from moment to 
moment, and moves the camera to achieve great‐looking images.

150
Part II: Making Good Videos and Not Making Bad Videos 
You can choose from a few basic camera moves:
✓
✓Pan: Simply move the camera from side to side, along the horizon. If the 
child in the bouncing‐ball example enters a room, spots the ball on a 
table, and walks to it, you can follow his movement by panning from the 
doorway to the table.
✓
✓Tilt: Move the camera laterally, along a vertical plane. In the example, 
you would tilt the camera from the child’s hand grabbing the ball and 
then lifting it to his chest as he looks at it mischievously.
✓
✓Track: In this tricky‐but‐fun shot, you simply follow the subject 
throughout the scene. You can track the child from an outdoor start-
ing point, keep him at a distance, and then follow him right up to the 
ball. The tracking shot, which is used in lots of Hollywood films, can 
be an ­effective way to show off. (A famous 3‐minute tracking shot from 
Martin Scorsese’s Goodfellas follows Ray Liotta’s character through the 
­hallways and kitchen of a nightclub.)
You can pan and tilt by either using a handheld camera or placing it on a 
tripod or monopod. Tracking shots are typically accomplished with the use 
of a steadicam or dolly. To add a slick touch to your video, work out a brief 
tracking shot of one character.
Matching your eyelines
An eyeline is the invisible line leading from the eyes of a character on camera 
to a person or an object that the character is looking at off camera. The cut 
that you make to the next shot showing the off‐camera person or object must 
be placed within the shot where the brain would expect it to be. If a charac-
ter is looking upward, for example, you should then cut to the object that 
the viewer sees, placed above the camera. If the character’s eyeline and the 
object’s position don’t match (if they look down at an object that you then 
see hanging over their heads, for example), the audience becomes disori-
ented and disconnects from the scene. The eyeline makes a subtle but crucial 
difference when cutting between two people who are speaking to each other 
within a scene.
In this section, we explain how to add two medium shots to the bouncing‐ball 
example. One shows the mother furrowing her brow at her child, and the 
other shows the child lowering his head after being scolded. For these two 
shots, you can shoot the actors in this scene separately or even on differ-
ent days because they don’t appear in the frame together in this particular 
moment. Above all else, you have to match the eyelines of the mother and 
her child.

151

 Chapter 7: Putting It All Together to Capture Some Video 
Suppose that the child looks up at his mother towering over him and then 
you cut to a shot of her face. Rather than look downward at him, as your 
brain expects, she instead looks directly across the shot at an object at the 
height of her eyes. Your brain would automatically connect the two shots 
to make you wonder what she’s looking at (another person in the room, for 
example). Because she’s the taller of the two, her eyes should aim downward 
at him, at a spot that’s as close to the same spot in the frame where his eyes 
were looking up in the previous shot.
A character who looks off‐screen at another character should be looking at 
the spot where the other character would stand. If you reverse the shot (to 
show the other character), the second character’s eyes should be focused on 
the spot where the first character is positioned. Any well‐made TV show or 
film has examples of shooting proper eyelines. In one with incorrect eyelines, 
you cannot determine where characters are oriented in a scene.
To ensure matching eyelines, position an off‐screen actor behind the camera 
so that the on‐screen actor can look at that person and deliver her lines. 
Encourage actors to stand immediately off‐camera, even when they aren’t 
part of a shot, to help make eyelines match. It also helps a cast member with 
her performance to speak directly to her scene partner, even if the partner is 
standing off camera.
Following the 180‐degree rule
The 180‐degree rule is a critical guideline in how scenes are shot in a film or 
video. When you watch a movie in which two characters are speaking and the 
cut moves from one to the other, you’re likely seeing the 180‐degree rule in 
action: It establishes the spatial relationship between characters or objects 
within a scene, specifically when the scene cuts between shots of them. Most 
viewers aren’t aware of the 180‐degree rule when it’s followed; but when it 
isn’t, viewers can become disoriented or confused about where characters 
are standing or sitting in relation to each other.
To use the 180‐degree rule to construct a scene, imagine a straight line run-
ning down the middle of the characters, as shown in Figure 7-1. To avoid 
disorienting the audience, choose one side of the 180‐degree line on which to 
shoot all your shots, and don’t cross the line. Understanding this concept can 
be confusing, so we will walk you through an example.
Rather than show each actor individually, such as in the bouncing‐ball exam-
ple, you can use the popular Hollywood technique known as the over‐the 
shoulder shot. For a shot of the child in the example looking up at his mother, 
you place the camera over her left shoulder and aim it at the child so that 
part of her left shoulder and hair frame the shot of his face.

152
Part II: Making Good Videos and Not Making Bad Videos 
Cut back to the mother looking crossly at her child. If you place the camera 
over his right shoulder, pointing up at the mother, who is towering over him, 
his right shoulder and hair frame the shot of his mother looking cross. Then 
you cut back to the first shot over her left shoulder, of the child looking 
remorseful.
In the example, we stay on one side of the line, over the mother’s left shoul-
der and over the child’s right shoulder. If we had moved from her left to his 
left, we would have crossed the line and confused the audience, because 
they wouldn’t know where the characters were standing in relation to each 
other.
In another example, you see a shot of a train flying down the tracks, moving 
from right to left in the frame. Cut to a person waiting for the train, and then 
cut back to the same train, except that now you’ve crossed the tracks and 
you’re shooting from an angle on the other side. The train is now moving 
from left to right! Your brain believes that it’s another train, heading directly 
for the first train, and suddenly you’ve made a disaster film!
The 180‐degree rule has one exception: If the camera is moving, you’re 
allowed to cross the imaginary line if the shot itself moves across it. Then the 
audience will understand why you switch sides in the next shot.
Shooting an interview
Shooting an interview is a fairly easy task. In the world of marketing videos, 
you’ll likely shoot a lot of sit‐down interviews.

 Chapter 7: Putting It All Together to Capture Some Video 
Follow these steps to shoot a simple but professional‐looking interview:
1.	Set up two chairs. One is for the subject, and one is for the interviewer 
(who may be you). The subject should be seated.
2.	Set up your camera on a tripod. Place the tripod to the side of your 
chair, facing your subject.
3.	Frame the subject. Use a medium shot, moving upward from mid‐torso 
or slightly closer.
4.	Light and mic your subject. This topic is covered in Chapter 6.
5.	Have your subject look at you, not at the camera. Looking into a 
camera lens tends to make a person self‐conscious. You can conduct 
an excellent interview that has a conversational flow by having the sub-
ject speak to you. The camera serves to record the conversation you’re 
having. (The most common camera style on YouTube is to have the sub-
ject speak directly into the camera; we recommend this style only if the 
subject can appear natural.)
A person who is verbose the first time he answers an interview question may 
want to answer a question a second time, after having the opportunity to find 
the best wording for his answer. To avoid being heard asking the interview 
questions, you can edit yourself out, by having the subject rephrase your 
question within the answer, as in this example:
You: “How long have you been the president of Smith Industries?”
The subject: “I have been president of Smith Industries for 40 years.”
Encourage your subject to answer as simply as possible, always including  
the crux of the question within the answer, and you’ll have a professional‐
looking, easy‐to‐edit interview that you can replicate with different subjects.
Shooting extra footage and B‐roll
Watch any political thriller (especially one with Harrison Ford or Morgan 
Freeman as the commander in chief) and you’re bound to see an impressive 
shot of the White House while ominous music plays in the background. Did 
you know that the shot wasn’t filmed by the movie’s director? It may not 
have even been filmed by anyone working on the movie. That shot of the 
White House is a classic example of an establishing shot (that shows you 
where you are) and is a member of the family of B‐roll footage.
B‐roll footage is supplementary, traditionally used to accompany a documen-
tary or TV news story. For example, in an interview with the president of  

154
Part II: Making Good Videos and Not Making Bad Videos 
Smith Industries, during an especially dry segment, you can cut away to show 
the Smith Industries factory floor or show workers picketing the president’s 
office.
You can shoot and use B‐roll to support the main storyline in your video. 
Film anything related to your business, or to the storyline of your video,  
and intercut it (cut back and forth) with your main (or A) storyline.
B‐roll can be shot quickly, using your camera’s internal mic. Shoot lots of 
footage until you find shots that blend well with the main part of your video. 
You can also shoot establishing shots of various buildings or areas where 
your scenes take place.
Capturing the perfect take —  
several times
Whether you’re shooting a scripted scene or an interview, you probably 
won’t get the perfect take the first time every time. Someone may flub a line 
or slam a door off‐screen, a dog may begin barking, or a sudden rainstorm 
may interrupt a romantic picnic scene. Or, the “magic” just isn’t happening 
right away and your actors need a few takes to warm up and discover the 
best way to play the scene. In any case, if you have to do it again, shrug your 
shoulders, yell “Cut,” and prepare everyone for another take.
Shooting multiple takes can be demanding because actors have to repeatedly 
speak the same lines and hit the same marks. However many takes you shoot 
of a scene, the acting always has to seem fresh. One way to achieve this goal 
is to let the actors vary their line readings slightly on every take. You can 
always revert to an earlier take if you don’t like the revised version.
After you capture an excellent take, shoot a safety take immediately after-
ward. This extra version ensures that your editor has two good takes to work 
with, just in case something goes wrong with the footage during the post­
production process.
Working with Voice
When you shoot video, it’s easy to get caught up in the visual aspect of each 
shot. However, you must also keep audio quality in mind at all times. See 
Chapter 6 for details about audio, but aside from mics and audio capturing 
devices, you have another tool in your audio arsenal that is provided for 
free by your actors: their voices. Whether you’re dealing with seasoned or 

155

 Chapter 7: Putting It All Together to Capture Some Video 
first‐time actors, you can get the most from the mouths of your talent in a 
few ways, as described in the following sections.
Practicing diction and dialects
William Shakespeare, no slouch himself in producing one or two quality 
scripts, had some good advice 500 years ago for video actors: to speak their 
lines “trippingly on the tongue.” In other words, he suggested good diction, or 
the proper enunciation of the words in a script. Your actors need to practice 
diction in order to get your message across. Even unscripted interviewees 
can stand to use good diction.
Diction is all about several distinct vocal areas:
✓
✓Volume: Actors should speak loudly enough for the mic while still 
sounding believable. (Our experience tells us that nearly every actor  
can stand to be a bit louder.)
✓
✓Clarity: Determine whether actors are speaking unclearly, such as 
­pronouncing words incorrectly or dropping sounds off the ends of their 
words. Most of us do this when we’re speaking casually. Make sure 
that actors practice pronouncing the trickier words in your script. No 
one should sound like Mary Poppins, but every word should be clearly 
understood.
✓
✓Pace: Make sure that your actors aren’t speaking too quickly or too 
slowly. Many people tend to rush through sentences when they’re 
excited or stressed — which is exactly how actors will feel with 
the camera on them. Take time to rehearse the scene, and find an 
­appropriate speaking pace.
✓
✓Vocal energy: Not to be confused with volume, vocal energy refers to 
the quality of an actor’s voice, such as whether he’s speaking with pas-
sion and animation or in a tired monotone. Because the camera is fairly 
close, actors don’t have to speak the way they would to a crowded 
auditorium, though their voices should possess energy and make the 
dialogue sound authentic and believable.
Everyone speaks in a dialect, or regional accent. There’s no universal, 
­unaccented way to speak. A dialect can add huge amounts of believability 
and variety to a performance and truly drive home the content of your video. 
A dialect that’s too strong, however, especially if an actor seems to be strug-
gling with the lines in a script, can also detract the audience from engaging in 
your video. The key is to ensure that the words in your script are striking the 
audience as clearly and effectively as you need.

156
Part II: Making Good Videos and Not Making Bad Videos 
The power of the pause
People who speak to large groups or, worse, in front of a camera tend to 
barrel through their lines in an effort to reach the end of the script as soon 
as possible and stop speaking. Because they simply forget to pause, they’re 
missing out on the most powerful audio tool available.
A well‐placed pause carries a lot of weight. For a brief moment, suspense 
hangs in the air. The words you’ve just heard settle for a second, and then 
you hear more. A pause used by actors can add drama, dimension, and 
­structure to the words they’re saying.
Work with actors to find two or three spots to pause the dialogue. Don’t 
overdo it, and don’t make a pause last forever. Make sure that it’s real, how-
ever, where the speaker can take a breath and feel in control of her words, 
not the other way around.
Managing crowd audio
Keep this Hollywood secret between you and us (and everyone else read-
ing this book). Watch a crowd scene in a movie or TV show — a restaurant 
or bar scene is perfect. Notice how you hear the main characters speaking 
clearly while the crowd around them is quiet. How do the creators do that? 
Yes, mics are being used, but the bigger trick is that the crowd is completely 
silent during filming. All their talking is pantomimed, and the sounds are later 
added by editing.
Hollywood uses stock crowd sounds, which is why (if you’re paying attention 
to these sort of things) you sometimes hear the same voices on different  
TV shows. When you’re shooting a crowd scene, stock crowd sounds are 
available for different group sizes, and you can find the one that best suits 
your scene.
You can also direct the crowd to simply speak more quietly than normal. 
Depending on how many people you’re working with, this suggestion can be 
an easy solution or a tough one to manage. The key is to get a great sound 
level from your main actors while retaining a believable amount of back-
ground noise. Remind crowd members that they’re adding to the authenticity 
of a scene and offer to throw a party after the shoot is complete.

ven the simplest modern editing tools are powerful applications. If you 
want to edit your own videos, expect to spend some time learning how 
to use your tool of choice. If you’ve ever worked with Word or PowerPoint, for 
example (from the Microsoft Office suite), you may recall that you spent some 
time learning how to use that program. Let’s be honest: Most people discover 
new features and new ways of doing things in these programs all the time.
To edit a video, you need to get familiar with the software and some founda-
tional editing techniques. In this chapter, we describe both of these and  
how to turn your footage into a polished video.
Choosing Editing Software
Editing programs are sophisticated tools for content creation with a lot of 
powerful features. The best way to approach them is to first read about the 
basics, or you may take a class to get started. Then just dive in and complete 
a project. Most people become comfortable using their chosen editing tool 
during the first few days.
The first item to consider when choosing editing software is your existing 
operating system on your computer. In other words, if you use Windows,  
you need editing software for Windows; if you use a Mac, you need editing 
software for the Mac.
Chapter 8

Mac tools
The selection of editing tools on the Mac is somewhat smaller than on the PC, 
but that isn’t necessarily bad news, because of the high quality of Mac-based 
programs:
✓
✓Apple itself provides two industry-leading editing applications:
• iMovie: Entry level
• Final Cut Pro: Professional level
✓
✓Adobe, the market leader in creative software, offers a full line of tools 
for the Mac.
iMovie
If you have a Mac, you already have iMovie. This powerful little editing 
­application comes preinstalled on every new Mac. We highly recommend  
this for your YouTube video editing because it is very easy to use.
Upgrade to the latest version of iMovie, if you can. If your version is older, 
you can buy the current edition online at the Apple App Store. It’s more than 
worth the price.
iMovie covers virtually everything you need for normal video editing, and it 
comes supplied with helpful templates for impressive titles and neat visual 
effects.
The main drawback of iMovie compared to professional-grade applications 
is that it can deal with only a single video track and a single track of back-
ground sound. You can use background music and a voice-over narration 
track at the same time, but using more elements isn’t possible. This restric-
tion isn’t a big deal for most videos, though it can be limiting on ambitious 
productions.
A good companion product for iMovie is Garage Band, which comes prein-
stalled on Macs as well. You can finish up your visual edits in iMovie and 
export right into Garage Band. It lets you put together soundtracks for your 
videos and provides some useful background music tracks that you can use 
immediately. Be sure to check on the copyright for any existing or canned 
background music tracks you pull from Garage band. Your video monetiza-
tion may be affected when using tracks with existing copyrights.
Final Cut Pro
Final Cut Pro is the professional-grade editing application from Apple  
that covers most capabilities that an editor needs. It’s used by many 

159

 Chapter 8: Fixing It in Post: The Edit
­professionals, including such legendary editors as Walter Murch (The Godfather, 
Apocalypse Now).
Final Cut Pro is a major upgrade from iMovie. Its user interface is quite simi-
lar to iMovie, and old iMovie projects can be imported directly. It offers much 
more flexibility, such as unlimited video and audio tracks, many more visual 
effects, a feature-rich footage management system, and sophisticated audio 
editing.
If you’re going with Apple editing programs, start with iMovie and then 
upgrade to Final Cut Pro X when you run into limitations.
Adobe Premiere
Apple’s primary competitor on the Mac platform is Adobe and its Premiere 
editing programs — note the plural form here. You have a choice between 
two Premiere products:
✓
✓Premiere Elements: The entry-level Adobe editing program, Premiere 
Elements, an application designed for consumers and business  
users.
The advantages of using Premiere Elements over the free Apple iMovie 
program are that it:
• Supports multiple video and audio tracks
• The additional power is useful if you edit more complex projects, 
such as footage shot with multiple cameras simultaneously
• Offers a more sophisticated way to organize large collections of 
raw footage
• Provides more flexibility in dealing with photos and other images
✓
✓Premiere Pro: The Adobe program for professional video editors, 
Premiere Pro offers all the same professional features of Final Cut Pro. 
Some editors like it better because:
• Its user interface is optimized for a professional editor’s typical 
workflow.
• It has broader support for the file formats that professional and 
consumer-level cameras produce. It allows you to work with files 
natively — no transcoding needed.
• It integrates the workflow as a one-stop — you can take a project 
entirely through the Adobe Creative Suite, including color  
correction, motion graphics, and audio finishing.

160
Part II: Making Good Videos and Not Making Bad Videos 
Windows tools
Dozens of editing programs of all sophistication levels are available on the 
Windows PC platform. The following five sections describe a few of the most 
popular.
Windows Movie Maker
Much like iMovie on the Mac, the free editing tool Windows Movie Maker 
covers basic video editing needs. It lets you quickly import footage and  
pictures, arrange and trim clips, add music, and apply basic visual effects 
and titles. If your Windows PC doesn’t have Movie Maker installed, you can 
download Movie Maker for free at this Microsoft website: http://windows. 
microsoft.com.
Movie Maker is a helpful way to get your feet wet with video editing. Most 
people working on advanced video projects quickly run into its limitations, 
such as having only one background audio track, one video track, and limited 
visual effects. Furthermore, its particular way of handling the start and stop 
points of clips isn’t ideal for precision editing.
Adobe Premiere
The people behind Photoshop also provide their video editing program, 
Premiere, for Windows PCs. The Premiere version you need depends on  
your goals.
Premiere can work with multiple video and audio tracks, which allows for 
the easy arrangement of footage and complex narrative structures. That’s an 
important advantage over the free Windows Movie Maker.
Here are your Premiere choices:
✓
✓Premiere Elements: A strong editing application for consumers and 
business users, Premiere Elements improves upon Windows Movie 
Maker by packing in a ton of features that let you edit your videos in a 
much more sophisticated way. It organizes footage more intelligently, it 
can stabilize shaky footage, and it comes supplied with a huge selection 
of transitions and visual effects. It can even handle green-screen effects 
and animated graphics.
✓
✓Premiere Pro: We discuss Premiere Pro, Premiere Element’s larger  
sibling, in the earlier Mac section “Premiere Pro.” The Windows  
version is largely identical, and it’s a highly respected tool for 
­professionals.

161

 Chapter 8: Fixing It in Post: The Edit
Sony Vegas Movie Studio
Sony’s aggressively priced Vegas Movie Studio editing software is an interest-
ing alternative to Adobe products, positioned between Premiere Elements 
and Premiere Pro. It offers features that are comparable to some of the best 
editing software on the market. If you’re looking for the most bang for your 
buck, Vegas is worth a serious look.
Pinnacle Studio
This product is significantly more sophisticated than Premiere Elements. 
It boasts unlimited video and audio tracks, animated titles, broad format 
support, sophisticated audio editing, and a ton of professional-level special 
effects.
The price is reasonable, and the product even comes with a green-screen 
backdrop and software for Blue-ray disc authoring. Pinnacle Studio is a good 
choice for people who want to do frequent, sophisticated editing and are 
­willing to endure a bit of a learning curve.
CyberLink PowerDirector
Another tool competing with Premiere Elements is CyberLink PowerDirector, 
priced similarly to Premiere Elements. The PowerDirector feature set is com-
parable to other products in this market segment, but its performance tends 
to be somewhat faster, and its user interface is nice and clean.
The drawback to using PowerDirector is its somewhat weaker media organi-
zation functionality, which can be a problem for people with a lot of footage. 
But thanks to its speed, it’s one of the best programs on the market.
Where to Get Started with Editing
At first, the task of editing video may seem confusing and somewhat scary. 
The process has many technical expressions to understand, many software 
features to use, and many concepts to grasp. The best way to deal with this 
complexity is to simply dive in.
Attempting a test project
After some preparation, there’s no better way to get up to speed in video 
editing than to simply try it. Select a topic for a test project, and try to put 

162
Part II: Making Good Videos and Not Making Bad Videos 
together a simple video about it. This gives you firsthand experience with the 
editing software before you try to create your first real video.
If you have some video footage from your last vacation or family event, that’s 
a good place to start, because your family can then enjoy a watchable, well-
edited video. Or if you want to dive right into marketing-oriented videos, 
shoot some quick footage about your business and use existing pictures.
Avoid overthinking your first project. Your goal isn’t to produce a master-
work of cinematic storytelling — it’s to explore the features of your editing 
tool and experience the basic process of editing.
Your first project should follow these guidelines because you find these 
­elements in most serious video projects:
✓
✓Import, view, and organize multiple clips of raw video footage.
✓
✓Use pictures and graphical elements, such as a logo, in your video.
✓
✓Experiment with different title styles.
✓
✓Try variations of background music to see how music can influence the 
mood of a video.
✓
✓Explore basic visual effects, such as transitions between scenes.
✓
✓Record a voice-over narration track.
Make a short video first, maybe a couple of minutes long. Don’t forget to 
share the video with a friend for feedback; you’ll be surprised at what you 
notice when you’re sharing a project.
Reading books and watching videos
As a starting point for editing video, you may 
want to read a book about your editing software 
of choice. A book can help you understand the 
basic concepts that your editing application 
is built on, and it can provide a quick overview 
of all its features. In addition, good books have 
step-by-step guides for more advanced features.
Several books in the For Dummies series explain 
how to use some of the most popular editing 
programs, and we highly recommend them.
Apple and Adobe products generally have the 
biggest selection of good instructional books 
available, though some of the less popular edit-
ing applications aren’t covered as thoroughly. 
Before you decide on a particular editing pro-
gram, look at what kind of information and sup-
port are available for it. Don’t forget to check 
out YouTube for editing tutorials, there are 
many channels dedicated to this topic.

 Chapter 8: Fixing It in Post: The Edit
Handling file formats, resolution,  
and conversion
Video used to be supplied on magnetic tape. Though it was available in sev-
eral formats, such as VHS and Betacam, figuring out what you had was fairly 
simple. The digital world has brought about a dramatic cost reduction (video 
professionals no longer have to own a VCR for every cassette format), but 
it also brought about more complexity. Dozens of different digital video file 
­formats are now used in the industry.
Fortunately, modern editing programs handle much of this mess for you. 
Almost all editing tools handle the most common dozen or so formats. But if 
you work with video footage shot by someone else, you still may occasion-
ally encounter an exotic format. That’s why you should understand the basic 
principles of using video file formats.
Sorting out the file formats
Digital video produces extremely large files. These files would be even larger 
if not for the heavy compression that’s applied to the original video signal. 
Video compression uses some fancy calculations to squeeze high-quality 
moving pictures and sound into files that are as small as possible. To give 
you an idea, your video files would be between 5 and 50 times larger without 
compression.
The compression process is managed by a coder/decoder, or codec. This 
piece of software squeezes the video into a smaller digital format when it’s 
recorded and decompresses it again when it’s being watched. Because a 
codec typically isn’t compatible with other codecs, you can’t watch a video 
recorded via codec A on a device that supports only codec B.
Some of the most popular video codecs are
✓
✓Apple ProRes
✓
✓Digital Video (DV)
✓
✓H.264 (a more modern version of MPEG-4)
✓
✓MPEG-4
✓
✓Windows Media (WMV)
The data generated by these codecs is stored in a file that contains additional 
information, such as the title and description of the video, synchronization 
markers that sync audio and video, subtitles, and more.

164
Part II: Making Good Videos and Not Making Bad Videos 
You see these file formats, or container formats, on your PC or Mac. These 
container formats and their file endings are the most popular:
✓
✓Flash Video (.flv)
✓
✓MP4 (.mp4)
✓
✓MPEG (.mpg)
✓
✓QuickTime (.mov)
✓
✓Windows Media (.avi)
Don’t let yourself become confused: Container files can contain several dif-
ferent codecs. For example, a QuickTime file can contain a video in Apple 
ProRes, DV, or H.264 format. Each format can be matched with a number of 
audio codec formats, such as AAC, AIFF, or MP3.
In other words, if someone asks you for the format of your video files and 
you respond “AVI” or “MOV,” the person doesn’t know much more about 
the format than before he asked. Any container file type can contain any of 
dozens of different codecs.
The only way to determine what you have is to open the video file in a  
player application, such as QuickTime Player or Windows Media Player. 
Then use the menu command that shows you details about the file. In 
QuickTime, it’s Window ➪ Show Movie Inspector. In Windows Media Player, 
it’s File ➪ Properties.
Converting formats
Modern editing programs can work with most widely used video file formats. 
However, if you use footage in a more exotic format — material provided by 
someone else, for example — you may encounter roadblocks. Your editing 
application may not be able to work with unusual formats directly.
In this case, convert these files to a more standard format by using a video 
conversion program. Your editing program may even have one already.
You can find many free or inexpensive conversion programs. If you have to 
deal with an exotic video file format, the time savings are definitely worth the 
price. On Windows PCs, AVS Video Converter (www.avsmedia.com/AVS- 
Video-Converter.aspx) and Any Video Converter Pro (www.any-video- 
converter.com/products/for_video) are good choices. On the Mac,

Editing Your Video
Editing is the art of telling a story using video footage, pictures, and sound. 
Editing is often called the invisible art because the best editing isn’t noticed 
by the viewer.
A well-edited video brings the viewer into the story, none of the elements of 
the actual edit should be seen unless your goal is to show off a digital effect 
on the footage.
Even when you plan a video shoot meticulously, surprises and changes take 
place during editing. An idea that seems outstanding at first may not work in 
the final video. On the other hand, unexpected moments of excellence may 
show up in your footage to give your video an extra boost.
Editing can make or break your video. This section tells you how to approach 
this essential process. We use the Apple iMovie editing software in the 
­examples, though other editing programs work similarly.
Recognizing videos that need no editing
Some types of video can stand on their own 
with no significant amount of editing. You can 
prepare the following types of videos for pub-
lishing with a minimal amount of trimming:
✓
✓Talking head: A talking-head video shows 
a person simply speaking into the camera 
to make an announcement or to explain a 
concept or an issue. This technique isn’t 
terribly interesting visually, but it can be 
effective if the speaker has interesting 
material. If your talent can complete the 
statement in one take, you typically don’t 
even need to edit.
✓
✓Speech and presentation: Sometimes, you 
can tape a representative of your company 
or an outside expert presenting a relevant 
topic at an event. You can typically use this 
footage without editing if the presentation 
is brief. But remember that presentations 
on video tend to be less interesting than 
the ones you see in person.
✓
✓Simple product demonstrations: A sales-
person, or even a CEO, may be able to 
give a killer product demonstration in only 
one take. Sometimes, a charismatic sales-
person can be more convincing than a 
slickly produced product video. A compe-
tent camera person can show details of 
the product by zooming in or moving the 
camera.

Logging your footage
After you return from a shooting location, follow these general steps to log 
your footage — the most important step in preparing for the editing process:
1.	Download the footage to your computer. Using a modern camera, this 
process can be completed quickly — just copy the digital video files from 
the camera. Shooting on tape is more time-consuming because you have 
to let the tape run so that your editing program can capture all footage 
digitally. Refer to your camera’s instruction manual to find out how.
2.	Import the footage into your editing program. You may already have 
completed this step if you downloaded the footage using your edit-
ing software, but in other cases, you first have to import the footage 
­manually.
3.	Organize your clips. After you have a bunch of clips that cover different 
parts of your project, start by organizing them to better see what you 
have. Group clips that are related to the same scene. Editing programs 
offer different methods to help, such as folders or “bins” in which you 
can store clips, labels and tags that you can assign to clips, or “events” 
that group related clips.
4.	Watch your footage. Review all your clips to determine what you have. 
If you have a lot of footage, there’s no way to avoid this time-consuming 
step.
5.	Remove unwanted material. If you have clips that are clearly unusable, 
remove them immediately. Don’t delete them — just store them in a 
folder labeled Unusable in your editing program or in your computer’s 
file system. Sometimes a clip that looks unusable now can come in 
handy later.
6.	Take notes. The best way to find your footage quickly during editing is 
to take the time to take notes about every clip. Add a few simple words 
about the content of the clip and its level of quality. Notes can be taken 
in the editing software directly in line with the clip you are referencing 
in most programs.
7.	Mark the best clips. If you have multiple takes of a scene, mark the one 
you think is best. Many editing programs let you use a special Favorites 
functionality, or you can simply make a mark in your notes. Also mark 
B-roll footage that you think looks good, and make notes of the best 
sound bites in interview clips.
Logging your footage may seem like a tedious and time-consuming process, 
but investing time in it pays off later. During editing, you can waste a lot of 
time hunting for a particular clip that you somehow recall but didn’t mark 
properly.

Trimming video clips
Clips often tend to be too long. If you want to use a one-take video, you can 
simply trim off unwanted pieces at the beginning and the end. Fortunately, 
trimming a clip on your computer is fairly easy. The best tool depends on the 
platform you use:
✓
✓On the Mac: Mac users already have QuickTime, a preinstalled media 
player that has basic editing features.
If you want to trim a clip, open the video file in QuickTime, and then 
choose the Edit ➪ Trim command. A timeline showing the entire clip 
appears. Drag the yellow handles to mark the start and end of the clip, 
and then click the Trim button. The resulting clip can be saved or 
exported for use on YouTube or on your website. Figure 8-1 shows how 
to use the trim function in QuickTime.
✓
✓On the PC: PC users can select from a variety of video processing tools 
that provide the trimming function.
An easy way is to use Windows Movie Maker (described earlier in this 
chapter). This simple editing application is free, and it works well if you 
want to trim only a few clips.
In some editing programs you will need to save the trimmed video as a 
new clip, or else you lose the rest of your footage.
Some simple video programs even let you assemble multiple clips into a 
longer clip. For example, QuickTime lets you add a clip to the end of the 
current clip by choosing the Edit➪Add Clip to End command. On a PC, use 
Windows Movie Maker and simply drag and drop the clips to the storyboard. 
This method works for assembling two or three clips, but don’t expect it to 
replace an editing program. As soon as you want to move beyond the simplest 
trimming level (and save time in the end), invest in quality editing ­software.

Making a rough cut
The first step in determining what your video will look like is to make a rough 
cut, in which you line up all the good footage to figure out what works. A 
rough cut is typically much longer than the final product, and it lacks many 
of the elements from the final video, such as titles and visual effects.
To make a rough cut, first log your footage, as explained earlier in this 
­chapter, in the section “Logging your footage.” Then follow these steps:
1.	Review your storyline in sequence.
Tackle every scene separately.
2.	For every scene, find the best takes that you marked during logging.
3.	Mark in and out points for every clip to trim it to the part you want in 
the video.
In and out points are indicators you set on the individual clips that make up 
the scene. An in point is the frame in the clip where you would like to begin 
viewing, an out point is the frame you would like to end the clip with.
Don’t worry much about the exact timing. It comes later. In and out 
points can easily be changed once your clip is in your timeline.
4.	Insert the clip in your editing program’s timeline, in any order you 
want.
Figure 8-2 shows what a rough cut looks like in an editing program.  
It’s just a sequence of clips with no further treatment.
5.	Repeat this process for all scenes to assemble a sequence of clips that 
tells your intended story.
When you watch your rough cut for the first time, it probably looks bumpy, 
overly long, and <ahem> rough. Your goal is simply to figure out how well 
your material works when it’s assembled.


 Chapter 8: Fixing It in Post: The Edit
If it’s possible in your editing program, make a safety copy of your first rough 
cut, of either the timeline or the whole project. This copy may come in handy 
later in the editing process, when you don’t see the forest for all the trees 
and you need a fresh perspective. Making a copy can also be a helpful way 
to find raw clips quickly if you have a lot of footage.
Switching it around
The great thing about modern editing software is that you can experiment by 
moving clips and entire sequences to find the best combination of clips and 
scenes. Be careful: You can easily get lost in the experimentation process. 
First consider why you would want to change something, and if you have a 
truly good reason, do it.
Try some of these suggestions:
✓
✓Use different versions of the same take. Sometimes, a take that you 
think is best when you watch it in isolation no longer works well with 
the rest of the material. If you’re unhappy with a take, try using a differ-
ent take of the same shot to see whether it improves the entire scene.
✓
✓Drop clips or entire scenes. Shorter is typically better in editing. If you 
feel that a particular clip or an entire scene doesn’t add much value to 
the video, drop the clip entirely and watch the video without it. If you 
don’t miss it much, your audience will likely never miss it.
✓
✓Change the order of scenes. Particularly in documentary-style and 
educational videos, scenes don’t necessarily have a natural fixed order. 
You can also change the sequence completely for dramatic effect. For 
example, if you sell lawnmowers and you want to show how your latest 
model performs, you can grab your viewers’ attention if you first show 
the pristine lawn that results from using your product and then demon-
strate how your product was responsible.
Editing is storytelling, but stories don’t always have to flow linearly. Early in 
your video, specify to your audience that you have something interesting to 
say. Learn from the pros: James Bond movies, for example, don’t start with 
a boring explanation of the villain’s latest evil plot, but rather with a high-
octane action scene that grabs the audience’s attention immediately.
Creating cuts
A rough cut is all about finding the right way to tell a story with your video. 
In a written document, the rough cut would be the equivalent of the outline 
and first draft. But there’s more to editing: Just as you would refine a written 

170
Part II: Making Good Videos and Not Making Bad Videos 
text for style and powerful language, refine your video edit with better timing, 
transitions, additional material, and refined cuts.
Working on these elements is the style aspect of video editing, and it makes 
all the difference between a video that’s barely watchable and one that 
excites viewers.
A cut in film editing connects two shots. One shot ends and the next one 
begins, and between them is a cut. The word cut comes from the act of physi-
cally cutting celluloid film in traditional movie editing. Today, in the age of 
digital editing, no cutting is taking place, though the name stuck.
Different types of cuts serve different purposes. Depending on the effect you 
want to achieve, use one of these cut types:
✓
✓Hard: This is the most basic (and by far the most frequently used) type 
of cut. One shot ends, and the next shot starts immediately. Both the 
picture track and the sound track are cut at the same time.
✓
✓Transition: One shot flows into the next with some kind of visual effect. 
The simplest form of transition is the fade, which softly transitions one 
picture to the next. You can use many different types of other transi-
tions, some of which can look quite elaborate; use such transitions with 
caution, since the editing should be felt not seen. You don’t want to 
take away from the viewing experience with star burst transitions every 
minute.
Use transitions to suggest a special relationship between two shots, such 
as a scene transition.
✓
✓Cross fade: This cut type can be used between shots as a softer replace-
ment for hard cuts. If you want to edit to slow music and achieve a 
­flowing pace, the fade is a useful technique.
Figure 8-3 shows what a cross fade between two shots looks like in the 
context of a video. On the left, you can see the timeline with the vertical 
bar that shows which part of the video is playing. On the right, the pre-
view pane shows the two shots that the cross fade combines.
✓
✓Jump: Cut from one view of a person or an object to another one that’s 
only slightly different. You should generally avoid using the jump cut, 
but it can be used occasionally for dramatic effect. It’s also used in inter-
views or talking-head videos to shorten a statement or to add visual vari-
ety. For example, the person who’s speaking can be shown in a medium 
shot while you cut to a slightly tighter shot for the next sentence.
Your rough cut probably uses plain hard cuts exclusively, but as you start refin-
ing your video, you may want to consider using these other types of cuts to 
help advance the story and make the viewing experience more sophisticated.

171

 Chapter 8: Fixing It in Post: The Edit
Many beginners in video editing overuse fancy transitions. Modern editing 
programs are supplied with dozens of different transitions, and spicing up a 
video with all that eye candy is tempting. But don’t forget that most viewers 
are more impressed by good storytelling than by overused special effects. 
A good rule of thumb is that 95 percent of your cuts should be plain hard 
cuts. If you use more than a handful of fades in your video, you’re probably 
­overdoing it.
Filling the gaps with B-roll
The term B-roll describes supplemental footage that can be used to provide 
additional context for the viewer or to fill gaps in the main storyline. We talk 
about how to shoot B-roll in Chapter 7. Having plenty of good B-roll is always 
a good idea because it makes an editor’s life easier.
Use B-roll in your video in these common scenarios:
✓
✓Illustrate what a speaker or an interviewee is saying by showing the 
­subject of the explanation.
✓
✓Add a bit of rhythm and visual polish to an otherwise long and visually 
boring scene.
✓
✓Separate scenes in a scripted video to give the viewer breathing room. 
Many TV series use a few pieces of B-roll between scenes — for example, 
in shots of the city where the story is taking place.
✓
✓Hide cuts in an interview or another continuous scene. If you have only 
one perspective of an interviewee, shortening the interview is difficult. 
Cutting directly looks jumpy and indicates that you’ve omitted material. 
If you cut instead to a piece of B-roll while the interviewee is still talking, 
you can easily mask the cut.
✓
✓Disguise small flaws in the footage. Did the camera suddenly shake in 
the middle of the interview, or did the subject move briefly out of focus? 
No problem — simply use a bit of B-roll to hide the mistake.
Figure 8-3: 
A cross fade 
transition.

172
Part II: Making Good Videos and Not Making Bad Videos 
If you use B-roll only to disguise mistakes, your use of it may become too 
obvious. Use B-roll frequently to make your video more interesting and 
varied. But also avoid using B-roll that has nothing to do with the subject  
and doesn’t add true value.
Polishing Your Video
After you refine your rough cut into a well-timed, well-trimmed video, it’s 
time to apply the final layer of polish. A bit of further fine-tuning makes  
the difference between an acceptable video and one that looks truly 
­professional.
Fine-tuning your edit
Videos can benefit from a number of relatively simple steps you can follow  
to improve certain aspects that viewers may not even consciously  
recognize:
1.	Tweak your cut timing. If a cut seems even a little bit off, spend some 
time fine-tuning it. Even placing a cut a frame or two earlier or later can 
make a difference.
2.	Add music. You may have already worked with some temporary music 
tracks during earlier editing steps, but now is the time to finalize all of 
your audio and background tracks.
3.	Clean up the audio track. Most audio tracks can use some additional 
work. Be sure that the levels are correct and consistent throughout 
the video. Viewers don’t like viewing one scene that’s too loud fol-
lowed immediately by one that’s barely audible. Some editing programs 
have the Normalize Audio function, which optimizes audio levels auto­
matically. Also, hard audio cuts rarely sound good. You can add a dis-
solve transition to the audio track while still applying a hard cut to the 
picture track.
4.	Use color correction. Scenes in general should have a consistent look 
between shots; different video cameras can pick up different color 
influences. The color-correction feature in most editing programs 
will help fix color inconsistencies between shots and scenes. Color-­
correction also lets you give your video a unique and more interesting 
feeling. For instance, bluer light or colder light is used in many crime 
scenes, more yellow or warmer light is typically used in more romantic 
movies.

 Chapter 8: Fixing It in Post: The Edit
Adding bells and whistles
You can add a number of elements, as described in this list, to complete your 
video and make it look more interesting:
✓
✓Titles: A video should have a good title sequence, and editing programs 
offer a variety of different templates. Try a few different styles to see 
what works best. A general rule for any text on screen is viewers should 
be able to read it quickly twice. Be sure your title sequences are not too 
long, viewers on YouTube typically have less patience than viewers in 
the movie theater.
✓
✓Sound effects: A well-placed sound effect can make certain scenes 
much more interesting. We aren’t talking about explosions, alien ray 
gun sounds, or Wilhelm Screams, but about basic background tracks or 
sounds that match the visible content on the screen. Sometimes, your 
original background sounds for a scene aren’t good, and you can use 
canned sounds to replace them. Some editing programs come with small 
libraries of sound effects, and you can find more online.
✓
✓Visual effects: Most editing programs have effect filters that change the 
look of your footage completely. Though you should always use these 
effects sparingly, they may occasionally help make your video look more 
interesting.
You can experiment with bells and whistles in the earlier stages of the ­editing 
process, though you typically should wait until the end of your ­editing 
­process before trying to use them fully. They’re typically time ­consuming 
to apply, and if you change your edit afterward, you may have to do 
­unnecessary work.
Adding Music to Your Video
You may wonder why music is even necessary in a video that isn’t destined 
to sell a pop singer’s latest album. Music determines a lot about the percep-
tion of your message because viewers make split-second, subconscious judg-
ments about the content of your video depending on the type of music you 
choose.
In contrast to music videos, the music in your marketing video is meant to 
complement the message you’re trying to convey. Music isn’t the focus of a 
video — it’s there simply to add color.

174
Part II: Making Good Videos and Not Making Bad Videos 
You must understand the difference between music you pay royalties to 
use and royalty-free music. Most of the music that you hear on the radio or 
buy online is copyrighted and can be used in videos only if you pay royal-
ties to its record label — often an expensive strategy because you must 
pay for every use of a copyrighted music track. Record labels sometimes 
even charge more, depending on how many views your video attracts. And, 
­“borrowing” music and hoping that you won’t get caught is not an option. 
Videos containing copyrighted music can be banned automatically from sites 
such as YouTube.
The easiest way to save time and expense is to use only royalty-free music 
tracks — they’re sold specifically for use in YouTube videos or presenta-
tions. After you pay a fixed price per song, you can usually use it however 
you want, as long as you stay within the boundaries specified by the music 
publisher contract. For example, some royalty-free tracks may be available 
for use in online videos but not in TV commercials. To choose music for your 
video, follow these steps:
1.	Determine which emotion you want to convey. For example, you may 
want viewers to feel happy, sad, or uplifted — or neutral.
2.	Watch a rough edit of your video several times. Or, if you’re still in the 
planning stage, simply review the video’s storyline in your mind. Do you 
need fast, aggressive cuts? Are your graphics clean and simple, or more 
elaborate and flowery? The music you choose must match the video’s 
storyline, aesthetic value, and editing style.
3.	Choose an appropriate genre. You may want to use a rock-and-roll 
track or a country track, for example, or perhaps electronic music more 
closely suits your style.
4.	Set the mood. The mood of the music you choose has to match the emo-
tion you want to convey. To judge, determine how the music makes you 
feel when you listen to it. If it matches the emotion you chose in Step 1, 
you’re on the right track.
5.	Control the pace of the video by controlling its musical tempo. A 
song’s tempo refers to its speed or pace. The pace of the video also has 
to fit the emotion you’re trying to convey and the overall storyline. For 
example, should viewers be relaxed or breathless after watching your 
video? Choose a tempo between these two extremes that creates the 
impression you want.
6.	Search for a song. After you choose the genre, mood, and tempo of 
the music in your video, search for a song. (You’ll find out more about 
music to purchase in the following sections. Or, if you’re truly talented, 
compose one yourself.) You’ll likely stick with royalty-free music.
7.	Drop in the music. After you finish creating the video, you can drop the 
music into your editing timeline and edit the piece to mirror the pacing 
of the footage.

175

 Chapter 8: Fixing It in Post: The Edit
Adding built-in music in  
video editing tools
Most of the video editing software programs we describe in this chapter 
­contain royalty-free song tracks, such as in these two examples:
✓
✓Apple Final Cut Pro: Has over 1,000 royalty-free sound effects and music 
tracks
✓
✓Sony Vegas Movie Studio: Contains 400 royalty-free music soundtracks
Some of the songs you can use from video editing software are so popular 
and overused (because they’re free) that you risk triggering unwanted reac-
tions from your audience. For example, a friend once complained to us that 
his video reminded him of a late-night TV ad containing questionable con-
tent. When we watched it, we found that his video editor had used a free, 
built-in music track that’s often chosen by these low-cost advertisers.
Incorporating stock music libraries
If you have only a small budget and you want to sound different from the 
standard music libraries that come with many editing programs, you can  
find a good selection of royalty-free stock music to download online.  
This list describes some options that we recommend:
✓
✓PremiumBeat (www.premiumbeat.com): Has a great selection of great 
audio tracks and sound effects. They work closely with composers 
from around the world. They are very selective so it is easier to search 
through libraries for what you need.
✓
✓Audiojungle (www.audiojungle.com): It’s less expensive than 
Shockwave-Sound (www.shockwave-sound.com), the major player in 
the stock music and sound effects derby, but its selection isn’t as large. 
Songs cost between $10 and $20 apiece.
✓
✓Footage Firm (www.footagefirm.com): This site sells inexpensive DVD 
song compilations. A disc usually has only a few good songs, but they’re 
usually worth the price — approximately $10 per disc, including shipping.
If you want to use an iconic song such as Nirvana’s “Smells Like Teen Spirit” 
and you have a limited budget or limited time to secure the rights, you can 
often find inexpensive but similar-sounding songs on stock music sites.
If you can’t find a song that matches the length of your video, don’t worry: 
Viewers don’t focus on songs — songs simply enhance the pacing and mood. 
Therefore, a repetitive song, or looping a song to fit the length of the video, 
usually works well.

176
Part II: Making Good Videos and Not Making Bad Videos 
Putting music in your video
After you have selected your music, it’s time to insert it in your video.
The mechanical aspect of this task is easy to complete. Follow these steps in 
your editing software:
1.	Gather into one folder on your computer all the music files you want 
to use.
Using one folder helps you find files easily and helps you back them up 
after editing. If you store your music on a CD, import the necessary tracks 
to your computer first by using a program such as iTunes.
2.	Import the music files into your video editing software.
Most editing programs can process MP3 files and most other commonly 
used music file formats.
3.	Add an additional audio track to your editing project.
Certain simpler programs, such as iMovie, have predetermined tracks for 
background music.
4.	Drag and drop your music piece to the new audio track. Then shift its 
position until it fits the timing you want.
5.	Watch the part of the video that now has background music in 
­context. Fine-tune the timing of the music, if necessary.
If you aren’t sure which piece of music will work best with your video, simply 
import into your editing program multiple music tracks that you’re consider-
ing. Drop one after the other on the audio timeline, watching the video with 
every piece of music, to quickly find which track you like best.
Adding emotional impact
The main purpose of your music selection is to enhance the emotional 
impact of your video. Even the specific way in which you use music in your 
edit affects the video’s emotional impact. Try these simple tricks to give your 
music more emotional impact:
✓
✓Work with the volume level. Music in a video shouldn’t always play at 
the same volume level. It should be softer and drop into the background 
whenever it supports dialogue or a voice-over narration, and it should 
be fairly loud when it stands on its own and drives home an emotional 
point. Most editing programs let you change the volume of a particular 
track over time. Dramatically increasing the volume of the music track in 
a key video scene adds quite a powerful effect — Hollywood movies and 
TV shows do it all the time.

177

 Chapter 8: Fixing It in Post: The Edit
✓
✓Determine the proper timing. A music track doesn’t have to start  
at its beginning when you insert it in your video. Match the music to  
the video’s visual content. Most musical selections have hooks —  
particularly remarkable and recognizable parts. For example, the hook 
of Beethoven’s Fifth Symphony is the famous “Ta-ta-ta-daaa.” Try to 
match musical hooks with important moments in the video.
Cutting your video to music
When you have a piece of music that matches well the emotional purpose of 
your video, fine-tune your edit to maximize the effect of the music. For exam-
ple, you can extend a scene slightly to fit the most dramatic moment with a 
remarkable hook in the music.
Most editing programs let you lock your music tracks to avoid their being 
affected by other changes in your video. Follow these steps:
1.	Put your musical piece on its own audio track.
2.	Time the music so that the music begins exactly where you want.
3.	Lock the music track.
Most editing programs use a tiny padlock icon to indicate locking.
4.	Watch the video and determine how to adapt the timing to best fit the 
music.
For example, shorten or stretch certain shots slightly.
5.	Make your editing changes.
6.	Unlock the audio track.
Precisely matching cuts in a video with beats in the music can create quite a 
pleasing effect because the picture and music then seem to move in perfect 
harmony. Avoid overdoing it, though, because an exact match can quickly 
bore viewers. The best approach is to match a couple of cuts with the music 
and then purposely skip the next few cuts before matching again. Alternating 
makes the final product less predictable and maintains viewer interest.
Cutting your music to video
You may not want to alter an edit just to better fit the music. In this case,  
cut the music to match your video instead.
Another important reason to cut music is to omit parts that may not fit 
well with the visual side of your video. For example, the piece of music 

178
Part II: Making Good Videos and Not Making Bad Videos 
you selected may have a bridge section that has a slightly different mood 
from the rest of the track, which can be distracting in a video. Eliminate the 
unwanted section by cutting precisely at the end of the previous part and at 
the end of the bridge section.
Almost all video editing programs let you cut audio tracks also, which is good 
enough for completing the basic editing of your music tracks, such as cutting 
off unwanted intros or endings to the millisecond.
An alternative is to cut your music tracks in advance by using an audio 
­program such as Garage Band or Pro Tools. They let you edit audio precisely, 
and they provide a wealth of audio effects to help you enhance your music 
tracks for video use.
Adding Voiceover and Sound Effects
Many videos used for marketing employ voiceover narration, using offscreen 
narrators to tell viewers about the company’s products or services. Most 
video editing programs have a voice-over recording feature, which is useful 
if you’re recording your own voice directly into your computer.
To record your own voiceover, invest in a mid-quality external microphone. 
You can buy good USB microphones well below $100 — a worthy investment 
because your voice-over tracks will sound much better.
As with voice-over narration, you can also add sound effects. Most noises 
you hear in a typical Hollywood movie aren’t recorded live on the set, but are 
added later in the process. Recording sounds on location is tricky and often 
creates mediocre results.
So, sound effects are most often added during the editing process. This list 
describes the major kinds of sound effects you can use:
✓
✓Background or ambient: Continuous background noises that suggest 
where the video scene is taking place work well to establish location. 
For example, a busy city scene needs vehicle noises, lots of footsteps, 
and the occasional siren. A beach scene needs wind and water sounds. 
These background sounds are easy to apply.
If you can, record a few minutes of ambient sound on your video set to 
capture the audio character of the location.
✓
✓Hard: This type of sound effect accompanies visible events onscreen, 
such as slamming doors or passing vehicles. This type is a little more 
difficult to apply because they must be synced precisely to the picture, 
though most editing programs let you do it quite easily.


 Chapter 8: Fixing It in Post: The Edit
Most advanced video-editing programs are supplied with a small library of 
basic sound effects that you can easily use in your edits. Just add an audio 
track, drag in the sound recording you want, and shift the track around until 
it fits the scene.
You can find additional sound effects online from stock sound libraries such 
as Shockwave-Sound.com (www.shockwave-sound.com) and Soundsnap 
(www.soundsnap.com). Most of these sounds have specific descriptions, 
such as “Cars passing by at 25 mph on a somewhat busy street,” so you can 
likely find something suitable.
Exporting the Final Version
When you finally finish editing, you export the video from your editing 
­program so that you can use it later.
Typically, you should export multiple versions of a video because you can 
use the final product in different ways:
✓
✓Export an archive master copy with the highest possible quality that 
your editing program offers. You can always decrease, but not increase, 
quality (and therefore file size). That’s why you should store a high-­
quality copy, in case you want to create other versions later.
✓
✓Keep a copy just for YouTube purposes: YouTube export settings are 
always changing, so be sure to double check the current best practices 
for settings directly on your YouTube channel upload page. Typically 
the settings look like this:
• Container: mp4
• Audio Codec: AAC-LC
• Video Codec: H.264
• Acceptable and common frame rates: 24, 25, 30, 48, 50, 60 frames 
per second
• Aspect Ratio: YouTube players are all 16:9, a typical resolution is 
720p: 1280x720
Most of the editing programs discussed in this book let you directly upload 
video to your YouTube channel. Uploading this way is convenient, but if you 
notice a mistake after uploading the video, you’ll have to remove it, which 
can be a hassle. Normally, exporting video to your hard drive first is recom-
mended for backing up and test purposes — watch it one last time, and then 
upload it manually to gain more control over every step.

t’s hard to believe that, not that long ago, the whole concept of video 
production and distribution was the domain of specialized professionals. 
In those bad old days, the entire process was not only difficult but often also 
extremely expensive. Securing broader distribution rights required ­lawyers, 
which added another level of complexity and expense, all in the name of 
keeping great video work out of the domain of creative people and many 
business.
Fortunately, all that has changed. As computers, cameras, and applications 
became more powerful — and affordable and a lot less complex — creating a 
fabulous video could be accomplished relatively easily. So much for the miles 
of film and expensive production facilities that used to be standard operat-
ing procedure — now you could shoot an outstanding video on your mobile 
phone and then edit it on your laptop in the local coffee shop. The digital 
video revolution had begun.
Then along came YouTube, and suddenly you could get your video immedi-
ately distributed to, and in front of, millions of viewers without the aggrava-
tion of contracts, lawyers, and distribution partners. Overnight, you could 
become your own Hollywood studio. YouTube made it powerful and easy 
by making simplified, video self-publishing a reality. It eliminated nearly all 
the crazy video file format issues and removed the complicated conversion 
issues so that you could simply upload a file and people could watch it nearly 
everywhere without any special software.
Today, video is simpler than ever. But don’t be deceived by the simplicity: 
YouTube gives you powerful tools to do great things with video uploading 

182

and distribution. So start off simple and hit the ground running, but be sure 
to leverage YouTube’s additional distribution capabilities as your skills and 
your channel mature.
Preparing Your Channel for Uploads
Chapters 7 and 8 do a great job of guiding you through the process of 
­capturing and editing great videos for your channel. If you’ve made your 
way through those chapters, you may be thinking that you’re just a few 
clicks away from uploading a video, and you’d be absolutely right to think 
so. That’s the great part about YouTube — it makes it easy to get your 
videos online. However, as Chapter 5 so forcefully puts it, being successful 
on YouTube requires a bit of planning, so don’t rush. The time you invest 
now getting your channel ready for uploads not only makes your future work 
easier but also gives your channel much better watch time, subscription 
growth, and audience engagement.
Checking your YouTube account hygiene
YouTube certainly started a revolution in online video by making it amazingly 
easy to upload and share content. But there’s something more: YouTube is 
also a community that abides by certain guidelines to maintain order and 
civility. These rules are divided into two categories:
✓
✓Community guidelines: YouTube is great place to share your work and 
do business, but just like your physical community, there are certain 
rules governing behavior — rules usually having something to do with 
the type of content you can upload. Just keep in mind that viewers can 
(and do) use the Watch page to flag what they consider to be community 
violations. Viewers don’t have the last word here — YouTube reviewers 
will review the flag to make sure that the complaint is ­legitimate — but 
violations could lead to warnings, known as a ­community guidelines 
strike, being issued against your YouTube account.
✓
✓Copyright policies: Individuals or business are strongly encouraged to 
upload content that they own or have legal ownership of. This includes 
both audio and visual content. Uploading content you have no legal 
ownership of — or content where the legalities of ownership are  
murky — can be cause for more strikes against your account. Three 
copyright strikes will result in account termination (Copyright issues 
can be complicated; for a closer look at YouTube’s take on copyright 
issues, check out www.youtube.com/yt/copyright. For our take on 
copyright, check out Chapter 16.)

183

 Chapter 9: Preparing for Upload Day
Copyright violations can be flagged one of two ways:
• Copyright strike: A strike is a legal request by a copyright holder 
directing YouTube to take down the video and remove it from your 
channel.
• Content ID claim: YouTube will grant some users access to an 
automated copyright-verification system and database known as 
Content ID. Claims in Content ID don’t result in a strike, because 
the system gives the copyright owner some control over what to 
do with violations, such as monetization or blocking.
Simply removing videos with copyright strikes or other violations (if 
YouTube hasn’t done so automatically) doesn’t make the strike or claim 
go away. You can wait for the claim to expire in six months, get the owner 
to retract the claim, or dispute it with a counter notification. Be diligent 
in resolving the issue with YouTube or the claimant.
Your success at following these rules defines your account status in 
YouTube:
✓
✓Good Standing: This is where you want to be: no community guidelines 
strikes; no copyright strikes; and no more than one video blocked by a 
Content ID copyright claim.
✓
✓Bad Standing: If you have violations under community or copyright 
guidelines, you may be subject to channel customization restrictions 
as well as upload suspensions and limitations. Monetization and your 
YouTube Partner Program standing may be at risk, too. Though many 
issues can be resolved or appealed, continued problems while in bad 
standing can lead to the removal of your YouTube channel. (For more on 
monetization issues and the YouTube Partner Program, see Chapter 14.)
✓
✓Terminated: In particular circumstances, YouTube will terminate 
your channel and prevent you from establishing new ones. Repeated 
breaches of community guidelines or continued copyright infringement 
will get you booted off YouTube.
Checking your YouTube account status is simple:
1.	In your web browser, go to www.youtube.com.
2.	Log in to your YouTube account.
3.	Click the logged-in icon and then choose Creator Studio from the 
drop-down menu that appears.
The Creator Studio main menu should appear on the left side of the 
browser.

184
Part II: Making Good Videos and Not Making Bad Videos 
4.	Click the Channel section of the Creator Studio menu.
By default, it should go directly to the Status and Features submenu.
You can also bypass these steps by going directly to www.youtube.com/ 
features.
5.	Select Status and Features, if it’s not already showing.
Doing so loads your account status on the right.
6.	Make sure that both the Community Guidelines and Copyright lines 
show a green status circle and the words Good Standing.
The top of Figure 9-1 shows an account in good standing.
If your account is not in good standing, for either community guidelines or 
copyright violations, you probably received an email explaining why. You can 
get more detail on the status of your channel when you follow these steps:
1.	In your web browser, go to www.youtube.com.
2.	Log in to your YouTube account.
3.	Click the logged-in icon and then choose Creator Studio from the 
drop-down menu that appears.
The Creator Studio main menu should appear on the left side of the 
browser.

4.	Click the Video Manager section of the Creator Studio menu.
If your account is in bad standing, you see selections that aren’t normally 
shown, such as Copyright Notices.
5.	If visible, click the Copyright Notices section of the Video Manager 
section.
You can also bypass these steps by going directly to www.youtube. 
com/my_videos_copyright.
If your account is in good standing but you do have some copyright notices, 
you’ll see those little notices next to your videos in the Videos section as well 
as in the Copyright Notices section. They are little blue hyperlinks next to the 
Edit button that generally say Matched Third Party content.
Maximizing the options for accounts  
in good standing
An account in good standing is much more than a merit badge and a nice pat 
on the back. It’s the gateway to maximizing what you can do on your channel. 
With a channel in good standing, you’re free to
✓
✓Customize your channel.
✓
✓Apply for the YouTube Partner Program. (More about that program in 
Chapter 2.)
✓
✓Control who can view your uploaded videos.
✓
✓Post videos longer than 15 minutes.
✓
✓Create custom video thumbnails to help get more views to watch.
✓
✓Extend your video licensing rights with Creative Commons. (More on 
Creative Commons and other copyright issues in Chapter 16.)
✓
✓Stream live events.
✓
✓Provide annotation links to external sites.
✓
✓Monetize your channel.
✓
✓Perform minor video edits on your YouTube channel.
✓
✓Provide a branded introduction to your video or an overlay branding 
watermark.
✓
✓Appeal Content ID disputes.
You want your YouTube account to be in good standing. Be sure to review 
the community guidelines and copyright policies every few months.

Enabling channel features
Now that your account is in good standing, be sure to check the rest of the 
fields on your channel’s Status and Features page. Checking which YouTube 
features are enabled is straightforward:
1.	Log in to your YouTube account.
2.	Click the logged-in icon and then choose Creator Studio from the  
pull-down menu that appears.
The Creator Studio main menu should appear on the left side of the 
browser.
3.	Click the Channel section of the Creator Studio menu.
4.	Select Status and Features.
Doing so displays your account status on the right, as spelled out earlier 
in this section. Now cast your eye a bit below your account statuses and 
you’ll see your YouTube features. More specifically, you’ll see three  
distinct fields for each feature:
	
1.	The feature itself: This lists the name of the YouTube feature — one 
of the many built-in extensions to YouTube channel functional-
ity that allows for greater channel control, monetization, and 
enhanced viewing features.
	
2.	The feature status: Your current ability to use these features. Each 
feature status is binary: Either you’ve enabled it or you haven’t.
	
3.	The feature description: Details on what the feature does.
5.	Click to enable the feature you want to add to your channel.
For example, if you want ads on your channel, click the Enable button on 
the Monetization feature.
Tending to Video SEO Matters
In Chapter 5, we introduce the concept of discoverability — helping YouTube 
get your content in front of the right viewers through recommendations and 
search so they watch your content, rather than somebody else’s. Though 
watch time is a critical part of YouTube’s recommendation engine, a video’s 
metadata — its title, description, and tags — plays an important role in 
­getting the video found in the first place.
Video search engine optimization (video SEO, for short) is all about tell-
ing YouTube something about your video. For traditional web SEO, search 

187

 Chapter 9: Preparing for Upload Day
engines such as Google, Bing, and Yahoo! would analyze the content on your 
site, figure out what was important, and then offer up your content to the 
most relevant searchers. Over time, these search engines factored in ele-
ments such as links, sharing, and clicks to determine how popular particular 
content ended up being on the web.
YouTube doesn’t work like web SEO because it can’t (yet) watch your con-
tent to determine what your video is about, so it has to rely on your metadata 
and how the community reacts by way of watch time, social media shares, 
and embedded links for the video on external sites.
It’s a lot easier to get your video SEO house in order up front, rather than 
deal with it after you’ve published all your content.
So what exactly do we mean by optimization in search engine optimization? 
Optimization is about intelligently and systematically putting together 
description words so that
✓
✓YouTube understands what your content is about so it can better offer 
your video to the most appropriate searchers.
✓
✓Search engines such as Google, Bing, and Yahoo! understand your 
content and are thus in a position to add your videos to search engine 
results pages along with web content.
✓
✓Viewers are more likely to click on your content versus other search 
results offered.
These are the goals you want to achieve. The next few sections spell out how 
you can achieve them.
A bit later in this chapter, you’ll find out where and when to enter informa-
tion about titles, descriptions, and other important metadata associated 
with your video. It’s important to understand the principles behind all these 
before you actually upload.
Titles
The video title is the most important piece of metadata that you’ll create. As 
important as the title is to YouTube and the major search engines, you have 
to also ensure that it works for people. The trouble is that it can’t look as 
though you’re trying too hard to grab folks’ attention. Fancy click-bait titles, 
such as “You won’t believe what happens to the 12 kittens in this video,” may 
generate more clicks, but the search engines won’t bite and they will likely 
ignore your content. Also avoid breathless wording such as “most epic” or 
“blow your mind.”

188
Part II: Making Good Videos and Not Making Bad Videos 
You need to strike a balance between attracting humans and attracting 
search engines when you create and optimize a title for a video.
Your title appears in many places:
✓
✓On the Watch page under the actual video
✓
✓In a YouTube search
✓
✓In Google, Bing, and Yahoo! searches
✓
✓As part of a playlist
✓
✓Under YouTube recommended videos
Selecting a title isn’t complicated, but you must be somewhat methodical.
Only 100 characters of your video’s title will show up in search results on  
a desktop computer, while some mobile devices will only show about 40,  
so you have to make the characters count. Suggested videos show about  
75 characters maximum, with mobile being less. You can create a longer 
title, but it will be visible only on the Watch page. The goal of video SEO is to 
get viewers to the video in the first place. Being too short with the title is no 
good either because it may impair search algorithm matching.
Use the following approach to picking a title:
1.	Determine the keywords.
These are the important words that people will search for. Make sure 
they’re part of your video content, as well as in the other metadata associ-
ated with your video, such as the Tag and Description fields. If you work 
for Acme Electric and you’re marketing the new Z500 convection oven, 
your keywords would include Acme Electric, Z500, and convection oven.
2.	Add a descriptive phrase to the title.
Your keywords alone may not be enough. Determine why your view-
ers would be searching for your product or your video. They may want 
installation instructions or product reviews, for example. Terms such as 
how to install and product review will aid you in both search and views.
3.	Move branding keywords to the end of the title.
Viewers will search for your brands, but they need to see the descriptive 
information first.
4.	If your video is part of a series, include an episode number at the end 
of your title.
Even if your videos are part of a playlist, your viewers may end up search-
ing separately, so make it easy and logical for them to find another episode.

189

 Chapter 9: Preparing for Upload Day
Be sure to include your title keywords in the tag and description metadata.
Before you even upload anything to YouTube, it’s good practice to rename 
the video file to a title that accurately represents its content. YouTube will 
keep the original reference file title on the asset no matter how many times 
you end up changing the title.
Descriptions
You’ll want to make good use of the 5,000-character field that YouTube pro-
vides you for describing your video. It’s a great place to add details about not 
only your video but also your channel, along with links for other videos, sub-
scriptions, other channels, and web assets. In other words, it’s a goldmine for 
both metadata and user guidance. (Figure 9-2 demonstrates what we mean.) 
The viewers who care about your video will read the description, so make it 
worth their while.
Going long on shortlinks
Chances are, you’ve seen some rather inter-
esting web names like bit.ly, owl.ly, 
goo.gl, pix.tv, and is.gd as you’ve 
made your way around the web. Often, 
these web names are combined with what 
appears to be a random string of characters 
to produce something that looks like this: 
http://bit.ly/1xUu7KB. Like any 
Internet address, this link can be clicked to take 
you anywhere on the web, including YouTube. 
You can even click one of these funny-looking 
strings to get to the Watch page of a specific 
video.
So what is this funky address? It’s called 
a shortlink, and it replaces really long web 
addresses to preserve valuable space on 
sites such as Twitter and YouTube. How does 
this work? A shortlink has an associated 
target link. For example, in our link example, 
http://bit.ly/1xUu7KB, actually points 
to http://www.pixability.com. When 
clicking a shortlink, users end up at the associ-
ated target. Shortlinks are formally known as 
shortened Uniform Resource Locators (URLs). 
URL is a fancy way of referring to a web 
address.
Many free services are available for link short-
ening. One of the most popular ones is bit.ly, and 
you can quickly sign up for it at www.bit.ly. 
In seconds, you’ll be creating shortlinks to your 
heart’s content.
But there’s much more to shortlinks than meets 
the eye. Services such as bit.ly track clicks so 
that you can see which shortlinks are the most 
popular. You can actually have different short-
links point to the same target address so that 
you can test which tweets work better or which 
web pages may be most interesting.
The top YouTube channel managers use link 
shorteners extensively in YouTube descrip-
tions, channel descriptions, and social media.

190
Part II: Making Good Videos and Not Making Bad Videos 
The video description should
✓
✓Explain in greater detail what your video and your channel are about.
✓
✓Extend the viewer’s experience by providing additional detail around 
what is shown in the video. For example, if you have a video on cook-
ing, the description field would be a great place to include a copy of the 
recipe.
✓
✓Trigger the viewer to do something. That could include watching 
another video, making a purchase, supporting your cause, and more.
✓
✓Entice people to view. The first couple of paragraphs of the descrip-
tion show up in search results, so you have to write compelling — and 
­relevant — content so that the user somehow takes the next step of 
clicking and viewing. That’s also true on the Watch page, where the  
first couple of sentences appear under the video, compelling the viewer 
(you hope!) to watch.
✓
✓Aid in discovery. A great description can include hundreds of keywords 
that will help with search. Be sure to use ones that are relevant to the 
video.
The description field isn’t the place for a transcript of your video. YouTube 
has a special spot for that; we cover that spot a bit later in this chapter.
Include at the beginning of the description a shortlink that leads to a web 
page that has something to do with the video. Leading viewers to your home 
Figure 9-2:

constructed

field.

191

 Chapter 9: Preparing for Upload Day
page is generally not advised, because they’re looking for more detailed 
information around the video. Follow the shortlink with a clear and concise 
description, but make it interesting enough that people will feel like watching.
Always consider what information is visible in search results — by being well 
aware of which devices your audience is using to search. The first paragraph 
of the description will show up on a desktop search, whereas no description 
data is currently exposed in a mobile device search.
Two older terms from marketing and advertising are still quite relevant to 
today’s YouTube description field: above the fold and below the fold. When 
people used to receive folded letters or advertisements, they often first looked 
at the top, which was “above the fold.” If the content was compelling, they’d 
read the rest of it “below the fold.” When viewers watch your video, they also 
see the first part of its description. If the description is compelling, they’ll click 
“Show more” and see what’s below the fold. Make what’s above the fold in the 
video description count.
The description field should contain enough shortlinks to answer any ques-
tions your viewers might have about your video, your channel, and your busi-
ness. The About page of your channel should contain links that complement 
your channel. It’s okay to repeat some of these links in the video description 
as well. The shortlinks in the description field can point to
✓
✓Your channel
✓
✓Other videos
✓
✓Social media sites such as Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Pinterest, or 
Instagram
✓
✓A website
✓
✓A landing page
Include only one link in the first paragraph if you want viewers to ultimately 
end up somewhere else. Include all the relevant social links or product page 
links in the second or lower paragraphs of the description.
Don’t create a custom description field for each video. Put together a con-
sistent framework or template that includes some repeatable information 
such as subscription information, social media links, programming schedule, 
and contact information. Customize only the data in your framework that 
relates to the video itself. Keep everything else consistent. Your audience will 
­appreciate the consistent layout of your field as well.
Everyone hates email spam — unsolicited advertisements filled with over-
done and repeated buzzwords. If the description sounds at all “spammy,” 
you’ll provoke a negative reaction. Instead, try to be informative by using a 
lot of descriptive words and appropriate shortlinks.

192
Part II: Making Good Videos and Not Making Bad Videos 
Tags
Tags are special descriptive keywords or short phrases that indicate what 
your video is about. They are used by search engines to help potential view-
ers discover your video. Tags also play an important role in helping YouTube 
make related video recommendations. (Your description field also has key-
words, but tags are used by YouTube to help categorize your video.)
YouTube imposes a limit of 500 characters for the entire Tag field. A tag can 
contain one or more words, but each individual tag cannot be more than  
30 characters long.
Without getting too deep into the math, you may end up with room for 10 to 
30 tags. Use as many as you can.
What’s the best approach to creating tags?
✓
✓Be both specific and broad. Everyone searches differently — some use 
broad terms like oven, whereas others use Acme Electric Z500 convection 
oven. Use both.
✓
✓Choose synonyms. Though you may use oven only in the description 
and video, it’s okay to use the word stove in your tags.
✓
✓Add an action tag. Sure, people may be searching for video about the 
“Acme Electric Z500 convection oven.” Think about terms that are rel-
evant, such as product review, how to install, and how to clean. Pick one 
around the video content.
✓
✓Combine and break up keywords. Language and people are imprecise, 
so take that into account and use both keywords, as in cook top and 
cooktop.
Tags can be modified. Just be sure that they reflect the essence of the 
­content.
Don’t use keywords to mislead or bait viewers. Viewers will realize that 
they’ve been misled and stop viewing. YouTube will detect that the watch 
time is bad and penalize your video and hurt its discoverability.
Thumbnails
Thumbnails are visual snapshots of your video, similar to a poster for a 
movie. They have a tremendous impact on a video’s view rate, so you should 
choose a good one. Thumbnails by default are chosen by YouTube — three 

193

 Chapter 9: Preparing for Upload Day
optional frames from the beginning, middle, and end of your video will be 
provided for every video asset that’s uploaded. You can, however, create 
a custom thumbnail for each video. (See Figure 9-3 for some examples and 
check out the “Adding Custom Thumbnails” section, later in this chapter, 
for the specifics on creating custom thumbnails.) If you do decide to create 
custom thumbnails, it’s best to choose a thumbnail that is illustrative of the 
content in the video. Thumbnails show up in the following areas:
✓
✓Channel page
✓
✓Watch page
✓
✓Playlists
✓
✓Suggested videos
✓
✓Channel guide
✓
✓Subscriber feed
✓
✓YouTube search
✓
✓Web search
✓
✓Mobile display
✓
✓Mobile search
Figure 9-3:

­thumbnails.

194
Part II: Making Good Videos and Not Making Bad Videos 
Keep the following key considerations in mind when deciding on a custom 
thumbnail:
✓
✓Incorporate boldness: You’re competing for viewers, so you need to 
stand out among the many other thumbnails across YouTube and the 
web. Color contrast and image quality and visual layout matter.
✓
✓Add personification: Show the close-up view of faces, if possible. 
Viewers will click on faces more than anything else.
✓
✓Strive for accuracy: The thumbnail has to relate to the content of the 
video. Don’t use the thumbnail as click bait.
Uploading Your Video
There’s always a bit of excitement when you upload one or more videos to 
YouTube. The feeling is similar to what happens when you see the proverbial 
light at the end of the tunnel.
Uploading isn’t the final step to getting your videos available for viewing by 
your growing fan base. You still need to publish an uploaded video in order to 
make it live.
Between uploading and publishing, you have several steps to consider. 
YouTube rewards you with higher search rankings and supplementary video 
recommendations based first and foremost on your channel and on indi-
vidual video watch times. In addition, YouTube looks at characteristics like 
viewer engagement and video sharing rates. Your job in the planning process 
is to identify and coordinate each component so that you’re in a position to 
keep your channel active.
Picking the source
Before you upload, your videos have to live somewhere. They might be on 
your desktop computer, laptop, game console, tablet, or smartphone. What’s 
great about having so many choices for uploading is that you can capture 
and upload content to your channel anytime and anywhere. It’s that easy!
Sign in using the same YouTube account from all your different computers, 
consoles, and mobile devices so that all your videos and channel settings 
stay synchronized.

195

 Chapter 9: Preparing for Upload Day
The web browser interface to YouTube on your laptop or desktop will have 
the most complete set of YouTube capabilities for uploading, optimizing, 
annotating, and publishing. For iOS and Android devices, you can run appli-
cations such as YouTube and YouTube Creator Studio to upload videos and 
manage your channel. iOS even offers an additional application known as 
YouTube Capture. Though these applications are quite powerful and have 
most of the features of the computer-based versions, we focus here on the 
browser-based versions.
Going public about YouTube privacy
New YouTube channel managers and creators often ask, “How do I control 
who can see my videos?” This is controlled by YouTube’s privacy settings, 
which can be found under Creator Studio’s Channel and Video Manager sec-
tions. You need to know and understand the three types of privacy settings 
in YouTube:
✓
✓Public: This is the default setting in YouTube — everyone can view your 
video. Videos set to Public can also show up in all searches.
After you make a video public, you’ve officially published it. It will show 
up in your subscribers’ feeds. Though you can readily change the privacy 
settings on your content, be sensitive to how your audience is using and 
sharing it, because changing settings may suddenly make your content 
unavailable to them with no warning.
✓
✓Private: This setting, the most restrictive one, prevents anyone but 
you from watching the video without your explicit permission. Private 
videos cannot be searched and are invisible on your YouTube channel. 
If your channel is linked to Google+, you can selectively share a private 
video with specific users on Google+ or within your Google+ circles. If 
you or your viewers don’t have a Google+ account, private video cannot 
be shared. Video set to Private cannot show up in search results or be 
viewed by someone even if they have the video URL.
✓
✓Unlisted: Unlisted videos will not show up on your channel or YouTube 
search for viewers. However, anyone with the unlisted video URL can 
watch the video and share it freely anywhere on the web, including web-
sites and on Facebook, Twitter, and other social sites. Unlisted videos 
can be included in playlists as well. A viewer does not need to have a 
Google+ account to view an unlisted video.
Use unlisted content as a way to share special or exclusive content with 
select fans or as part of a limited-time promotion or sale.

Part II: Making Good Videos and Not Making Bad Videos 
✓
✓Scheduled: This special setting is reserved for YouTube partners. It 
automatically sets the video to Private and then changes it to Public on 
the date and time you specify.
Use scheduled privacy settings for channel programming consistency to 
ensure that videos are available at a standard date and time, regardless 
of whether you have access to your YouTube channel.
Your privacy settings also signal to YouTube to begin its magic. When you 
publish a video, YouTube starts assessing your video by using its algo-
rithms to determine what your video is about, how good it is, and where it 
should fall in search results. The best practice is to publish a video when 
your viewers are already on YouTube. Publish the video so that you get 
immediate views on it; this indicates to YouTube that this video is indeed 
hot stuff and that it may be a good candidate for YouTube search and 
­recommendations.
Playlists have privacy settings, too. One of your options during the final 
stages of the upload process is to put your video content into a playlist. 
Chapter 3 covers playlists and their importance on your channel.
Don’t underestimate the power of YouTube playlists, which have become 
increasingly popular because they not only show up in search results but can 
also be customized to greatly enhance the viewing experience.
Uploading to YouTube
You should have no problem finding the Upload button on YouTube — it’s 
on every page! You’ll find it in the top right corner, to the left of the Sign In 
button (if you’re not logged in to YouTube), or to the left of the bell-shaped 
notification icon on the top right of the window (if you are logged in). To 
upload your video content:
1.	Sign in to your YouTube Account.
2.	Click the Upload button.
Doing so brings up the Upload window, shown in Figure 9-4.
3.	Select the video-upload privacy option that you want from the Privacy 
pull-down menu.
The menu is automatically populated with your default privacy setting.  
If you’re happy with the default setting, you don’t have to do a thing; just 
move on to the next step.

 Chapter 9: Preparing for Upload Day
4.	Still in the Upload window, use one of the following three methods to 
select the video file you want to use:
	
1.	Select files to upload: Hover the mouse cursor over the big up-arrow 
button and click it when it turns red. Then use the Look In dialog 
box to navigate to — and then select — the file you want to upload.
	
2.	Drag and drop video files: This one’s as simple as it sounds: Just 
drag a video file to the Upload window and drop it when the ­ 
drag-and-drop video file’s overlay turns green.
	
3.	Import your videos from Google+: This option is to the top right 
of the main Upload window. Start by clicking the Import button 
there, and then select and upload the video file from your Google+ 
account.
5.	If your method requires it, click OK to upload.
Your files are on their way to YouTube.
6.	Get ready to enter your metadata.
In the following section, you’ll learn how to add that title, tags, descrip-
tions, and video thumbnails.
With your videos selected and the upload under way, you’ll be presented 
with a new Video Manager editor screen (Figure 9-5) that shows important 
details about the video. If you’re uploading more than one video, YouTube 
will show you the progress for each upload.

 Chapter 9: Preparing for Upload Day
The Video Manager editor screen that you see during the upload process is 
the same one displayed under the Video Manager section of Creator Studio. 
Having the video manager editor screen here as well allows you to go back 
later and modify the video settings. This includes such tasks as changing the 
video description, tags, and shortlinks.
YouTube easily handles most encoding types. If YouTube is having any prob-
lems with your file, check out https://support.google.com/youtube 
for more information.
Entering information about your video
It doesn’t matter whether your upload is a work in progress or a finished 
product; you can begin adding the metadata at any time. This process is 
known as “video optimization.” In the YouTube world, optimization involves 
dealing with three distinct areas:
✓
✓Basic Info: This is your most important information because it con-
tains all the important fields for video SEO. This would include title, 
­description, and tags.
✓
✓Monetization: Creators who’ve elected to make money from ads being 
placed against their video can use this section to specify what types 
of ad can be shown against the video. Chapter 14 covers this in more 
detail.
✓
✓Advanced Settings: This detailed bucket list contains some esoteric 
information, such as licensing and syndication, along with some 
­important fields around category classification and distribution.
Edit the basic info first. (Refer to Figure 9-5 to see the layout of the Basic Info 
section.) Although it isn’t rocket science, you’ll still want to make sure to 
cross your i’s and dot your t’s. Follow these steps to edit your video’s  
basic info:
1.	Make sure the Basic Info section in the Video Manager editor screen is 
selected.
The active section (refer to Figure 9-5) will have a red underline just 
below the section name. If Basic Info isn’t selected, simply click on the 
name, and the section fields will appear.
2.	Using your newly acquired SEO knowledge, come up with an appro-
priate title for your video and enter it into the Title field.
3.	Enter an SEO-friendly description of your video into the Description 
field.

200
Part II: Making Good Videos and Not Making Bad Videos 
4.	Add SEO-appropriate tags in the Tags field.
YouTube imposes a limit of 500 characters for the entire Tag field. A tag 
can contain one or more words, but each individual tag cannot be more 
than 30 characters long. Depending on how you divvy up your 50 charac-
ters, you can end up with between 10 and 30 tags.
5.	Add your uploaded video to one or more playlists.
This step is optional. You can also create a new playlist here. Simply click 
the + Add To Playlist button and check the playlist you want the video 
included in. (You can check more than one playlist.)
6.	Add video credits.
Remember that this step applies only to partner channels. To give credit 
to your video contributors, click the + Add Role button, choose the title, 
and then add the person. The person will need a channel user name  
or URL.
7.	Set the privacy level or schedule your content for publication.
Click the Privacy button which will show Published, Unlisted, or Private 
depending your default settings. Make changes, if desired. If you want 
to schedule a video so that it is made public at a specific time, choose 
Scheduled after you click the Privacy button and enter the publish date 
and time.
The best practice is to upload all your videos as Private and then schedule 
your content. This saves you from the mistake of publishing a video prema-
turely, often before you’ve had a chance to set up all the metadata. This has 
happened to all of us.
If you’re part of the YouTube partner program, the Info and Settings page will 
have a Monetization tab in addition to the standard Basic Info tab, as shown 
in Figure 9-6. (If you’re not bothering with monetization, you can skip this bit 
and jump right to the Advanced Settings discussion.)
The following steps show you how you can take advantage of monetization 
opportunities for your uploaded video.
1.	Click to select the Monetization section.
Doing so displays the fields in the Monetization section.
2.	Click to select the Monetize with Ads check box.
A menu appears, listing your ad-format options.
3.	Select one or more of the listed ad formats.
Chapter 14 covers monetization and ad formats in greater detail.

 Chapter 9: Preparing for Upload Day
You’ve probably figured out by now that YouTube does have a lot of bells 
and whistles. If you’re just starting out, you don’t need to mess around with 
all the settings, because most operations will work fine. As you advance, 
though, you’ll probably want a bit more control. That’s what the Advanced 
Settings page is for (as shown in Figure 9-7).

Part II: Making Good Videos and Not Making Bad Videos 
To manage the advanced settings, do the following:
1.	Click to select the Advanced Settings section.
Doing so displays the Advanced Settings section fields.
2.	Modify the settings that are important to your video.
Pick and choose from the offerings in this list:
	
1.	Comments: Specify whether you want comments posted automati-
cally or only after approval from the channel owner. Only you can 
decide what is best for your channel. YouTube viewers generally 
prefer to see their comments right away and will take note if you 
require approval.
	You always have the option, as the content owner, of hiding bad 
comments. Users who posted bad comments can come back to 
your video and still see their own comments, but no other viewers 
can see comments you have removed. For more details on com-
ment management, see Chapter 10.
	Keep the Users Can View Ratings for This Video check box 
selected. That lets users see a video’s likes and dislikes — the 
handy thumbs-up and thumbs-down images.
	
2.	License and Rights Ownership: You have ownership rights for what 
you create, but you can let other people use your content, even 
for commercial use. YouTube provides you with some flexibility 
through the standard YouTube license or Creative Commons. (For 
more on copyright and your rights options, check out Chapter 16.)
	
3.	Syndication: If you’re monetizing your videos, you can control 
whether your content is shown everywhere or only on platforms 
that support ads. (Other platforms include mobile applications on 
iOS and Android, as well as gaming consoles such as PlayStation 
and Xbox.)
	
4.	Captions: Captions are important to people with disabilities or to 
others who don’t speak the native language of the video. There’s 
no rule that you have to add captions your videos; it depends on 
whether it’s important to use it to connect with your audience. 
Chapter 10 provides more detail on adding captions.
	If your content has been shown on American television, there may 
be FCC restrictions around the captions, and you’ll need to let 
YouTube know about it.
	
5.	Distribution Options: Embedding allows people to include your 
video in their websites. YouTube will provide you with the HTML 
code for your website. To get the code, click the Share button 

203

 Chapter 9: Preparing for Upload Day
under the video on the Watch Page, and then click the Embed tab. 
Just copy the highlighted HTML and add it to your website. You 
receive credit for all views, likes, and shares. You can also select 
the Notify Subscribers option so that subscribers are notified via 
either their YouTube page or email.
	If you’re releasing 20 videos in one day and you normally only 
release 1 video per week, deselect the Notify Subscribers option. 
Your viewers may see your multiple offerings as spam if they aren’t 
used to this level of activity for your channel.
	
6.	Age Restrictions: Certain content isn’t appropriate for viewers 
under 18, and it’s up to you as the channel owner to make that  
call. Selecting this box helps ensure that a video can only be 
viewed by signed-in viewers who are 18 years of age and older. 
Understand that this may impact monetization if you’re a YouTube 
partner.
	Even if viewing is restricted to audiences 18 and over, community 
guidelines are still in effect.
	
7.	Category: This is the big bucket that you’d put your video into if 
someone asked you to describe your video in the most general of 
terms. Think of it as a “super tag,” and choose a category that best 
suits your video. This helps YouTube categorize your video for its 
search and recommendation algorithms.
	
8.	Video Location: Both your users and YouTube may care where you 
shot your video. Add the location if you think it’s important.
	
9.	Video Language: Set this to the language spoken in the video.
	
10.	Recording Date: Like your location selection, users and YouTube 
may be interested in when your content was shot.
	
11.	3D Video: Some people like 3D content, and YouTube is more 
than happy to accommodate. Using the options in the Advanced 
Settings section, you can disable the 3D function for your video, 
make your video 3D, or upload a 3D video and choose the This 
Video Is Already 3D option. Viewers can view the video in 3D with 
HTML5, but they will need to configure the settings.
	
12.	Video Statistics: Some channel owners don’t mind sharing informa-
tion about views, time watched, subscriptions driven, and video 
shares. It’s always interesting to see whether views grow slowly 
over time or have an initial spike and flatten out. It’s an indication 
of whether your content has long-term value to viewers. Uncheck 
the box if you don’t want to share this information. Doing so won’t 
have any negative impact on either your video or your channel.

204
Part II: Making Good Videos and Not Making Bad Videos 
Setting upload defaults
After you hit your groove and are uploading lots of content, you may tire of 
having to enter the same information over and over again into your upload 
screens or through Video Manager. Fortunately, YouTube allows you to set 
default values on the most common Basic Info, Monetization, and Advanced 
Settings tabs. Just select the Channel section in the Creator Studio menu on 
the left side of the screen and choose the Upload Defaults option. Figure 9-8 
shows the kinds of things you can set as defaults using this option.
Defaults are simply preconfigured values. You can change values either 
during the upload process or through Video Manager.
Figure 9-8: 
The

figuration.
Adding Custom Thumbnails
If your channel is in good standing, you can also provide a custom thumbnail 
instead of one of the default three images that YouTube recommends for 
your video. You can only add a custom thumbnail after your video has been 
uploaded. After the upload is completed, YouTube needs to analyze and 
­process the video before you can add a custom thumbnail.
If you don’t pick the thumbnail, YouTube will kindly do it for you. It’s always 
better to pick it yourself or add a custom one.

205

 Chapter 9: Preparing for Upload Day
The thumbnail is your billboard and will have a big influence on whether 
someone will watch your video.
To add a custom thumbnail to your video:
1.	Log in to your YouTube account.
2.	On your YouTube page, click your channel icon and then choose 
Creator Studio from the menu that appears.
3.	Click the Video Manager section of Creator Studio.
By default, it should go directly to the Videos submenu.
You can also bypass these steps by going to www.youtube.com/ 
my_videos.
4.	Find the video whose thumbnail you want to customize and click the 
Edit button next to it.
You’re presented with page similar to the one shown in Figure 9-9. You’ll 
see much of the information you saw during the upload, but you’ll now 
have more stuff, including detailed video information and a visual repre-
sentation of the thumbnails.
5.	Click on the Custom Thumbnail button shown under the three default 
thumbnails chosen by YouTube.
Choose the thumbnail from an image file.
6.	Click the Save Changes button.
You have a custom thumbnail!

Publishing and Unpublishing Videos
As a YouTube channel manager or content creator, your work may well be 
done when you’ve uploaded your videos and set the metadata. Publishing is 
all about configuring the privacy settings that are most appropriate for your 
users and clicking Save during the upload process or through Video Manager. 
For most channel managers, that means setting the video to Public at a 
­specified time.
Always set your uploads to Private by default to avoid publishing before 
you’ve had the chance to set up metadata, shortlinks, and other parts of the 
video.
Before you publish, YouTube provides several additional features to help 
audience engagement, which we cover in greater detail in Chapter 10.  
You can
✓
✓Edit videos without having to upload again
✓
✓Add audio tracks
✓
✓Add annotations
✓
✓Set up captions and transcripts
After you’ve uploaded a video, you can’t simply replace it with another one 
and use the same video URL. If you need to remove a video from general 
viewing, you have two choices:
✓
✓Unpublish it. Set it to Private and remove any Google+ shares.
✓
✓Delete the video. Remove it from YouTube permanently.
You can only delete videos that you own. To delete a video:
1.	Log in to your YouTube account.
2.	On your YouTube page, click your channel icon and then choose 
Creator Studio from the menu that appears.
3.	Click the Video Manager section of Creator Studio.
By default, it should go directly to the Videos submenu.
You can also bypass these steps by going to www.youtube.com/ 
my_videos.

4.	To delete one video, click the down arrow of the Edit menu to the 
right of thumbnail of the video, and select Delete from the submenu 
that appears.
You’re presented with a confirmation dialog box.
5.	Select Yes if you want to delete, or Cancel if you’ve made a mistake or 
changed your mind.
6.	To delete multiple videos, select one or more check boxes to the left 
of the thumbnails of the videos you want to remove, and then click 
the down arrow on the Actions menu at the top of the Video page and 
select Delete from the menu that appears.
You’re presented (again) with a confirmation dialog box.
7.	Select Yes if you want to delete, or Cancel if you’ve made a mistake or 
changed your mind.

T
 
here’s obviously more to being an excellent channel manager than 
simply uploading a few videos and arranging a playlist or two. To 
truly excel as a channel manager, you have to realize that the core of your 
YouTube channel activities centers on your audience and understanding and 
responding to their needs. Your audience, whether it consists of one person 
or ten million people, is coming to your channel and watching your videos for 
a reason, whether it’s education, entertainment, production information, or 
what-have-you. Building an audience is about catering to the requirements of 
your viewers.
In the “good old days” of television, content was broadcast to a mass of 
viewers who were, for the most part, anonymous. It was never truly clear 
how many people were watching, so companies such as Nielsen provided 
estimates. The only feedback the audience delivered was either watching or 
not watching. As important as it was to retain regular viewers, the television 
networks knew they had to build an audience as well. They did this by put-
ting together good shows and doing lots of advertising. There wasn’t much 
else for the audience to do other than show up and watch shows when the 
networks decided.
Fast-forward to Generation YouTube, where a completely different set of 
audience expectations affect not just viewing patterns but also how view-
ers expect to interact with the stars of the show. In this sense, the YouTube 
world is a two-way street where the audience expects a back-and-forth 
exchange with the content providers. Audiences want an experience on  
their terms.

212
Part III: Growing and Knowing Your Audience 
As a YouTube channel manager, you need to keep that engagement going.  
If you manage a YouTube celebrity, consider yourself the agent. Got a 
brand or business channel? You need to put on your Social Media and Press 
Relations hat. Either way, you need to treat your audience with the same care 
and attention that you do your own content.
Developing a Community
Your audience consists of the people who watch your videos. As you acquire 
bigger audiences, YouTube ranks your channel and content higher, greatly 
aiding discoverability — the process whereby potential viewers are led to 
view your content. It’s that simple, and it’s why audience development is 
vital to your channel strategy. You want that newly acquired audience to go 
to your channel page and experience more of your great content. It’s a good 
pattern to establish.
Deciphering audience evolution
Unless you’re already a Hollywood celebrity, you probably won’t acquire an 
audience overnight. That’s okay. You need to understand that it may take 
years to build the right audience. Also remember that your channel may be 
evolving as well. Where you start on YouTube may not be where you end up. 
Nonetheless, consider the evolution of your audience and how they engage 
with your content. That process should (you hope) play out with these 
­characteristics:
✓
✓Interest: Viewers are interested in something, whether it’s Bruno Mars, 
monster trucks, Indian cooking, radiant floor heating installation, or so 
much more. They search and come to YouTube to find out more about 
what they’re interested in.
✓
✓Curiosity: Impressed by watching one of your videos, your viewers 
then visit your channel to look for more of your stuff. A nicely designed 
­channel and well-organized playlist enhance their experience.
✓
✓Connection: Liking their experience with you and your channel, they 
now want to stay current and be informed of updates. They choose to 
subscribe.
✓
✓Engagement: Your audience wants even more, so they begin to click 
that handy Like button on some of your videos and start offering 
­comments. They may engage with each other on the Comments section 
of your channel.

213

 Chapter 10: Building Your Audience
✓
✓Promotion: They then share your content via Facebook, Twitter, and 
other social media channels with others who share similar interests and 
also become part of your audience.
✓
✓Collaboration: In addition to giving you feedback, your most passionate 
fans may even work with you on content.
Determining what you want your  
audience to do
Though your final goal may be to become a YouTube celebrity and have your 
audience request autographed pictures of you, you have some other home-
work to do before the audience is eating out of your hand. Your audience 
requirements come down to two simple things you want them to do:
✓
✓Watch: You know the importance of watch time on discoverability. Your 
audience needs to view your content regularly — and you need to feed 
them good content regularly.
✓
✓Engage: Having viewers watching content is great, but having them 
actually do something is the frosting on the cake. Engagement is a 
broad topic that you can read about at length in this chapter. It includes 
actions such as liking, commenting, messaging, sharing, and clicking.
Engagement is a two-way street. You need to engage back as well. Holly 
Casto (www.youtube.com/charmandgumption) is the owner and 
designer of Charm & Gumption, an online gift shop for bloggers and 
­creative types. Aside from having an interesting YouTube channel that 
support her business, she does a fine job of communicating with her fans, 
as shown in Figure 10-1.
As you get more viewers, your watch time and engagement level increase. 
That’s why building an audience for your channel can’t be left to chance.
Appreciating the importance  
of community
Communities have developed around common interests for thousands of 
years. From medieval guilds to book groups to political causes, people have 
banded together into communities. As the Internet grew in both reach and 
popularity, virtual communities began to spring up. Suddenly, people could 
be part of large, diverse communities spread over continents and time 
zones.

214
Part III: Growing and Knowing Your Audience 
By bringing the video component to the Internet picture, YouTube made 
these communities more engaged — and more real. You could actually see 
your peers. As a result, YouTube communities quickly displayed characteris-
tics important to both creators and companies: They supported and helped 
their members.
Your community could do much to drive the audience growth for your 
YouTube channel, but for that to happen you need to be a genuine and active 
member of the community.
Over time, many members of your community will take that extra step 
and subscribe to your channel. Subscribers are worth their weight in gold 
because they watch more and engage more. Clearly that’s a good thing, but 
there’s something else: YouTube offers additional features to channels that 
have a high subscriber count, including fan insights and additional mon-
etization options. (Fan insights provide more detail about who is watching 
your content, while the additional monetization options enables more ways 
for you to make money off your channel and content.) As you acquire more 
­subscribers, YouTube gives you more perks.
In the YouTube world, you also hear a lot about fans. Aren’t all subscrib-
ers fans? Not exactly. Your fans will be that subset of your subscribers 
who exhibit considerably higher levels of engagement. Take care of your 
­subscribers, but take special care of your fans.

 Chapter 10: Building Your Audience
Fans and Insights
If your channel has a large number of subscribers, YouTube provides two 
interesting options for analyzing your fans in order to learn a bit more 
about them and (hopefully) communicate with them more effectively. These 
features — the Fans feature and the Insights feature — are found in the 
Community section of Creator Studio. Here’s how they work:
✓
✓Fans: This Fans feature shows your top fans based on their subscriber 
count and their engagement with your channel, including likes, com-
ments, and subscriptions. This feature also highlights recent activity 
and provides options for communicating directly via Google+.
✓
✓Insights: With the Insights feature, you’re able to put your top fans  
into a Google+ circle. With that in place, you can look at demographic 
data — where fans are from, for example — as well as information about 
their recent activity with your channel.
With the Google+ integration, Insights is a great way to have a “private” 
discussion with only your fans. You can also share unlisted videos just 
for them, which is another effective way to engage or to provide a special 
offer if you’re a business.
YouTube can be somewhat vague on how many subscribers you need to 
access specials feature. That number may also change over time, so be sure 
to check out https://support.google.com/youtube for the latest 
details. Often, you’ll find out that you qualify when you see these new fea-
tures show up on your channel. If your channel has enough subscribers to 
warrant access to the Fans and Insights features, you can do so using the 
­following steps:
1.	From the YouTube home screen, click the blue Sign In button in the 
top-right corner to log in to your YouTube account.
If you don’t see the blue button, you are likely still logged in. YouTube 
doesn’t log you out when you leave the page.
2.	Click the Channel icon in the top right of the page and then click 
Creator Studio in the menu that appears.
3.	Click the Community section of Creator Studio in the menu on the  
left side of the screen.
4.	Select either the Fans or the Insights option from the menu that 
appears.
You probably should check out Fans first to get a sense of the community 
where the Insights are derived.

Part III: Growing and Knowing Your Audience 
Fans and Insights are different from the Fan Finder feature, found under the 
Channel section of Creator Studio, which has more to do with advertising on 
YouTube. You can find out more about YouTube advertising in Chapter 13.
Understanding Subscribers  
and Their Value
YouTube allows viewers to connect more deeply with the channels they like 
by allowing them to become subscribers. To subscribe to a channel, all a 
viewer needs to do is go to a channel’s home page and click either the red 
Subscribe button or a link to the Subscribe button. (The Subscribe button is 
shown in Figure 10-2.)
Each Subscribe button also shows the number of current subscriptions to 
the channel, which is a great way to see how much interest lies in a particular 
channel.
Understand that your subscribers have both YouTube value — in the sense 
that more subscribers lets YouTube know that your channel and content are 
important — and in some cases monetary value. If you make money from 
YouTube or are planning to, you’ll look at audience data and advertising 
­performance to determine what your subscribers are worth. You can read 
more about these topics in Chapters 11 and 14.

 Chapter 10: Building Your Audience
Viewers must be logged in to subscribe to a channel. If they happen to click 
the Subscribe button when logged out, YouTube simply asks them to log in 
with their Google credentials.
If a viewer is logged in and visits a channel page that he has subscribed to 
or visits a video watch page that’s part of one of his subscribed channels, 
he sees a gray Subscribed box with a check mark in it instead, as shown in 
Figure 10-3. Note that each Subscribed button has the gear icon next to it — 
click that button and a menu appears, listing options that allow subscribers 
to control how they receive channel updates.

Convincing viewers to subscribe
Channel managers have several options when it comes to getting viewers to 
subscribe:
✓
✓Below the channel art: On every page that has channel art (such as the 
home page, About page, Watch page, and channel pages) you’ll find a 
Subscribe button, under the right side of the channel art. (Channel art  
is described in Chapter 2.)
✓
✓On the Watch page: Users can subscribe to a channel by viewing a 
video on the Watch page — the page where viewers watch a video. The 
Subscribe button is underneath the left side of the video — below the 
channel name and next to the channel icon. Chapter 2 describes the 
characteristics of the Watch page.

218
Part III: Growing and Knowing Your Audience 
✓
✓Through custom links: Channel managers can create subscription 
custom links that will appear on the channel’s About page and in the 
channel art. Start with the following line of code, and add the name of 
your channel to yourchannelname:
http://www.youtube.com/subscription_center?add_
user=yourchannelname
✓
✓In the channel description: Subscriber links can be useful in the 
descriptions uploaded as part of your video metadata. Just use the sub-
scriber link code shown in the preceding paragraph. Chapter 9 describes 
how to modify and optimize (for video SEO) a video description.
Subscriptions links can get long and unsightly. Don’t be afraid to sub-
stitute a shortlink instead. You also get additional tracking to see which 
subscription links generate the most clicks. Chapter 9 introduces short-
links and the software needed to track them.
✓
✓Through annotations: A video overlay is a great way to add a subscrip-
tion link to your channel. YouTube provides all the tools necessary to 
place these overlays, known as annotations, to video without requiring 
any editing. You can read about annotations later in this chapter.
✓
✓Recommendations: Subscription buttons also show up under the 
Recommended Videos section of a channel page. The channel manager 
can hand-select specific channels that may be of interest to the viewer. 
(Note that, unlike other Subscribe buttons, which are red, these buttons 
are gray with no subscriber count.)
✓
✓With web URLs: It’s easy to get people to subscribe from places not 
on YouTube; just include a Subscription link like the one shown ear-
lier. Clicking the link brings them to a YouTube channel, so determine 
whether you want the link to open in another tab or window if you don’t 
want the subscriber to exit your site.
Many channel managers put a link to the channel page as the target of the 
Subscribe link. If you want to bring them to your channel, please let them 
know that; otherwise, make the Subscribe button trigger a subscription 
request.
✓
✓The old-fashioned way: Have your video personality look straight into 
the camera and ask them to subscribe. They can say the name of the 
Subscribe link. There’s no harm in asking! You can even combine an 
annotation link here to make it even easier.
There are many ways to ask your viewers to subscribe. Don’t feel that you 
have to use only one method. YouTube allows a good deal of flexibility in 
generating subscription requests, so go ahead and experiment to see what 
works best for your audience.

 Chapter 10: Building Your Audience
Specifying how subscribers get updates
Being a subscriber to a channel is a lot like being a supporter of a local 
museum: You get notified about things first, and you get to see things before 
anyone else. Yes, being a subscriber has its benefits. Subscribers can be 
­notified when you
✓
✓Upload a video
✓
✓Add a video to a public playlist
✓
✓Like a video or save a playlist
✓
✓Subscribe to a channel
Subscribers can choose between being notified of all your events or just your 
uploads. (They do this by clicking the gear icon next to the gray Subscribed 
button and making their choice from the options that appear.) As a channel 
manager, you choose how much information you want to share with your 
subscribers. This is done through the channel feed, which is discussed in 
some detail in the next section. Don’t forget to manage the frequency of com-
munication as well, which is triggered from all the activity discussed earlier.
Your subscribers are your gold, so keeping them happy with your channel 
and the frequency of your notifications is important. If they receive too many 
from you, they may unsubscribe; too few and they may forget about you. 
Moderation is important.
You should understand how your subscribers receive your channel updates:
✓
✓Email
✓
✓Mobile device notification
✓
✓Accounts connected to social media
✓
✓Channel feed
Your channel feed is your richest source of updates. Subscribers receive 
updates from several areas of the platform:
✓
✓What to Watch: When viewers log in to YouTube, click the YouTube 
button in the top left corner of their browsers, or start the YouTube app 
on their mobile devices, they land on the What to Watch page.
This page is customized for each user because YouTube makes video 
suggestions based on a viewer’s subscriptions and recommendations 
derived from her viewing history.

220
Part III: Growing and Knowing Your Audience 
✓
✓My Channel: This is your channel, not the public view. You can edit 
your channel page directly here or go into the Video Manager to make 
individual video-playlist edits or manage your channel settings and 
­analytics. (Details of your YouTube channel are covered in Chapters 2 
and 3; additional information on Video manager is also in Chapter 9.)
✓
✓My Subscriptions: When viewers are logged in, they find their subscrip-
tions on their home pages or in the guide. This is where all their sub-
scriptions can be found and sorted by uploads or by all activity. Users 
can also manage subscriptions and create collections of channels in this 
section. (For more on subscriptions and guides, see Chapters 2 and 3.)
Setting the channel feed  
and privacy levels
You can control what your subscribers see by configuring your channel feed, 
as shown in Figure 10-4.

screen and select My Channel from the menu that appears.
The My Channel screen appears.
3.	Hover the mouse cursor over the channel name to bring up the  
Edit button.
The channel name sits just below the channel art; the Edit button should 
appear in the top left, below any links you may have configured.
4.	Click the Edit button and then select Edit Channel Navigation from the 
menu that appears.
Doing so brings up the screen shown earlier, in Figure 10-4.
5.	In the Feed settings section, select the check boxes of those activities 
you want to share with your subscribers.
Your subscribers can be notified when you:
	
1.	Add a video to a playlist
	
2.	Like a video or save a playlist
	
3.	Subscribe to a channel
6.	Click Save.
You can also set the privacy of your likes and subscriptions under your chan-
nel’s account settings. To access your account settings, click the Account 
Settings link from the Edit Channel Navigation screen (refer to Figure 10-4) or 
by following these steps:
1.	Log in to your YouTube account.
2.	Click the Channel icon in the top right corner of the YouTube home 
page.
3.	Click the gear icon to the right of the Creator Studio button in the 
menu that appears.
4.	Select Privacy on the left side of the Account Settings navigation bar.
5.	Select the check box for the information you want to make private.
Your privacy options are:
	
1.	Keep your liked videos and saved playlists private
	
2.	Keep your subscriptions private
6.	Click Save.
You can also go directly to the privacy setting by using yet another method 
visiting www.youtube.com/account_privacy.

222

Your public channel uploads are automatically part of your feed and can’t be 
set as part of the feed or privacy settings. Only the subscribers can specify 
whether they want to be notified about your new public videos.
Treating subscribers and nonsubscribers 
differently
To provide a more customized experience for viewers, YouTube allows you 
to treat subscribers and nonsubscribers differently when they visit your 
channel. (Subscribers don’t necessarily want to see the same video when 
they show up at your channel, because they’ve likely already seen it, so it 
makes sense to treat them differently than nonsubscribers.)
Working with a channel trailer
The channel trailer is a prominent video that’s shown whenever viewers 
first arrive at your channel. It’s your chance to convert nonsubscribers, to 
The Google+ dilemma
It’s hard to use a product from Google, espe-
cially YouTube, without running into Google+, 
or G+, as it is sometimes known. Launched in 
2011, Google+ is the company’s fourth attempt 
to deliver a social media platform designed to 
counter Facebook.
What made Google+ unique is the concept of 
circles, which allows users to group their social 
media contacts into distinct groups. Different 
content could be easily shared with different 
circles. While on Google+, users could see 
updates from all their different circles on what 
was known as the stream.
Google+ concurrently evolved into an identity 
service for other Google properties such as 
Gmail, Google Maps, Google Play, YouTube, and 
others. In other words, Google+ made it easy to 
link many of your online efforts. But there’s the 
rub: Google+ was starting to look like many dif-
ferent things, and the broader user community 
started to become perplexed.
Making matters worse was the integration of 
Google+ with YouTube comments in 2013, forc-
ing users to comment with their Google+ pro-
files exposed and no anonymity. However noble 
the intent to tame the often-wild YouTube com-
ment jungle, the YouTube nation bit back with 
a vengeance, including a less-than-flattering 
response from Jawed Karim, one of YouTube’s 
cofounders. Since then, Google has softened 
the Google+ stance for many of its products, 
including YouTube.
Nonetheless, with so much Google+ integra-
tion in YouTube, channel managers need to 
gauge how important Google+ is to their com-
munities. Don’t be deceived: There are perks 
with Google+ integration with YouTube, espe-
cially around fan management. In the mean-
time, YouTube channel managers should stay 
current on Google+ moves. The YouTube offi-
cial blog (http://youtube-global.  
blogspot.com) is a great place to start.

 Chapter 10: Building Your Audience
inform them about what they can expect from your channel, get them excited 
about you and your content, and give them the details of your programming 
­schedule.
You won’t need to change out your channel trailer frequently, because a 
viewer who subscribes isn’t shown this trailer again. Subscribers are greeted 
by a What to Watch Next page instead of a channel trailer.
Several factors affect what shows up on the What to Watch Next page. 
If you’re live-streaming, that stream shows up first. If you’re running a 
TrueView YouTube advertising campaign (see Chapter 13), your ads will 
show here. If none of these applies, your related video or most recent 
uploads will appear to subscribers.
Setting the Channel Browse view
To show a channel trailer, you need to set up Channel Browse view. To do so, 
do the following:
1.	Log in to your YouTube account.
2.	Click the guide icon next to the YouTube logo on the top left of the 
screen and select My Channel from the menu that appears.
The My Channel screen appears.
3.	Hover the mouse cursor over the channel name to bring up the  
Edit button.
The channel name sits just below the channel art; the Edit button should 
appear on the top left, below any links you may have configured.
4.	Hover the mouse cursor over the Edit button and then select  
Edit Channel Navigation from the menu that appears.
The Channel Navigation screen appears (refer to Figure 10-4).
5.	Click the Enable button in the Browse section if it doesn’t already 
show a check mark.
6.	Click Save.
Managing Comments
Many people tend to forget that YouTube is also a social media platform. 
That’s a bit odd because it’s one of the most heavily trafficked websites on 
the planet. In fact, one reason YouTube is so effective for creators and com-
panies is precisely because its platform provides a powerful connection not 
just between a viewer and your brand but also among your audience.

224
Part III: Growing and Knowing Your Audience 
Seeing why comments matter
Your interaction with your viewers and channel visitors is an important 
signal to not just your current subscribers but also potential subscribers. 
It tells them that your brand and your channel and content are worth their 
time. Encouraging comments is a great way to grow an audience and feed 
your community.
Make a concerted effort to add your own follow-ups to comments posted 
when you upload a video. Channel programming is about regularly schedul-
ing uploads. Channel manager programming is about always responding to 
comments in a timely manner.
Your options for managing any particular comment are listed here:
✓
✓Allow the comment.
✓
✓Allow and respond to the comment.
✓
✓Remove the comment.
✓
✓Report spam or abuse.
✓
✓Ban the commenter from the channel.
You’ll typically allow and respond to comments. You’ll learn the details of 
managing comments in the following sections.
Similarly to likes and dislikes on video, viewers can like and dislike comments 
as well. Pay attention to comments that receive both large numbers of likes 
and dislikes.
Viewers generally appreciate being recognized by creators and channel 
­managers. You can add the name of a viewer in a comment by typing a plus 
sign (+) and then their name. YouTube helps by autocompleting the name,  
so you’re assured that the person will be notified of your outreach.
You can respond to comments in one of two ways:
✓
✓On the Watch page: Both viewers and channel managers can add 
­comments just below the channel description (refer to Figure 10-1). The 
Comment field is in the All Comments section; just type right where it 
says “Share your thoughts.”
Commenters must be logged in to make a comment. If they are not logged 
in, YouTube asks them to do so.

225

 Chapter 10: Building Your Audience
✓
✓Community Comments Section in Creator Studio: Only channel man-
agers can respond here. The idea is to provide a convenient place for 
channel managers to respond to comments for all their videos.
Setting up your channel for comments
You may hear some people say not to allow comments on your channel. 
We’re convinced that you’d give up much of the effectiveness of YouTube by 
following that advice. Much of the concern folks have about comments stems 
from the fact that some channel managers have done a less-than-stellar job 
around content moderation, which meant that some channels’ Comments 
sections turned into toxic cesspools. That’s a sign of a channel manager 
­falling down on the job, not proof that comments can’t work in a YouTube 
context. In the next section, you can find tips and techniques that you need 
to keep from falling down on the job.
Enabling channel-level comment controls
As a channel manager, you first have to enable comments for your entire 
channel; with that out of the way, you can then move on and decide your 
level of comment control as well.
You control whether comments are posted automatically or only with your 
approval. In the following steps, we explain how you can screen bad ­comments 
before they get posted.
1.	Log in to your YouTube account.
2.	Click the guide icon next to the YouTube logo on the top left of the 
screen and select My Channel from the menu that appears.
The My Channel screen appears.
3.	Hover the mouse cursor over the channel name to bring up the 
Edit button.
The channel name sits just below the channel art; the Edit button should 
appear on the top left, below any links you may have configured.
4.	Hover the mouse cursor over the Edit button, click it, and then select 
Edit Channel Navigation from the menu that appears.
The Channel Navigation screen appears (refer to Figure 10-4).
5.	Look at the Discussion section and confirm that the button to the right 
is selected and labeled Enabled.
If it says Enable with no check, simply click the button. Your channel is 
now enabled for comments.

226
Part III: Growing and Knowing Your Audience 
6.	Determine how you want comments displayed by clicking the button 
under the Discussion label and choosing the appropriate option.
Your choices are
• Display Automatically posts appropriate comments without your 
approval.
• Don’t Display Until Approved requires you to explicitly approve a 
comment before it is posted.
7.	Click Save.
In the meantime, you need to enable or confirm that your channel is set up 
for comments.
Enabling video-level comment controls
With your channel enabled for discussion, your videos can receive com-
ments. You can also control comments on a video-by-video basis. You have 
three ways to enable comments on individual videos:
✓
✓Default: YouTube allows channel and video comments by default.
✓
✓Upload defaults: In the Creator Studio Channel section, you set the 
default comment controls for all future uploaded videos. This allows you 
to set a general policy so you don’t have to configure each individual 
video.
✓
✓Advanced settings: In the Creator Studio Video Manager section, set the 
comments controls for an individual video and click Save Settings. (We 
show you how to do this one in a sec.)
For the last two options, you can go with one of these two settings:
✓
✓All will post appropriate comments for the video without your  
approval.
✓
✓Approved requires you to explicitly approve a comment on the video 
before it is posted.
To set up video commenting at the individual level, do the following:
1.	Log in to your YouTube account.
2.	Click the Channel icon in the top right of the page and then click 
Creator Studio in the menu that appears.

227

 Chapter 10: Building Your Audience
3.	On the left side of the screen, click the Video Manager heading in 
Creator Studio’s navigation menu.
4.	Select Videos from the drop-down menu that appears.
5.	Scroll through your videos to find the one whose Comments feature 
you want to configure.
If you have quite a few videos, you can use the search bar on the Videos 
page to track down the one you want.
6.	Click the Edit button to the right of the video and then select 
Advanced Setting under the video.
7.	Under Comments, check the Allow Comments box to allow  
comments for this video. (To block comments, uncheck the  
check box.)
8.	Click the button to the right of All Comments to select whether you 
want all comments added automatically or whether they need to be 
approved first.
9.	Click the blue Save Changes box on the bottom right to save your 
changes.
Moderating comments
As your audience engages more and more with your videos and your channel 
becomes increasingly successful, comment moderation on a video-by-video 
basis can become rather tedious. Fortunately, YouTube allows you to mod-
erate comments all in one place — in the Community Comments section of 
Creator Studio. To access these comments:
1.	Log in to your YouTube account.
2.	Click the Channel icon in the top right of the page and then click 
Creator Studio in the menu that appears.
3.	On the left side of the screen, click the Community heading in Creator 
Studio’s navigation menu.
4.	Select Comments from the drop-down menu that appears.
Doing so brings up the Comments page, as shown in Figure 10-5. By 
default, clicking on Community should bring you automatically to the 
Comments section.

228
Part III: Growing and Knowing Your Audience 
Note the following three tabs:
• Published Comments: These are the comments currently posted 
on your channel. You can do all the standard things with these 
­comments — allow the comment, allow and respond to the 
­comment, remove the comment, report the comment as spam or 
abusive, or ban the commenter from the channel.
	Whether you’re on the Watch page or in the Comments section, 
you have icons and pull-downs to the right that allow you to 
remove a comment, block a commenter, or report spam. (You’ll 
probably make much use of the Trash icon, which quickly vapor-
izes an inappropriate comment.)
• Held for Review: Comments are held here when you don’t allow 
automatic posting or when comments are caught by blacklist fil-
ters you set in the community guidelines. (For more on blacklist 
filters, check out the “Configuring Community settings” section, 
later in this chapter.) If the comment is acceptable, click the Check 
button; otherwise, click its associated Trash icon to remove it. 
Review your held comments regularly so the appropriate ones get 
posted on your channel.

 Chapter 10: Building Your Audience
• Likely Spam: YouTube, in its efforts to root out spam, places com-
ments here that it regards as likely spam. Ultimately, however, 
you are the judge of what’s spam and what’s not. You should make 
sure that YouTube hasn’t jumped the gun and mischaracterized a 
comment as spam. If it’s not spam, just click the check button to 
accept; otherwise, click the Trash icon to remove it.
Anything you can do to a single comment on the Comments page — accept, 
respond to, delete — can be done to multiple comments in one fell swoop. 
Simply check one or more of the comments you’re moderating and take bulk 
action.
Reacting to inappropriate comments
As a channel manager, you need to draw the line as to what comments are 
appropriate to be shown on your channel. Just because someone disagrees 
with you doesn’t mean you have to call out the military. Some channel man-
agers and creators like a debate, but there are situations where comments 
are abusive and inappropriate, while providing no benefit to you, your 
­viewers, or your community.
With comments, you have the following options:
✓
✓Remove. This will simply delete the comment.
✓
✓Report spam or abuse. Comments and those who comment are subject 
to the same community guidelines. (For more on community guidelines, 
see Chapter 9.) The Report Spam or Abuse flag is there to report a 
guideline violation, not a channel or video comment disagreement. See 
the next option if community guidelines are adhered to and yet you still 
need to address a situation.
✓
✓Ban from channel. Sometimes you just need to divorce yourself from 
certain viewers. This setting prevents them from posting comments.  
If circumstance change and you want them back, then you can remove 
them from the banned user list in your Community settings. (More about 
that later.)
To remove a comment, report spam or abuse, or ban a user from your 
­channel, channel managers can:
✓
✓Use the pull-down to the right of the comment that appears on the 
Watch page. (See Figure 10-6.)
✓
✓Manage a comment from the Community Comments section in 
Creator Studio. (See Figure 10-7.)

 Chapter 10: Building Your Audience
Using Messaging
Sometimes your audience prefers not to have a discussion in a public forum, 
so YouTube came up with a messaging system. With it, your viewers can 
communicate directly with you.
If you’ve been using YouTube for a while, you may be familiar with the Inbox 
feature, which has been replaced by Messaging. Be sure to clear out your old 
Inbox and start using Messages in its place. New users don’t have to worry 
about this.
Messages are an important way to build an audience, but as with comments, 
managing a large number of messages can be time consuming.
How to kill a troll
User anonymity has been a blessing and a 
curse since the early days of the Internet. In 
some instances, it facilitated very honest dis-
cussion, and in other cases it provided a cover 
for bad behavior and malicious intent. This 
latter group is known as trolls. Popular web-
sites, such as the Huffington Post, decided to 
forbid anonymous comments because their 
moderators were too busy filtering out trolls 
and spam rather than moving the discussion 
forward. Because YouTube is a social platform 
with a massive audience, it has attracted more 
than its fair share of trolls, much to the frustra-
tion of channel managers and viewers alike.
Making matters worse, YouTube’s platform is 
decidedly videocentric, which can more easily 
trigger a response than, say, a three-page blog. 
YouTube’s ease of adding comments didn’t 
help either, because viewers (or malcontents) 
could add a comment easily, instantaneously, 
and anonymously. YouTube had a challenge on 
its hand.
Starting in late 2013, YouTube began putting 
controls in place to counter trolls as well as 
spam, because neither serves part of the dis-
cussion around a video. It started off by forcing 
a deeper integration with Google+ to “pierce 
the veil of anonymity.” Though this strategy 
was well-intentioned, many legitimate viewers 
cried foul over privacy concerns, with hun-
dreds of thousands of users signing an online 
petition against what they saw as heavy-
handed restrictions.
By 2014, YouTube backed off some of the 
requirements, but provided channel manag-
ers with more tools and controls, such as 
blacklisting and keyword flagging, to help 
preserve the integrity of their channels. It’s 
gone a long way toward getting the problem 
under control, but it will remain an evolving 
situation for YouTube and many other social 
platforms.

Managing messages follows the same pattern as moderating comments, 
except that you don’t see links to your video content and you have different 
tabs. To access your messages, do the following:
1.	Log in to your YouTube account.
2.	Click the Channel icon in the top right of the page and then click 
Creator Studio in the menu that appears.
3.	On the left side of the screen, click the Community heading in Creator 
Studio’s navigation menu.
4.	Select Messages from the drop-down menu that appears.
Doing so brings up the Messages page, as shown in Figure 10-8.
Note that the Messages page has four tabs — not the three you see with 
Comments:
• Approved messages: These are audience messages that have made 
their way to you. Feel free to respond to a message, remove it, 
block it, or report a message as spam.
	Check your messages regularly and respond to important 
­subscribers or audience members in a timely manner.
• Filtered Messages: These are messages caught by the filters you set 
in the Community Guidelines section. The settings are discussed in 
the Configuring Community Settings section, later in this chapter.

 Chapter 10: Building Your Audience
• Likely spam: As with comments, YouTube wants to do its part 
when it comes to filtering out spam hiding as messages, but ulti-
mately you have the yea or nay here. Just double-check to make 
sure YouTube made the right decision when characterizing a mes-
sage. If a message is not spam, just click the check button; other-
wise, click the Trash icon to remove it once and for all.
• Sent messages: These are messages that you’ve sent.
As with comments, anything you can do to a single message on the Messages 
page can be done to multiple messages in one fell swoop. Simply check one 
or more of the messages you’re moderating and take bulk action.
Configuring Community Settings
You’ve probably noticed some similarities between comments and messages. 
Both of these involve the management of users. YouTube makes it easy to 
manage users from a central location known as Community Settings. To 
access Community Settings, do the following:
1.	Log in to your YouTube account.
2.	Click the Channel icon in the top right of the page and then click 
Creator Studio in the menu that appears.
3.	On the left side of the screen, click the Community heading in Creator 
Studio’s navigation menu.
4.	Select Community Settings from the drop-down menu that appears.
Doing so brings up the Community Settings page, as shown in Figure 10-9.
Community settings consist of three sections:
1.	Automated filters: There will be viewers who are constructive and 
viewers who are not. That’s just the nature of YouTube. This is where 
you manage:
	
1.	Approved users: Enables automated posting of comments and 
­messages from identified users.
	
2.	Banned users: Block comments and messages from identified users.
	Both approved and banned users can be managed using their 
Google IDs, Google+ profiles, or Google+ circles.
	
3.	Blacklist: Comments and messages that match phrases or words in 
this list will be held for review. This also applies to live chats and 
the content will be blocked.

✓
✓Set up highlights: This helps you limit what comments you see in order 
to help you identify the most relevant ones. This is important because 
you may want to respond to specific community members. If you 
have tons of comments, this will prevent you from seeing all of them. 
Approved comments will still end up on your channel, but you may not 
see them all.
✓
✓Default settings: This is your overall comment management. You can:
• Allow all comments
• Hold all comments for review
• Disable comments
Think hard before disabling comments. It’s tough to develop a community 
when you’ve taken away a key engagement component of YouTube.
Getting Viewers to Engage
After you have a solid channel and an active audience commenting, mes-
saging, and sharing your content, you have to ask whether they’re doing 
everything you expected. In Chapter 5, we talk about establishing the goals 
for your channel. Some of those goals may be YouTube related, such as get-
ting more views and subscribers, or they could be more commerce-oriented, 
Figure 10-9:

 Chapter 10: Building Your Audience
such as influencing a brand decision and driving a product purchase from a 
­website. Either way, you need to get your audience to click on the video and 
take the next action.
It’s all about the click, and YouTube has some tools to make that click 
happen.
Working with annotations
Annotations are overlay elements that you can add to your existing videos. 
They allow a viewer to do something when they click on the annotations, 
such as subscribe, get more information about you, or view more content. 
(An annotation also happens to be one of the best ways out there to get your 
audience to engage with your channel, just in case you were curious.)
For channel managers, annotations are editable fields that can be added to 
videos after they’re uploaded. Annotations can be modified and updated at 
any time. In other words, you’re not stuck with an annotation once you’ve 
created it; you can change it, delete it, move it, and so on. Annotations can 
just be plain text or links back to other content on YouTube, or off YouTube, 
such as specific social networks, nonprofits, fundraising, retails accounts, 
and other associated websites.
Use annotations to create what are called custom end-cards — a collection of 
one or more annotations at the end of a video that help instruct viewers in 
what to do when the video is completed. This can also include subscription 
requests. Custom end-cards are good for branding consistency, and they 
always helps your audience identify with your content. Figure 10-10 shows 
what an end-card could look like.
Exploring the annotation types
YouTube would seem to subscribe to the notion that variety is the spice of 
life, given the number of annotation options it offers. The following list gives 
you an overview:
✓
✓Speech bubble: This annotation is a lot like the clouds you see in news-
paper comics. Use it whenever you want to visually express thoughts or 
spoken words.
✓
✓Note: This annotation is similar to a speech bubble, except that the text 
is enclosed in a box.

236
Part III: Growing and Knowing Your Audience 
✓
✓Title: An overlay name for your video, like one you might add during the 
editing process. Doing it as an annotation lets you be more flexible later 
on if you decide to change the title. Titles are non-clickable.
✓
✓Spotlight: Use this annotation to create custom end-cards or to highlight 
an element in the video. Spotlight annotations are different from other 
types of annotation because they only appear when the viewer moves 
the mouse over the section of the video that has the annotation. It mini-
mizes viewers distraction while still provide a path for engagement.
✓
✓Label: When a viewer hovers the cursor over the annotation, your label 
appears. This is commonly used for videos featuring multiple products 
at a time on the screen. Viewers can choose what interests them most 
and interact with only that item. Labels prevent the video from getting 
cluttered and does not take away from the viewing experience.
Specifying an annotation target
Though coming up with a cool annotation design can be a lot of fun, never 
lose sight of your end goal. Annotations are meant to point your viewer 
to some new place on the Internet — another video, a playlist, an associ-
ated website, you name it. Above all, this new place — the target of your 
­annotation — has to relate to the video that was viewed.
Figure 10-10: 
Use of an 
end-card.

237

 Chapter 10: Building Your Audience
Viewers need be directed to targets that make sense based on the context of 
the video. If they feel misled or sent to a confusing target, chances are good 
that they won’t click on another annotation. Even worse, they may unsub-
scribe from your channel.
Your site must be in good standing to use annotations. See Chapter 9 
for more information to learn more about keeping your channel in good 
­standing.
Setting up annotations
To create annotations, follow the same path you’d use when working with 
any video on your channel — in other words, you need to pay another visit to 
the Video Manager. To set up annotations, do the following:
1.	Log in to your YouTube account.
2.	Click the Channel icon in the top right of the page and then click 
Creator Studio in the menu that appears.
3.	On the left side of the screen, click the Video Manager heading in 
Creator Studio’s navigation menu.
4.	Select Videos from the drop-down menu that appears.
5.	Scroll through your videos to find the one you want to annotate.
If you have quite a few videos, you can use the search bar on the Videos 
page to track down the one you want.
6.	Click the Edit button to the right of the video.
Doing so brings you to the Video Editing page; the Info & Settings tab is 
shown by default.
7.	Select the Annotations tab above the video.
The Annotations tab of the Videos page appears.
You can alternatively select the down arrow next to Edit, which provides 
a drop-down where you can select Annotations that will drive you to the 
Annotations section in the Video Editing page. The first way, you have 
to take two steps, the second way you only take one step to get to the 
Annotations tab.
8.	Click the + Add Annotation button on the right side of the video.
9.	Choose an annotation type from the menu that appears.
Your choices are Speech Bubble, Note, Title, Spotlight, and Label.

238
Part III: Growing and Knowing Your Audience 
10.	Choose when the annotation runs by either dragging the mouse cursor 
over the Play bar to the point where you want the annotation to show 
or manually entering the times in the Start and End boxes.
11.	Add text to the annotation text box and customize the font size, font 
color, and background color by using the editing toolbox that’s provided.
12.	To make your annotation a clickable link, select the Link check box.
13.	Paste the URL into the field under the Link check box.
14.	Click the Video button to the right of the Link check box and select 
the link type.
You must use YouTube-accepted links, which include the following targets:
• Another video
• A playlist
• Another channel
• A Google+ profile page
• A Subscribe prompt
• A fundraising project
• An associated website
• A merch (an approved retail site)
15.	If you’ve chosen a linked video, set the start time.
16.	Click the Open Link in a New Window button if you want the clicked 
link to open in a new window.
17.	On the Annotations tab, preview the newly annotated video, as shown 
in Figure 10-11, and be sure to play and pause the video when the 
annotation appears.
18.	Using the sizing handles, change the annotation size and location,  
if necessary.
Do not put annotations at the top of a video or in the lower third, because 
they can be obstructed by overlay ads.
19.	Click the Apply button to save your work.
Getting creative with annotations
Want to take annotations even further and provide an even more interactive 
experience for your audience? Use annotations to offer surveys your viewers 
can then use as an easy way to decide what they most want to view from you.

Be sensible about annotations. They should complement, not detract from, 
the viewer’s experience. Don’t be shy, either. The end of a video is a wonder-
ful place to use an ask a viewer to subscribe.
In Chapter 11, you find out how to assess how much your audience likes your 
channel. That assessment should be able to tell you how much they like your 
annotations as well.
Adding branding to the mix
Audiences engage with your channel, but they also come to recognize your 
brand — those unique elements that tell the world your content is yours rather 
than someone else’s content. YouTube recognizes that branding is a big deal in 
our content-saturated world. That’s why it goes out of its way to provide some 
­additional capabilities to apply branding without forcing you to invest the 
additional time and effort that always comes with an additional video edit.
Branding was previously known by the more confusing name: InVideo 
­programming.
When it comes to branding, YouTube allows channel managers to do the 
­following:
✓
✓Add a brand watermark to the top left corner of each video on the ­channel.
✓
✓Automatically add a short video as a branded introduction to each of 
your channel’s videos.
To set up branding for your channel, follow these steps:
1.	Log in to your YouTube account.
2.	Click the Channel icon in the top right of the page and then click 
Creator Studio in the menu that appears.
3.	On the left side of the screen, click the Channel heading in Creator 
Studio’s navigation menu.
4.	Select Branding from the drop-down menu that appears.
The Branding page appears, as shown in Figure 10-13.
5.	To add a standard opening branded video to your content, click the 
blue Add a Branding Intro button. (See Figure 10-14.)
You can upload a video that’s three seconds or less as your intro. This 
branding video must already be on your channel and you should set its 
privacy to unpublished. Refrain from making the introduction an adver-
tisement per YouTube policy. You can subsequently change branded 

241

 Chapter 10: Building Your Audience
intros, but do so sparingly so you don’t alienate your audience. You can 
also remove a branded intro by simply clicking the Remove button.
6.	To add an overlay brand watermark, click the blue Add a Watermark 
button. (See Figure 10-15.)
Upload a PNG or GIF file less than 1MB in size. After you’ve saved the 
branded watermark, choose the duration for when you want it to show:
• For the entire video.
• At end of the video.
• At a custom time within the video.

The full branding experience may not be fully integrated into all mobile 
devices.
Capturing the Captioning Opportunity
Language and sound should not be barriers to connecting with your audi-
ence. YouTube provides tools for subtitles and closed captions. Subtitles 
and closed captions allow viewers who don’t speak your language to watch 
and understand your video. Even viewers with hearing disabilities can enjoy 
watching your content, too.
Adding subtitles and closed captions
Don’t let the thought of dealing with closed captions and subtitles scare you. 
Working with these elements is similar to working with any other video ele-
ment on your channel — in this, as in all things, Video Manager is your friend. 
Use the following steps to create subtitles and closed captions:
1.	Log in to your YouTube account.

243

 Chapter 10: Building Your Audience
2.	Click the Channel icon in the top right of the page and then click 
Creator Studio in the menu that appears.
3.	On the left side of the screen, click the Video Manager heading in 
Creator Studio’s navigation menu.
4.	Select Videos from the drop-down menu that appears.
By default, clicking on Video Manager should bring you automatically to 
the Videos section.
5.	Scroll through your videos to find the one you want to work with.
If you have quite a few videos, you can use the search bar on the Videos 
page to track down the one you want.
6.	Click the Edit button to the right of the video and select the Subtitles 
and CC tab from the menu that appears above the video.
Doing so brings up the Subtitles and CC tab of the Videos page, as shown 
in Figure 10-16.
You can also click the down arrow to the right of Edit button and select 
Subtitles and CC directly.
7.	Click the Add subtitles and CC drop-down menu to the left of the 
video to view your language choices.
8.	Choose your language or search for it in the search box.
After your language is selected, you’ll be prompted with how you’d like to 
add your subtitles or closed captions.

9.	Select your method:
• Upload a file. Add a text transcript or timed subtitles in the form of 
an uploadable file.
• Transcribe and set timing. Type or paste a transcript into the video 
transcript box that comes up on the right of the video. YouTube 
autoconfigures the timing.
• 	Create new subtitles or CC. Add captions as you watch the video 
either by uploading a transcript file or by entering the text directly 
into a transcript box. You can pause and play while doing this.
Having viewers contribute subtitles  
and closed captions
Some channels, known as participating channels, allow their own viewers to 
submit subtitles and closed captions. Expect this limited function to be more 
broadly available in the future, representing a great way to get your audience 
to help out.
For more information on subtitles, closed captions, and participating chan-
nels, see https://support.google.com/youtube.
Giving Credit Where It’s Due
YouTube videos frequently represent the work of many people. Some of the 
more elaborate content on YouTube could easily rival a small Hollywood 
movie. Recognizing the people who work with you on YouTube productions 
has been a bit of a challenge. More creative channel managers have some-
times called out collaborators in the video description field.
YouTube has formalized the attribution of key contributors with a new 
­functionality called creator credits.
Receiving credit
In the YouTube world, channels with higher subscriber counts gain certain 
benefits. Being able to assign credits is limited to channels with 10,000 or more 
subscribers. (Note that YouTube may lower thresholds over time.) However, 
you don’t need that many subscribers to have someone else credit you.

245

 Chapter 10: Building Your Audience
If you’re just dying to know where you’ve been credited, do the following:
1.	Log in to your YouTube account.
2.	Click the Channel icon in the top right of the page and then click 
Creator Studio in the menu that appears.
3.	On the left side of the screen, click the Community heading in Creator 
Studio’s navigation menu.
4.	Select Credits from the menu that appears.
Doing so brings up the Credits page. Note the four tabs where your col-
laboration work could (potentially) be recognized: Pending, Published, 
Removed, or Spam.
5.	Approve or remove credits.
You have control over were you’ve been credited, so you can remove the 
attribution if you want.
People who receive credit always receive an email notification. Credit set-
tings can also be configured in the community guidelines.
Assigning credit
When you reach 10,000 subscribers, you can assign credit to your production 
partners. Creator credits are shown on the Watch page, as shown in  
Figure 10-17. Viewers need to click Show More to reveal more.

Producing Live Events
Putting together live events on YouTube is a great way to build an audience 
and drive engagement. You have several options for managing live content 
on YouTube:
✓
✓YouTube live events: Live-streaming with active management of the 
comments.
✓
✓Google+ Hangouts On Air: This is a great way to have a video-based 
discussion with your fans. Hangouts On Air allows you to stream live 
events or online discussions from either Google+ or YouTube.
✓
✓Off-platform events: Grab the opportunity to meet with your fans in real 
life. Many YouTube creators use physical community events such as 
VidCon (www.vidcon.com) to meet with their fans — and shoot some 
live content with them.
Repurpose your live event content for your channel. Your audience will love 
the attention.

magine driving along in your car and suddenly your dashboard goes out: 
no lights, no gauges, and no navigation. You can either pull over to the 
side of the road and call a tow truck, or just keep driving. Whatever the deci-
sion, you’ll have a tougher time making it to your destination. As a YouTube 
channel manager driving down the video highway, you need a dashboard, 
too: That dashboard is YouTube Analytics.
YouTube Analytics is all about getting meaningful information about how 
your channel is doing. If you’re working with YouTube creators and other 
online video personalities, chances are good that you’ll be prompted to 
provide some interesting reports about all the wonderful things happening 
with the YouTube channel. In some cases, though, you may have to deliver 
some not-so-good news: Maybe your audience and fan base just aren’t liking 
the new videos that are being uploaded to the channel. YouTube Analytics 
is there to help you figure out what may have gone wrong — and a whole 
lot more.
YouTube Analytics is where you find the details about your audience: where 
they’re finding you, what they like, where they’re watching, and so on. After 
a while, YouTube Analytics will likely be your first YouTube stop every day. 
Spend time mastering the analytics process and extracting the key insights 
it contains because it will help you craft a more robust channel — and sig-
nificantly better video content. If you’re making money from your channel, 
YouTube Analytics can help you earn even more.
Chapter 11

248
Part III: Growing and Knowing Your Audience 
YouTube Analytics isn’t just for new channels. If you already have a channel 
and it’s not performing to your satisfaction, YouTube Analytics is a valuable 
resource for diagnosing and subsequently fixing problems.
Getting Started with YouTube Analytics
It’s tough to talk about analytics with YouTubers without hearing support-
ing terms like metrics and insights. Don’t be put off by all the geeky terms. 
In Chapter 5, you can find out all about setting goals for your channel. This 
chapter, however, is all about determining whether you’re meeting your 
goals; to able to do that, you need to work with metrics and insights.
Here’s the skinny: Metrics are quantitative things you measure, such as the 
number of views and percentage click-through rates on your channel. Metrics 
gauge your goal attainment against your plan. Insights are qualitative and 
actionable things you learn and do from analyzing metrics, including whether 
your content is working for you or your annotations are well placed in your 
video.
YouTube Analytics shows you how you’re tracking against your goals and 
also where you may need to make adjustments. Understanding metrics and 
insights is relatively straightforward, but you need to know where to look in 
YouTube Analytics to get the data you need.
As a channel manager, always think in terms of metrics and insights. You 
must act on those insights, though. For example, if the view count and 
number of likes (metrics) for your new video are 25 percent of your target, 
it may indicate that your video isn’t resonating with your audience or that 
you released it at the wrong time (insights). Take the time to fix what may be 
immediately wrong (such as poor metadata) or change future content or pro-
gramming. You should verify the video metrics again over time.
As you become more sophisticated in your use of YouTube Analytics, you’ll 
realize that certain metrics may depend on other metrics. For example, your 
earnings metrics may be impacted by view metrics, which may be impacted 
by engagement metrics. Don’t sweat the details — the relationship among all 
metrics comes together quickly.
Chapter 5 covers two important metrics — views and subscribers — in 
some detail. Make sure that you understand what other metrics impact 
these two.

Reading YouTube Analytics reports
Your go-to place for all aspects of YouTube Analytics is the Analytics section 
of Creator Studio. To make your way there, do the following:
1.	In your web browser, go to www.youtube.com.
2.	Log on to your YouTube account.
If you see a blue Sign In button in the top right corner of the YouTube 
home page, enter your email address and password.
3.	Click on the logged-in icon and choose Creator Studio from the menu 
that appears.
The Creator Studio navigation menu should appear on the left side of 
your browser.
4.	Click the Analytics section of Creator Studio.
By default, it should go directly to the Overview submenu, as shown in 
Figure 11-1.
You can also bypass these steps by going to www.youtube.com/

Part III: Growing and Knowing Your Audience 
When you look at the Analytics section on Creator Studio’s navigation menu, 
you can see that YouTube Analytics is divided into five subsections. They’re 
described, from top to bottom, in this list:
✓
✓Overview: Presents a high-level view of your channel’s overall perfor-
mance. It includes these five subsections:
• Performance: Data on views, watch time, and earnings.
• Engagement: Includes likes, comments, social shares, and sub-
scriber action.
• Top 10 Videos: Lists your most popular videos along with their 
views, estimated watch times, and estimated per-video earnings.
• Demographics: Includes viewer geography and gender.
• Discovery: Specifies top playback locations and leading traffic 
sources.
✓
✓Realtime: Displays a two-column comparative report on the five newest 
videos on your channel. Column 1 looks at the last 48 hours, and Column 2 
measures the past 60 minutes.
✓
✓Earnings reports: Partners can earn money from advertising with 
Google, along with YouTube Rentals, which are like online movie rentals. 
This subsection not only looks at estimated advertising revenue but also 
analyzes which ads perform best against your channel.
The Earnings Report section is visible only if you have enabled channel 
monetization. (Chapter 14 has more on monetization opportunities.)
✓
✓Views reports: Spells out who makes up your audience, what they’re 
watching, and where they’re coming from. You’ll also see critical met-
rics around retention, which is how much of a video viewers watch and 
where they stop viewing.
✓
✓Engagement reports: Analyzes subscriber additions and losses, along 
with whether viewers are liking, commenting, sharing, and clicking 
­annotations.
Breaking down the report components
YouTube provides a rich set of reports that may seem overwhelming at 
first, but you’ll quickly discover that navigating the reports is quite easy 
because they have a similar structure that consists of these three distinct 
sections:

251

 Chapter 11: Knowing Your Audience
✓
✓Filter: Over time, you’ll add video content, construct playlists, build 
annotations, engage subscribers, and do so much more. You’ll definitely 
want to set up dynamic filters that are meant to show you only the 
information you’re looking for. The Analytics Filter section is shown in 
Figure 11-2.
✓
✓Chart: After you’ve determined what you want to analyze, you can 
get lots of information with some fairly flexible graphical representa-
tions (charts, in other words) to guide your understanding. These will 
help you assess the performance of your channel, your content, and 
your community. (You can see an example in Figure 11-3 of a YouTube 
Analytics chart showing views over a multiyear period.)
Figure 11-2:

filter.
Figure 11-3:

252
Part III: Growing and Knowing Your Audience 
✓
✓Details: Shows itemized details that correspond to the particular 
YouTube Analytics report. For example, in the Views report, you can 
get a detailed list of your top 200 videos, including name, views, per-
centage growth in view, estimated minutes watched, and average view 
duration. You have similar access to geographical, date, and language 
data. Figure 11-4 shows what the Details section of a YouTube Analytics 
report might look like.
Grouping information
To simplify some of your channel analysis, you can create custom groups 
of videos or playlists for analysis. If you manage a baking channel, you may 
want to create one group for all your bread videos and playlists and another 
for your cake baking videos and playlists. (To create a group, simply click 
the Group button, give the group a name, select the videos or playlists you 
want in the group, and then click Save.)
A group is used for your analysis work; it lets you aggregate related con­
tent. It’s different from a playlist, which is meant for audience viewing.  
Yes, YouTube even lets you group playlists for analysis!

 Chapter 11: Knowing Your Audience
Comparing data
In the earlier (hypothetical) example of a baking channel, wouldn’t it be 
great if you could compare how your bread-baking videos or playlists are 
performing against your cake-baking videos or playlists? Well, with YouTube 
Analytics, you can do precisely that. You can even make comparisons 
by country and date. (To compare videos, groups, or playlist, click the 
Comparison button and enter the names of the items you want to compare. 
YouTube Analytics will pull the data together for you.)
If you’re running a YouTube advertising campaign (see Chapter 13), groups 
and comparisons are effective ways to determine which channel videos may 
be the best one to advertise with.
Setting up report filters
Creating truly informational reports is easy: Just figure out which data you 
want to include and which data you don’t. The Analytics Filter section not 
only makes this task possible but also lets you see the results of what you’re 
doing immediately, which lets you fine-tune the filter so that the data is 
exactly what you want.
By using the following text fields and drop-down menus, found in the 
Analytics Filter, you can ensure that you’re looking at only the data you need:
✓
✓Search for Content field: Include only a specific video, playlist, or group 
for analysis.
If you want to include more than one video, group the videos first. This 
feature doesn’t let you filter for multiple individual videos unless they’re 
part of a group or playlist.
✓
✓Search for Locations field: Select video data that is gathered worldwide, 
by continent, or by country. You may want to do this, for example, to 
determine how many viewers you get from Europe, Asia, South America, 
and so on.
You cannot currently group countries or continents.
✓
✓Preconfigured Date drop-down menu: The default value is Last 28 Days. 
Click the button to the right of the Location section to choose common 
date criteria, such as this year, last year, or this quarter.
✓
✓Custom date range: If a preconfigured date doesn’t work, you can pick 
a more suitable and customizable date range by clicking the Calendar 
button to the right of the Preconfigured Date menu.

✓Uploads/Playlists: By default, YouTube Analytics looks at the perfor-
mance of the videos on your channel. Playlists, however, can be as 
important an asset as videos. This button, which sits below the Search 
for Content field, lets you toggle between video uploads and playlists.
✓
✓Show Only Subscriber Views: Your analytics reporting looks at 
the behavior of your entire audience. For certain reports, such as 
Demographics and Traffic sources, you can look at behavior by only 
your subscribers. Simply click the Show Only Subscriber Views check-
box, if it’s present, to the right of the Uploads/Playlists.
✓
✓Groups: Add a custom video and playlist groups to your filter criteria by 
clicking the Groups button. You can also modify existing groups.
✓
✓Comparisons: Clicking the Comparisons button brings up a second filter 
section immediately under the first. Currently, YouTube allows only two 
comparisons. When you’re finished with the analysis, merely click the 
Cancel Comparison button that appears to the left of the Groups button, 
initially where the Comparison button was when you started.
You need to set up a filter only once in the Analytics section of Creator 
Studio. You can move among all report types, and your filters will remain in 
place. However, after you leave the Analytics section and move over to the 
Video Manager or Community sections, for example, you have to reenter the 
filter information whenever you return to Analytics.
Understanding visual charts
Moving from report to report in the Analytics section, you’re sure to see both 
the graphs and the data changing in the Chart section below the filter crite-
ria. Though the reports are similar, each may have specific metrics based 
on the report type. For example, you’ll find subtitles and captions in a Views 
report, but such items would make no sense in an Engagement report.
YouTube Analytics always presents data relevant to the particular report type.
In the Chart section, you generally see the following elements:
✓
✓Key Metrics: A banner below the filter criteria indicates the major met-
rics associated with the report. Clicking on a major metric immediately 
graphs it on the chart. If you’re looking at a Subscriber report, you can 
choose among subscribers, subscribers gained, and subscribers lost.
✓
✓Comparative Metrics and More Metrics: Charting different metrics 
against one another can provide insight into what channel actions influ-
ence another. On a Views report, you may find that charting views and 
total estimated earnings show similar and aligned graphs. You can use 

255

 Chapter 11: Knowing Your Audience
this information to formulate the actions needed to drive views and 
accelerate earnings. To add metrics, click the Comparative Metric or 
More Metrics button, whichever shows up under the Key Metrics banner 
on the left. A complete list of your choices is shown in Figure 11-5.
✓
✓Graphing controls: You can find additional graphing controls under the 
Key Metrics banner. Look for the Charting Granularity control just to the 
right of the Comparative Metrics or More Metrics button. You can graph 
using daily, weekly, or monthly spans. Depending on the chart, you can 
also add totals and percentages to see how your data compares with 
your totals.
✓
✓Chart type: YouTube Analytics has six chart types, as indicated by the 
six icons down the left side of the Chart screen:
• Line: Shows one key metric and a comparative metric over a period 
that you select. This is effective for showing trends or viewing pat-
terns. For a View report, it would show total view counts for your 
channel over time. (Figure 11-6 shows a sample line chart.)
• Multi-line: Graphs the side-by-side details of the components of a 
major metric. For a Views report, it can show the side-by-side graph-
ing of your top videos. (You can customize to show any 25 of your 
top 200 videos, if you were curious.) This is effective not only for 
observing the increase in the number of video views but also seeing 
whether views trend together. (Figure 11-7 shows a multi-line chart.)

Part III: Growing and Knowing Your Audience 
• Stacked: Like its multi-line cousin, a stacked chart shows the rela-
tive portion attributed to each component while showing the total 
number of videos compared. (Figure 11-8 highlights a stacked-
chart example.)
• Pie: An old standby (see Figure 11-9) that can be used to display 
how items are distributed over a particular period.

• Bar: Illustrates relative proportions of a selected metric as horizon-
tal bars, as shown in Figure 11-10.
• Map: Reveals a map of the world that displays metrics as you hover 
the mouse cursor over each country. More active countries for a 
specified item — views, subscribers, likes, and more — are shown 
with darker shades so that they stand out, as shown in Figure 11-11.

 Chapter 11: Knowing Your Audience
Pick the chart type and graphing items that best reflect what you’re trying  
to analyze. If you want to see trends, a pie chart or bar chart may not be  
the best choice. Instead, pick a graph with a strong time axis, such as line, ­ 
multi-line, or stacked.
Just because YouTube Analytics lets you graph as many as 25 items doesn’t 
mean that you should do so. In fact, a complicated graph may hide the exact 
nuggets you’re trying to find.
Managing report details
For each chart, YouTube lets you see the detailed information that supports 
the graph. Just remember that every chart is different and that its features 
depend on the metrics used. If the chart you’re working with has modifiable 
details, you can find a banner under the graph that you can use to manipulate 
the chart. Figure 11-12 shows the choices for the Views report, which let you 
look at details based on the following categories:
✓
✓Video: List the top videos for views.
✓
✓Geography: Order the top countries that generated the views.
✓
✓Date: Show when the views were generated.
✓
✓Subtitles and CC: Itemize the viewing language.

Sometimes you want to customize your own charts or combine details of 
your YouTube Analytics data with other information. You can download your 
data into a comma-separated values (CSV) file and import it into Microsoft 
Excel or another common spreadsheet program. To do so, just click the 
Download Report button on the top right part of the filter section associated 
with your report.
Learning about Views
YouTube Analytics provides plenty of insights, but you still have to come 
up with the final answers. To be effective, put on your proverbial Sherlock 
Holmes hat and pick up a magnifying glass as you sift through all the 
YouTube metrics clues. To see how that could work, let’s look more closely 
at a specific report type: the Views report.
Seeing which content is the most popular
Like most YouTube channel managers, you want to know which videos are 
attracting the most views. Getting that info is simple:
1.	In your web browser, go to www.youtube.com.
2.	Log on to your YouTube account.
If you see a blue Sign In button in the top right corner of the YouTube 
home page, enter your email address and password.
3.	Click on the logged-in icon and choose Creator Studio from the menu 
that appears.
The Creator Studio navigation menu should appear on the left side of 
the browser.
4.	Click the Analytics section of Creator Studio.
By default, it should go directly to the Overview submenu (refer to 
Figure 11-1).
5.	In the Analytics Navigation pane, click Views under the Views Report 
heading.
Doing so brings up a line chart that shows your total views over the last 
28 days. (Note: You can change the analysis period by changing the time 
from the filter section that sits above the graph.)

261

 Chapter 11: Knowing Your Audience
6.	Examine the line.
Is it moving up and to the right? Do you see peaks during certain days? 
Look for patterns and look for spikes, both high and low.
If you see consistent peaks, that means your audience is viewing your 
content on a regular basis. Think about the programming schedule from 
Chapter 5, and align it with your audience’s viewing patterns.
7.	From the listing running down the left side of the chart area, click the 
Multi-line Chart icon.
Doing so brings up a chart showing your top five videos, graphed by 
color. In the Details section, you see a color key matched to each video 
so that it’s clear how one video is performing compared to the others. 
Select the Video Details button next to the listed video to add and 
remove videos from the chart.
You won’t break anything by looking at the different chart type or chang-
ing the analysis timeframe. You should become comfortable navigating and 
modifying your analysis.
Determining whether viewers are 
watching or leaving
One of the truly great aspects of YouTube is the detail it can provide about 
how much of your videos your audiences actually watch. If you’re think-
ing about the view duration, that’s partially correct: If you have a 4-minute 
video and viewers watch only about half the video, you have a 2-minute (or 
50 percent) view duration.
View duration, though important, tells only part of the story. A channel man-
ager needs to know more, including the answers to these questions:
✓
✓Where is my audience dropping off?
✓
✓How does the audience attraction compare with similar videos?
Audience retention — determining the steps you need to take to hold on 
to your audience — should be a critical part of the analytics process. The 
Audience Retention report generated by YouTube Analytics allows channel 
managers to see these two factors:
✓
✓Absolute audience retention: You’re greeted by a timeline that 
­displays what percentage of your audience views your video. If you 
have a 3-minute video, you see a retention graph for the entire three 
minutes aligned with the player for the entire video. You can see 
exactly where an audience watches and where they drop off.

262
Part III: Growing and Knowing Your Audience 
Don’t become upset when you discover that your audience is not watch-
ing 100 percent of your videos for their entire duration. Drop-offs are 
perfectly normal — think about your own viewing patterns on YouTube.
✓
✓Relative audience retention: After you realize that you won’t have 100 
percent audience retention, you need to determine how your retention 
rates compare with similar content from other channels. Relative reten-
tion rates displayed in the Audience Retention report show how your 
video compares over time and display whether parts are average, above 
average, or below average.
You can also look at audience retention by playlist; just click the Playlists 
button in the Filter section of the YouTube Analytics page.
So, does an audience retention report sound intriguing? Here’s how to carry 
one out:
1.	In your web browser, go to www.youtube.com.
2.	Log on to your YouTube account.
If you see the blue Sign In button in the top right corner of the YouTube 
home page, enter your email address and password.
3.	Click on the logged-in icon to and choose Creator Studio from the 
menu that appears.
The Creator Studio navigation menu should appear on the left side of 
your browser.
4.	Click the Analytics section of Creator Studio.
5.	In the Analytics Navigation pane, click Audience Retention under the 
Views Reports heading.
By default, a line chart appears, displaying the average duration of all 
your channel videos. The Absolute Audience Retention chart is also 
shown by default.
6.	In the report’s Details section on the bottom part of the page, click on 
the name of a particular video you want to analyze.
Doing so automatically fills in the video name in the filter section and 
brings up the audience retention graph.
If you don’t see the video you want to analyze for retention, simply use 
the Filter menu to search for it.
7.	Search for peaks and valleys in the graph. You may be scratching your 
head and trying to figure out why a peak is showing up on a viewing 
graph. Your audience may be choosing to rewatch a segment, ­signaling 
vital content. The valley represents viewer loss, so look at what’s 

263

 Chapter 11: Knowing Your Audience
­happening at that point in the video below the graph. The cause might 
be boring or overly long content, which is something that you should 
­consider when editing upcoming content.
8.	Click the Relative Audience retention button just above the retention 
graph.
You should determine how your content is performing against compa-
rable videos. If it’s consistently below average, look at other content to 
understand how it’s different and why it may be more interesting to the 
audience than yours.
The watch time plays a crucial role in increasing your video’s profile in 
YouTube search results (as we talk about in Chapter 5). Audience retention 
provides you with insight you need in order to keep viewers watching.
A retention drop always occurs at the beginning of a video because that’s 
when viewers decide if they’ve chosen the right video to watch. However, if 
the drop seems rather precipitous at the beginning, it may be a sign that the 
title, metadata, or thumbnail is out of sync with what viewers expected when 
they found the video. Never mislead viewers, and fix any concerns based on 
what your retention reports indicate.
Understanding Your Audience
View reports and Audience Retention reports are designed to help you 
understand how well your viewers are responding to your channel content. 
To find out who’s watching your videos, you have to try a different tack: the 
Demographics report.
Diving into demographics
It helps to know who’s watching your content so that you can make impor-
tant content-planning decisions. The Demographics report in YouTube 
Analytics is a fascinating way to analyze your audience, because you can 
get concrete information about your audience members’ genders, ages, and 
countries of residence.
Demographics is a vital chart area that lets you apply a Subscriber Only filter. 
Sometimes it’s interesting to see whether your subscriber demographics 
mirror your general audience demographics.
To access your demographics, follow these steps:

264
Part III: Growing and Knowing Your Audience 
1.	In your web browser, go to www.youtube.com.
2.	Log on to your YouTube account.
If you see the blue Sign In button in the top right corner of the YouTube 
home page, enter your email address and password.
3.	Click on the logged-in icon and choose Creator Studio from the menu 
that appears.
The Creator Studio navigation menu should appear on the left side of 
your browser.
4.	Click the Analytics section of Creator Studio.
5.	In the Analytics Navigation pane, click Demographics under the Views 
Reports heading.
Gender is the major metric, and both Male and Female are shown by 
default, as shown in Figure 11-13.
You can focus on only one gender by clicking Male or Female in the 
banner above the chart. The chart shows a breakout by age bracket and 
a pie chart split by gender.
6.	Examine the charts and their accompanying details.


 Chapter 11: Knowing Your Audience
It’s terrific if your audience is exactly what you thought it would be. 
If it isn’t, revisit your assumptions. You may find that your content is 
having wider interest, which may be a good thing. Conversely, if you’re 
not seeing enough traction, perhaps you’re not engaging enough with 
key creators and fans in your core demographic to help you get the 
word out.
7.	Click Show Only Subscriber Views in the Filter section.
Look at how the graphs change. If you see a big difference, determine 
whether subscription requests are working more broadly than expected, 
because your content certainly is appealing to others.
Make it a habit to compare your demographic information over time to detect 
any shifts in your audience.
Diving into subscribers
Knowing your subscribers’ patterns and where they subscribe is an impor-
tant part of your channel management responsibilities. YouTube is well 
aware of that, which is why it offers a Subscriber report as part of YouTube 
Analytics. Here’s how to access it:
1.	In your web browser, go to www.youtube.com.
2.	Log on to your YouTube account.
If you see the blue Sign In button in the top right corner of the YouTube 
home page, enter your email address and password.
3.	Click on the logged-in icon and choose Creator Studio from the menu 
that appears.
The Creator Studio navigation menu should appear on the left side of 
your browser.
4.	Bring up the Analytics section of Creator Studio.
5.	In the Analytics Navigation pane, click Subscribers under the 
Engagement Reports heading.
You see a line chart with subscription patterns, similar to the one shown 
in Figure 11-14.
6.	Look at the report’s Details section to see the most popular subscription 
locations. (You may need to click the Geography tab to see ­locations.)
You see the number of subscribers lost, too, which is a normal part of 
channel activity.

266
Part III: Growing and Knowing Your Audience 
On some of your reports, you see the label Closed Account, which happens 
when YouTube purges accounts every so often. You lose subscribers when-
ever their accounts are closed.
Optimizing Discoverability
YouTube is a huge place, and it’s growing every day. YouTube, Google, Bing, 
and Yahoo! visitors are presented with many options as they search for 
videos that interest them. In Chapter 5, you find out about the importance of 
discoverability and its importance for helping YouTube get your content in 
front of the right viewers so they can watch. Ideally, you want your content 
offered up first, but that takes some time. (Rome wasn’t built in a day, you 
know.) As a channel manager, you use analytics to figure out whether your 
quest for discoverability is moving in the right direction.
Seeing where viewers find your content
As your content becomes more popular and relevant for specific viewers, 
YouTube will offer up your videos as Recommended videos and as part of 
their search results. These are important ingredients in your overall channel 
Figure 11-14:

 Chapter 11: Knowing Your Audience
performance. So, too, is community engagement, which helps your ­content 
show up on playlists, on websites, in social media, and more. YouTube 
Analytics can help you determine where your audience is discovering your 
content.
The Traffic Sources report from YouTube Analytics is designed to show 
you how viewers discover your content. It includes not only sources within 
YouTube but also external sites and social media. To see how your viewers 
find you, do the following:
1.	In your web browser, go to www.youtube.com.
2.	Log on to your YouTube account.
If you see the blue Sign In button in the top right corner of the YouTube 
home page, enter your email address and password.
3.	Click on the logged-in icon to and choose Creator Studio from the 
menu that appears.
The Creator Studio navigation menu should appear on the left side of 
your browser.
4.	Bring up the Analytics section of Creator Studio.
5.	In the Analytics Navigation pane, click Traffic Sources under Views 
Reports.
By default, you see a line chart with aggregate channel views, which 
is not terribly interesting, so you should change to a more meaningful 
view.
6.	In the row running down the left side of the Chart area, click on the 
Bar Chart icon.
Doing so changes the view into something a bit more interesting — your 
top five YouTube channel traffic sources. (Figure 11-15 gives you an idea 
of what such a view looks like.)
7.	Modify the graph by using the Filter section, or select sources in the 
Detail section.
8.	Review your traffic sources.
Sources here might include
• YouTube advertising
• YouTube channel page
• YouTube Guide (YouTube homepage and subscription screen)

• Unknown — direct (mobile apps and external website)
• Unknown — embedded player (views from external websites)
• External app
• External website
• YouTube — other features (analytics, editing screen, and other 
random stuff)
9.	Click YouTube Playlists in the Details section.
Doing so brings up all the playlists — yours and others — that include 
your videos.

 Chapter 11: Knowing Your Audience
Finding out where (and how) viewers 
watch your content
Channel managers also need to know where their video content was watched 
and on what kind of devices, including computers and mobile devices. You 
can get that information with the help of two specific reports:
✓
✓Playback Locations: Shows whether the video was viewed from 
YouTube or an external website or device.
✓
✓Devices: Specifies the device format and the operating system used to 
view video content.
Don’t underestimate the importance of how your audience consumes your 
content. If mobile devices dominate, be sure that your videos don’t require a 
55-inch plasma display to get your point across.
To determine where your audience is viewing:
1.	In your web browser, go to www.youtube.com.
2.	Log on to your YouTube account.
If you see the blue Sign In button in the top right corner of the YouTube 
home page, enter your email address and password.
3.	Click on the logged-in icon and choose Creator Studio from the menu 
that appears.
The Creator Studio navigation menu should appear on the left side of 
your browser.
4.	Bring up the Analytics section of Creator Studio.
5.	In the Analytics Navigation pane, click Playback Locations under the 
Views Reports heading.
By default, you see a stacked chart with aggregate channel views.
6.	Modify the chart by using the Filter section or selecting Sources in the 
Details section.
7.	Click on the Embedded Player on Other Websites link in the Details 
section.
The report highlighting embedded players appears, as shown in 
Figure 11-16.
YouTube allows websites to embed your video, which is one of the  
highest forms of engagement.

270
Part III: Growing and Knowing Your Audience 
You always get full view credit for embedded videos. If you have a web-
site, feel free to embed videos from your YouTube community and your 
subscribers as well. It’s good practice because it highlights how you 
interact with your subscribers.
8.	To probe a bit deeper, go back and click Devices under the Views 
Reports heading.
Under the graph, you can toggle between the device type and the operat-
ing system. Here are some popular devices:
• Computer
• Game console
• Mobile
• Tablet
• TV
• Unknown
9.	To see even more information, click a specific device type or operat-
ing system in the Details field.
If you find certain types to be the most popular, you can test your chan-
nel by using those particular devices and operating systems. That way, 
you can ensure that your audience has the best viewing experience 
­possible.

 Chapter 11: Knowing Your Audience
Making Sure Your Audience Is Engaged
Engagement is all about your viewers going beyond just watching a video. 
You want them to comment, share, and interact with you. The Engagement 
report offered by YouTube Analytics lets you look at several types of 
­engagement:
Subscriptions: This feature displays information on subscriber gains 
and losses, along with specific info about where in the process they are 
choosing to subscribe.
Like and dislikes: This feature captures details around view sentiment 
about your content. This category also includes geographical informa-
tion, which would let you know if some of your content is resonating 
better in some countries than others.
Favorites: This feature shows which videos are being added to viewers’ 
Favorites playlists.
Comments: This feature highlights those videos that receive viewer com-
ments. Don’t forget the date dimension here to find out when most of the 
comments are posted.
If comments are made in the first few hours after you post a video, 
you may want to make sure you’re always available after posting for 
­immediate engagement.
Google Analytics and YouTube
If you’re setting up a YouTube channel, 
chances are good that you have a website. 
And if you have a website, you’re likely to have 
one or more analytics packages integrated 
into it, including the most popular one: Google 
Analytics. The good news here is that you can 
use Google Analytics for your YouTube channel.
Rather than use your existing Google Analytics 
tracking ID, create a new property only for your 
YouTube channel under your existing Google 
Analytics account. This new tracking ID must 
then be added to Creator Studio’s Channel 
­section under the Advanced tab.
After the new tracking ID is in place, you can 
follow many of the interactions that visitors 
are specifically having on your YouTube chan-
nel page rather than on your Watch pages or 
playlists. Google Analytics helps show you 
what YouTube Analytics doesn’t: how view-
ers discover your channel. Remember that 
YouTube Analytics shows only how viewers 
are discovering your content, not your channel 
as such. With Google Analytics, you can figure 
out which videos drive the most viewers to your 
channel.

272
Part III: Growing and Knowing Your Audience 
Sharing: This feature itemizes which videos are shared and shows you 
which social media service they were shared on. (You might use this 
latter bit of information to find out whether your community prefers a 
particular service, such as Twitter or Facebook.)
Annotations: This feature helps analyze the performance of your 
­annotations, showing which ones generate the most clicks.
Getting Engagement Reports
If Engagement reports sound like a good deal, start cranking them out. Here’s 
how to do that:
1.	In your web browser, go to www.youtube.com.
2.	Log on to your YouTube account.
If you see the blue Sign In button in the top right corner of the YouTube 
home page, enter your email address and password.
3.	Click on the logged-in icon and choose Creator Studio from the menu 
that appears.
The Creator Studio navigation menu should appear on the left side of 
your browser.
4.	Bring up the Analytics section of Creator Studio.
5.	In the Analytics Navigation pane, click any of the reports under the 
Engagement Reports heading.
For the purposes of this example, say that you want to see where your 
viewers chose to subscribe and which countries they came from.
6.	In the Analytics Navigation pane, click Subscribers under the 
Engagement Reports heading.
You’re presented with a line chart.
7.	Click Source in the Details section below the chart.
Doing so brings up a list of locations where your subscription activity 
happened.
8.	Click Video in the Details section.
Look for particular videos that drove the most subscriptions.
9.	To discover which countries your subscribers come from, click 
Geography in the Details section.
You see all the countries where you added and lost subscribers.

273

 Chapter 11: Knowing Your Audience
You always lose subscribers, no matter how great your channel and con-
tent. Why? Often because viewer interests change. You should, however, 
make sure that the subscribers you gain outnumber the subscribers 
you lose.
10.	If you prefer a pretty picture, click the Map icon to the left of the chart 
to graphically show where your subscribers come from. Then click the 
Geography button under the map.
Figure 11-17 shows your subscriber detail by country.

Analytics and language
You may have discovered that many of your 
viewers don’t come from your own country or 
speak your language natively. Unfortunately, 
with your busy schedule as channel manager, 
creator, or digital brand video guru, you prob-
ably don’t have time learn a new language — 
even though you’d love to.
Luckily for you, you can provide captions in a 
different language — see Chapter 10 for all 
the details. Use YouTube Analytics to discover 
what language and countries are most impor-
tant to your channel. You may be able to collab-
orate with your fans who are native speakers 
or with services such as the Google Translator 
Toolkit (https://translate.google.
com/toolkit).

274
Part III: Growing and Knowing Your Audience 
After you have a general idea how to access the Subscribers report, you 
should be able to apply that knowledge to accessing the other Engagement 
reports. Drill down into the details to understand exactly what your audience 
is doing with your content.
Going In-Depth on Annotation Analytics
Regardless of whether you’re an independent creator or a business, you often 
want your audience to do something. Annotations — the clickable elements 
you can add to a video — can be quite an effective way to help the audience 
take that action. (If annotations don’t ring a bell, check out Chapter 10.) 
Fortunately, YouTube Analytics helps you determine whether your annota-
tions are effective, which is often important to not only you as a channel 
manager but also your viewers, who may be looking to do something.
Understanding annotation lingo
If you’ve ever dealt with any type of web commerce, you’ll find the metrics 
and nomenclature around annotations familiar. If not, you can pick it up 
rather fast. Here are some key terms to know for annotations:
✓
✓Impression: This is the number of times an annotation is shown. If an 
annotation appears once in a video, for example, and the video is shown 
1,000 times but the watch time presents the annotation only 572 times, 
that’s 572 impressions.
✓
✓Click: If the viewer clicks on the annotation, that’s a click. Note that not 
all annotations are clickable.
✓
✓Click-through rate: This percentage shows the number of clicks divided 
by the number of impressions. If a video received three clicks for  
88 impressions, that would be 3 88, or a 3.4 percent click-through rate.
✓
✓Closes: If the viewer closes the annotation, it’s a close. Note that not all 
annotations can be closed.
✓
✓Close-rate: This percentage shows the number of closes divided by the 
number of impressions. If a video receives four clicks for 40 impressions, 
that’s 4 40, or a 10.0 percent close rate.
You see all these metrics in Annotation reports prepared by YouTube 
Analytics.

Getting your annotation metrics
After you all the “vocab” out of the way, it’s time to generate some 
Annotation reports. Here’s how it’s done:
1.	In your web browser, go to www.youtube.com.
2.	Log on to your YouTube account.
If you see the blue Sign In button in the top right corner of the YouTube 
home page, enter your email address and password.
3.	Click on the logged-in icon and choose Creator Studio from the menu 
that appears.
The Creator Studio navigation menu should appear on the left side of 
your browser.
4.	Bring up the Analytics section of Creator Studio.
5.	In the Analytics Navigation pane, click Annotations under the 
Engagement Reports heading.
You see a line chart that shows annotation clicks for the last 28 days.
6.	Use the Report filter to change the timeframe or to select particular 
content that you want to analyze.
7.	Click on the major annotation metrics shown in the banner above the 
chart: Clicks, Click Through Rate, Closes, and Close Rate.
Look for any trends, peaks, or valleys in the graph.
Repeatable patterns, trends, and chart anomalies are your analytics 
friends. Be on the lookout for them and try to understand why they’re 
occurring. Use chart comparatives and other analytics reports to probe 
deeper.
8.	Click the Annotation Type tab in the Details section.
This step helps you determine whether your audience prefers a particu-
lar type of engagement. Figure 11-18 shows an annotation report with 
itemized annotation types.
9.	Click on Video tab in the Details section.
Your top-performing videos, ranked by annotation click, are listed.
If you’re not seeing a particular video, go to the Filter section and reset 
your choices.

276
Part III: Growing and Knowing Your Audience 
10.	Click on the video name to see the annotation performance for a 
­particular video.
You see a list of all annotations, ranked by click frequency.
Clicks tends to attract all the attention, but also pay particular attention 
to annotations that are closed. A high close rate may be a sign that you’re 
annoying your viewers and risking watch time, unsubscribes, and dislikes.
11.	Click the Video Manager section of Creator Studio to modify or 
remove annotations.
Analytics gave you the insights, so be sure to take action. Chapter 10 has 
all the details on annotations.
As a channel manager, you’ll continually look at your metrics and make 
adjustments. That’s perfectly normal. There’s never one fix, so just keep 
repeating the process (within reason) until you get it right.
Seeing whether your annotation 
are working
After you see all these interesting metrics — such as click-through rate 
(CTR), subscriber growth, favorite additions, and more — you may wonder 
how your metrics compare. Though you’d probably like to hear that a 
Figure 11-18:

 Chapter 11: Knowing Your Audience
click‑through rate of 3.1345 percent is the norm, you’ll quickly see that 
there really is no single “good” value for a metric. Establish the norm, and 
­continually compare performance among all components of your channel.
A good end-card (see Chapter 10) may have several side-by-side annota-
tions with associated thumbnails. YouTube Analytics is a goldmine in this 
example because it shows not only the clicks; it also provides insights into 
what viewers watch next, which thumbnails are drawing attention, and how 
the thumbnail orientation affects the number of clicks.
Beyond YouTube Analytics
If you have only a few channels and limited programming skills, and you 
aren’t doing any advertising, YouTube Analytics will do a fine job for you. If 
you want to analyze broader markets on YouTube for competitive reasons or 
you are interested in selecting places to advertise on YouTube, you need dif-
ferent tools and analytics. The same holds true if you’re only looking to see 
lists of trending videos.
Analytics on YouTube isn’t restricted to YouTube Analytics in Creator Studio. 
There are third-party solutions, such as VidStatsX (www.vidstatsx.com) 
and Pixability (www.pixability.com), that provide creators, channel 
managers, and brand marketers with the tools necessary to analyze industry 
trends, manage multiple channels, and run advertising campaigns. Figure 
11-19 gives you a taste of what VidStatsX can offer, in the form of a nice Top 
100 list, and Figure 11-20 shows Pixability’s analytics for the most influential 
creators in the beauty industry on YouTube.
Using the YouTube Analytics API
It’s quite easy to access YouTube Analytics from 
your laptop, your tablet, or even your mobile 
phone. You get some nifty graphs from which 
you can make some rather powerful decisions 
about your channel and your audience. But 
that’s not the only way to get the metrics and 
insights you need in order to run your channel.
You can also access YouTube Analytics via an 
application programming interface (API). That’s 
tech-speak for having your computer programs 
talk directly to YouTube and do all sorts of tasks, 
such as upload videos, grab analytics data, and 
so much more. A number of powerful video 
marketing and advertising platforms from com-
panies such as Pixability make extensive use of 
YouTube APIs.

Only you have access to your YouTube Analytics data. Other analytics tools 
use public information only, often combining data from several different 
sources to come up with a much broader analytics view beyond just your 
channel.

U
 
rban legend has it that when asked why he robbed banks, famed 
­criminal Willie Sutton responded, “Because that’s where the money 
is.” You won’t learn much about bank robbery in this chapter, but you will 
­understand why doing business on YouTube is a big deal: because that’s 
where your customers are. In fact, that’s where nearly everyone who’s doing 
business today is.
YouTube now reports that it receives over 1 billion unique visitors per month 
who watch over 6 billion hours of video during that period. They’re watching 
from desktops, laptops, tablets, smartphones, smart TVs, game consoles — 
and pretty soon, from intelligent watches. They’re watching around the world 
from over 60 countries. (In fact, 80 percent of YouTube views occur from out-
side the United States.) Wherever a YouTube video is played lies a potential 
opportunity to help your business.
If you’re serious about taking your business to the next level, YouTube can 
provide you with some rich capabilities designed to help you reach that goal. 
In later chapters, you find out how to work as an advertiser (someone who 
buys ad space) or as a creator (someone who sells ad space). Fortunately for 
you, Google and YouTube take care of most of the messy work for you while 
helping you integrate YouTube into your paid marketing initiatives, such as 
your display and search campaigns.

Part IV: YouTube Channels Are Serious Business 
Understanding Video and Business
Before you think about YouTube for business, you may want to think about 
video for business. It doesn’t matter whether you’re part of a Fortune 500 
multinational corporation or running a one-person community nonprofit: 
Your business will benefit greatly by bringing video into your marketing 
efforts. YouTube helps you make that happen easily while also giving you the 
tools to help you reach your business goals.
If you’re a business, the audience you’re trying to reach also includes  
those viewers who can help you sell more. They’re your prospective — or 
­existing — customers, other businesses that can help you sell, or potential 
advocates who may become your brand champions. Your challenge is to get 
their ­attention, which is especially difficult these days because they’re get-
ting bombarded with digital media from so many different sides. That’s why 
video is vital: It helps you cut through all your audience’s distractions and 
deliver your value proposition fast and effectively. The good part, according 
to market research company eMarketer, is that online video not only is  
the fastest-growing type of media but will also be the largest, as shown in  
Figure 12-1. YouTube is a great place to be.
It’s all about video marketing
Because the focus of this book is on YouTube, you’ve probably already 
embraced the broader concept of video marketing and advertising. If not, 
check out the book referenced in Chapter 5, Video Marketing for Dummies, by 
Kevin Daum, Bettina Hein, Matt Scott, and Andreas Goeldi (Wiley). It deals 
with the broader concept of video as an effective medium for helping your 
business. In this chapter and the following, you’ll learn about how YouTube 
fits into the business equation.

 Chapter 12: How and Why Businesses Use YouTube 
Using video for marketing and advertising is nothing new, especially for 
larger companies that have spent fortunes on television advertising and paid 
infomercials. Lots of cutting-edge organizations alternatively jumped onto the 
web-based, online video bandwagon, but many became frustrated because  
it was difficult to gauge whether video advertising actually helped their busi-
nesses. They couldn’t determine who was watching, they were unable to 
engage their audience, and they were at a loss to explain to their bosses how 
well their fancy video campaigns worked. Too bad their leaders were often 
asking about viral videos rather than business results.
Betting your business on viral video is like betting your retirement on lottery 
tickets: It’s just not a sound strategy. You’ll end up investing all your money 
and time in something that has little or no chance of succeeding. A much 
better strategy is to make great content regularly and add a dash of paid 
advertising to build your business the right way.
Most folks are well aware that a revolution has occurred in video capture, 
production, and editing over the past decade. We’re at the point where 
someone using the smartphone in their pocket can shoot, edit, and upload a 
high-quality video, all within minutes. The thing is, the revolution didn’t stop 
there. It happened in distribution and social media, too. With YouTube, you 
can also reach millions of viewers, all within a matter of minutes. Keep that 
point in mind as you make your way through this chapter.
Brand decisions are made on YouTube
YouTube is now where consumers frequently turn to make decisions about 
what products to buy. Because of the rich engagement capabilities that 
YouTube provides, the site is far more than just a place you go to when you 
want to watch a few videos — it has become a gathering place, a true com-
munity, a powerful social platform. By combining the social aspect with video 
(both branded video and video that’s independently produced), YouTube 
now hosts its fair share of trusted advisors who act as product experts and 
influencers who are in a position to guide consumers on their journey to 
making a decision about a product or service.
Figure 12-2 shows consumer search patterns around tablets in the con-
sumer electronics industry. What’s most striking is the amount of ongoing 
YouTube search traffic that’s shown. Compare that with the corresponding 
Google search graph, which shows only seasonal search spikes — a sure sign 
that consumers are looking for the big sales after having already selected 
their products. The implications of Figure 12-2 are profound, especially for 
­business: Brand and product decisions are being made on YouTube, and 
­purchase decisions are being made on Google.

284
Part IV: YouTube Channels Are Serious Business 
Being on YouTube is no longer just an advantage; it’s a necessity for busi-
ness. If you’ve doubted where YouTube fits into your business cycle, think 
again. YouTube now represents the first few steps in your customers’ ­journey 
with you.
Understanding Your YouTube  
Business Components
If you have a business, more likely than not you also have a business  
model — a plan that sets down how you intend to make money, to put not 
too fine a point on it. This chapter is designed to help you find a place for 
YouTube in your business model. (You may want to read this chapter in com-
bination with Chapter 5, where we talk a bit more about how you can ensure 
that your YouTube channel objectives and video content align with your 
business goals.)
Don’t be rigid about your YouTube business model. Ultimately, your audi-
ence is the judge. Relevant content, engagement, and collaboration may 
all be important factors to consider. YouTube Analytics — and your sales 
­performance — are your guides, so be sure to scrutinize your channel’s 
­numbers. (See Chapter 11 for more on YouTube Analytics.)
Content matters
No ifs, ands, or buts — content is critical to business on YouTube. If you 
come from the TV world, your first instinct may be to drop the standard  
15- or 30-second commercial on YouTube. Your first instinct would be  
wrong. YouTube viewers don’t want commercials; they want authenticity. 
They don’t want glitz; they want reality.

 Chapter 12: How and Why Businesses Use YouTube 
If you have a product to sell, picture your viewer’s journey with you and with 
your brand as a series of steps that viewer must take. Each step represents 
a stage where your viewer, who may now be a bona fide business prospect, 
is looking for more — yet different and increasingly detailed — information. 
These steps are shown in Figure 12-3.
Figure 12-3: 
Using your 
YouTube 
channel to

sales.
You may believe that these steps look and sound a lot like the proverbial 
sales funnel. You’d be right to think so. Viewers frequently complete a series 
of distinct phases before they make a product decision. The reason it’s called 
a funnel is that it’s wider at that top than at the bottom because not every-
one who looks at your products (or terrific videos) will buy something. Your 
business goal is to use YouTube to help them pick you when they make a 
purchase decision.
With these steps in mind, your YouTube content should align with the stages 
of your customer’s journey. Here are some phases to consider as you try to 
help viewers make a decision:
✓
✓Create awareness. Initially, viewers likely have no idea who you are or 
what you offer as a product or service. You want to elevate their knowl-
edge of you in the fastest way possible. Think of the video content at 
this stage as a short YouTube commercial. It’s different from regular ads 
and TV commercials because it may provide annotations and web links 
for viewers seeking more information. In other words, you won’t leave 
them hanging. If you’re going to advertise on YouTube, content at this 
stage may be perfect for your campaign.

286
Part IV: YouTube Channels Are Serious Business 
Don’t make viewers think too hard! Make it ridiculously easy for them to 
find more information about what is shown in the video. Use all the tools 
in your toolbox — annotations, metadata, and shortlinks, for ­example — 
to keep them engaged. (For more on the tools you can use to keep 
­viewers engaged, see Chapter 11.)
✓
✓Generate interest. Think of endorsements or partnerships. If you’re 
big enough — or rich enough — you’re talking about celebrity 
­endorsements.
Aside from being expensive, celebrity endorsements often come with 
severe licensing restrictions. If you end up getting a million views — and 
lots of business — from a celebrity endorsement, that’s great, until you’re 
forced to pull the video after licensing rights expire. Be sure to create 
licensing contracts that do not require you to remove the video from 
your YouTube channel. After you delete a video or list it as private on 
your channel, your channel won’t be able to show those video views on 
your About page as views and your channel won’t be rewarded for them 
in YouTube search.
✓
✓Build credibility. Building credibility usually necessitates adding tuto-
rials and longer videos that take the time to describe product details. 
Don’t be surprised to see a 30-minute longer-form video at this stage 
perform as well as shorter-form content at an earlier stage.
Content curation (or playlisting videos you haven’t produced) is often 
as important as content creation. If your raving fans are making awe-
some videos about your products, don’t hesitate to include them in your 
­playlists. There’s probably no better way to establish credibility with 
sales prospects than to show the enthusiasm of your fans. Don’t forget 
that including your community on your channel is a great community 
high-five as well.
✓
✓Remove objections. Having collaborators producing tutorials are great 
for not only building trustworthiness but also removing potential objec-
tions. Sometimes, though, you need something different from a tutorial, 
perhaps videos that describe how your product or service benefited  
the customer. This is where you make the sale happen, so make sure  
it counts.
✓
✓Provide a service. After your prospective channel viewer has turned 
into a paying customer, you may think that your YouTube work is done. 
Not exactly. Remember that if customers love their experience with 
you and your business, they’ll likely buy from you again, and again, 
and again. One way to ensure this level of loyalty is to make the expe-
rience they have with you and your brand after the sale a rewarding 
one. We’re talking about customer support and service. This is where 
YouTube can truly shine. Your customer will no doubt have ques-
tions about your product, application scenarios, maintenance, and so 

287

much more. That’s okay and perfectly normal, so help them out. For 
example, the auto manufacturer Audi does a great job with customer 
service on YouTube, as shown in Figure 12-4. As car electronics became 
more advanced and sophisticated, Audi stepped up as one of the first 
companies to offer tutorial videos. Check out the tutorial videos at 
www.youtube.com/AudiofAmerica.
When your customers visit your YouTube channel for product support, 
they also see your new product offerings — which is an excellent upsell 
or referral opportunity.
Rob and Theresa spend much of their time working with brands and agen-
cies on YouTube for business. One of the top challenges they face is getting 
companies to move beyond producing content for only the top of the funnel 
(refer to Figure 12-3). Creating awareness is a necessary marketing function 
and has well served brand advertisers targeting television audiences for 
many years. The digital world, however, expects something more from the 
content on your YouTube channel. Give them an authentic video experience, 
not an isolated 15-second ad. Moving beyond dumping repurposed one-off 
commercials on YouTube to a more holistic, funnel-based approach is the 
most important way to help your business.
Effective content doesn’t have to be all about products, either. American 
Express (www.youtube.com/AmericanExpress) does an outstanding job 
of producing channel content that provides important advice for small busi-
nesses, as shown in Figure 12-5. Doing so isn’t the core business of a credit

card company such as American Express, but it’s obviously quite important 
to its target audience. Always remember that your best content aligns with 
your audience’s needs.
Video optimization and effective channel management are essential to 
­effective business on YouTube. For more on these topics, check out 
Chapter 9, where you can find out all about the importance of video 
­thumbnails, metadata, playlists, and more.
Community and content creators
If you have an interesting product or service that people are passionate 
about, there’s likely to be a conversation about it on YouTube. Chances 
are good that there will be many conversations and they’ll be happening 
whether or not you’re involved. This situation often comes across as quite 
strange to companies that are accustomed to controlling the business con-
versation around their brands and products. Though YouTube shatters  
that notion of control, don’t be afraid of having others talk about you: They 
may be your army of brand champions — and the best salespeople you’ve 
ever had.

 Chapter 12: How and Why Businesses Use YouTube 
One of the most interesting business segments found on YouTube is the 
beauty industry. Now, before you roll your eyes and close this book because 
your business has nothing to do with mascara and eyeliner, take a moment 
to reconsider the implications. The dynamics of the beauty industry show 
where the future of YouTube is for business: independent creators producing 
fantastic content for a passionate and purchase-motivated fan base. These 
creators, or beauty vloggers, also know the importance of subscribers.  
Figure 12-6 shows the number of subscribers for the top beauty brands 
versus the top independent beauty vloggers. It’s not even close: The audi-
ence often prefers authentic, independent voices.
In many industries, you’ll find a strong, independent, and creative force 
where YouTube creators are crafting content in your topic space. Don’t fear 
that force. In fact, you can embrace the representatives of that force by doing 
the following:
✓
✓Include their content in your playlists. This is the ultimate tip of the 
hat to independent creators.
✓
✓Comment on their channel. Add to their conversation in a meaningful 
way.
✓
✓Respect their independence. They may show your products and your 
competitors’ in the same video. Don’t ask them to do otherwise. Creators 
do what is best for their audience.
✓
✓Consider sponsorship or another type of promotion. Whether you are 
the creator or the brand, only enter into partnerships that support your 
channel objectives and provide your audience with an experience that 
will keep them coming back for more. (See Bonus Chapter 1 for more 
information on sponsorships.)

Part IV: YouTube Channels Are Serious Business 
If you’re in independent creator in your own right, keep in mind that brands 
and larger companies may not be in a position to work like you do because 
they have neither the content production flexibility nor the means to engage 
with subscribers at the same level of intimacy you may have.
Brands steer clear of vloggers who want something — whether it’s product 
bling or cold, hard cash — in exchange for a favorable review. You may not 
get the audience engagement if the vlogger isn’t really into your product or 
services because the audience can tell when it is not authentic content.
Brands versus vloggers
Recently, Pixability conducted a compre-
hensive study of the beauty industry, one of 
the most active and leading-edge industries 
in the digital video marketplace. The report, 
titled Beauty on YouTube: How YouTube Is 
Radically Transforming the Beauty Industry 
and What That Means for Brands, identified 
and analyzed how 168 major beauty brands 
and 45,000 YouTube beauty-focused personali-
ties manage, produce, and socialize more than 
877,000 makeup videos and hair, skin, and nail 
care videos. (See the blurb about the report in 
the sidebar figure.) The report highlights strik-
ing differences in impact between those who 
manufacture products and those who manufac-
ture videos about products. Some of the find-
ings are listed here:
Beauty brands own a surprisingly small share 
of YouTube’s audience.
✓
✓Beauty brands on YouTube typically get far 
less views and engagement compared to 
vloggers talking about beauty, thus making 
the brands’ impact on the space smaller 
than the independent creators.
✓
✓Beauty brands control only 3 percent of 
YouTube’s 14.9 billion beauty-related video 
views.
✓
✓YouTube vloggers and other beauty 
­content creators control 97 percent of 
­conversations around beauty and brands 
on YouTube.
✓
✓Top beauty brands partner with key YouTube 
content creators in addition to running 
YouTube advertising campaigns to increase 
their YouTube brand footprints by way of 
organic views and user-generated content.
Beauty brands need to consistently create a 
wider variety of YouTube content — and more 
of it.
✓
✓YouTube’s top beauty vloggers have ten times 
more videos on their channels than beauty 
brands manage to place on their channels.
✓
✓Top beauty vloggers publish new YouTube 
content seven times more frequently than 
beauty brands do.
✓
✓Beauty brands are underinvesting in 
YouTube’s popular long-format beauty tutori-
als and seasonal events and are overinvest-
ing in publishing less popular ­commercials.
✓
✓YouTube’s top quartile of beauty brands 
vary video lengths five times more than the 
bottom quartile of beauty brands.

291

 Chapter 12: How and Why Businesses Use YouTube 
Beauty brands aren’t being found on YouTube.
✓
✓Beauty brands show up only 2.5 percent 
of the time in YouTube search results for 
popular beauty keywords.
✓
✓YouTube’s top beauty-brand creators use 
seven times more playlists and 170 percent 
more metadata tags than the bottom quar-
tile of beauty brands, to ensure that video 
content is discoverable on YouTube.
Audience engagement is the key to beauty-
brand marketing success on YouTube.
✓
✓YouTube’s top 25 beauty vloggers possess 
115 times more subscribers and receive 
2,600 percent more comments on average 
than beauty brand channels.
✓
✓YouTube’s top beauty-brand quartile suc-
cessfully engages with target audiences to 
receive 16 times more views per video than 
the bottom quartile.

✓Top-performing beauty brands focus on 
converting YouTube views into sales by 
including conversion links 260 percent 
more often than less successful beauty 
brand performers on YouTube.

Advertising
Discoverability — the ease with which potential viewers can find your 
­content — is crucial on YouTube. Your content needs to be easy to find if 
you want to capture the most engaged target audience. You can let discover-
ability grow organically over time on its own by way of community, engage-
ment, watch time, and more. Sometimes, though, the business world doesn’t 
work at that organic speed, so you may need to add a bit of “fertilizer” to 
help the process move a little faster. That’s what YouTube advertising is all 
about: Apply some cash to help get your content in front of viewers who may 
turn into customers or avid viewers.
As a YouTube channel manager, you need to decide whether advertising  
will work for you and figure out which side of the business ad equation 
you’re on:
✓
✓Publisher: You’re a content creator looking to monetize your YouTube 
channel by having appropriate ads placed against it.
✓
✓Advertiser: You want people to become aware of your channel and 
­consume more of your content, perhaps even subscribe. Maybe you 
have a product and you want viewers to buy something — at a store, 
online, or via a business partner.
Paid, owned, earned
If you hang out around marketers often enough, 
you’ll hear them talk about paid, owned, and 
earned media. Each of these three categories 
plays an important but related role in your busi-
ness strategy, so this is as good a time as any to 
figure out exactly what the terms mean. They’re 
easier to understand if you change the order a 
bit, though:
✓
✓Owned consists of the web properties and 
resources you control, which includes your 
website and your YouTube channel.
✓
✓Earned is what your customers are saying 
about you and how they engage with your 
channel. From the YouTube perspec-
tive, this one includes videos about your 
­products that are produced by independent 
creators.
✓
✓Paid here means “paid advertising.” The 
good part about the paid category is that 
you can experiment and discover audi-
ences that may not find your channel and 
content organically. Paid works well on 
YouTube because it can drive meaningful 
views, help add subscribers, and increase 
sales.
All three media — paid, owned, and earned — 
feed off one another, so your YouTube strategy 
and your business strategy should always take 
all of them into account.

293

 Chapter 12: How and Why Businesses Use YouTube 
Chapters 13 and 14 have lots more detail about YouTube advertising from 
both sides, but for now just remember that there are no hard-and-fast rules 
or thick walls between publishers and advertisers. You may find your busi-
ness is okay doing a little of both.
Effective advertising is all about measurement, so you’ll use YouTube 
Analytics extensively to make sure you’re getting the most out of your ad 
dollars or maximizing your monetization potential. (For more on YouTube 
Analytics, check out Chapter 11.)
Don’t view YouTube advertising as an isolated activity. Done correctly, an 
outstanding ad campaign not only moves the sales meter in the right direc-
tion but also generates important free follow-on channel activities, like 
additional playlist views and subscriptions from engaged viewers, which 
are critical to increasing discoverability. Unlike other paid media, YouTube 
advertising helps organic growth.
If you’re a creator who’s working with a brand or another type of sponsor, be 
transparent about it. Your success on YouTube is closely tied to your authen-
ticity and openness. Getting a sponsorship deal and placing products in your 
videos is fine, as long as your audience knows what’s going on. You’ll find 
your YouTube audience extremely loyal — but unforgiving (and unsubscrib-
ing) if they feel misled in any way. If you’re a brand or sponsor, your brand 
reputation on YouTube should be treated with the same care you’d expend 
anywhere else. Be conscious of your YouTube partners.
Integrating YouTube with  
Other Campaigns
Broadcast television, cable, newspapers, magazines, and direct mail may not 
have the same impact they once did, but they’re not going away anytime soon, 
either. And don’t forget your email and display campaigns: They’re probably 
an important part of your business strategy, so you should nurture them. If 
you’re holding special events and conferences, keep them coming, too. The 
point is that YouTube is a great way to not only integrate all your diverse 
­business campaigns but also make them more effective and ­memorable.
Cross-media integration
To see what an effective integrated business campaign might look like 
on YouTube, look no further than the campaign put together by the NBA

(www.youtube.com/nba), one of the better sports leagues on YouTube. The 
NBA does many things well for its business, including
✓
✓Content generation: The NBA updates its YouTube content quite fre-
quently, often releasing custom highlights just for its YouTube audience. 
It’s a useful example of how to repurpose TV content for a YouTube 
audience.
✓
✓Promotion integration: The NBA’s YouTube channel sections are always 
up to date with the newest content, tentpole events — seasonal or timely 
content releases around an event, playoffs for example — and more. If 
the NBA is doing something on court or off court, it’s guaranteed to be 
on YouTube.
✓
✓Video optimization: Well-chosen, accurate, custom thumbnails entice 
viewers to click and watch. Many of the NBA’s videos also have other 
interactive elements, such as annotations and end-cards.
✓
✓Channel monetization: The NBA knows how to make money, and it has 
taken that formula to YouTube. You’ll see extensive use of pre-roll ads 
against its channel content. (The idea behind pre-roll video ads is that 
they play before the NBA video assets, and the channel then earns earns 
money from each view of an ad.)

 Chapter 12: How and Why Businesses Use YouTube 
YouTube isn’t television (or cable)
Business professionals who treat their YouTube channels as though they’re 
television channels are the ones who complain most loudly about the results. 
The truth is that television commercials just don’t perform well in terms 
of both views and engagement on YouTube. Rather than do what the NBA 
has been doing — repurposing great content specifically for its fan base on 
YouTube — many brands simply plop down their TV ad product on YouTube 
and expect miracles to happen. It just doesn’t work that way. If you’re coming 
from the world of television advertising and programming, look through the 
YouTube lens, not the TV camera. Figure 12-8 highlights some big differences 
between YouTube and television.
According to Nielsen, one of the major media-measurement companies, 
YouTube reaches more 18-to-34-year-olds than any cable network. This 
shows something important: Younger audiences aren’t consuming traditional 
media in the same old way. Many people, affectionately known as cord cutters, 
no longer even subscribe to cable. They are, however, watching a good deal 
of video by way of YouTube, Hulu, Vimeo, Facebook, and other online video 
providers.
But don’t assume that people outside this age bracket aren’t consuming 
online video. Remember to use demographics as a guide, not as a rule. If your 
content is relevant and your target audience is online, you’ll get the business 
results you want.
Keep in mind as well, when migrating from television to YouTube, that many 
of the traditional metrics associated with performance, especially those 
around viewership and advertising, differ radically between the two plat-
forms. TV tends to focus on impressions, which measures how many people 
may have been exposed to a program or an ad. The dominant metrics on 
YouTube are how many people actually watched your content and your ads.
Figure 12-8: 
YouTube 
and 
­television 
comparison.

296
Part IV: YouTube Channels Are Serious Business 
You don’t measure distance with your bathroom scale, so don’t measure 
your media the wrong way, either. Use the proper measurement in the digital 
world. Use television metrics for TV, and YouTube metrics for your channel. 
For more on YouTube metrics, see Chapter 11.
YouTube isn’t Google, either
It’s a fact: How a viewer searches on YouTube is different from how a viewer 
searches on Google. (Don’t believe us? Take another look at Figure 12-2.) 
Google is indeed the number one search engine and YouTube is the number 
two, but it’s how viewers search that makes them so vastly different.
It’s worth repeating: Brand and product decisions are being made on 
YouTube, and purchase decisions are being made on Google.
From an advertising perspective, YouTube advertising — specifically, 
TrueView by way of AdWords for Video — behaves much differently from tra-
ditional AdWords. You get all the details in Chapter 13. It’s important to note, 
though, that effective business management requires understanding the dif-
ference between traditional search and display for business, compared with 
YouTube search, display, engagement, subscriptions, and views.

any channel managers often believe that after their channels are set 
up, their view counts are increasing, their subscriptions are growing, 
and engagement is up, they can then sit back and focus on making some con-
tent. Well, that’s not exactly the case. You have another powerful resource  
in your tool chest that can potentially take your channel to the next level:  
It’s advertising.
Now, before you close this book with a sigh, sure as sure can be that adver-
tising is nothing more than a fancy way of throwing away money and annoy-
ing people, you’d better think again. YouTube advertising is highly effective 
because it allows you to reach a large part of your target audience who may 
not have discovered your channel and your content organically — without 
the help of advertising, in other words.
Unlike many types of advertising, well‐run YouTube ad campaigns end up 
delivering not only views but also increased watch time and additional sub-
scriber growth, both of which are great for your channel in YouTube’s eyes. 
Why? Because effective YouTube advertising can help with discoverability, 
creating a virtuous cycle for your channel. A well‐targeted ad campaign lets 
the right kind of viewers discover your channel — those you really want to 
reach. Once they subscribe and watch other videos on your channel after 

298
Part IV: YouTube Channels Are Serious Business 
seeing your ads, your channel’s search ranking will improve, which in turn 
will let other viewers with similar interests discover your content.
YouTube advertising builds on Google’s successful AdWords product — 
one of the world’s most popular advertising platforms. The part that ties 
into YouTube is AdWords for Video. As you can probably imagine, many ad 
types can be used with YouTube. Chances are good that you’ve seen the 
video masthead ad on YouTube’s home page or animated ad overlays over 
the lower center area of YouTube videos. This chapter focuses on the spe-
cific ad types you configure via AdWords for Video. They’re called YouTube 
TrueView ads.
YouTube TrueView ads are different from many other types of ads because 
you as the advertiser pay only if the viewer does something concrete, such 
as watch a video ad or click on a display ad. TrueView ads include both video 
and display ad formats. In other words, some ads use videos, and others 
use regular display ads, with just a static image and some text. A pre‐roll ad 
is a video ad that is shown immediately before displaying the video that the 
viewer clicked to see. If you’ve been on YouTube, you’ve seen them. They’re 
the ones that let you skip off after 5 seconds. Concerned that tons of people 
are sure to skip off after the first 5 seconds? Don’t be. The good part is that 
you pay only for the viewers who choose to watch rather than those who 
skip off. In other words, you pay only for viewers who have a strong interest 
in the ad you’ve put in front of them.
Most channel managers should have no problem setting up an ad campaign 
for YouTube. Though you have to complete quite a few steps to set up an ad, 
most of the time you can simply use the default values for each step. Over 
time, you tweak the settings to produce even better results, but for your first 
campaign, we recommend sticking with the defaults.
Google Display Network
You’re not restricted to YouTube for your 
TrueView ads. Google also has the Google 
Display Network (GDN), a massive, worldwide 
collection of more than 2 million websites that 
allow display and video advertising. Ads on the 
GDN can support all screen types, including 
desktop computers, laptops, tablets, and smart­
phones. A majority of the world’s most heavily 
trafficked websites are part of the GDN, but that 
doesn’t ensure that you’ll be able to run place­
ments on only the best sites.
You have the option during the YouTube ad 
campaign setup to include the GDN for place­
ment of your ads. When setting up targeting 
groups for your ads, you can also itemize spe­
cific placement within YouTube and within the 
GDN. The GDN supports all types TrueView ads.

 Chapter 13: Expanding Your Audience through YouTube Advertising
Understanding YouTube Advertising
To understand YouTube advertising, you need to know a little bit about 
Google advertising. You may believe that Google is simply a big search 
engine company, but it’s really a big advertising company — that’s where 
it makes its money. The same logic holds true for YouTube. People think 
of it as an amazing video site, but at its core, it’s really a major advertising 
­platform.
A fortune is being spent and made on YouTube. You know all those YouTube 
stars like PewDiePie, Jenna Marbles, and Ray William Johnson? They’re earn-
ing the lion’s share of their money from advertising. Granted, they’re also 
now signing other types of lucrative endorsement deals, but their YouTube 
fame led to their first fortune — and that came from advertising.
There are two sides to the advertising equation:
✓
✓Advertiser: The person or organization paying for and placing the ads
✓
✓Publisher: The person or organization whose property has the ad 
placed on it and who receives a cut of revenue from the ad
On YouTube, you can be an advertiser or a publisher, or both. In this 
­chapter, you can read about the advertiser side. Chapter 14 tells you all 
about the publisher side.
Other YouTube ad formats and pricing models
TrueView in‐stream and in‐display aren’t the 
only ad types available on YouTube, but they’re 
highly effective for many advertisers because 
they are charged only when a viewer watches 
the whole ad or — for longer ads — at least 
the first 30 seconds. There are other types of 
ads, however, such as a masthead (the big ad 
that shows up on the YouTube home page) or 
an in‐video overlay (an ad that appears in the 
lower center of a video and acts like an annota­
tion). For more on these (and other) ad types, go 
to www.youtube.com/yt/advertise/. 
You may also want to check out Google 
AdWords For Dummies, by Howie Jacobson, 
Joel McDonald, and Kristie McDonald (John 
Wiley & Sons, Inc.). It provides all the details 
you need to become an AdWords guru.
TrueView ads’ claim to fame is that they use cost 
per view (CPV) pricing. Other ad types may have 
different pricing methods, including cost per 
thousand impressions, also known as CPM. As 
you advertise more, it’s worth your time to explore 
all ad types available via Google for YouTube.

300
Part IV: YouTube Channels Are Serious Business 
Google and YouTube help on both sides of the advertising equation and have 
product offerings for both. On the advertiser side, you use Google AdWords 
for Video, which we cover later in this chapter. On the publisher side, you 
use Google AdSense to manage how your YouTube channel receives ads.  
(For more on Google AdSense in a YouTube context, check out Chapter 14.) 
Don’t assume that you have to connect with publishers directly. Google acts 
as an intermediary — for a share of your profits, of course. (It’s more proof 
that nothing in this life is ever free.)
Recognizing the importance of ad policy
If you’re new to YouTube advertising, take a few minutes to understand ad 
policy, which basically states that advertising should conform to certain 
behavioral standards. (Go to http://support.google.com/adword 
spolicy for details.) Better yet, check out Chapter 9, which talks in some 
detail about the YouTube community guidelines — rules for everything from 
obscene material to copyright infringement and privacy controls. Google 
does its utmost to ensure that appropriate and relevant ads are placed,  
but both advertisers and publishers have further control as well.
Community guidelines are upheld nonstop, all day and all year. Violations not 
only jeopardize your ability to advertise, but you also risk your channel being 
taken down.
In addition to being in line with the YouTube community guidelines, ads 
must conform to technical guidelines and specification. This helps ensure 
both consistency and fairness across the YouTube platform; it also lowers 
the likelihood that you’ll annoy viewers. Ad format details can be found at 
http://support.google.com/displayspecs.
Looking at YouTube ad types
This chapter concentrates on YouTube TrueView ads. These formats work 
well for many advertisers because charges occur only when a viewer watches 
an ad or clicks on a video thumbnail. This is a signal of a higher degree of 
audience interest, making those viewers much better targets for your ads.
YouTube TrueView ads come in two flavors: in‐stream ads and in‐display ads. 
In‐stream ads work a bit like TV commercials. Before users can see the video 
they want to watch, they have to watch your video ad first. This is known 
as a pre‐roll ad. YouTube lets users skip an in‐stream ad after 5 seconds, but 
they can also click on the call to action banner to go directly to your website 
or YouTube channel.

301

 Chapter 13: Expanding Your Audience through YouTube Advertising
As for the in‐display ads, they appear on search results pages and on YouTube 
Watch pages and are marked with a gold AD icon. (Figure 13-1 shows a typical 
example of an in‐display ad above the organic search results.)
Figure 13-1:

Since YouTube prioritizes videos with longer viewer session watch times and 
high engagement rates in its search results, highly engaged viewers from paid 
ads can support your SEO efforts.
You can go to http://support.google.com/youtube to learn all 
about the other ad types. Remember that YouTube TrueView ads are 
a great way to start your advertising work. To learn more about all the 
YouTube ad types, check out the YouTube media guidebook from Pixability, 
a company that specializes in YouTube marketing and advertising: 
www.pixability.com/industry‐studies/mediaguidebook/.
Planning for Advertising
Advertising on YouTube requires some familiarity with Google AdWords. 
(Luckily for you, you can achieve the necessary level of familiarity simply 
by reading this chapter.) First and foremost, you need a Google AdWords 
account, which you can easily access via your regular Google account.  

302
Part IV: YouTube Channels Are Serious Business 
Note, however, that you need to explicitly tie your AdWords account to your 
YouTube account. (Don’t worry: We show you how to do that as well.)
You don’t need to learn all about AdWords to work your YouTube advertis-
ing magic. However, if you have a commerce website and need to drive more 
traffic, you may want to consider learning a lot more. In that case, we recom-
mend Google AdWords For Dummies, by Howie Jacobson, Joel McDonald, and 
Kristie McDonald (John Wiley and Sons, Inc.).
Creating an AdWords account
Creating an AdWords account used to be pretty involved, but that was then. 
Fortunately, Google has greatly simplified the process of opening a new 
AdWords account:
1.	Point your web browser to http://adwords.google.com/video.
2.	(Optional) Choose a language other than English (US) from the  
drop‐down on the bottom right.
Google translates the page into that language.
3.	Log in with your Google account.
Normally you’d use the same Google account you’d use to manage your 
YouTube channel.
If you already have a Google account for Gmail, YouTube, or another 
Google service, you can use it for your AdWords account. If you’re a 
Gmail junkie, for example, connect the accounts so that you don’t sign 
yourself out of AdWords every time you check your mail. If you already 
have a Google Analytics account (a free service that measures what visi-
tors do on your website), the email address of your AdWords account 
must be the same as your Analytics admin user email.
4.	Click the Skip the Guided Setup link.
This setup process is designed for search advertising, not video ads, so 
you don’t need to go through it.
5.	In the new screen that appears, select your time zone and currency 
from the drop‐down lists and then click the Save and Continue button. 
(See Figure 13-2.)
Google might change the sign‐up process and its billing practices at any 
time, so take the preceding instructions with a grain of salt. They may be 
accurate for years — or they may be out of date one week after this book 
shows up in the bookstore.

 Chapter 13: Expanding Your Audience through YouTube Advertising
Linking your AdWords account  
and YouTube channel
For your YouTube advertising project, you should link your AdWords 
account with your YouTube channel to access deeper ad analytics. A well‐
run YouTube ad campaign produces lots of views, subscriptions, engage-
ments, and clicks. By linking your accounts, you have access to much deeper 
­statistics.
To link your accounts, follow these steps:
1.	Log in to your AdWords account.
2.	Copy your customer ID.
An AdWords customer ID is a three‐part number that uniquely identi-
fies your AdWords account. You’ll find it in the top right corner of your 
AdWords page, right above your email address and to the left of the 
account settings icon.
3.	Log on to your YouTube account.
4.	On your YouTube page, click your channel’s icon and then choose 
Creator Studio from the menu that appears.
Doing so brings up the Creator Studio dashboard.
Figure 13-2: 
Setting up 
an AdWords 
for Video 
account.

304
Part IV: YouTube Channels Are Serious Business 
5.	In the Navigation menu on the left, click the Channel section of 
Creator Studio.
The Channel section expands to show its subsections.
6.	Click the (newly revealed) Advanced heading in the Channel section.
7.	Click the Link an AdWords account button.
Doing so brings up the Link an AdWords for Video Account dialog box, as 
shown in Figure 13-3.
8.	Paste the customer ID that you copied in Step 2 into the dialog box’s 
Customer ID text field.
9.	Click the Next button.
A new dialog box with all the linkage details appears, as shown in  
Figure 13-4.
10.	Enter a descriptive name of the AdWords account you’re linking into 
the Assign a Name to the AdWords Account text field.
11.	Select the account permissions.
Linking your AdWords and YouTube accounts gives you access to 
­additional capabilities. These include
• View counts and call‐to‐action, which will provide you with more 
detailed information about video views and will let you add a 
­clickable call‐to‐action button to your video ads.
• Remarket, which will enable you to show your ad to viewers who 
previously visited your channel.
• Engagement, which shows you what viewers do after seeing  
your ad
We recommend checking all options as part of your initial campaigns.
12.	Click Finish.
Your AdWords account is now linked with your YouTube channel, and 
your permissions settings are saved.
You can unlink the AdWords account that you associated with your YouTube 
channel at any point, if you feel so inclined. Just remember that, by unlink-
ing your accounts, you lose access to earned metrics, which measure the 
impact your advertising has had on important channel metrics such as views 
and subscriptions. You can find out more about earned metrics later in this 
­chapter.

Determining Your Ad Targets
Before starting your campaign, you have to determine where you want 
your ads placed. This is known as ad targeting. AdWords for Video provides 
extremely rich and powerful targeting options. Each set of options is known 
as a targeting group, and you can use multiple, simultaneous targeting groups 
in the same campaign.
Running a YouTube ad campaign isn’t like placing an ad in a magazine or a 
commercial on television, where the ad is placed and you’re done. Effective 
digital marketing — marketing that relies on YouTube and on display and 
search advertising — allows advertisers to constantly “tune” ad performance 
by making adjustments throughout the campaign, which may include chang-
ing the targets.
You can set up multiple targeting groups throughout a campaign, so don’t 
try to be exhaustive out of the chute. You can even share or update target 
groups among campaigns, which allows you to streamline your campaign 
setup and management.
Setting up general targeting
To get started with YouTube TrueView advertising, you need to get a handle 
on the basics of ad targeting. Your default AdWords for Video setup lets you 
target using the following criteria:
✓
✓Demographics: This option lets you select your audience characteris-
tics by age, gender, and parental status, as shown in Figure 13-5. Always 
choose the age and gender of your targeting audience, if you know it.
YouTube does not let you target viewers under the age 18. You can, 
however, make some assumptions that parents with young children 
will share devices (and, by default, Google accounts) with their kids. 
(Parental status targeting isn’t available in all countries.)
✓
✓Interests: This option lets you identify specific viewer characteristics 
that you want targeted. Interest groups allow you to target viewers who 
are interested in that topic even when they are not viewing content 
about that topic. Google determines viewers’ interests by analyzing the 
type of videos they’re watching and by the websites they’re visiting.
✓
✓Keywords: This option lets you target videos that are relevant to the 
keywords you itemize. For example, if you have a video ad for your 
­pottery product, pottery would then be a good keyword to add to your 
campaign.

307

 Chapter 13: Expanding Your Audience through YouTube Advertising
Start off with broad keywords, you can always add in more niche terms 
after testing. Keywords are used to deliver ads for both YouTube search 
and watch, along with the Google Display Network.
Adding a minus sign (–) in front a keyword ensures that your ad won’t 
show against content that matches this keyword. If you don’t want 
your audience to be reminded of the fact that pottery might break,  
you might enter –glue as a keyword to filter out any videos dealing 
with glue.
We’re giving you the lay of the land right now when it comes to prepar-
ing for your YouTube ad campaign. As for the nuts and bolts of setting 
up a YouTube ad campaign, we cover that topic a bit later in this chapter 
(in the section that just happens to be entitled “Setting Up a YouTube Ad 
Campaign”).
Configuring more narrow targeting
Even though general targeting may work for your campaign, you’ll probably 
get better results by using more narrow targeting. AdWords for Video lets 
you get more detailed and select your targets by letting you focus on the 
­following categories.
Figure 13-5: 
Your 
AdWords

demo­
graphic 
targeting 
options.

308
Part IV: YouTube Channels Are Serious Business 
✓
✓Topics: You can target specific content on either YouTube or the GDN 
corresponding to the selected topic. When configuring topic‐based target-
ing, you can go broadly, such as Home & Garden, or be more specific in 
the category by selecting Rugs & Carpets under the Home Furnishings 
subcategory. (Note that you can select different topics in the same group.)
Topic‐based targeting applies only to video content on YouTube and the 
GDN, not to display ads.
✓
✓Remarketing: You can target viewers who have interacted with your 
channel, videos, or website. That means they have done one of the 
­following:
• Viewed your content
• Looked at your ads
• Engaged with your videos
• Visited your channel
• Subscribed (or unsubscribed) from your channel
By linking your AdWords for Video and YouTube accounts, you can 
remarket to these viewers or visitors. You target with remarketing by 
­creating a remarketing list, which you can find out about in the next 
­section. You can use several different remarketing lists in the same 
­advertising campaign.
Remarketing is just a fancy term for targeting users who have already 
interacted with you. Google and YouTube privacy rules prevent you from 
knowing who they specifically are, but that shouldn’t prevent you from 
giving those remarketed viewers a more customized ad experience. For 
example, if viewers have watched a particular video, you can serve them 
a different video ad next, rather than the same one.
You can also remarket to viewers who have watched videos similar to the 
ones on your channel. This strategy significantly increases the reach of 
your ads.
AdWords for Video treats remarketing lists and interest groups together, 
so have an interest group set up if you’re using remarketing.
✓
✓Placements: You can create a list of YouTube channels, specific videos, 
exact websites, or itemized pages in the GDN where you want your ad 
served. This is an excellent way to ensure that your content is appear-
ing in the right places next to videos about specific topics. (Placements 
apply only to YouTube videos and to the GDN, not to YouTube Search.)
To access your more advanced targeting options, click on the Narrow Your 
Targeting (Optional) drop‐down menu, as shown in Figure 13-6.

Navigating the AdWords for Video Page
AdWords for Video has a powerful interface that lets you set up and check the 
status of your campaigns. Using this single interface, you can look at the perfor-
mance of all your campaigns (see Figure 13-7) or dive into a particular campaign.
Exploring the Campaign navigation menu
The Campaign navigation menu appears on the left side of the page (refer to 
Figure 13-7) and consists of these sections:
✓
✓All online campaigns: This one shows all your AdWords campaigns, 
including display campaigns.
✓
✓All video campaigns: This option limits the view to just your AdWords for 
Video campaigns. By default, you see all your video campaigns. If you want 
the details about a specific campaign, simply click on the campaign name.
✓
✓Shared libraries: Here you’ll find a list of YouTube accounts and video 
remarketing lists. If you haven’t linked your AdWords account with your 
YouTube account yet, you can start that process by selecting the Linked 
YouTube Accounts option. If your campaigns will include remarketing, 
you can set that up by clicking the Video Remarketing Lists option.
✓
✓Help: This option offers additional help for AdWords for video.

If you’re familiar with the YouTube Analytics interface, you may see some 
similarities. For example, you can filter your results using the date pull‐down 
in the top right corner, just as you would with YouTube Analytics.
Looking at your campaign details
If you’ve clicked on All Video Campaigns or on a specific campaign, you see 
some (or all) of the following tabs appear in the Details section in the main 
pane of the interface window:
✓
✓Campaigns: This tab shows up only when you choose All Video 
Campaigns. You use this tab to set up a campaign.
✓
✓Ads: This tab displays your actual ads. You can have multiple ads 
­running in a campaign.
✓
✓Videos: This tab lists the videos that are used as your ads.
✓
✓Targets: This tab lists your targeting groups.
✓
✓Settings: This tab shows up only when you click a specific campaign;  
it details such areas as budget and scheduling.
If you have many more tabs showing than what we list here, you’ve likely 
clicked All Online Campaigns. Simply click All Video Campaigns in the 
Navigation menu on the left side to get to the right place.

✓Details buttons: These are found under the main tabs and allow you to
• View specific campaign, ad, and targeting information
• Control chart visibility
• Upload campaign configuration data (for power users who enjoy 
using spreadsheets)
• Download campaign reporting metrics to a spreadsheet
Depending on which tabs or Details button you select, you may (or may 
not) see the following interface details.
✓
✓Chart: After you’ve determined what to analyze, you can get lots of 
information with some fairly flexible graphical representations of your 
campaign performance — your views, for example, cost per views, 
impressions, and more. (An Analytics Chart section is shown in  
Figure 13-8.)
✓
✓Details section: This section appears when you scroll down on the page. 
It shows itemized details that correspond to the campaign details, such 
as lists of campaigns that are running or stopped, ads, videos, and target 
groups.

Setting Up a YouTube Ad Campaign
So you’ve informed yourself about the costs and benefits of YouTube adver-
tising and decided to give it a shot. We can only say, “Smart move.” Now it’s 
time to get your hands dirty and set up your first YouTube ad campaign.
Going with a general campaign
Unfortunately, no one has yet invented a robot that sets up YouTube video 
ads for you. The process might sound a bit complicated at first because 
AdWords for Video is quite powerful, but it’s fairly easy to start your first 
campaign. To set up a new YouTube ad, follow these steps:
1.	Log in to https://adwords.google.com/video.
If you haven’t created an AdWords account yet, do so by following the 
instructions in the “Creating an AdWords account” section, earlier in this 
chapter.
2.	Click the + Campaign button at the top of the Details section.
A Create New Video Campaign page appears onscreen.
3.	(Optional) Click the Load Settings button if you have an earlier 
­campaign and you want to reuse some of its configuration data.
As you become more proficient in running campaigns, you can save time 
and automatically populate new campaign fields by reusing older con-
tent. You can also change the settings for the campaign even after you’ve 
autoloaded it.
4.	Enter a name for your campaign in the Campaign Name field.
Choose a relevant and informative name such as Acme Electric Z500 
Product Launch as opposed to Campaign #1. If you have special target-
ing, add words such as mobile or desktop to the campaign name. This will 
make it easier to identify and manage these particular campaigns later in 
the list of all your campaigns.
Don’t rush through the naming process; you want to be as descriptive as 
possible. Trust us: You’re sure to forget important campaign details even 
if you have only a few campaigns.
5.	Enter your daily budget in the Budget field.
This is the amount you’re willing to spend per day on your ads. You can 
increase or decrease the budget at any time, so enter an amount that you 
feel comfortable to experiment with. Start with a small amount, such as 
$50, and increase it gradually as you start seeing the results you want.

6.	Pick your ad delivery method.
You set the rate at which your ads are served over the course of a day. 
Click Standard if you want them spread evenly over your ad day. Select 
Accelerated to deliver your ads rapidly.
Your ad budget is daily. If you run an accelerated campaign and max out 
your daily budget, your ads stop for the day and start up again during the 
next day you’re serving ads.
7.	Select your networks.
These are the types of places where your ads will appear.
As a YouTube advertiser, you have three choices for where your ads are 
shown:
	
1.	YouTube Search: You get to post your TrueView ads in search 
­queries. The only allowed ad type is TrueView in‐display.
	
2.	YouTube Videos: You run either in‐stream video ads against 
YouTube videos or in‐display ads on the YouTube Watch page.
	
3.	Google Display Network: You have to also select the YouTube 
Video network option above. The GDN supports both in‐stream 
and in‐display ad formats.
8.	Pick your locations.
Don’t let the simple interface fool you. You have the option to pick world-
wide, United States, or Canada, but when you click Let Me Choose, you’re 
presented with a powerful interface that lets you do precision location 
targeting of your ads, down to the city or area level. (To see how specific 
geo location targeting can get, check out Figure 13-9.) You can mix and 
match locations, but you also have the option to exclude certain areas.
You can not only run ads on a specific region but also put together 
­simultaneous campaigns with region‐specific offers.
9.	Choose the language of the viewers who will see your ads.
This step ensures that your ad appears only in places where the language 
of the ad matches the language of the targeted audience — an important 
consideration when you’re dealing with GDN targeting.
10.	(Optional) Enter the video ad you want to use.
If you already know which of your existing videos you want to use for 
your campaign, select it here. The easiest way is to copy the URL of your 
video (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0XiC830EhHQ, for 
example) and paste it into this field.
Any video that you want to use for your ad campaign has to be previ-
ously uploaded to your YouTube channel. If you haven’t done this yet 
or if you want to decide later which video to use, you can leave this field 
empty for now.

314

You can always enter a video later or add more than one video to an 
existing campaign. See the “Placing and Managing Your Ads” section, 
later in this chapter, for all the details on ad configuration.
11.	Select the platform and carrier on which the ad can appear.
Your target audience may prefer one platform or carrier over another. 
AdWords for Video therefore lets you specify desktops, smartphones, or 
tablets as targets and choose to place ads only on specific mobile provid-
ers by country, such as AT&T, Verizon, or others in the United States.
12.	Configure mobile bid adjustments.
Always strive to get the best mix of ads for your ad campaign. If you 
discover that mobile ads are your least successful ad type, you can 
use mobile bid adjustments to change the ratio of mobile ads all the 
way down to 0 percent so that none of your ads shows on mobile. (Just 
set your mobile bid adjustment to –100 percent.) If mobile ads end up 
being quite successful, you may want to adjust the bid +20 percent; this 
number allows your maximum bid to raise by 20 percent for mobile.
13.	Schedule when your ad runs.
You get to pick when your ad campaign starts and ends, along with the 
days and times you want it to run. You can leave this option empty and 
manually start and end campaigns as needed.

 Chapter 13: Expanding Your Audience through YouTube Advertising
Ad scheduling is helpful if you know when your viewers are watching and 
would likely see your ads. For example, if you’re in the beauty or fashion 
business and you want to target women getting ready for work, you’d 
likely schedule your ads for weekday mornings. This strategy is espe-
cially helpful if you accelerate your ads; you don’t want to burn up all 
your budget before your core target audience is even awake.
14.	Manage your ad delivery.
This step is advanced stuff, so you may want to leave the default settings 
for your initial campaign. Here’s what’s involved:
• Ad rotation: This feature determines how often your ad is served 
in relation to the other video ads in the same campaign. Note that 
you can optimize for views or conversions; the default ad rota-
tion optimizes for views. The best ads get more budget and views 
­naturally with this default.
	
	If you want all your ads to get equal play, you can choose to rotate 
them evenly. This is one method that can be used to determine 
which videos hit your goals best upon campaign start without 
click‐through and conversion rates impacting the results. However, 
if click‐through or conversion rates are your primary goals, this 
option may not be the right one for you.
• Frequency capping: This feature sets the average number of times 
a unique user will view your ad over a given period, unless the 
viewer sees your in‐search ad on YouTube. In‐search ads are not 
affected by frequency capping.
Selecting bidding and your  
target audience
After your general settings are in place, you need to determine who will  
get the ad and what you’re willing to spend for each ad action.
With all types of TrueView ads, you pay only if the viewer does something, 
such as watch an in‐stream ad or click on an in‐display ad.
To specify the audience for targeting and establish the price for each ad 
action, take the following steps:
1.	In your Campaigns screen, click the Targets tab.
2.	Click the + Targeting Group button.
A Create New Targeting Group page appears onscreen.

316
Part IV: YouTube Channels Are Serious Business 
3.	Give the target group a name in the Name field.
Choose a relevant and informative name such as Atlanta Area Acme 
Users as opposed to Targeting Group #1, as shown in Figure 13-10.
4.	Set the bidding amount.
This is the maximum amount you’re willing to pay each time a viewer 
watches your video or clicks on your display ad. A good amount to start 
with is 20 cents. You can optimize the amount later.
TrueView ads are sold on an auction basis. You are competing with other 
advertisers who want to reach a similar target audience and are willing 
to bid a certain amount per view. If your bid is too low, your ad won’t get 
many views and you’ll need to adjust your bid. If you leave a campaign 
running year‐round, take seasonality into account and understand that 
you may need to raise your maximum bid to get enough views during 
high‐volume ad buying seasons, like the beginning of December.
For in‐display ads, you pay only if people click on an ad, not for the  
ad just showing up. In the case of in‐stream ads, you’re charged only 
when the viewer watches at least 30 seconds of your video ad. This  
pay per view method makes YouTube ads highly cost effective.
Click the Customize Bids per Format link in the Bidding section if you 
want to establish different bidding for in‐stream versus in‐display.

5.	In the Demographic section, click the Edit link and select the 
­demographic groups you want to reach.
You can select any combination of age, gender and parental status by 
checking or unchecking the respective categories. When you’re happy 
with your selection, click the Done button.
6.	In the Interests section, click the Edit link and choose the interest 
­profiles that you want to reach.
Interest groups come in three flavors:
• Affinity audiences are groups of viewers who are particularly 
­enthusiastic about certain topics, such as fashion, comics, or home 
décor. If you’re marketing to enthusiasts, this is your best bet.
• In‐market audiences are viewers who are currently shopping for 
a particular type of product. For example, you can reach viewers 
who are evaluating a new computer in the Computer & Peripherals 
category.
• Other audiences groups viewers who are have demonstrated a 
general interest in certain topics. For example, people who occa-
sionally visit websites about cars can be reached in the Autos & 
Vehicles category.
Explore these categories using the + sign buttons in front of every cat-
egory. You can drill down over several levels to find very specific interest 
groups that match your marketing goals, as shown in Figure 13-11. Click 
the Add link next to a group to add it to your targeting set. When you’re 
done with your selection, click the Done button.
7.	If you want to refine your targeting even further, click the Narrow 
Your Targeting drop‐down box and among between Topics, 
Remarketing, Keywords, and Placements.
We explain the purpose of these targeting types earlier in this chapter in 
the “Configure more narrow targeting” section. Each of these targeting 
types works in the same way: Click the Edit link to make modifications, 
then explore the list of options to find the ones that match your goals, 
then click the Add link to include them in your targeting. When you’re 
happy with your selection, click the Done button.
8.	Click the Save Targeting Group button.
This will create your new targeting group. You will see it in the list of 
­targeting groups on the Targets tab.
With the campaign and targets set up, you must now associate one or more 
ads with the campaign. You can find out how to do that in later sections,  
but first we take care of one last side issue — your remarketing list.

318
Part IV: YouTube Channels Are Serious Business 
Sharing your remarketing list
Remarketing is all about targeting viewers who have already interacted with 
your channel, videos, or website, by either viewing your content, seeing 
your ads, visiting your channel, or subscribing to your channel. You can set 
up remarketing when you build an individual campaign, or you can set it up 
separately so that your remarketing lists can be shared among different  
campaigns. If you want to share remarketing lists, follow these steps:
1.	Log in to https://adwords.google.com/video.
The home page for Google AdWords for Video appears.
2.	On the Navigation menu on the left, click Video Remarketing Lists 
under the Shared Library heading.
This step brings up the Video Remarketing page.
3.	Click the red + Remarketing List button.
You see the Create Remarketing List dialog box.
4.	Select the remarketing items you want to use from the dialog box’s 
List Type drop‐down menu.
The List Type drop‐down menu (see Figure 13-12) shows all actions a 
viewer could have made in order to make them eligible for retargeting 
options. Select the most relevant actions for this particular remarketing list.
5.	Click the Create List button.

 Chapter 13: Expanding Your Audience through YouTube Advertising
You can also remarket to viewers who have watched content similar to  
yours — just select that option in the Details section of the Video 
Remarketing page. (Note that YouTube decides what content is “similar” — 
you have to take its choice or leave it.)
You can find more in‐depth details about remarketing with YouTube by 
making your way to https://support.google.com/adwords.
Placing and Managing Your Ads
Lots of people set up their video and display ads when they configure their 
general campaign settings. Just remember that you can also add ads to an 
existing campaign. No matter where you are in your ad campaign, here’s how 
to get that scintillating ad of yours in front of your viewers:
1.	Log in to https://adwords.google.com/video.
The home page for Google AdWords for Video appears.
2.	Click the name of the campaign you want to work with.
It should be listed under the All Video Campaigns section of the 
Navigation menu on the left side of the page.
Figure 13-12:

lists for

320
Part IV: YouTube Channels Are Serious Business 
3.	Click the red + Video Ad button in the Campaign Details section of the 
AdWords page.
Doing so opens a Create New Ad page.
4.	Paste the YouTube video URL of your ad into the Your Video field.
The video has to be uploaded to your YouTube channel before you 
do this. Videos that are to be used as ads need to be either public or 
unlisted. Check Chapter 9 for details on how to upload a video.
As soon as you paste a correct video URL, you will see your video with its 
thumbnail picture, and several additional options will appear.
Your YouTube ad might be the first thing that people see about your 
company, so use a video that is short, catchy, and to the point.
5.	Select the ad format you want to use.
Select or deselect the check boxes in from of the In‐stream and In‐display 
formats, depending on which one you want to use for this ad. It’s best 
to use only one format per ad because it gives you the best control over 
your bidding and targeting strategy. If you want to use the same video in 
different formats, create separate video ads for each.
6.	If you’ve chosen an in‐stream ad, use the In‐stream section of the new 
page that appears to configure your in‐stream ad.
Figure 13-13 shows you the in‐stream configuration options of the ad 
creation page. (Note that you have an input panel and preview pane that 
shows what your ad will look like for both types of TrueView ads —  
in‐stream and in‐display.)
Here’s a rundown of the in‐stream settings:
• Display URL: This is the website link that is shown on your  
video ad.
	This isn’t the destination that the user goes to when the ad is 
clicked, so keep this one short, sweet, and informative. Viewers 
need some sense of where they’ll end up, so be sure to get that 
information across.
• Destination URL: This is the actual web location where viewers end 
up after they click.
	Do not indulge in bait‐and‐switch tactics. Always send viewers to a 
web page that clearly has something to do with the ad. If you try to 
trick your viewers, you’ll only end up wasting your ad budget and 
alienating viewers who may be interested in your channel, prod-
uct, or services.

321

 Chapter 13: Expanding Your Audience through YouTube Advertising
• Companion banner: This is a 300 x 60 pixel companion banner for 
YouTube display or a 300 x 250 pixel companion banner for the 
GDN. The companion banner should have a strong call to action 
so that viewers are more likely to click. Note that the companion 
banner is the only element that remains up after your video ad has 
finished playing or has been skipped by the user. We recommend 
the YouTube default banner if you have a several videos on your 
channel or if you are looking to gain subscribers with your ad. It 
gives the viewer three options: Subscribe, watch more content, or 
visit your destination URL.
7.	If you’ve chosen an in‐display ad, take the following steps to configure 
your in‐display ad:
a.	Write the ad text. This short bit of text appears next to the video 
thumbnail in your ads. (See Figure 13-14.) You get one head-
line with a maximum length of 25 characters and two lines of 
­description text with 35 characters apiece.
	Attach a catchy title, and be sure to tell people why they should 
watch this video. You can test ad copy by creating multiple 
­versions of the in‐display ad.
b.	Choose the thumbnail picture that you want to use. YouTube gives 
you only four predefined options. See the “Thumbnails” section in 
Chapter 9 for tips on how to select an effective one.

322

c.	Enter your website address in the Display URL field. This is the web 
address that appears in the ad for viewers to see.
d.	If you want to direct viewers to a particular page other than your web-
site’s home page, enter a web address in the Destination URL field. 
For example, you could use a landing page that promotes a specific 
product. When users click on your video ad, they’re sent to this 
page.
8.	Enter the ad name.
Use a descriptive name that makes it easy for you to find the ad later.
9.	Select the targeting groups for the ad.
By default, all existing targeting groups are selected.
You can set up multiple targeting groups for your ads to optimize the 
results. For example, you can set up one target group only for search key-
words, another one for topics, and a third one for specific channel place-
ments. To add a targeting group, go to https://adwords.google. 
com/video, select the campaign you want to change, and click the 
Target tab. Then click the New Targeting Group button and follow the 
steps in the “Selecting bidding and your target audience” section, earlier 
in this chapter.
10.	Click Save.

11.	If this is the first time you’ve bought ads on Google or YouTube, 
you’re asked for your billing information.
Follow the simple process on the screen to provide your credit card 
information.
You’re billed for your AdWords account only after you start your ad 
­campaign.
12.	Verify the status of your ad.
If your money’s good, you should see your new ad listed in the Details 
section of the AdWords for Video home page. Looking at the Status cat-
egory, you should see the text Not yet serving/Under review. That’s a good 
sign. It’s proof that your ad is complete — you just need to wait on final 
approval from Google. Usually, that takes no more than 24 hours. If it’s 
taking any longer, call AdWords Google support at 866‐246‐6453 to see 
whether there’s a problem.
Be sure to check out how your ads are performing after your ads are 
approved by Google. (You can find out more on how you can actually do that 
in the next section.) Monitor your campaigns regularly to find the most effec-
tive videos, targeting groups, and ads. Always test different versions of your 
ads, and make changes, if necessary.
If you need to modify an ad name or ad copy after the ad has been saved, you 
lose all the performance data associated with that ad. Click the little arrow 
next to the title of the ad in the Details section to make any edits. (If you want 
to keep your performance data, we recommend duplicating the ad and then 
making changes to the new version of the ad.)
You can always pause an ad campaign from the All Video Campaigns view 
by highlighting the check box next to the campaign name and clicking the 
Change Status drop‐down menu so that it shows Paused. We recommend that 
you never remove an ad because you can’t get it back in case you change 
your mind.
Measuring Clicks and Results
Tracking the success of your campaign regularly is essential. If you don’t pay 
attention, you may be spending ad dollars for ineffective views, or you might 
miss out on interesting opportunities to reach your audience. Fortunately, 
the YouTube ad management tool gives you all the important numbers you 
need in order to manage your campaign.

324
Part IV: YouTube Channels Are Serious Business 
When you analyze your campaign results, it’s important to understand the 
following distinction:
✓
✓Paid metrics: These represent the direct results of your ads, such as ad 
views and the average cost per view.
✓
✓Earned metrics: Think of these as the follow‐on activities that occur as 
a result of your ads, including new subscribers and additional channel 
views.
Both sets of metrics are important to advertisers and YouTube channel 
managers because they tell them whether their ad money is being spent 
­effectively.
You’re charged for paid metrics, not for earned metrics. If your video ad 
results in a viewer going to your channel and watching ten more videos, you 
paid for 1 view and received 10 for free. In other words, that’s 11 views for 
the price of 1.
Looking at campaign information
The YouTube ad management tool is your friend. To gain the full benefit of  
this friendship, you need to visit (you guessed it) https://adwords. 
google.com/video and click the All Video Campaigns link to see the most 
important performance numbers. You also see the details for every video 
campaign.
These are your paid metrics. This list describes what the numbers mean:
✓
✓Impressions: These figures represent how many times your ad was 
shown to a user (irrespective of whether the user clicked on it). Thumb 
impressions refer to the little picture‐and‐text in‐display ads in search 
results and next to videos, whereas Video impressions count how many 
times your video was shown as an in‐stream ad just before another 
video.
✓
✓Views: This number shows how many views your videos got by way of 
paid ads. For in‐display ads, a view is counted when a viewer clicks on 
an ad and starts watching the video. For in‐stream ads, a view means 
the user watched at least 30 seconds of the ad (or the whole ad if it’s 
shorter).
✓
✓View rate: This represents the percentage of people who saw your ad 
and either clicked on it (for in‐display) or chose not to skip it (for in‐
stream). Don’t be disappointed if this number seems low. Typical rates 
are well under 1 percent for in‐display and around 15‐20 percent for  
in‐stream ads. The higher the number, the more effective your ad.

325

 Chapter 13: Expanding Your Audience through YouTube Advertising
✓
✓Average cost per view (CPV): This figure tells you how much you spent 
for one person to watch your video. This value can differ depending on 
the topic and the amount of competition you face, but ranges between 4 
cents and 40 cents are typical.
✓
✓Total cost: This is the total amount you spent on all your YouTube ads.
Successful campaigns have a high view rate and a low CPV. But what the 
numbers should be depends strongly on your industry. Some industries, 
such as financial services, are highly competitive in their online marketing 
efforts, so expect a high CPV amount. In other industries, you may be able to 
draw viewers for only a few cents a pop.
Watch how your campaign performs over time. When the view rate value 
drops and your CPV rises, it’s time to optimize.
Getting earned metrics
The great part about YouTube advertising is that it can lead to increased 
viewer activity with your channel. These are earned metrics, and they include:
✓
✓Earned views: The number of new video views that occur within seven 
days from viewers who’ve seen an ad from your channel
✓
✓Earned subscribers: The number of new subscriptions that occur within 
seven days from unsubscribed viewers who’ve seen an ad from your 
channel
✓
✓Earned playlist additions: The number of playlist additions that occur 
within seven days from viewers who’ve seen an ad from your channel
✓
✓Earned likes: The number of video likes that occur within seven days 
from viewers who’ve seen an ad from your channel
✓
✓Earned shares: The number of video shares that occur within seven 
days from viewers who’ve seen an ad from your channel
Earned metrics are not displayed by default, so you have to set them up 
through AdWords for Video:
1.	Log in to your AdWords for Video account.
The home page for Google AdWords for Video appears.
2.	Click All Video Campaigns in the Navigation menu on the left.
3.	Click the Campaigns tab.
4.	Click the Columns button and select Customize Columns from the 
menu that appears.
You’re presented with a Customized Columns configurator, like the one 
shown in Figure 13-15.

This technique can be used for customizing all reporting, including adding 
and removing other paid metrics as well as competitive metrics around 
impressions.
Optimizing Your Campaign
Because you pay for every click on your YouTube ads, you must choose 
highly effective keywords and placements for your campaign. When you ini-
tially create your campaign, you make certain assumptions about which tar-
gets will deliver results. Some assumptions may turn out to be wrong,  
and you may want to try other options over time.

327

 Chapter 13: Expanding Your Audience through YouTube Advertising
Fortunately, YouTube offers a powerful way to manage targets for every 
video ad. Follow this step‐by‐step approach:
1.	Log in to your AdWords for Video account.
The home page for Google AdWords for Video appears.
2.	Click All Video Campaigns in the Navigation menu on the left.
3.	Click on the campaign you want to optimize, and then click the 
Segment by Targeting Group link.
4.	Look at the campaign details.
You see the number of views you’ve received and the amount of money 
you’ve spent for each ad. Below these numbers, you see a list of the 
­targeting groups that have contributed to these results.
5.	Review the list of targeting groups to determine which ones are 
­effective.
The most important number is the cost per view, or CPV — the amount 
you pay for every viewer who sees your video because of that particular 
keyword. Low CPVs are attractive, but sometimes you may want to spend 
more on targeted keywords.
6.	To optimize a targeting group, click the Targets tag and then click the 
name of the targeting group you want to change.
7.	Click on each category link under the Targeting heading to look at the 
details of how your keywords and placements perform.
You can look at detailed information for YouTube search keywords, 
­display network keywords, topics, and placements.
8.	Remove the nonperforming keywords and placements by clicking the 
green button next to them and selecting Paused from the menu that 
appears.
Pause keywords and placements, rather than delete them, because the 
performance information for paused targets is retained by the system.
9.	If you have ideas for additional keywords, click the Add Keywords 
button or Add Placements button to add them.
If you aren’t drawing enough views, consider increasing your bid on 
the targets that you particularly like. Click the Targets tab and then the 
Edit link next to the name of the targeting group you want to change. 
Increase the value of maximum CPV and click the Save and Enable 
Targeting button.

Creating a Call‐to‐Action Overlay
After you draw viewers to your video, you want them to then take action — 
by coming to your website, for example, or by signing up for your newsletter 
or even buying your product online.
YouTube advertisers use an attractive feature that lets you place a call‐to‐
action message on top of your videos. This call‐to‐action overlay consists of 
a small picture, three lines of text, and a link to your website, and it starts up 
immediately when your video plays.
It’s an effective way to draw YouTube viewers to visit your site.
Follow these steps to create a call‐to‐action overlay:
1.	Log in to your YouTube account.
2.	On your YouTube page, click your channel’s icon and then choose 
Creator Studio from the menu that appears.
Doing so brings up the Creator Studio dashboard.
3.	Click the Video Manger heading in the Navigation menu on the left.
4.	Click Video under the Video Manager heading.
Doing so brings up the Video page.
5.	Find the video you’re using for advertising and click the Edit button.
If your video is public, you see a call‐to‐action overlay link under the 
video on the same level as Basic Info and Advanced Settings.
6.	Click the Call‐to‐Action Overlay link.
You’re prompted for overlay information, as shown in Figure 13-16.
7.	Add a headline and two lines of description text for your overlay.
This should be a strong call to action that entices people to click on it.
Special offers always work well.
8.	Enter the display URL and the destination URL that you want to use.
The display URL is the web address that people see in the overlay 
(www.acmeelectric.com, for example). The destination URL is the link 
to the page that opens when someone clicks on the overlay. It can be a 
product‐specific page, as in this example:
www.acmeelectric.com/products/z500.

Google Preferred
In 2014, YouTube announced the premium 
advertising platform Google Preferred, an in‐
stream advertising format that allows adver­
tising to target the top 1 percent and the top 
5 percent of the most popular content on 
YouTube. The figure below shows popular 
Google Preferred channels for technology. The 
lineup changes regularly.
Google Preferred is targeted at big‐brand 
spenders and has a premium price that Google 
will discuss with you privately. As an advertiser, 
don’t despair if you can’t buy the top 1 percent 
or 5 percent of YouTube. The other 95 percent 
of content on YouTube may actually be better 
suited for your channel objectives — and your 
budget.

f you have a great channel with fabulous content and you excel at social 
media and community interaction, you have a good shot at making some 
money from your all your hard YouTube work. In YouTube and digital adver-
tising lingo, this is monetization. If you’ve already read Chapter 13, you know 
all about how advertisers pay for YouTube advertising. You’ve probably 
figured out that the advertising money has to go somewhere. It does — into 
the hands of Google, your partners, and you: the channel manager/publisher/
creator.
You can make money from your YouTube work in many ways, too:
✓
✓Create a paid channel. Charge users to view some or all of the content 
on your channel.
✓
✓Monetize your video content. Allow ads to be placed against your 
­content.
✓
✓Join a multichannel network. Become part of a MCN. (For more on 
MCNs, see Bonus Chapter 2.)
✓
✓Sell products. Use your YouTube content to help your viewers make a 
decision about your products or services.
✓
✓Get an endorsement deal. Sponsorship deals work when they’re made 
without too much over‐the‐top promotion.
You can read about monetization in this chapter, and you may already have 
the basic info about MCNs and selling products from previous chapters. 
Chapter 14

Part IV: YouTube Channels Are Serious Business 
Completing the last item in the preceding list means that you’ve hit the ­ 
big‐time if you’re getting six-figure deals to promote products.
Nothing prevents you from combining some of these various monetization 
approaches. MCNs are the exception, so you have to speak with your MCN 
managers and lawyers about the rules around monetization.
Be patient on your monetization journey, though. If you focus on the basics 
of building your channel with content, discoverability, subscribers, and 
engagement, the ad revenue you receive will grow in kind. Your YouTube 
earnings will come from multiple sources, including:
✓
✓The Google Display Network (GDN)
✓
✓AdSense auctions
✓
✓Reservation buys (those nonclickable ads)
✓
✓YouTube
Don’t waste your time trying to conjure up a viral video that you hope to 
monetize. Instead, focus on slow and steady channel growth.
Your first step to income involves tying together all the AdSense and 
YouTube plumbing. You can find out more about these topics in the 
­remainder of this chapter.
Integrating AdSense
AdWords for Video is the way for advertisers to target YouTube and the 
Google Display network for ad placements. (For more on AdWords for Video, 
check out Chapter 13.) Publishers and creators can control what types of ads 
are shown against their content.
Content owners often take a great deal of pride in the content they produce, 
so it only makes sense that the ads conform to their brands and ensure a 
good overall experience for their viewers.
Google AdSense is how web content creators and YouTube channel man-
agers control ads and get paid by advertisers who place ads against their 
YouTube content and websites. Like AdWords for Video, AdSense is a huge 
topic — we don’t have room to cover every nook and cranny in this chap-
ter, but we can give you a sense of what’s necessary to get you started with 
YouTube monetization. AdSense, like all Google products, evolves regularly.

Setting up YouTube monetization
Before you start seeing any money in your bank account, you need to set up 
your channel for monetization. Here’s how it’s done:
1.	Log on to your YouTube account.
2.	On your YouTube page, click your channel’s icon and then choose 
Creator Studio from the menu that appears.
Doing so brings up the Creator Studio dashboard.
3.	Click the Channel section in the Navigation menu on the left.
If you see a Monetization link under the Status and Features link in the 
Channel section right under the Status and Features link, your channel is 
already set up for monetization and you can proceed to the next section, 
“Linking your channel with AdSense.” If you don’t see a Monetization link, 
continue with Step 4.
4.	Select Status and Features from the Channel section of Navigation 
menu on the left.
Doing so brings up a page similar to the one shown in Figure 14-1.
5.	In the Features section of the page, click the Enable button under the 
Status column.
A page about the YouTube partner program opens.
Figure 14-1:

6.	Click the Enable My Account button.
You see a dialog box with lots of legal info about terms and conditions, 
honesty, and rights.
7.	If you (or your lawyer) agree with the terms, select all three 
­agreement boxes and click the I Accept button.
You then see another dialog box that lets you select the ad formats 
you’re willing to associate with your video content, such as overlay and 
TrueView in‐stream. (For more on ad formats, check out Chapter 13.)
All display ad types are preconfigured, and none of them can be changed.
8.	Select the ad formats to allow and then click Monetize.
You see the confirmation dialog box.
9.	Click the Got It button.
You’re brought to the Videos page of the Video Manager.
10.	Select the video you want to monetize by clicking the $ button on the 
row with the video.
If you were to click on Channel in the Navigation menu, you’d see a new 
Monetization link on the Navigation menu. If you selected Status and Features 
from the Navigation menu, you see a green radio button next to Monetization, 
under Status. Your channel should now look like the one shown in Figure 14-2.

 Chapter 14: Mining the YouTube Goldmine
With monetization now in place, you can set specific ad controls for you 
videos. Details are shown in the section, “Making Monetization Adjustments.” 
Before that, you’ll have a few more housekeeping tasks that we discuss in the 
following sections.
Linking your channel with AdSense
To collect payment and control the types of ads shown on your YouTube 
channel, you need to link an AdSense account to that channel. If you already 
have an AdSense account, you can simply link that account. If don’t already 
have an AdSense account, the following steps can help you do that. Either 
way, begin with the following steps:
1.	Log in to your YouTube account.
2.	On your YouTube page, click the channel icon and then choose 
Creator Studio from the menu that appears.
Doing so brings up the Creator Studio dashboard.
3.	Click the Channel heading in the Navigation menu on the left.
4.	Select Monetization under the Channel heading
You see the Monetization Account status page.
You can also disable monetization at any point by clicking the Disable 
Monetization button.
5.	Click the How Will I Be Paid? link.
Doing so brings up more information about AdSense.
6.	Click the Associate an AdSense Account link.
You’re brought to the Monetization screen.
7.	Click the Next button.
You’re redirected to a YouTube and Google AdSense setup page. If you 
already have an AdSense account, log in to complete the association. If 
you need to set up an AdSense account, follow the directions in the next 
section.
Creating your AdSense account  
for YouTube
If you’re in the process of linking your YouTube and Google AdSense 
accounts and you need to set up a brand‐spanking new AdSense account, 

336
Part IV: YouTube Channels Are Serious Business 
here’s what you need to do. From the AdSense setup page, follow 
these steps:
1.	If you’re coming here from the previous section, you 
should be on the AdSense setup page. If not, enter 
https://www.youtube.com/account_monetization?action_ 
adsense_connection into your web browser and click Next to go to 
AdSense setup.
You’ll be presented with a page like the one shown in Figure 14-3.
If you’re creating an AdSense account for the first time and it’s associ-
ated with your YouTube channel, then you need to sign up for AdSense 
through YouTube, not directly through AdSense. Notice both the 
YouTube and AdSense logos at the top of Figure 14-3 — that’s the sign 
you’re in the right place. If you only see the AdSense logo, then you’ll be 
given a warning to sign up for AdSense through YouTube.
2.	From the AdSense setup page, select the Google account that you want 
to associate with AdSense by clicking the blue button on the bottom 
left that either shows your account or asks you to sign in.
If you’re just starting out, it’s easier to use the same Google account 
for YouTube, AdSense, AdWords, Gmail, Google+, and other Google 
­properties.
Figure 14-3: 
Setting up 
AdSense


 Chapter 14: Mining the YouTube Goldmine
3.	Verify that your YouTube channel is listed and pick the content 
­language using the Content language drop-down menu.
You should see your channel listed right next to the line that says “I will 
show ads on,” as in Figure 14-4. The Content Language drop‐down should 
be right below it.
4.	Click the Continue button.
You see the AdSense application screen.
5.	Fill out the AdSense application and click the Submit My Application 
button.
You’re redirected to your YouTube channel.
Your application needs to be reviewed by Google; you should hear back 
about your approval within a week.
After being approved, you’ll receive an email from Google directing you to 
accept its terms of service. (Whenever money is involved, so is lots of paper-
work.) With your AdSense account approved, your Monetization page under 
Creator Studio should look like the one shown in Figure 14-5. If necessary, 
you can change or remove the direct association between your YouTube 
channel and your AdSense account.
Figure 14-4: 
Verifying 
your

Part IV: YouTube Channels Are Serious Business 
When you set up your AdSense account through YouTube, it’s known as an 
AdSense‐hosted account. If you want to incorporate AdSense into your web-
site, you have to upgrade the account, which is pretty straightforward. If you 
already have an AdSense account that predates your YouTube integration, no 
conversion or upgrade is necessary; you can just use the older account.
Setting up AdSense monetization
Linking your (approved) AdSense account to your YouTube account is a 
great first step, but you still have to jump through some configuration hoops 
in order to begin monetizing your channel and your video content. Here’s 
what you still need to do:
1.	Log on to your AdSense account at http://adsense.google.com.
2.	Click the gear icon to the right of the Google account name.
3.	Choose Settings from the menu that appears.
Doing so brings up the AdSense Personal Settings page, where you set up 
contact information, email preferences, and default language.
4.	After specifying your contact information, email preferences, and 
default language, click the Save button.

 Chapter 14: Mining the YouTube Goldmine
5.	From the gear icon drop-down menu, select Status and verify that your 
account has no policy violations.
Many of the policy violations are centered on what are referred to as 
­artificial clicks. Remember that the publisher gets paid whenever some-
one legitimately clicks on an ad. Clicking on your own ads or encouraging 
others to do so fraudulently doesn’t result in legitimate clicks — they’re 
fake (artificial) clicks. Artificial clicks are a no‐no.
Be sure to address policy violations promptly; if your channel is con-
sidered to be in violation of AdSense policy, all ads will be disabled 
and any monetization that you may have enabled will be stopped. 
Instructions and advice on AdSense policy violations can be found at 
http://productforums.google.com/d/forum/adsense.
6.	From the gear icon drop-down menu, select Payments.
Doing so brings up the Payments screen, which you use to handle all 
­payment setup and reporting.
The Payments screen is an important administration section for channel 
managers, creators, and publishers. It consists of three parts:
• Payment history: This section shows your monthly transactions, 
which consist of costs, earnings, payments, adjustments, and 
taxes. You can pick the reporting period and export the data,  
if necessary.
• Payee profile: This section includes a special billing ID, tax 
­reporting details, and billing contacts.
• Payment settings: Here’s where you set up your payment 
­schedule and configure your payment method, including banking 
­information.
	
	You can easily change any of the payment information if you 
choose to do so later.
Not everything is monetizable
If you’re at all familiar with the ways of 
YouTube, you probably have already figured 
out that you can’t just grab a copy of Korean 
entertainment artist Psy’s “Gangnam Style” 
video, modify it slightly, and put it on your 
channel. Sure, everyone would love a few bil­
lion monetized views, but in the end it all comes 
down to content ownership and copyright. To 
monetize anything, you need to own the rights 
to both the audio and visual components of 
the content. You also have to be careful about 
some of the visual elements, such as logos and 
other graphics, which may also be protected 
by the rights holders.

Analyzing Ad Performance  
with YouTube Analytics
You may have figured out already that Google rewards you with more inter-
esting data when you link various accounts. You may have seen it with 
Google+ for YouTube channel management and with AdWords for YouTube 
advertising. Well, making money on YouTube is no different. When you link 
your AdSense account with your YouTube channel, you get more detailed 
information about your earnings. The good part is that you can get lots of 
this information directly from YouTube Analytics.
YouTube Analytics is your go‐to resource when you want to find out how 
your channel is performing with your audience. Chapter 11 gives you the 
whole YouTube Analytics story; this chapter concentrates on how YouTube 
Analytics can help you figure out your ad and earnings performances.
Getting your YouTube ad information
In YouTube Analytics, you’ll find a section called Earnings Reports, a vital 
resource for channel managers responsible for monetization. Within the 
Earning Reports section are two important reports:
✓
✓Estimated Earnings: Includes the details about your earnings and which 
of your video is making you the most money.
✓
✓Ad Performance: Shows which ad types are most effective for driving 
revenue on your channel.
(continued)
YouTube keeps tabs on copyrighted content 
with a feature it calls ContentID, a database of 
files that YouTube uses to compare copyrighted 
content against new content being uploaded to 
the site. ContentID can be used to make claims 
against your content, which may affect your 
ability to monetize. Note that with ContentID, 
the rights holder may choose to monetize your 
content
Copyright is a tricky topic, and you can read 
more about it in Chapter 16. You can also check 
out https://support.google.com to 
find out more about the partner program and 
monetization. When in doubt, consult with a 
lawyer or watch a YouTube video on the sub­
ject, assuming that it’s not blocked by copyright, 
of course.

341

 Chapter 14: Mining the YouTube Goldmine
To get to the reports for your channel:
1.	Log on to your YouTube account.
2.	On your YouTube page, click your channel’s icon and then choose 
Creator Studio from the menu that appears.
Doing so brings up the Creator Studio dashboard.
3.	Click the Analytics heading in the Navigation menu on the left.
By default, you should go directly to the Overview submenu.
4.	Under the Earnings Reports heading in the navigation menu on the left, 
click on either the Estimated Earnings link or the Ad Performance link.
Seeing which metrics are offered
YouTube Analytics is a truly robust feature. Looking at only the Ad 
Performance report, check out all the attributes you can measure:
✓
✓Impressions: The number of times an ad is presented to a viewer.
There can be multiple impressions per playback. If a viewer is served a 
TrueView instream pre‐roll ad, a display ad, and an in‐video overlay,  
it counts as three impressions, not one.
✓
✓Estimated monetized playbacks: A single playback occurs when your 
video is shown and one or more ads are presented. A playback also 
occurs whenever a viewer quits an in‐stream ad.
✓
✓Playback-based CPM: This is the average gross revenue per thousand 
video playbacks (cost per mille in ad lingo) on which an ad was shown.
✓
✓Playback-based gross revenue: This is the total gross revenue for all ads 
that are placed against a video before any of the ad revenue is shared 
with YouTube and other partners. Remember that multiple ads may be 
shown against your video during a single viewing.
Revenue is different from earnings. Earnings remain after YouTube and 
other partners take their cut.
From the Estimated Earnings report, you find the following metrics:
✓
✓Total estimated earnings: Net earnings remain after partner allocations 
for Google‐sold advertising.
✓
✓Ad earnings: These earnings are from AdSense auction and DoubleClick 
reserved buys.
✓
✓Transaction earnings: These include paid content, YouTube rentals, and 
Fan Funding.

342
Part IV: YouTube Channels Are Serious Business 
It used to be the case that earnings data and playback information in 
YouTube Analytics were always estimates because there was an informa-
tion lag of as many as seven days. That’s no longer the case: You’ll have 
your information within 24 hours after the close of the business day. Your 
­transaction history as reported in AdSense will therefore contain accurate 
information, not mere estimates; just keep in mind that this information is 
reported after all the data has been collected. YouTube Analytics will show 
information — within reason — as it’s occurring. Actual earnings will be vis-
ible and available for download within 24 hours on YouTube or AdSense.
As a publisher or creator, you need to calculate one critical metric on your 
own: revenue per mille, or RPM. RPM tells you how much you earn for every 
1,000 ad impressions. You calculate RPM this way:
	
	
	
The time period for total estimated earnings and impressions has to be 
the same.
Analyzing your ad performance
A YouTube Analytics ad performance report, as mentioned in the previous sec-
tion, can highlight tons of different metrics regarding your channel’s gross reve-
nue and performance by ad type. Accessing that ad performance report is easy:
1.	Log on to your YouTube account.
2.	On your YouTube page, click your channel’s icon and then choose 
Creator Studio from the menu that appears.
Doing so brings up the Creator Studio dashboard.
3.	Click the Analytics heading in the Navigation menu on the left.
By default, you should go directly to the Overview submenu.
4.	In the analytics Navigation menu on the left, click the Ad Performance 
link under the Earnings Reports heading.
You see a line chart (see Figure 14-6) that highlights one of the three 
key ad‐performance metrics (playback‐based CPM, playback‐based 
gross ­revenue, and estimated monetized playbacks) and graphs out the 
­monetary performance of each ad type. (To switch between the three 
metrics, click the appropriate tab at the top of the chart area.)
You can change the analysis period and specify particular videos that 
you want to examine. (We tell you more about that in Chapter 11.)
5.	Scroll down to the Details section under the chart to take a closer look 
at your channel’s performance data.

 Chapter 14: Mining the YouTube Goldmine
Figure 14-7 shows how the monetized ad types perform across key 
­metrics. By checking the box next to each type, you can determine 
what shows up on the graph for a more precise picture of which ads are 
­working best (or worst) against your content.

By default, you’re on the Ad Types tab in the Details section. You can 
also see where and when ads work best by clicking the Geography and 
Date tab.
If you’re not seeing performance data for a specific ad type, go back and 
review the monetization setting you configured. You can find out more 
about configuring the monetization of existing videos a little later in this 
chapter.
6.	Look for things that stand out in the charts, such as spikes or valleys 
in the data to determine what’s working well and what may need 
improvement.
Use the Chart Type toolbar — that line of icons running down the left 
side of the Chart area — to try out different models. Sometimes, simply 
changing the chart type from a line chart to a bar chart gives you a much 
better look at ad type performance. (Figure 14-8 shows what we mean.)
Determining your estimating earnings
It’s time to look at the bottom line. The YouTube Analytics estimated 
­earnings report shows your earnings, which some call net revenue. It’s what 
remains after Google and its partners take their share. To find out your 
­channel’s estimated earnings, do the following:

3.	Click the Analytics heading in the Navigation menu on the left.
By default, you should go directly to the Overview submenu.
4.	On the Analytics Navigation menu on the left, click the Estimated 
Earnings link under the Earnings Reports heading.
You see a line chart (see Figure 14-9) that highlights one of three impor-
tant earnings metrics (total estimated earnings, ad earnings, and trans-
action earnings) and graphs out the desired metric for the time period. 
Total estimated earnings is net revenue from all Google‐sold ads. Ad 
earnings reflects net revenue from AdSense and DoubleClick, which 
is yet another Google property that can put ads against your content. 
Transaction earnings is paid content and fan funding. (To switch between 
the three metrics, click the appropriate tab at the top of the chart area.)
Again, you can change the analysis period and specify particular 
videos that you want to analyze. (We tell you more about that topic in 
Chapter 11.)

You can click on an individual video entry to see earnings details by 
geography and date.
Some important metrics, such as impressions, are not shown by default in 
estimated earnings or ad performance reports. If this is information you want 
to see, you need to customize your reports. To do that, do the following:
1.	In YouTube Analytics, click on either the Estimated Earnings link or 
the Ad Performance link under the Earnings Reports heading on the 
Navigation menu.
2.	Click the Compare Metric button in the top left corner of the 
Chart area.
3.	From the drop-down menu that appears, select More Metrics.
Doing so displays a Compare Metric screen listing your metric choices, 
like the one shown in Figure 14-11.
4.	Go to the Estimated Earnings section of the Compare Metric screen 
and click the metric you want to use. If you want to see impressions 
(always a good choice), then click the Impressions link.

Managing AdSense for YouTube
If you have your AdSense account approved, set up, and linked with your 
YouTube channel, give yourself a pat on the back. You have accomplished 
much, but is it truly time to go shopping for that new car with your expected 
pot of gold? Not just yet. Yes, YouTube can be both personally and financially 
rewarding, but you have to give it time to grow.
AdSense offers its own set of analytics data, distinct from YouTube analytics. 
You have to understand both to derive the right insights to make effective 
content and ad placement decisions. It isn’t a one‐shot deal. You need review 
all the reports and take action on an ongoing basis. That’s the key to maxi-
mizing your YouTube channel’s monetization potential.
Figure 14-11: 
Looking at 
various met­
rics options.
Fan funding
If you’re a YouTube partner in good stand­
ing and you have an integrated AdSense 
account, you can set up your channel so that 
your fans can make voluntary contributions to 
help finance your uploading of content to your 
channel. YouTube is quite strict about how you 
ask for funds, and it can’t be used to fund future 
videos or outside activities. You can enable 
fan funding through your channel’s status and 
features under Creative Studio. For detailed 
rules and information around fan funding, 
visit https://support.google.com/

Reconciling AdSense earnings data  
with YouTube Analytics
Deciding when it’s important to look at YouTube Analytics earnings data 
versus when you need to look at AdSense earnings data is one of the biggest 
sources of misunderstanding for YouTube channel managers, creators, and 
publishers. Candidly, Google made the decision rather confusing because 
there were different earnings data in both. Your YouTube earnings often 
include income from multiple places. Making matters worse was the time 
delay in earnings updates in YouTube Analytics over AdSense.
In March 2013, important changes were made to eliminate the confusion. 
You still need your AdSense account, but your earning information is now 
reported through YouTube Analytics, which looks at not only YouTube Ads 
but also display ads bought via Google AdSense. Even better, all the com-
bined data will is available within 24 hours of the end of the business day.
Adding AdSense controls and reporting
Though your earnings information now comes from YouTube, you need to 
know that AdSense continues to supply the following critical information, 
which isn’t available in YouTube Analytics:
✓
✓Payments: You’re still paid via AdSense, so keep all your contact, 
­banking, and tax information current.
✓
✓Ad controls: As a YouTube channel manager, you have control over which 
AdSense display ads are presented. (More on that in the next section.)
✓
✓Ad performance: You can see analytics for ads served against your 
content, including number of clicks, click‐through rates, cost‐per‐click, 
and RPM.
Controlling ads
AdSense gives you a great deal of control over what ads are served (or not) 
against your YouTube channel and content. To see how controls work, do 
the following:
1.	Log on to your AdSense account.
You can also get there by accessing the Monetization section of Creator 
Studio and clicking on AdSense Settings.
2.	Click Allow & Block Ads in the top menu bar.
3.	The Allow & Block Ads screen appears.

4.	To block specific advertisers, click Advertiser URLs tab.
You’re taken to a page where you can enter target links to block.
5.	Click Block URLs.
6.	You can click on the other tabs on the Allow & Block Ads screen for 
additional ad control.
You can allow or restrict ads based on
• General categories (restrict broad topics for ads)
• Sensitive categories (block politics, magic, religion, and so on.)
• Ad networks (manage placements from specific ad networks)
• Ad serving (control new ad formats)
• Ad reviews (see ads before blocking)
You can find more details on AdSense ad controls at https://support. 
google.com/adsense.
Measuring ad performance
AdSense also lets you see how well ads are performing against your content. 
The click‐through‐rate (CTR) is an important metric that gives you a sense of 
how well viewers are responding to the ads against your content.
CTRs are measured using percentages and are frequently in the single digits. 
If your CTRs are very low and trending downward, something is likely wrong, 
and you may want to modify your ad controls so that something more suit-
able is presented to your viewers.
The types of ads placed against your channel and content impact your brand. 
Google does a great deal of work to ensure that only ads that make sense are 
placed against your content, but ultimately you have control, so use it when 
necessary.
To check out your ad performance using AdSense:
1.	Log in to your AdSense account.
You can also get there by accessing the Monetization section of Creator 
Studio and clicking on AdSense Settings.
2.	Click Performance Reports in the top menu bar.
3.	Select a time period filter in the top right by clicking the date and 
­setting up a date range in the drop-down menu.
4.	Click Apply.

5.	Click on any of the tabbed items running along the top of the Graph 
area to add them to the graph.
Figure 14-12 shows what happens when you select Clicks. In this example, 
you can see an overall CTR of 4.72 percent for the selected period. Pay 
attention to the spike around the beginning of July, which indicates some 
seasonal component for the channel and content.
Making Monetization Adjustments
A set‐it‐and‐forget‐it mentality doesn’t fit into an effective YouTube channel‐
management strategy. If you want your channel to truly succeed, you need 
to commit to an ongoing series of adjustments to content, engagement, and 
advertising. How you manage ads served against your channel and content is 
no different from your other YouTube activities: You have to look at metrics 
and adjust accordingly.
Looking at key ad‐serving metrics
In the earlier section “Analyzing Ad Performance with YouTube Analytics,” 
you can read about using AdSense reports to analyze trends in CTRs and 
making adjustments to ads served. You should also measure RPM ­trending — 
that’s the revenue per mille, or how much you earn for each 1,000 ad

­impressions. Figure 14-13 shows a YouTube Analytics Estimated Earnings 
report with impressions added as a comparison metric. Using that informa-
tion, you can make use of this handy RPM formula:
	
	
	
Plugging in the numbers from Figure 14-13 produces this result:
	
	
	
If you do the math, you see that it gives you an RPM of $4.06. In other words, 
you make just over 4 dollars for each 1,000 ad impressions against this video. 
Is that good? Is that bad? The only way you can find it is by analyzing how 
this compares with your other videos.
Managing monetizable ad inventory
Keep in mind that you don’t have to monetize all the content on your chan-
nel all the time. You can pull videos in and out of the monetization mix. To 
­control which videos are monetized, follow these steps:

Doing so brings up the Creator Studio dashboard.
3.	Click the Video Manager heading in the Navigation menu on the left.

Ten Key Steps to Improving 
YouTube Search Results
In This Chapter

▶Defining and optimizing video metadata
▶
▶Improving channel search results
▶
▶Avoiding misleading metadata
Y
 
ouTube is about one thing: Getting people to watch your content. Before 
they watch it, though, they’ve got to find it. Simple, right? In theory, yes, 
but your challenge is to help viewers find your channel and your content. 
That’s what search results are all about: Placing your content in front of the 
right viewers so that they can watch.
Unfortunately, YouTube doesn’t share the secret sauce for getting found, 
but you can help improve the odds of your videos showing up in YouTube 
and Google Search as well as in Suggested Videos on the Watch page. To get 
that search engine to work for you, you need to optimize both your chan-
nel and your videos. It may come as a surprise to you, but YouTube cannot 
have a human watch all your videos to determine what topics they cover. To 
let YouTube understand what your videos are all about, then, you need to 
include metadata that describes the content for YouTube to index. (That’s 
part of the optimization process.) In this chapter, we describe ten key steps 
for improving YouTube search results for your content.
Updating Video Metadata
Metadata are the words you use to describe your video — stuff like the video 
title, keyword tags, and video description. When uploading new content to 
your channel, YouTube walks you through the steps to add metadata. If you 
Chapter 15

356
Part V: The Part of Tens 
want to go back and tweak that metadata later, as part of your optimization 
strategy, do the following:
1.	Log in to your YouTube account.
2.	On your YouTube page, click the channel icon and then choose 
Creator Studio from the menu that appears.
3.	Click the Video Manager section of Creator Studio.
By default, it should go directly to the Videos submenu.
4.	Find the video and click the Edit button next to it.
5.	Modify the thumbnail, title, description, and tags to better reflect your 
optimization goals.
6.	When done, click the blue Save Changes button.
The two search results right under the ads in Figure 15-1 show good 
­metadata — compelling thumbnail images, great titles, and punchy 
­description data. Metadata helps visitors make viewing decisions, and 
good ­metadata helps visitors make better viewing decisions.

 Chapter 15: Ten Key Steps to Improving YouTube Search Results
Managing Video Titles
Descriptive video titles are not only helpful for your viewers to identify 
­content they may want to view but also important for YouTube’s search 
engine. These titles are one key indicator used to index your videos. If you 
do nothing at all, at least be sure to use a keyword‐rich title — a title full of 
descriptive words or adjectives, in other words. You always have the oppor-
tunity to rename your videos after you upload them to your channel. A good 
title tells the viewer what the content includes and who created the video, 
such as “Easy Stretches for Runners Led by Certified Yoga Instructor.”
Good titles are 60 characters or fewer. Any longer and the title gets cut off in 
search results. Mobile devices often show even fewer characters before the 
title is cut off. If you have a large mobile audience, put the most important 
keywords at the beginning of the title so that they are visible to all users.
Understanding Working Titles
Editors — whether they’re of the Hollywood variety or the YouTube 
­variety — often use a working title for a film being edited. That’s all fine 
and dandy in the privacy of your studio, but we’re here to tell you that you 
should never upload an asset using a working title. Always upload your 
videos with a descriptive title — say, 2014 Napa Earth Quake Overview.mp4. 
Even if the descriptive title doesn’t end up as the final title, it’s important 
to have a descriptive title associated with the file. YouTube never loses this 
original upload title, so it always remains with your video file in YouTube’s 
database. (This is simply another way to ensure that YouTube knows what 
your video is about, even if you forget to include any other metadata.)
Optimizing Thumbnails  
for Viewer Session Time
Thumbnails are visual snapshots of your video, similar to a poster for 
a movie. They have a tremendous impact on a video’s view rate, so you 
should choose a good one. By default, YouTube chooses thumbnails from 
three optional frames taken at the beginning, middle, and end of your. You 
can, however, create a custom thumbnail for each video. If you do so, it’s 

358
Part V: The Part of Tens 
best to choose a thumbnail that is illustrative of the content in the video. 
Thumbnails show up in the following areas:
✓
✓Channel page
✓
✓Watch page
✓
✓Playlists
✓
✓Suggested videos
✓
✓Channel guide
✓
✓Subscriber feed
✓
✓YouTube search
✓
✓Web search
✓
✓Mobile display
✓
✓Mobile search
Although it’s vital that the title of your video accurately reflects its content, 
it’s even more important for a viewer’s mobile viewing experience that you 
add a compelling video thumbnail. Users of mobile devices often base the 
decision of whether to watch your entire video on the appeal of the video 
thumbnail. The thumbnail should not confuse viewers; it should prepare 
them for the entire viewing experience. You can even create custom thumb-
nails for your playlists.
Playlists can show up in YouTube searches along with the video results, and 
they often lead to longer viewing sessions. The longer a viewer’s session 
time, the better it is for your video and channel ranking. Viewer session time 
is the primary ranking factor on YouTube’s search engine.
Managing Video Descriptions
The video description is a 5,000‐character field that YouTube provides you 
to describe your video. It’s a great place to add details about not only your 
video but also your channel, along with links for other videos, subscriptions, 
other channels, and web assets. In other words, it’s a goldmine for both 
metadata and user guidance. The viewers who care about your video will 
read the description, so make it worth their while.
The first two lines of the first paragraph of the description (approximately 
100 characters) comprise the only element that shows in YouTube search 
results; thus, it’s the most important part of the description copy. Everything 

359

 Chapter 15: Ten Key Steps to Improving YouTube Search Results
to follow is consumed by YouTube’s algorithms, and passionate follow-
ers who click the Show More link below the description copy. The first line 
should describe the content of the video and grab viewers’ attention with 
alluring copy to lead them into the viewing experience. If you don’t have a lot 
of time, focus your creative energy on the first paragraph.
The first line should also include a conversion link. The best practice is to 
include a short link to save space — you can compress any link using a link 
shortener like bit.ly, a free link‐shortening website. The link might lead to a 
playlist with the video, the landing page on or off the YouTube site, a product 
page, or a blog. Figure 15-2 shows a good description.
You can set up default metadata for your new uploads. Always remember 
to customize the title, tags and descriptions of every video. Your metadata 
should closely reflect each video’s unique content.
Adding Closed Captioning
YouTube and certain other platforms let you upload text files that contain 
closed‐captioning subtitles for your video. You can then reach people who 
have hearing impairments, and it pays off for your search engine ranking. The 
captions are used by YouTube search to determine the topic of your video. 
(See Chapter 10 for information about adding captions.)
Figure 15-2:

360
Part V: The Part of Tens 
You don’t have to write captions yourself. Several affordable services can 
create these caption files for you. 3Play Media (www.3playmedia.com),  
for example, provides captions for only dollars per minute.
Handling Tags
A tag is a keyword that identifies your video’s content within YouTube for 
discovery. These unique, descriptive keywords are limited to 30 characters 
per keyword. Try to apply at least 15 tags per video, with a maximum of 500 
characters per video. Tags are applied through the Video Manager portion 
of Creator Studio. You can add tags when you upload or modify them later 
on. Make the tags extremely relevant to your video content, and scatter them 
throughout the description copy. Start with the most specific tags first, to 
help viewers find your videos more easily when they’re looking for a particu-
lar topic.
Start off with specific keyword tags, but if you have space, then add some 
general purpose ones as well to identify the category of your video, such as 
beauty or DIY or entertainment.
Refreshing Metadata
Recently published videos typically rank higher in YouTube Search because 
they have newer content — though we’re not saying that all old videos dis-
appear. Older videos that have been watched frequently and are contextual 
matches for specific searches will rank well. It is important to revisit your 
older video content regularly and add in any new or trending metadata terms 
that are relevant.
Refresh your annotations to link to newer, more relevant videos and play­
lists on your channel. (See Chapter 10 for information about annotation 
­optimizations.)
Understanding Channel SEO
Channels can show up in relevant YouTube searches along with video search 
results. You’ll see a square channel icon and the first few lines of the chan-
nel description in the search results. To ensure that your channel appears 
in the search results, you have to let YouTube know what your channel is 
about. Your channel has a description field that you can use to communicate 

361

 Chapter 15: Ten Key Steps to Improving YouTube Search Results
­precisely what content viewers can find here. (See Chapter 9 for instructions 
on how to update and edit your channel description.)
A channel also has a field for keywords that you can use just like you use the 
Tags field for videos. To update your channel keywords:
1.	Log on to your YouTube account.
2.	On your YouTube page, click the channel icon and then choose 
Creator Studio from the menu that appears.
Doing so brings up the Creator Studio dashboard.
3.	Click the Channel heading in the navigation menu on the left.
4.	Click the Advanced button.
Doing so brings up a page dedicated to the advanced channel settings, 
as shown in Figure 15-3.
5.	Add relevant, descriptive keywords, separated by commas in the 
Channel Keyword field.
6.	When done, click the Save button.
Create a keyword‐rich channel description. Craft an engaging first few lines 
of the channel description, because those are the elements that are revealed 
across YouTube with your channel.

metadata.

362
Part V: The Part of Tens 
Add specific keywords first, and finish off with broader terms if space allows.
Avoiding Misleading Metadata
Using misleading or deceptive metadata is against YouTube policies. You 
cannot include metadata that isn’t contextually relevant to your video con-
tent or that misrepresents the video’s content. You cannot add a series of 
unrelated tags to your description copy to show up for additional search 
results. If Katy Perry isn’t in your video, you shouldn’t add her name to the 
title, tags, or description. Adding repetitive words in the description copy 
and tags indicates spam to YouTube and is disregarded.
The most important thing is to not try to trick viewers into watching your 
content with misleading titles, thumbnails, tags, or description copy. These 
resources are at your disposal to add more contextual value to your video 
asset — not to fool viewers into clicking. Misleading metadata is a futile 
­exercise. When viewers click on your video and don’t find what they were 
looking for, they will click to go elsewhere quickly. This hurts your watch‐
time statistics and definitely hurts your search rankings. YouTube excels at 
detecting spam and misleading metadata, so trying to game the system will 
never ­succeed in the long run.
Flag comments on videos if they look like spam. This helps YouTube improve 
its spam filters even further. Use the Flag for Spam feature only if you’re con-
fident that a comment is truly spam. If you’re the owner of the content, you 
can remove or delete spam comments from your videos to help the viewer’s 
engagement experience. Removing comments should be done only to create 
a better experience for your audience, not to control the conversation.

J
 
ohn Locke said “The end of law is not to abolish or restrain, but to pre-
serve and enlarge freedom.” In the same spirit, copyright law protects 
the creator from having her material used by someone who didn’t create it 
without permission. The goal is to protect the creator’s freedom to create 
without having to fear that others will profit unjustly. Create something, and 
the intellectual property belongs to you by way of copyright. If anyone palms 
off your intellectual property as their own, the law protects you and provides 
measures for legal action. And if your copyrighted content should appear in 
video form on YouTube without your permission, YouTube acts as the law on 
your behalf.
That’s great if someone is trying to take advantage of you, but sometimes it’s 
you who gets put on the hot seat. Thanks to multimedia, people often create 
things that use other people’s work — say, adding a piece of music you didn’t 
write to a video you’ve made — and they don’t realize that they’re doing any-
thing wrong. Collaboration is a good thing, but you need to have the proper 
permission to use any music, artwork, photographs, excerpts, or whatever 
else was created by an individual other than yourself.
When someone infringes on copyright — whether it’s someone doing it to 
you or you doing it to someone else — there will be consequences. YouTube 
takes the breach seriously and will take down the infringing video. It also 
penalizes the offender with a strike. And as in baseball, if you take three 
Chapter 16

364
Part V: The Part of Tens 
strikes, you’re outta there! YouTube boots you and your channel if it gets to 
this point.
To ensure that it doesn’t happen to you, follow the advice in this chapter.
Remember Who Owns the Copyright
It’s fairly simple: If you created the video, the copyright belongs to you; if 
you upload content created by someone else, the copyright belongs to that 
person, and you had better have permission to do it.
As soon as the work is created, so is the copyright, and since 1992, there’s no 
longer a renewal process. Copyright lives with the creator — and even lives 
on for a period after the death of the creator.
Basic stuff, right? But often it’s the most basic rules that are not followed. 
People jaywalk all the time, and people don’t honor copyright all the time 
on YouTube, either. That means YouTube is kept busy because, if another 
user uploads your content without your permission, or if you do the same, 
YouTube tracks down the offender, YouTube sends a take‐down notifica-
tion, YouTube blocks the video, and YouTube can potentially sanction the 
offender with a strike.
Attribution Does Not Absolve  
a Copyright Violation
Some people steal other people’s work and claim it as their own, and that’s 
blatant infringement. But it’s no less of an offense when you use content and 
then add a line saying, “Created by so‐and‐so.” It’s still a breach that can earn 
a strike and a block the video.
If you use someone else’s work in your video without that person’s permis-
sion, it doesn’t make it less of an offense just because you give the person 
credit. You’re still in violation because attributing the creator doesn’t 
absolve you if don’t get permission. The only exception is fair use, but we will 
tell you more about that topic later in this chapter.
Here are some elements to watch out for in your videos:
✓
✓Music: If you didn’t write it, didn’t play it, didn’t record it, and you didn’t 
get permission to use it, you can’t use it.

365

 Chapter 16: Ten Things to Know About Copyright 
✓
✓Someone else’s pictures: Pictures found on the Internet are not 
yours for the taking. Instead, try a practical solution, like purchas-
ing inexpensive rights images on various stock photo sites, such 
as www.istockphoto.com/, www.shutterstock.com/, and 
http://us.fotolia.com/.
✓
✓TV or movie clip: Again, you simply can’t do it, even if you provide an 
attribution. Some exceptions are afforded under the principle of fair use, 
which we describe later in this chapter. And though the studio may not 
track you down and ask you to remove it, YouTube eventually will, and 
it will throw you a fastball over the plate.
Know the Consequences
YouTube takes copyright issues seriously — and it blocks or takes down any 
video that infringes on copyright. Two things can happen, and though they 
sound similar, they’re completely different:
✓
✓Takedown notice: If someone notices content they’ve created being 
used without their permission, they can send YouTube a complaint. If 
it’s a breach, YouTube takes down the video.
If you feel compelled to lodge a complaint, just be extra sure that it’s your 
content and that the breach is accurate, because you’re initiating a legal 
process.
✓
✓Content ID match: Content ID is a system YouTube uses to automati-
cally match content that violates copyright against the millions of videos 
uploaded every month to the site. For Content ID to work properly, 
­copyright owners have to upload so‐called reference files — original 
versions of their work that prove they own the rights. Normally, record 
labels, movie studios, or TV stations go through this process for all 
the work they publish, so individual artists don’t have to worry about 
it. Every new video uploaded to YouTube is checked against this huge 
library of reference files, and if there is a match, YouTube automatically 
files a copyright claim for the owner of the work.
It is possible to have permission to use music, pictures, or video yet still 
have a Content ID claim filed against you. Content ID is an automated pro-
cess, and the idea is that claims are triggered when the robots sense that 
the musical, photo, or video content belongs to a copyright holder other 
than yourself. But don’t worry: If you had permission to use that content, 
you can file a dispute challenging the accuracy of the claim.

366
Part V: The Part of Tens 
To find more information about Content ID and the processes behind it, go to 
www.youtube.com/yt/copyright/.
No matter how a copyright violation may have been discovered, if you 
breach another content creator’s copyright, that creator is in a position to 
have YouTube take down your content. In the event of a mistake, you can 
send YouTube a notice saying that an error occurred, but you had better be 
darn sure about it. If the claim ends up being proven correct, or if you were 
untruthful in any way, you may find yourself in much bigger trouble, includ-
ing legal action.
The Profit Motive Is Irrelevant
Some folks will say “Hey, it’s all right if I use someone else’s content, because 
I’m not looking to make any money.” Say that before the judge and the 
­verdict will still be “Guilty of copyright infringement!”
Whether you intend to make money from the video or you simply want to 
share your masterpiece with the world, it still doesn’t mean that you can 
violate copyright law. You need to get permission from the copyright holder. 
Not thinking about profit doesn’t absolve you if you used someone else’s 
­content without permission.
Rather than take any chances, reach out to the copyright holder, explain 
your intended use of the content — profit or otherwise — and see what the 
person says. Sometimes, the copyright holder will give you written permis-
sion with no stipulations, whereas at other times she may attach restrictions 
on the type of use, length of time of use, or content.
Getting Permission for Using 
Copyrighted Material
Getting permission to use someone else’s copyrighted material is often well 
within the realm of the possible. A nicely written note explaining how you 
would use the content usually is enough for a rights holder to grant permis-
sion. Just remember that it can get dicey, because sometimes permission 
comes with the caveat that you cannot monetize the overall video. That 
restriction can hurt big‐time if your intention is to quit your day job, but it 
may end up being a bittersweet solution if you’re merely looking to add flavor 
to your video.

367

 Chapter 16: Ten Things to Know About Copyright 
Fair Use Is Complicated
Albert Einstein never failed math, unicorns don’t exist, and fair use is any-
thing but easy — or fair — to understand. Debunking the first two of these 
myths is easy. All right, maybe the first is, but when it comes to fair use, 
that’s a single‐horned horse of a different color.
Many misconceptions exist surrounding fair use, among them the notion that 
you can use anything you want as long as you don’t go beyond some arbi-
trary time constraint. But it’s much more complicated. In some editorial situ-
ations, you can use copyrighted material without permission, but you must 
fully understand those situations to avoid future trouble.
If you feel the need to exercise fair use, and the use is for nonprofit and edu-
cational purpose, here a few acceptable uses to consider:
✓
✓Criticism: Reviewing a movie or some form of music makes it perfectly 
acceptable to use copyrighted material without permission, for example 
short clips on the work you critique.
✓
✓Parody: If you’re poking fun at something, it’s acceptable to use content 
without first gaining permission.
✓
✓Commentary: This one depends on how you use the material. If it’s used 
just enough to illustrate your point, it’s acceptable. For instance, gamers 
on YouTube often record themselves playing a new video game and 
offer funny observations. This is, within limits, fair use.
And now for the misconceptions:
✓
✓You can use 40 seconds of anything: It’s completely untrue. You can’t 
use even 4 seconds if it doesn’t comply with the circumstances in the 
preceding list.
✓
✓The notion that you can decide fair use for yourself: Fair use is compli-
cated for many situations, so you may not be sure exactly what you’re 
allowed to do. The thing is, if you stretch the limits of fair use too far, 
you can be sanctioned by YouTube. That’s why a copyright attorney 
should decide any serious question over fair use.
Don’t Let Copyright Issues on YouTube 
Lead to a Strikeout
Three strikes and you’re out is a common understanding when playing base-
ball. But in baseball, you get another chance after another eight batters have 

368
Part V: The Part of Tens 
had their try. YouTube doesn’t share this benevolence, so if they give you 
strikes — especially for copyright issues — that means a lifetime ban. That’s 
something you don’t want on your record; worse yet, once that happens to 
you, you won’t be able to recover any of your videos. So you want to avoid 
getting strikes at all costs.
There are two types of YouTube strikes:
✓
✓Community Guideline Strikes: These can result from a variety of 
­reasons, ranging from uploading objectionable content to having a 
­misleading thumbnail or caption.
✓
✓Copyright Strike: If some part of your video includes content from 
another creator and that creator did not grant you permission, you can 
get a strike. You can also get a ContentID claim lodged against you that 
can turn into a strike. You can appeal it in both cases or take down the 
video to avoid a possible strike.
Other things you should know:
✓
✓Mandatory copyright school must be completed: With every strike, 
YouTube requires that you take an online course and take a little quiz to 
be sure you’re up to speed on copyright regulations.
✓
✓Strikes come down, eventually: As long as you haven’t struck out, some 
strikes disappear after a while — usually six months. If you get another 
strike, the clock starts over.
✓
✓Your fate usually lies with the copyright holder: That person can 
decide whether the video you uploaded should be removed, flagged in 
certain regions, or even monetized. Yes, that’s right: Even though the 
video may contain only a small portion of the person’s material, he’s 
entitled to all monetization proceeds. He can even put ads on your 
video, if you haven’t added monetization.
Wipe the Slate Clean
When it comes to removing strikes from your account, these two contradic-
tory idioms come to mind:
✓
✓The squeaky wheel gets the grease.
✓
✓Don’t open a can of worms.
If you get a copyright strike from YouTube and you’re positive that you’re in 
the right, go ahead and appeal the strike. By not staying quiet, you can fulfill 
the prophecy of the first idiom by having that strike removed.

369

 Chapter 16: Ten Things to Know About Copyright 
Yet there’s that second idiom. If you’re not sure whether you can win, maybe 
it’s better to wait it out until the strike expires. You see, after you appeal 
the strike, your personal information goes to the copyright holder and that 
person can possibly sue you for copyright infringement. If the situation gets 
to this level, you still can work out an agreement directly with the copyright 
holder and see whether he will file an appeal with YouTube on your behalf if 
you both agree that you were within your rights to use the copyrighted mate-
rial. It’s worth a shot.
As for strikes related to the community guidelines, feel free to appeal those, 
because they’re only between you and YouTube.
YouTube’s Robots Are Good at Finding 
Copyright Infringements
Whether intentional or inadvertent, sometimes the content of other creators 
gets used in a YouTube video. Sometimes the breach is noticed, and at other 
times it goes undetected by the original creator. But as YouTube continues to 
refine its copyright detection system, it will find it more quickly than ever.
Part of those refinements to YouTube’s copyright detection system include 
sophisticated algorithms that scan every uploaded video and compare it to 
similar uploaded content, looking for matches with music, video, or pictures. 
It seems music gets detected the most. Even if it’s background music, you 
may get sanctioned. Usually, YouTube blocks the video, and you must submit 
a dispute form.
Copyright Is Not Forever, But It’s Likely 
Forever Enough for YouTube
Copyright lasts for 75 years past the death of the author; after that point, the 
copyrighted content enters the public domain. When that happens, the con-
tent is no longer protected by intellectual property laws, and anyone can use 
it without permission. Of course, for many people on YouTube, that content 
isn’t available to use without permission until we near the next century. Of 
course, if the creator (or heirs) files a copyright extension, she can hold on 
to the rights — then the video of your dog dressed as a spider can stay in the 
family for as long as possible.

Dedication
Rob Ciampa: I wish to dedicate this book to my wife, Laura, who tastefully 
balances being both an admiring fan and an impartial critic. I also dedicate 
this book to my sons Matt and Zach, who turned our attic into a YouTube 
studio, built a popular channel, and complained about cutting the grass 
because they were too occupied making videos instead.
Theresa Moore: This book is dedicated to my mother, Hope, for always 
­pushing me to be the most creative version of myself and for showing me 
that hard work and dedication to one’s passions is the only way to move 
­forward in life.

Authors’ Acknowledgments
Rob Ciampa and Theresa Moore: Keeping up with the YouTube world is not 
so different from minding a two‐year‐old in a toy store; it’s fast moving and 
often feels as if everything is out of control. Fortunately, we had many help-
ing hands to keep us up to date and help deliver the book you’re now holding 
in your hands (or viewing on your tablet). We would like to thank the team at 
Wiley who came to us with a great idea and a system to make it so, including 
Steven Hayes, Paul Levesque, and Becky Whitney. A big thank you also goes 
out to collaborators Adam Wescott, John Carucci, and Stan Muller.
Sincere thanks to Andreas Goeldi, CTO of Pixability, for being the most effi-
cient man on Earth, and Bettina Hein, founder and CEO of Pixability, for put-
ting together a truly great ad tech company. We’d like to thank our 
professional services and marketing teams at Pixability who helped review 
our manuscript while simultaneously keeping our YouTube customers happy 
and the world informed about the virtues of video marketing. A big thank you 
to Michael Benson, Laura Ciampa, Bill Darmon, Alexandra English, Ellen 
Flaherty, Matt Jackson, Shaman Kothari, Jessica McCarthy, Merrily McGugan, 
Jackie Swansburg Paulino, Sam Sacks, Emily Waskevich, and Ryan Whitten.
A special thank you goes to Jeff Rozic of YouTube for helping us navigate the 
ever‐changing YouTube user interface.
