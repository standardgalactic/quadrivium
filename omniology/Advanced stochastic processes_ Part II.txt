Stochastic differential equations
CHAPTER 4
Stochastic diﬀerential equations
Some pertinent topics in the present chapter consist of a discussion on mar-
tingale theory, and a few relevant results on stochastic diﬀerential equations in
spaces of ﬁnite dimension. In particular unique weak solutions to stochastic dif-
ferential equations give rise to strong Markov processes whose one-dimensional
distributions are governed by the corresponding second order parabolic type
diﬀerential equation. Essentially speaking this chapter is part of Chapter 1 in
[146]. (The author is thankful to WSPC for the permission to include this text
also in the present book.) In this chapter we discuss weak and strong solutions
to stochastic diﬀerential equations. We also discuss a version of the Girsanov
transformation.
1. Solutions to stochastic diﬀerential equations
Basically, the material in this section is taken from Ikeda and Watanabe [61].
In Subsection 1.1 we begin with a discussion on strong solutions to stochastic
diﬀerential equations, after that, in Subsection 1.2 we present a martingale
characterization of Brownian motion. We also pay some attention to (local)
exponential martingales: see Subsection 1.3. In Subsection 1.4 the notion of
weak solutions is explained. However, ﬁrst we give a deﬁnition of Brownian
motion which starts at a random position.
4.1. Definition. Let pΩ, F, Pq be a probability space with ﬁltration pFtqtě0.
A d-dimensional Brownian motion is a almost everywhere continuous adapted
process tBptq “ pB1ptq, . . . , Bdptqq : t ě 0u such that for 0 ă t1 ă t2 ă ¨ ¨ ¨ ă
tn ă 8 and for C any Borel subset of
`
Rd˘n the following equality holds:

dx1 . . . dxn.
(4.1)
This process is called a d-dimensional Brownian motion with initial distribution
µ if for 0 ă t1 ă t2 ă ¨ ¨ ¨ ă tn ă 8 and every Borel subset of
`
Rd˘n`1 the
following equality holds:
P rpBp0q, B pt1q , . . . , B ptnqq P Cs

Stochastic differential equations
dµ px0q dx1 . . . dxn.
(4.2)
For the deﬁnition of p0,d pt, x, yq see formula (4.26). By deﬁnition a ﬁltration
pFtqtě0 is an increasing family of σ-ﬁelds, i.e. 0 ď t1 ď t2 ă 8 implies Ft1 Ă Ft2.
The process of Brownian motion tBptq : t ě 0u is said to be adapted to the
ﬁltration pFtqtě0 if for every t ě 0 the variable Bptq is Ft-measurable. It is
assumed that the P-negligible sets belong to F0.
1.1. Strong solutions to stochastic diﬀerential equations. In this sec-
tion we discuss strong or pathwise solutions to stochastic diﬀerential equations.
We also show that if the stochastic diﬀerential equation in (4.108) possesses
unique pathwise solutions, then it has unique weak solutions. We begin with a
formal deﬁnition.
4.2. Definition. The equation in (4.108) is said to have unique pathwise so-
lutions, if for any Brownian motion tpBptq : t ě 0q , pΩ, F, Pqu and any pair of
Rd-valued adapted processes tXptq : t ě 0u and tX1ptq : t ě 0u for which
Xptq “ x `

ż t

b ps, Xpsqq ds and
(4.3)
X1ptq “ x `
ż t
0
σ ps, X1psqq dBpsq `
ż t
0
b ps, X1psqq ds
(4.4)
it follows that Xptq “ X1ptq P-almost surely for all t ě 0. If for any given
Brownian motion pBptqqtě0 the process pXptqqtě0 is such that for P-almost all
ω P Ωthe equality
Xpt, ωq “ x `
ż t
0
σ ps, Xps, ωqq dBps, ωq `
ż t
0
b ps, Xps, ωqq ds
is true, then t ÞÑ Xptq is called a strong solution.
Strong solutions are also called pathwise solutions. In order to facilitate the
proof of Theorem 4.4 we insert the following lemma.
4.3. Lemma. Let γ be a positive real number. Then the following inequality
holds:

(4.5)
Since ?γ ` ?γ ` 4 ď 2?γ ` 2, the inequality in (4.5) implies:

We will use the ﬁniteness of the sum rather than the precise estimate.

4.4. Theorem. Let σj,k ps, xq and bj ps, xq, 1 ď j, k ď d be continuous functions
deﬁned on r0, 8q ˆ Rd such that for all t ą 0 there exists a constant Kptq with
the property that

(4.8)
for all 0 ď s ď t, and all x, y P Rd. Fix x P Rd, and let pΩ, F, Pq be a probability
space with a ﬁltration pFtqtě0. Moreover, let tBptq : t ě 0u be a Brownian mo-
tion on the ﬁltered probability space pΩ, Ft, Pq. Then there exists an Rd-valued
process tXptq : t ě 0u such that, for all 0 ă T ă 8, sup0ătďT E

(4.9)
This process is pathwise unique in the sense of Deﬁnition 4.2.
The techniques in the proof below are very similar to a method to prove the
following version of Gronwall’s inequality: see e.g. [54]. Let f, g, h : r0, Ts Ñ R
be continuous functions such that fptq ď gptq `
şt
0 hpsqfpsq ds, 0 ď t ď T. If
h ě 0, then by induction with respect to k it follows that

by the formula
TXptq “ x `

Then the argumentation in the proof below shows that T is a mapping from
C
`
r0, Ts, L2 `
Ω, F, P; Rd˘˘
to C
`
r0, Ts, L2 `
Ω, F, P; Rd˘˘
indeed, and that T has
a unique ﬁxed point X which is a pathwise solution to the equation in (4.9).
Proof. Existence. Fix 0 ă T ă 8. Put X0psq “ x, 0 ď s ď t, and, for
n ě 1, 0 ă t ď T,

By assumption there exists functions s ÞÑ Kjpsq and s ÞÑ Kijpsq, 0 ď s ď T,
such that for
|bj ps, yq ´ bj ps, xq| ď Kjpsq |y ´ x| , 0 ď s ď T, x, y P Rd,
and
(4.12)
|σij ps, yq ´ σij ps, xq| ď Ki,jpsq |y ´ x| , 0 ď s ď T, x, y P Rd,
(4.13)
and such that
şT
0 pKjpsq2 ` Ki,jpsq2q ds ă 8 for 0 ď 1 ď i, j ď d. Let the
function Kpsq ě 0 be such that Kpsq2 “ řd
j“1 Kjpsq2 ` řd
i“1 max1ďjďd Kijpsq2.
Then
şT
0 Kpsq2 ds ă 8. Moreover, for n ě 1 and 0 ď t ď T we infer, by using
(4.11). (4.12) and (4.13), by the deﬁnition of Kpsq, and by standard properties
of stochastic integrals relative to Brownian motion, the following inequality:

(4.14)
In order to obtain (4.14) we also used an inequality of the form p|a| ` |b|q2 ď
2

|a|2 ` |b|2˘
, a, b P Rd. The proofs of (4.15) and (4.18) require equalities of

By employing induction the inequality in (4.14) yields, for 1 ď j ď n and for

(4.20)
From (4.19) it also follows that this convergence also holds P-almost surely.
The latter can be seen as follows. Fix η ą 0. Then the probability of the event

P-almost sure convergence (as n Ñ 8) also implies that we may take pointwise
limits in (4.10) to obtain:
Xptq “ x `
ż t

b ps, Xpsqq ds `
ż t

σ ps, Xpsqq dBpsq.
(4.22)
The equality in (4.22) shows the existence of pathwise or strong solutions to the
equation in (4.9).
Uniqueness. Let pX1ptqq0ďtďT and pX2ptqq0ďtďT be two solutions to the stochas-
tic diﬀerential equation in (4.9). By using a stopping time argument we may
assume that sup0ďsďT |X2psq ´ X1psq| is P-almost surely bounded. Then

(4.24)
Since the right-hand side of (4.24) tends to 0 as n Ñ 8 we see that X2ptq “ X1ptq

The proof of Theorem 4.4 is complete now.
□
1.2. A martingale characterization of Brownian motion. The fol-
lowing result we owe to L´evy.
4.5. Theorem. Let pΩ, F, Pq be a probability space with ﬁltration (or reference
system) pFtqtě0. Suppose F is the σ-algebra generated by Ytě0Ft augmented with
the P-zero sets, and suppose Ft is continuous from the right: Ft “ XsątFs for all
t ě 0. Let tMptq “ pM1ptq, . . . , Mdptqq : t ě 0u be an Rd-valued local P-almost
surely continuous martingale with the property that the quadratic covariation
processes t ÞÑ ⟨Mi, Mj⟩ptq satisfy
⟨Mi, Mj⟩ptq “ δi,jt,
1 ď i, j ď d.
(4.25)
Then tMptq : t ě 0u is d-dimensional Brownian motion with initial distribution
given by µpBq “ P rMp0q P Bs, B P BRd, the Borel ﬁeld of Rd.
It follows that the ﬁnite-dimensional distributions of the process t ÞÑ Mptq are
given by:

4.6. Remark. There is even a nicer result which says the following. Let X be
a continuous Rd-valued process with stationary independent increments. Then,
there exist unique b P Rd and Σ P Rd2 such that X ptq´X p0q is a pb, Σq-Brownian
motion. This means that Xptq is a Gaussian (or multivariate normal) vector
such that E rXptqs “ bt and
E rpXj1ptq ´ bj1tq pXj2ptq ´ bj2tqs “ tΣj1,j2.
For the one-dimensional case the reader is referred to Breiman [29]. For the

the process t ÞÑ Mptq possesses independent increments.

The equality in (4.37) is the same as the one in (4.27). By the above arguments
this completes the proof of Theorem 4.5.
□
As a corollary to Theorem 4.5 we get the following result due to L´evy.
4.7. Corollary. Let tMptq : t ě 0u be a continuous local martingale in R such
that the process t ÞÑ Mptq2 ´ t is a local martingale as well. Then the process
tMptq : t ě 0u is a Brownian motion with initial distribution given by µpBq “
P rMp0q P Bs, B P BR.
Proof. Since Mptq2 ´ t is a local martingale, it follows that the quadratic
variation process t ÞÑ ⟨M, M⟩ptq satisﬁes ⟨M, M⟩ptq “ t, t ě 0. So the result
in Corollary 4.7 follows from Theorem 4.5.
□
The following result contains a d-dimensional version of Corollary 4.7.
4.8. Theorem. Let tMptq “ pM1ptq, . . . , Md1ptqq : t ě 0u be a continuous local
martingale with covariation process given by
⟨Mj, Mk⟩ptq “
ż t

(4.38)
Let the d1 ˆ d-matrix process tχptq : t ě 0u be such that χptqΦptqχptq˚ “ I,
where I is the d ˆ d identity matrix. Put Bptq “
şt
0 χpsq dMpsq. This integral
should be interpreted in Itˆo sense. Then the process t ÞÑ Bptq is d-dimensional
Brownian motion. Put Ψptq “ Φptqχptq˚, and suppose that Ψptqχptq “ I, the
d1 ˆ d1 identity matrix. Then Mptq ´ Mp0q “
şt
0 Ψpsq dBpsq.
4.9. Remark. Since
χptq pΦptqχptq˚χptq ´ Iq “ pχptqΦptqχptq˚ ´ Iq χptq “ 0
we see that the second equality in Ψptqχptq “ Φptqχptq˚χptq “ I is only possible
if we assume d “ d1. Of course here we take the dimensions of the null and
range space of the matrix χptq into account.
Proof of Theorem 4.8. Fix 1 ď i, j ď d. We shall calculate the qua-
dratic covariation process

1.3. Exponential local martingales. Let t ÞÑ Nptq, 0 ď t ď T, be a
continuous (local) martingale with variation process t ÞÑ ⟨N, N⟩ptq, 0 ď t ď

are called exponential local martingales. The following proposition serves as a
preparation for Proposition 4.12. It also has some interest of its own.
4.10. Proposition. Let pΩ, F, Pq be a probability space with a ﬁltration F0ďtďT,
and let M “ pMptqq0ďtďT and N “ pNptqq0ďtďT be two local martingales with

(a) The process t ÞÑ e´Zptq, 0 ď t ď T, is a martingale;
(b) The process t ÞÑ e´Zptq pMptq ` ⟨N, M⟩ptqq is a local martingale;
(c) The process t ÞÑ Mptq ` ⟨N, M⟩ptq is a local martingale relative to the

and set Znptq “ Z pt ^ τnq. Then the processes t ÞÑ e´Znptq, 0 ď t ď T, n P N,
are martingales. It follows that E

In fact we have a stronger result. It says that an exponential local martingale
is a submartingale.
4.11. Theorem. Let the process t ÞÑ e´Zptq, 0 ď t ď T, be a continuous lo-
cal martingale. In general, this process is a submartingale. Consequently, if
E
“
e´Zptq‰
“ 1 for all 0 ď t ď T, then the process t ÞÑ e´Zptq, 0 ď t ď T, is a
martingale.
Proof. This result can be seen as follows. Let 0 ď t1 ă t2, and choose the
sequence of stopping times pτnqnPN as above. Then, for A P Ft1^τm, we have

From (4.42) it follows that:
E

(4.43)
Since the event tτm ą t1u belongs to Ft1^τm, from (4.43) we infer

ď e´Zpt1^τmq1tτmąt1u “ e´Zpt1q1tτmąt1u.
(4.44)
The ﬁrst equality in (4.44) is a consequence of the fact that, if an event A
belongs to Ft1, then A X tτm ą t1u belongs to Ft1^τm. In the left-hand side and
the far right-hand side of (4.44) we let m Ñ 8 to obtain
E

e´Zpt2q ˇˇ Ft1

P-almost surely.
(4.45)
The inequality in (4.45) shows that the process t ÞÑ e´Zptq is a submartingale.
If 0 ď t1 ă t2 ď T, and if E

it follows that the process in (a) is a genuine martingale: see Theorem 4.11.

(4.49)
Being the sum of two stochastic integrals with respect to (local) martingales
the equality in (4.49) implies that the process in (b) is a local martingale.
(c) By using a stopping time argument we may and do assume that the process
t ÞÑ Mptq ` ⟨N, M⟩ptq is bounded and so it belongs to L1 pΩ, FT, QNq. Let
0 ď t1 ă t2 ď T, and put

A combination of Proposition 4.10 and L´evy’s characterization of Brownian
motion in Rd yields the following result.
4.12. Proposition. Let the Rd-valued process s ÞÑ cpsq be an adapted pro-

the measure A ÞÑ QNpAq, A P FT, as deﬁned in Proposition 4.10.

the proof of Proposition 4.12.

It will be very convenient to introduce Hermite polynomials phkpxqqkPN, and to
establish some of their properties. In the context of stochastic calculus they
also play a central role. The Hermite polynomial hkpxq is deﬁned by
hkpxq “ p´1qke

(4.53)
For k P N, x P R, a ą 0, we write

.
Then we have H0px, aq “ 1, H1px, aq “ x, H2px, aq “ x2 ´a, H3px, aq “ x3 ´ax.
The Hermite polynomials satisfy the following recurrence relation:
hk`2pxq ´ xhk`1pxq ` pk ` 1qhkpxq “ 0, k ě 0,
(4.54)
and therefore
Hk`2px, aq ´ xHk`1px, aq ` pk ` 1qaHkpx, aq “ 0, k ě 0.
(4.55)
The equality in (4.54) can be proved by induction and the deﬁnition of hk in
(4.53). From the deﬁnition of hk`1pxq it follows that h1
k`1pxq “ xhk`1pxq ´
hk`2pxq, and so, by (4.54) we see
h1
k`1pxq “ pk ` 1qhkpxq, k ě 0.

From (4.54) and (4.56) we infer

The equality in (4.63) implies the identity in (4.60). By a correct scaling (τ?a
replaces τ, and
x
?a replaces x) the equality in (4.59) follows from (4.60) and
the deﬁnition of Hkpx, aq. The equalities in (4.61) follow from (4.56) and from
(4.58) respectively. Altogether this completes the proof of Proposition 4.13.

on the probability space pΩ, F, Pq. Its quadratic variation process is denoted by

Proof. These equalities follow from Itˆo’s formula and the equalities in
Proposition 4.13. Itˆo’s lemma is applied to the functions px, aq ÞÑ Hk`1px, aq,
and px, aq ÞÑ eτx´ 1

In particular
the equalities in (4.61) are relevant. This completes the proof of Proposition
4.14.

In the following proposition we collect some equalities in case we consider an

4.15. Proposition. Let t ÞÑ Mptq, 0 ď t ď T, be a martingale on pΩ, F, Pq

The equalities in (4.72) imply those in (4.68) for ℓ“ 1. The second equality
follows by partial integration and induction with respect to ℓ. The ﬁrst equality
in (4.68) can be obtained by an argument which is very similar to the proof of
the equality in (4.67) with k1 “ k2 “ ℓ. The details are left to the reader.
This completes the proof of Proposition 4.15.

If the limit in (4.73) is in fact an L1-limit, then the pro-

If the process t ÞÑ ⟨M, M⟩ptq is real-valued and deterministic, then the limit in
(4.73) is an L2-limit, and so also an L1-limit.
Proof. Equality (4.73) in Corollary 4.16 follows from the equality in (4.59)
in Proposition 4.13 with x “ Mptq and a “ ⟨M, M⟩ptq together with the equal-
ities in (4.65) and (4.61). The assertion about the L1-convergence also follows
from these arguments.
The only topic that requires some is the one about
the situation where the process t ÞÑ ⟨M, M⟩ptq is deterministic. In this case
the terms in the sum in (4.65) are orthogonal in L2 pΩ, FT, Pq, and this sum
converges in L2-sense to eτMptq´ 1

identities (4.67) and (4.68) in Proposition 4.15. This completes the proof of
Corollary 4.16.
□
The previous results, i.e. Proposition 4.14 and Corollary 4.16 are applicable if
the martingale Mptq is of the form Mptq “

is standard Brownian motion. Then ⟨M, M⟩ptq “

deterministic, then in (4.73) we have L2-convergence. These martingales play a
role in the martingale representation theorem: see Theorem 4.21.

The following theorem shows the close relationship between weak solutions and
solutions to the martingale problem.
4.17. Theorem. Let pΩ, F, Pq be a probability space with a right-continuous
ﬁltration pFtqtě0.
Let tXptq “ pX1ptq, . . . , Xdptqq : t ě 0u be a d-dimensional
continuous adapted process. Then the following assertions are equivalent:

(iii)
On an extended probability space pΩˆ Ω1, Ft b F1

a Brownian motion tBptq : t ě 0u starting at 0 such that

σ ps, Xpsqq dBpsq,
t ě 0.
(4.78)
Here pΩ1, F1
t, P1q is an independent copy of pΩ, Ft, Pq. Moreover, the equality in
(4.78) implies that the stochastic integral pω, ω1q ÞÑ
şt
0 σ ps, Xpsqq dBpsq pω, ω1q
is P ˆ P1-independent of ω1. If the matrix σ ps, yq is invertible, then there is no
need for this extension.
Examples of (Feller) semigroups can be manufactured by taking a continuous
function φ : r0, 8q ˆ E Ñ E with the property that φ ps ` t, xq “ φ pt, φ ps, xqq,
for all s, t ě 0 and x P E. Then the mappings f ÞÑ Pptqf, with Pptqfpxq “
f pφ pt, xqq deﬁnes a semigroup. It is a Feller semigroup if limxÑ△φ pt, xq “ △.
An explicit example of such a function, which does not provide a Feller-Dynkin
semigroup on C0 pRq is given by φpt, xq “

Put upt, xq “ Pptqfpxq “ f pφpt, xqq.
Then

to the martingale problem do not necessarily give rise to Feller-Dynkin semi-
groups. These are semigroups which preserve not only the continuity, but also
the fact that functions which tend to zero at △are mapped to functions with
the same property. However, for Feller semigroups we only require that con-
tinuous functions with values in r0, 1s are mapped to continuous functions with
the same properties. Therefore, it is not needed to include a hypothesis like

Nadirashvili [99] constructs an elliptic operator in a bounded open domain
U Ă Rd with a regular boundary such that the martingale problem is not
uniquely solvable. More precisely the result reads as follows. Consider an elliptic
operator L “
dÿ
j,k“1

, where aj,k “ aj,k are measurable functions on Rd
such that
c´1 |ξ|2 ď

j,k“1
aj,kξjξk ď c |ξ|2 ,
ξ P Rd,
for some ellipticity constant c ě 1. There exists a diﬀusion pXptq, Pxq corre-
sponding to the operator L which can be deﬁned as a solution to the martin-
gale problem P rXp0q “ xs “ 1, f pXptqq ´ f pXp0qq ´
şt
0 f pXpsqq ds is a Px-
martingale for all f P C2 `
Rd˘
. Nadirashvili is interested in non-uniqueness in
the above martingale problem and in non-uniqueness of solutions to the Dirich-
let problem Lu “ 0 in Ω, the unit ball in Rd, u “ g on BΩ, where ΩĂ Rd
is a bounded domain with smooth boundary and g P C2 pBΩq. In particular,
so-called good solutions u to the Dirichlet problem are investigated. A good
solution is a function u which is the limit of a subsequence of solutions un,
n P N, to the equation Lnun “
dÿ
j,k“1
an
j,k

BxjBxk
“ 0 in Ω, un “ g on BΩ, where
the operators Ln are elliptic with smooth coeﬃcients an
j,k and a common el-
lipticity constant c such that an
j,k Ñ aj,k almost everywhere in Ωas n Ñ 8.
The main result is the following theorem: There exists an elliptic operator L
of the above form deﬁned in the unit ball B1 Ă Rd, d ě 3, and there is a
function g P C2 pBB1q such that the formulated Dirichlet problem has at least
two good solutions. An immediate consequence is non-uniqueness of solutions
to the corresponding martingale problem.
The following corollary easily follows from Theorem 4.17. It establishes a close
relationship between unique weak solutions to stochastic diﬀerential equations
and unique solutions to the martingale problem.
For the precise notion of
“unique weak solutions” see Deﬁnition 4.19 below. This result should also be
compared with Proposition 3.43, where the connection with (strong) Markov
processes is explained.
4.18. Corollary. Let the notation and hypotheses be as in Theorem 4.17. Put
Ω“ C

r0, 8q, Rd˘

4.19. Definition. The equation in (4.80) is said to have unique weak solutions
on the interval r0, Ts, also called unique distributional solutions, provided that
the ﬁnite-dimensional distributions of the process Xptq, ď t ď T, which satisfy
(4.80) do not depend on the particular Brownian motion Bptq which occurs in
(4.80). This is the case if and only if for any pair of Brownian motions

and
tpB1ptq : T ě t ě 0q , pΩ1, F, P1qu

martingale Mpsq, 0 ď s ď t, on pΩ, Ft, Pq with the properties of assertion (ii).
We introduce the matrix processes rψεpsq, ε ą 0, ERpsq, and ENpsq as follows
rψεpsq “ σ˚ ps, Xpsqq pσ ps, Xpsqq σ˚ ps, Xpsqq ` εIq´1

and
ENpsq “ I ´ ERpsq.
The matrix ERpsq can be considered as an orthogonal projection on the range
of the matrix σ˚ ps, Xpsqq σ ps, Xpsqq, and ENps as an orthogonal projection on
its null space. More precisely,
ERpsqσ˚ ps, Xpsqq “ σ˚ ps, Xpsqq ,

From L´evy’s theorem 4.5 it follows that the process s ÞÑ Bpsq, 0 ď s ď t, is a
Brownian motion. In order to ﬁnish the proof of the implication (ii) ùñ (iii)
we still have to prove the equality Mpsq “
şs
0 σ pτ, Xpτqq dBpτq. For brevity we
write σpτq “ σ pτ, Xpτqq. Then by deﬁnition and standard calculations with
martingales we obtain:

From (4.89) together with the fact that covariation process of the local martin-
gale Mpsq is given by
şs

the local martingale

The ﬁnal expression in (4.93) is a local martingale. Hence (iii) implies (i).

4.20. Remark. The implication (ii) ùñ (i) in Theorem 4.17 can also be proved
directly by using Itˆo calculus. Suppose that the local martingales t ÞÑ Mjptq,

2. A martingale representation theorem
In this section we formulate and prove the martingale theorem based on an
n-dimensional Brownian motion. Proofs are, essentially speaking, taken from
[106]. Let pWpsqq0ďsă8 be standard Brownian motion in Rn, and let Ft be
the σ-ﬁeld generated by pWpsqq0ďsďt augmented with the P-null sets. For h P
L8 pr0, Ts; Rnq we write Xhptq :“ e

In Theorem 4.21 the space L8
simple pr0, Ts; Rnq consists of those Rn-valued func-
tions h P L8 pr0, Ts; Rnq which can be written in the form

Observe that C8

constitutes a dense subspace of C0

, i.e. the
space of complex-valued continuous functions which tend to 0 at 8 equipped
with the supremum norm.
Proof of Theorem 4.21. This statement is true if there exists no g P
L2 pΩ, FT, Pq, which is perpendicular to all XpTq P ΨT. We start by assum-
ing that there is a g P L2 pΩ, FT, Pq such that g is orthogonal to all vari-
ables XpTq P ΨT.
This orthogonality means that E rXhpTqgs “ 0, for all
h P L8

(4.97)
By taking h as in (4.95), we see that for all λ “ pλ1, . . . , λNq P pRnqN “ RnˆN
and for all pt1, . . . , tNq P r0, TsN with 0 “ t0 ă t1 ă ¨ ¨ ¨ ă tN “ T, the following

From the monotone class theorem, and the fact the space C8

for the uniform topology, it follows that the equality in (4.98), i.e.
the equality

simple pr0, Ts ; Rnq if and only if the random variable g P L2 pΩ, FT, Pq is
identically 0. This completes the proof of Theorem 4.21.
□
The following theorem is known as the Itˆo representation theorem.
4.22. Theorem. If the random variable XpTq belongs to L2 pΩ, FT, Pq, then
there exists a unique predictable Rn-valued process t ÞÑ Fptq, 0 ď t ď T, for

addition, we have

Next we formulate and prove the martingale representation theorem.
4.23. Theorem. Let pMptqq0ďtďT belong to M2 pΩ, FT, Pq. Then there exists
a unique predictable Rn-valued process t ÞÑ ζptq “ pζ1ptq, . . . , ζnptqq, ζptq P

(4.105)
Of course, if in Theorem 4.23 the process t ÞÑ Mptq, 0 ď t ď T, is a martingale
vector in Rd, then we obtain a predictable matrix Zptq P Rnˆd such that Mptq “
Mp0q `

Stochastic Diﬀerential Equations or BSDEs for short.)
Proof of Theorem 4.23. Let pMptqq0ďtďT be as in Theorem 4.23. The-
orem 4.22 yields the existence of a unique predictable Rn-valued process t ÞÑ

3. Girsanov transformation
In this section we want to discuss the Cameron-Martin-Girsanov transformation
or just Girsanov transformation. Let pΩ, F, Pq be a probability space with a
ﬁltration pFtqtě0. In addition, let the process tBptq : t ě 0u be a d-dimensional
Brownian motion. Let bj, cj, σi,j be Borel measurable locally bounded functions
on Rd. Suppose that the stochastic diﬀerential equation
Xptq “ x `
ż t
0
σ ps, Xpsqq dBpsq `
ż t
0
b ps, Xpsqq ds
(4.108)
has unique weak solutions. For a precise deﬁnition of the notion of “unique
weak solutions” see Deﬁnition 4.19. For more information on transformations
of measures on Wiener space see e.g. ¨Ust¨unel and Zakai [139]. In particular
these observations mean that if in equation (4.109) below (for the process Y ptq)
the process B1ptq is a Brownian motion relative to a probability measure P1,
then the P1-distribution of the process Y ptq coincides with the P-distribution of
the process Xptq which satisﬁes (4.108). Next we will elaborate on this item.
Suppose that the process t ÞÑ Y ptq satisﬁes the equation:
Y ptq “ x `

σ ps, Y psqq dBpsq `

(4.109)
where B1ptq “ Bptq `

tive to a martingale transformation P1 of the measure P (Girsanov or Cameron-
Martin transformation) the process t ÞÑ B1ptq is a P1-Brownian motion. More
precisely, we introduce the local martingale M 1ptq and the corresponding mar-
tingale measure P1 by

In addition, we have a need for a vector function c1pt, yq satisfying cpt, yq “

4.24. Proposition. Suppose that the process Y ptq satisﬁes the equation in
(4.109). Let the processes M 1ptq and Z1ptq be deﬁned by (4.110) and (4.112)
respectively. Then the following assertions are true:
(1) The process t ÞÑ M 1ptq is a local P-martingale.
It is a martingale
provided E rM 1ptqs “ 1 for all t ě 0.
(2) Fix t ą 0. The variable M 1ptq only depends on the process s ÞÑ Y psq,
0 ď s ď t.

(3) Suppose that the process t ÞÑ M 1ptq is a P-martingale, and not just a
local P-martingale. Then P1 can be considered as a probability measure
on the σ-ﬁeld generated by Ytą0Ft.
(4) Suppose that the process t ÞÑ M 1ptq is a P-martingale. Then the process
t ÞÑ B1ptq is a Brownian motion relative to P1.
Proof. 1
From Itˆo calculus we get
M 1ptq ´ M 1p0q “ ´
ż t
0
M 1psqc ps, Y psqq dBpsq,
and hence assertion 1 follows, because stochastic integrals with respect to Brow-
nian motion are local martingales. Next we choose a sequence of stopping times
τn which increase to 8 P-almost surely, and which are such that the processes
t ÞÑ M 1 pt ^ τnq are genuine martingales. Then we see E rM 1 pt ^ τnqs “ 1 for
all n P N and t ě 0. Fix t2 ą t1. Since the processes t ÞÑ M 1 pt ^ τnq, n P N,
are P-martingales, we see that

E

P-almost surely.
(4.114)
The equality in (4.114) shows that the process t ÞÑ M 1ptq is a P-martingale
provided that E rM 1ptqs “ 1 for all t ě 0. This completes the proof of assertion
1. 2
This assertion follows from the following calculation:

From (4.115), (4.110), and (4.112) it is plain that M 1ptq only depends on the
path tY psq : 0 ď s ď tu.

This assertion is a consequence of Kolmogorov’s extension theorem. The
measure is P1 is well deﬁned on Ytą0Ft. Here we use the martingale property.
By Kolmogorov’s extension theorem, it extends to the σ-ﬁeld generated by this
union.

sesses unique weak solutions on the interval r0, Ts.
Uniqueness. If weak solutions to the stochastic diﬀerential equation in (4.109)
exist, then they are unique in the sense as explained next. In fact, let the couple

that the local martingale M 1ptq given by

4.26. Remark. The formula in (4.120) is known as the Girsanov transform
or Cameron-Martin transform of the measure P. It is a martingale measure.
Suppose that the process t ÞÑ M 1ptq, as deﬁned in (4.110) is a P-martingale.
Then the proof of Theorem 4.25 shows that the process t ÞÑ Mptq, as deﬁned
in (4.118) is a P-martingale. By assertion 1 in Proposition 4.24 the process
t ÞÑ M 1ptq is a P-martingale if and only E rM 1ptqs “ 1 for all T ě t ě 0, and a
similar statement holds for the process t ÞÑ Mptq. If the process t ÞÑ M 1ptq is a
martingale, then taking G ” 1 in (4.135) shows that E rMptqs “ 1, and hence
by 1 in Proposition 4.24 the process t ÞÑ Mptq is a P-martingale. Conversely, if
the process t ÞÑ Mptq is a P-martingale, then we reverse the implications in the
proof of Theorem 4.25 and take F ” 1 in (4.139) to conclude that E rM 1ptqs “ 1
for all ě 0. But then the process t ÞÑ M 1ptq is a P-martingale.
Notice that the process t ÞÑ Mptq is a P-martingale provided Novikov’s con-
dition is satisﬁed, i.e. if E

Observe that Mp8q “ limtÑ8 Mptq exists P-almost surely.

By 2020, wind could provide one-tenth of our planet’s 
electricity needs. Already today, SKF’s innovative know-
how is crucial to running a large proportion of the 
world’s wind turbines. 
Up to 25 % of the generating costs relate to mainte-
nance. These can be reduced dramatically thanks to our 
systems for on-line condition monitoring and automatic 
lubrication. We help make it more economical to create 
cleaner, cheaper energy out of thin air. 
By sharing our experience, expertise, and creativity, 
industries can boost performance beyond expectations. 
Therefore we need the best employees who can 
meet this challenge!

For a proof of Theorem 4.25 we will need the Skorohod-Dudley-Wichura repre-

S “ C

and can be formulated as follows.
4.29. Theorem. Let pS, dq be a complete separable metric space (i.e. a Polish
space), and let Pk, k P N, and P be probability measures on the Borel ﬁeld BS of
S such that the weak limit w´ limkÑ8 Pk “ P, i.e. limkÑ8

(2) The sequence rYk, k P N, converges to rY rP-almost surely.
4.30. Remark. An analysis of the existence part of the proof of Theorem 4.25
shows that the invertibility of the matrix σ ps, yq is not needed.
Let r

0 ď s ď t, be a local martingale on a ﬁltered probability space

where the σ-ﬁeld rFs is generated by

If rY psq were Y psq, then by (4.130) r
Npsq would be N Y psq, given by the formula
in (4.132). Hence the process s ÞÑ N Y psq, s P r0, ts, is a stochastic integral
relative to Brownian motion on the space pΩ, Ft, Pq. We want to do same for
the process s ÞÑ r

PMptq be the probability measure on pΩ, Ftq deﬁned by PMptq rAs “ E rMptq, As,

The equalities in (4.145) and (4.146) complete the proof of Theorem 4.25.
□
3.1. Equations with unique strong solutions possess unique weak
solutions. The following theorem shows that stochastic diﬀerential equations
with unique pathwise solutions also have unique weak solutions. Its proofs puts
the L´evy’s characterization of Brownian motion at work: see Theorem 4.5.
4.31. Theorem. Let the vector and matrix functions bps, xq and σps, xq be as
in Theorem 4.25. Fix x P Rd. Suppose that the stochastic (integral) equation
Xptq “ x `

σ ps, Xpsqq dBpsq `
ż t

b ps, Xpsqq ds
(4.147)
possesses unique pathwise solutions. Then this equation has unique weak solu-
tions.
In the proof we employ a certain coupling argument. In fact weak solutions to
the equations in (4.3) and (4.4) are recast as two pathwise solutions of the same
form as (4.147) on the same probability space.
Proof. Let tpBptq : t ě 0q , pΩ, F, Pqu and tpB1ptq : t ě 0q , pΩ1, F1, P1qu be
two independent Brownian motions. Without loss of generality it is assumed
that, for 0 ď t ă 8,

be an adapted process which satisﬁes (4.4). Suppose 0 ď t1 ă t2 ă ¨ ¨ ¨ ă tn ă 8,
and let C1, . . . , Cn be Borel subsets of Rd. We have to prove the equality:
P1 rX1 pt1q P C1, . . . , X1 ptnq P Cns “ P rX pt1q P C1, . . . , X ptnq P Cns .
(4.148)
Let pΩ0, F0, P0q be a probability space with a Brownian motion tB0ptq : t ě 0u
such that F0 “ σ ptB0ptq : t ě 0u Ť tA0 P F0 : P0 rA0s “ 0uq. Deﬁne the Rd-
valued processes Y ptq, Y 1ptq, and rB0ptq on Ωˆ Ω1 ˆ Ω0 as follows:
$

rB0ptq pω, ω1, ω0q “ B0ptq pω0q ,
pω, ω1, ω0q P Ωˆ Ω1 ˆ Ω0.
(4.149)
In fact we use the notation Ω0 instead of Ωto distinguish the third component
of the space Ωˆ Ω1 ˆ Ω0 from the ﬁrst. The role of the ﬁrst two components
are very similar; the third component is related to the driving Brownian motion
tB0ptq : t ě 0u.
The processes Y ptq and Y 1ptq are going to be the pathwise
solutions on the same probability space

Ωˆ Ω1 ˆ Ω0, F b F1 b F0, rQx

: see
(4.159) and (4.160) below. On Ω0 the probability measure P0 is determined by
prescribing its ﬁnite-dimensional distributions via the equality:
P0 rpB0 pt1q , . . . , B0 ptnqq P Ds “ P rpB pt1q , . . . , B ptnqq P Ds
“ P1 rpB1 pt1q , . . . , B1 ptnqq P Ds .

In (4.150) we have 0 ď t1 ă ¨ ¨ ¨ ă tn ă 8, and D is a Borel subset of
`
Rd˘n.
Let C be another Borel subset of
`
Rd˘n. On ΩˆΩ0 and Ω1 ˆΩ0 the probability
measures Qx and Q1
x are determined by, respectively, the equalities:
Qx rpX pt1q , . . . , X ptnqq P C, pB0 pt1q , . . . , B0 ptnqq P Ds

(4.151)
Notice that P0 rA0s “ 0 implies Qx rΩˆ A0s “ Q1
x rΩ1 ˆ A0s “ 0. Consequently,
by the Radon-Nikodym’s theorem there are (measurable) functions
Qx : F ˆ Ω0 Ñ r0, 1s, and Q1
x : F1 ˆ Ω0 Ñ r0, 1s
such that, respectively,

(4.152)
Here Qx pΩ, ω0q “ Q1

functions
ω0 ÞÑ Qx pA, ω0q ,
and
ω0 ÞÑ Q1
x pA, ω0q
(4.153)
are measurable relative to the P0-completion of F0. In addition, the set functions
A ÞÑ Qx pA, ω0q, A P F, and A1 ÞÑ Q1
x pA1, ω0q, A1 P F1 are P0-almost surely
probability measures. Here we use the fact that, except for negligible sets, the
σ-ﬁelds F and F1 are countably determined. Finally, we deﬁne the measure
rQx : F b F1 b F0 Ñ r0, 1s
via the equality
rQx rA ˆ A1 ˆ A0s “

Qx pA, ω0q Q1

(4.154)
Here A, A1, and A0 belong to F, F1, and F0 respectively. First we prove that
the process

)
is Brownian motion with respect to the measure rQx.
The corresponding expectation is written as rEx. From the proof of Theorem
4.5 (i.e., L´evy’s characterization of Brownian motion) it follows that it suﬃces
to show that the following equality holds:

The process pω0, tq ÞÑ B0ptq pω0q is a Brownian motion relative to P0, and the

(4.157)
The equality in (4.155) is a consequence of (4.157). Since, by deﬁnition (see
(4.150))
P0 rpB0 pt1q , . . . , B0 ptnqq P Cs “ P rpB pt1q , . . . , B ptnqq P Cs
(4.158)
for 0 ď t1 ă ¨ ¨ ¨ ă tn ă 8, C Borel subset of
`
Rd˘n, and since the process
tBptq : t ě 0u is a Brownian motion relative to P, the same is true for the
process tB0ptq : t ě 0u relative to P0. Next we compute the quantity:

Y ptq “ x `

(4.162)

is a Brownian motion relative to rQx.
From the pathwise uniqueness and the equalities (4.161) and (4.162) we see

that, rQx-almost surely,
Y ptq “ Y 1ptq,
t ě 0.
(4.163)
Let 0 ď 0 ă t1 ă ¨ ¨ ¨ ă tn ă 8, and let C be a Borel subset of
`
Rd˘n. From
(4.163) it follows that
rQx rpY pt1q , . . . , Y ptnqq P Cs “ rQx rpY 1 pt1q , . . . , Y 1 ptnqq P Cs .
(4.164)
Using (4.164) and the deﬁnition of the measure rQx shows that the following
identities are self-explanatory:
rQx rpY pt1q , . . . , Y ptnqq P Cs “ Qx rpX pt1q , . . . , X ptnqq P C, Ω0s
“ P rpX pt1q , . . . , X ptnqq P C, Ωs “ P rpX pt1q , . . . , X ptnqq P Cs .
(4.165)
The deﬁnition of the measure rQx is given in (4.154). Similarly we conclude
rQx rpY 1 pt1q , . . . , Y 1 ptnqq P Cs “ P1 rpX1 pt1q , . . . , X1 ptnqq P Cs .
(4.166)
From (4.165), (4.166), and (4.164) we obtain
P rpX pt1q , . . . , X ptnqq P Cs “ P rpX1 pt1q , . . . , X1 ptnqq P Cs .
(4.167)
The equality in (4.167) implies that the ﬁnite-dimensional distributions of the
solution in equation in (4.3) are the same as those of the solution of equation
(4.4). So that stochastic diﬀerential equations with unique pathwise solutions
also possess unique weak (or distributional) solutions.
This concludes the proof of Theorem 4.31.
□
4.32. Example (Tanaka’s example). Let the process t ÞÑ Bptq, t ě 0, be one-
dimensional Browmian motion on the probability space pΩ, F, Pq, and let the
continuous process t ÞÑ Xptq be such that Xptq “
şt
0 sgn pXpsqq dBpsq. Here
sgnpyq “ y
|y| for y ‰ 0, and sgnpyq “ 0, when y “ 0. It can be proved that such
a process exists. If t ÞÑ Xptq solves this equation, then the process t ÞÑ ´Xptq
is a solution as well. So we see that the equation dXptq “ sgn pXptqq dBptq,
Xp0q “ 0, does not have pathwise unique solutions. On the other hand the
process t ÞÑ Xptq is (local) martingale, and, since Bptq “
şt
0 sgn pXpsqq dXpsq,
we get
t “ ⟨B, B⟩ptq “
ż t
0
|sgn pXpsqq|2 d ⟨X, X⟩psq “ ⟨X, X⟩ptq.
Hence, ⟨X, X⟩ptq “ t. L´evy’s martingale characterization of Brownian motion
(see Corollary 4.7 and Theorem 4.5) then implies that the process t ÞÑ Xptq
is a Brownian motion on pΩ, F, Pq. So that the distribution of Xptq is that
of Brownian motion. Consequently, the equation dXptq “ sgn pXptqq dBptq has
unique weak solutions. For more details on Tanaka’s example and its connection
with local time see, e.g., Øksendal [106].
Conclusion. In this chapter we treated several aspects of the theory of stochas-
tic diﬀerential equations: strong and weak solutions, L´evy’s characterization

In this section we will discuss, among other things, Fourier transforms of dis-
tributions of random variables, positive-deﬁnite functions, Bochner’s theorem,
L´evy’s continuity theorem, weak convergence of measures, ergodic theorems,
projective limits of distributions, Markov processes with one initial probability
measure, Doob-Meyer decomposition theorem based on Komlos’ theorem.
1. Fourier transforms
Since we will also need signed measures, we will discuss them ﬁrst.
1.1. Signed measures. Let M “ M pRν, Cq be the vector space of all
complex Borel measures on Rν, and let M` be the convex cone of all positive
ﬁnite Borel measures op Rν. Then we have M “ M`´M``i pM` ´ M`q. Thus,
every complex Borel measure µ on Rν can be written as µ “ µ1´µ2`i pµ3 ´ µ4q,
where µ1, µ2, µ3 and µ4 are ﬁnite positive Borel measures. In fact the measures
µj, 1 ď j ď 4, can be chosen in the following manner:
µ1pBq “ sup tRe µpCq : C Ď B, C Borel u ;
µ2pBq “ sup t´Re µpCq : C Ď B, C Borel u ;
µ3pBq “ sup tIm µpCq : C Ď B, C Borel u ;
µ4pBq “ sup t´Im µpCq : C Ď B, C Borel u .
For this choice of the measures µ1, µ2, µ3 and µ4, the measures µ1 and µ2 and
also the measures µ3 and µ4 are mutually singular in the sense that for certain
Borel subsets B1 and B3 the following equalities hold:
µ1pBq “ Re µ pB X B1q ,
µ2pBq “ Re µ pB X Bc
1q ;
µ3pBq “ Re µ pB X B3q ,
µ4pBq “ Re µ pB X Bc
3q .
This decomposition is known under the name Hahn decomposition. In addition,
we introduce the variation of a complex measure µ. This measure is denoted as
|µ|. It is the bounded positive measure deﬁned by
|µ| pAq “ sup

|µpAjq| : A Ě Aj and Aj X Ak “ H for k ­“ j

.
(5.1)
Here A is a Borel subset of Rν and the same is true for the elements of the
partition Aj, j P N. The norm }µ} of the complex Borel measure µ is then
deﬁned by the equality: }µ} “ |µ| pRνq. Supplied with this norm M is turned
into a Banach space. By the Riesz representation theorem the space M can

be taken as the topological dual of the space C0pRνq, being the Banach space
consisting of those complex continuous functions f : Rν Ñ C with the prop-
erty that limxÑ8 fpxq “ 0.
Then C0pRνq is a closed subspace of the space
CbpRνq, the space of all bounded continuous functions on Rν, which is a Ba-
nach space relative to the supremum-norm }¨}8, given by }f}8 “ supxPRν |fpxq|,
f P CbpRνq.
5.1. Definition. A complex Radon measure on a locally compact space E is
a complex Borel measure with the property that for every ϵ ą 0 and every
Borel subset B there exists a compact subset K Ă B with the property that
|µ pBzKq| ă ϵ.
5.2. Theorem (Riesz). Let E be a locally compact Hausdorﬀspace, which is σ-
compact, and let Λ : C0pEq Ñ C be a continuous linear functional. Then there
exists a unique complex Radon measure µ on the Borel ﬁeld of E such that
Λpfq “
ş
fdµ, f P C0pEq. In addition, }Λ} “ }µ} “ |µ| pEq. If Λ is positive
in the sense that f ě 0 implies Λpfq ě 0, then the corresponding measure µ is
positive as well and }Λ} “ µpEq.
Proof. For a proof the reader is referred to the literature. In fact the fol-
lowing construction can be used. Let the measures µj, 1 ď j ď 4 be determined
by
µ1pOq “ sup tRe Λpfq : 0 ď f ď 1O, f P C0pEqu ;
µ2pOq “ sup t´Re Λpfq : 0 ď f ď 1O, f P C0pBqu ;
µ3pOq “ sup tIm Λpfq : 0 ď f ď 1O, f P C0pEqu ;
µ4pOq “ sup t´Im Λpfq : 0 ď f ď 1O, f P C0pEqu ,
where O is any open subset of E. Then it can be shown that, for each 1 ď j ď 4,
the set function µj extends to a genuine positive Borel measure on E. This
extension is again called µj. Moreover,

5.4. Proposition. Let µ be a complex measure on Rν with the property that its
Fourier transform is identically zero. Then the measure µ “ 0.
Proof. Let ν be an arbitrary other complex Borel measure on Rν with the
property that |pνpxq| ď 1, x P Rν. Then the following equality holds:

5.6. Proposition. Let µ be a complex Borel measure on Rν with Fourier trans-
form pµ. Then the following assertions are true:
(a) the following inequality holds: |pµpxq| ď }µ}.
(b) If µ is positive, then the equalities µpRνq “ pµp0q “ }µ} are valid.
(c) If µ is positive, then the function pµ is positive-deﬁnite.
(d) The function pµ is uniformly continuous.
Proof. The proof is left as an exercise to the reader.

5.7. Definition. Deﬁne for µ and ν measures in M, the convolution-product
µ ˚ ν via the equalities:

Here B is a Borel subset of Rν and S is the (sum) mapping S : px, yq ÞÑ x ` y.
Let x P Rν. Deﬁne thee Dirac-measure δx by δxpBq “ 1Bpxq, B Borel subset
of Rν. Instead of δ0 it is more customarily to write δ. Let µ P M. Then ˇµ is
deﬁned by ˇµpBq “ µp´Bq, where B is a Borel subset of Rν. Let f : Rν Ñ C be
a complex function, which is deﬁned on all of Rν. The function ˇf is given by
ˇfpxq “ fp´xq, x P Rν.
5.8. Definition. A complex Banach algebra pA, }¨}q is a complex Banach space,
endowed with a product which is compatible with the norm. The latter means
that the product pa, bq ÞÑ ab, a, b in A, which is a bilinear operation, is contin-
uous in both variables simultaneously. In fact it is assumed that }ab} ď }a} }b}
for all a and b in A.
Examples of Banach algebras are the vector spaces C0pRνq and CbpRνq, equipped
with the supremum-norm and the pointwise multiplication. Let LpXq be the
vector space of all continuous linear operators on the Banach space X, supplied
with the operator norm and the composition as product. Then LpXq is a non-
commutative Banach algebra. The following theorem says that M, supplied
with the convolution product, constitutes a (complex) commutative Banach
algebra with identity δ. Recall that M stands for the space of all complex Borel
measures on Rν.
5.9. Theorem. The normed vector space pM, }¨}q supplied with the convolution
product ˚ is a commutative complex Banach algebra with identity δ. If µ and ν
belong to M, then the following equalities hold:
{
µ ` ν “ pµ ` pν,
x
aµ “ apµ,
z
µ ˚ ν “ pµpν,
pqµ “ qpµ.
Here a is a complex number.
Proof. The proof is left as an exercise for the reader.

The Banach space L1pRνq can be considered as a closed subspace of MpRνq.

5.10. Theorem. Let C00pRνq be the space of all complex continuous functions
with compact support. Then C00pRνq is a dense subspace of L1pRνq for the topol-
ogy of convergence in mean.This means that C00pRνq is dense in L1pRνq relative
to the topology generated by the L1-norm: }f}1 “

|fpxq| dx, f P L1pRνq.
Proof. Let ϵ ą 0 and let f ě 0 belong to L1pRνq. It suﬃces that there
exists a function g P C00pRνq such that

(5.4) follow via an argument about Dynkin systems.

Proof. By theorem 5.10 it suﬃces to prove (5.5) for f P C00pRνq. Such
a function f is uniformly continuous. Let K be the support of the function
f P C00pRνq. Fix ϵ ą 0 and choose δ ą 0 in such a way that

5.13. Theorem (Stone-Weierstrass). Let E be a locally compact Hausdorﬀspace
and let A be a subalgebra of C0pEq, which separates points of E and which is
closed under complex conjugation. That is, if f belongs to A, then f also belongs
to A. Then A is dense in C0pEq.
Proof. Let E△be the one-point compactiﬁcation (Alexandroﬀcompacti-
ﬁcation) and A1 “ A ‘ C1 “ tf ` λ1 : f P A, λ P Cu. Here 1 is the constant
function with value 1 and functions f P A vanish in △. The theorem of Stone-
Weierstrass, applied to the compact Hausdorﬀspace E△results in the desired
result, and completes the proof of Theorem 5.13.
□
5.14. Theorem. The set
!
pf : f P C00 pRνq
)
is a subalgebra of C0pRνq that is
closed under taking complex conjugates. This algebra is dense in C0pRνq with
the supremum-norm.
Proof. The fact that the set A :“
!
pf : f P L1pRνq
)
is a subalgebra of
C0pRνq follows from the standard properties of the Fourier transform in combi-
nation with Theorem 5.12. Since pf “ pˇf it also follows that this algebra is closed
under complex conjugation. In order to apply the Theorem of Stone-Weierstrass
we still have to show that A separates the points of Rν. To this end take x0 and
y0 ‰ x0 P Rν. Then there exists a bounded open neighborhood V in Rν such
that exp p´i ⟨x0, y⟩q´ exp p´i ⟨y0, y⟩q ­“ 0 for y P V . Next consider the function
f : y ÞÑ pexp pi ⟨x0, y⟩q ´ exp pi ⟨y0, y⟩qq vpyq, where v is a function in C00 pRνq
with v ě 1V . Then we see
pfpx0q ´ pfpy0q “
ż
|exp p´i ⟨x0, y⟩q ´ exp p´i ⟨y0, y⟩q|2 vpyqdy ą 0.
(5.8)
From (5.8) it immediately follows that A separates the points of Rν. The asser-
tion in Theorem 5.14 now follows from Theorem 5.13.

follows that:

The inequality in (c) is a consequence of (5.9).
(d) The determinant of a positive hermitian matrix is non-negative. So that, if

The inequality in (d) then follows from (5.11) by associating the second matrix

The proof of Theorem 5.15 is complete now.

In the theory of Banach algebras the Beurling-Gelfand formula gives a relation-

The following theorem is a very important representation theorem. It will be
used in Theorem 5.25 and in the continuity theorem of L´evy: Theorem 5.42.
5.17. Theorem (Bochner). Let φ : Rν Ñ C be a function.
The following
assertions are equivalent:
(i) The function φ is continuous and positive-deﬁnite;
(ii) There exists a positive Borel measure µ op Rν such that φ “ pµ.
The Borel measure µ in piiq is unique.

the equality: Λpνq “

equality: rνpAq “ νp´Aq. Because, by hypothesis, the function φ is positive-
deﬁnite we see that the functional Λ is positive in the sense that Λpν ˚ rνq ě 0
for all ν P M: see inequality (5.26) in Proposition 5.23 further on. By Cauchy-

(Theorem 5.14) this closure coincides with C0pRνq. The Riesz representation
theorem applies to the eﬀect that there exists a bounded Borel measure µ such
that Λ0p pfq “

Consequently, φ “ pµ. The function φ being positive-deﬁnite it follows that the
measure µ is positive. This proves the implication (i) ùñ (ii).
(ii) ñ (i). Let µ be a ﬁnite positive Borel measure. Then its Fourier trans-
form pµ is a uniformly continuous positive-deﬁnite function. The proof of these
assertions is left to the reader.
The proof of Theorem 5.17 is complete now.
□
An alternative proof runs as follows: the idea is taken from Theorem 5.10 in
L˝orinczi et al [88]. We need the following lemmas.
5.18. Lemma. Let φ : Rν Ñ C be a (uniformly) continuous positive-deﬁnite
function, and ﬁx t ą 0. Then the function ξ ÞÑ e´ 1
2 t|ξ|2φpξq is also (uniformly)
continuous and positive-deﬁnite.
Proof. Let ξj, 1 ď j ď n, belong to Rν, and let λj, 1 ď j ď n, be complex
numbers. Then

5.19. Lemma. Let ψ : Rν Ñ C be a function which belongs to L1 pRνq, and let
V1 be a bounded open neighborhood of the origin in Rν. Put Vn “ nV1, n P N.

Hence, by using the Lebesgue’s dominated convergence theorem the equality in
(5.18) is readily established. Moreover, this limit is uniform in x P Rν. This
completes the proof of Lemma 5.19.

observe that by Lemma 5.18 the functions of the form ξ ÞÑ φtpξq :“ e´ 1

now.

Then Λφ can be extended to the uniform closure of the collection tpµ : µ P Mu
such that |Λφpfq| ď φp0q }f}8 for all f in this closure. This closure contains
all constant functions and all continuous functions on Rν which tend to 0 at 8.

We write µ “ weak- limα µα. The space M can also be supplied with the vague
topology. This is the locally convex topology σ pM, C00pRνqq. For the vague
topology the functions f1, . . . , fn in (5.27) are required to belong to C00pRνq

The following theorem expresses the fact that the set M`, endowed with the
weak topology and CP, endowed with the compact-open topology T, are home-
omorphic. The compact-open topology is also called the topology of uniform
convergence on compact subsets of Rν. So that a net pφα : α P Aq converges to

Then for those α P A and those x1 and x2 P Rν which satisfy α ě α0 and

By (5.28) it follows that |pµpx1q ´ pµpx2q| ď ϵ for x1 and x2 P Rν for which

Then choose α1 P A in such a way that α1 ě αj for j “ 1, . . . , n. For x P yj ` V

This proves that the Fourier transform is continuous for the indicated topologies.

5.26. Theorem. A net pµα : α P Aq in M` converges weakly to µ P M` if and
only if the net pµα : α P Aq converges vaguely to µ and if
lim
α µα pRνq “ µ pRνq .
(5.30)
Proof. The weak topology is stronger than the vague topology and from
weak convergence the equality in (5.30) also follows. Hence, the indicated con-
ditions are necessary. Conversely, let a net pµα : α P Aq converge vaguely M`
to µ and assume that (5.30) is satisﬁed. We will prove that µ is the weak limit
of the net pµα : α P Aq. Therefore pick f P CbpRνq and ϵ ą 0 arbitrary but
ﬁxed. Choose a compact subset K such that µ pRνzKq ă ϵ. In addition, choose
a function h P C00pRνq in such a way that 1K ď h ď 1. By these hypotheses
the following (in-)equalities hold:

(a) The set CP is a convex cone, which is closed for the topology of uniform
convergence on compact subsets.
(b) With φ the functions φ and Re φ also belong to CP.
(c) If φ1 and φ2 belong to CP, then the same is true for the product φ1φ2.
(d) For every y P Rν the function x ÞÑ exp p´i ⟨x, y⟩q belongs to CP.
Convex combinations of such functions belong to CP.
Proof. The proof is left as an exercise for the reader.

holds. The symbol CN denotes the collection of all continuous negative-deﬁnite
functions on Rν. If ψ belongs to CN, then the same is true for ψ andRe ψ. The
collection CN is a convex cone.
If ψ belongs to CN, then ψp0q ě 0 and
ψpxq “ ψp´xq for all x P Rν. A function ψ is negative-deﬁnite if and only if ψ
has the following properties:
(1) ψp0q ě 0;
(2) For every x P Rν the equality ψpxq “ ψp´xq holds;
(3) For every n P N and for every n-tuple of complex numbers a1, . . . , an, for
which řn

inequality holds:

If the function ψ is negative-deﬁnite, then so is the function ψ ´ ψp0q. If φ is
positive-deﬁnite, then the function φp0q ´ φ is negative-deﬁnite.
The following theorem establishes an important connection between negative-
and positive-deﬁnite functions.
5.29. Theorem (Schoenberg). A function ψ belongs to CN if and only the
following two conditions are satisﬁed:
(i) ψp0q ě 0;
(ii) For every t ą 0 the function exp p´tψq is continuous and positive-
deﬁnite.
Let ψ be a negative-deﬁnite function. Then, by Bochner’s theorem together
with the theorem of Schoenberg, there exists for every t ą 0 a sub-probability
measure µt on the Borel ﬁeld of Rν such that pµt “ exp p´tψq. We return to this
aspect when we discuss the notion convolution semigroup of measures.
Proof. First suppose that ψ belongs to CN. Let xp1q, . . . , xpnq belong to Rν.

From (5.32) it follows that the function exp p´ψq is then positive-deﬁnite. The
same procedure can be repeated for the function tψ.
Conversely, if (i) and
(ii) are satisﬁed, then, for every t ą 0, the function ψt :“ 1 ´ exp p´tψq “
1 ´ exp p´tψp0qq ` exp p´tψp0qq ´ exp p´tψq is negative-deﬁnite. But then the

The following theorem says that a vaguely continuous convolution semigroups
is in fact everywhere weakly continuous.
5.31. Theorem. There exists a one-to-one correspondence between vaguely con-
tinuous semigroups of measures and negative-deﬁnite functions.
(a) If pµt : t ě 0q is a vaguely continuous convolution semigroup of mea-
sures, then there exists a unique continuous negative-deﬁnite function
ψ such that pµt “ exp p´tψq, for all t ě 0.
(b) Conversely, if ψ is a negative-deﬁnite function, then there exists a
vaguely continuous convolution semigroup of measures pµt : t ě 0q such
that pµt “ exp p´tψq for all t ě 0. Of course, this semigroup is unique.
Proof. (a) Deﬁne, for t ą 0, the function ψ via the equality
ψ “ 1 ´ pµt
ż t
0
pµsds
.
(5.33)
Since pµspµt “ pµs`t we see that ψ does not depend on the choice of t.
Put
gptq “
şt
0 pµsds. Then we see that gp0q “ 0 and gptqψ ` g1ptq “ 1, and hence
gptq “ 1 ´ exp p´tψq
ψ
. From the latter it follows that pµt “ exp p´tψq. The
Theorem of Schoenberg (Theorem 5.29) implies then that the function ψ is
negative-deﬁnite. The functions pµs, s ě 0, are continuous. So the same is true
for ψ.
(b) Since ψ is a negative-deﬁnite function, the functions exp p´tψq are positive-
deﬁnite by the theorem of Schoenberg.
The theorem of Bochner (Theorem
5.17) yields the existence of sub-probability measures pµt : t ě 0q such that pµt “
exp p´tψq. Since
lim
tÓ0 pµtpξq “ lim
tÓ0 exp p´tψpξqq “ 1 “ pµ0pξq
Theorem 5.43 in the next section implies that limtÓ0
ş
fdµt “ fp0q for functions
f P C00 pRνq.
The proof of Theorem 5.31 is now complete.
□
5.32. Remark. In the proof of Theorem 5.31 part (a) there is a problem if
the integral
şt
0 pµsds vanishes somewhere. However, notice that lim
tÓ0

pµ0 pointwise. It follows that, certainly, for t “ tpξq ą 0 small enough, the
expression
şt
0 pµspξqds ­“ 0. This fact can be used to circumvent this problem.
5.33. Remark. In the proof of Theorem 5.31 part (b) Theorem 5.43 of the
next section was employed.
This can be averted as well.

5.34. Proposition. Let pµt : t ě 0q be a vaguely continuous semigroup of Borel
measures on Rν. Suppose that all these measures are probability measures. Then
the following assertions hold:

Proof. (a) First we look at
µt pRνq ´ µt0 pRνq “ exp p´tψp0qq ´ exp p´t0ψp0qq .
It follows that
lim
tÑt0 µt pRνq ´ µt0 pRνq “ 0.
For the same reason we see that
lim
tÑt0 pµtpξq “ lim
tÑt0 exp p´tψpξqq “ exp p´t0ψpξqq “ pµt0pξq.
By using theorem 5.43 in the next section we see that
weak-
lim

Of course, in this proof the function ψ denotes the negative-deﬁnite function
from Theorem 5.31.

Let Fs be the σ-ﬁeld on Ωgenerated by Xpuq, 0 ď u ď s.
For t ą s the
variable Xptq ´ Xpsq is independent of Fs and Xptq ´ Xpsq possesses the same
Px-distribution as Xpt ´ sq ´ x, which is µt´s.
Proof. Fix t ą s, let f : pRνqn Ñ R be a Borel measurable function, and
suppose that 0 ď s1 ă ¨ ¨ ¨ ă sn “ s. Let g : Rν Ñ R be another bounded Borel
measurable function. Then the following equalities hold true:

Now let H be the vector space of Fs-measurable bounded random variables Y
with the property that E pY gpXptq ´ Xpsqqq “ E pY q E pgpXptq ´ Xpsqqq. Then
H satisﬁes the hypotheses of Lemma 5.100. Whence, H contains all bounded Fs-
measurable random variables. Since, in addition, the function g is an arbitrary
bounded continuous function, it follows that the state variable Xptq ´ Xpsq is
independent of Fs. This completes the proof of Theorem 5.37.

5.38. Theorem. Let pΩ, F, Pq be a probability space and let pXptq : t ě 0q be a

and also that for every t ą s the variable Xptq ´ Xpsq is independent of the σ-
ﬁeld σ pXpuq : 0 ď u ď sq and that Xptq ´ Xpsq possesses the same distribution
as Xpt ´ sq. Then the mapping B ÞÑ µtpBq :“ P pXptq P Bq deﬁnes a vaguely

Theorem 5.38.
□
5.39. Definition. Let pΩ, F, Pq be a probability space and let the mapping
X : pt, ωq ÞÑ Xpt, ωq “ Xptqpωq satisfy the hypotheses mentioned in Theorem
5.38. (So that for t ą s the state variable Xptq ´ Xpsq does not depend on the
σ-ﬁeld σ pXpuq : 0 ď u ď sq and Xptq ´ Xpsq possesses the same distribution
as Xpt ´ sq; moreover, the equality limsÓ0 E pfpXpsqqq “ fp0q holds for all
f P C0 pRνq).
Then the process X is called a L´evy-process, that begins at
Xp0q “ 0.
Important L´evy-processes are the Poisson process with jumps 1 and the Brow-
nian motion. The one-dimensional distributions of a Poisson process X (with
jumps 1 and of intensity λ) are given by

For more details on Brownian motion see the Section 4 in Chapter 1 and Sec-
tion 3 in Chapter 2. In addition, see Chapter 3. A L´evy-process with initial
distribution µ is a family of F-B-measurable mappings Xptq : ΩÑ Rν such that
Xp0q has the distribution µ, and such that the process t ÞÑ Xptq ´ Xp0q is a
L´evy-process that starts at 0. If the initial distribution µ “ δx, then it said that
the process X starts at x. If X “ pXptq : t ě 0q is a L´evy-process that starts
at 0, then px ` Xptq : t ě 0q is a L´evy-process, which starts at x. The Poisson

itself by rPptqfs pxq “ E pf px ` Xptqqq, f P L8 pRνq. The restriction of Pptq to
C0 pRνq leaves the space C0 pRνq invariant, and the family
!
Pptq

)
is a Feller semigroup (also called a Feller-Dynkin semigroup).
Proof. It is clear that every operator Pptq is contractive and positivity
preserving. It is also clear that limtÓ0 rPptqfs pxq “ fpxq for all x P Rν and for
all f P C0 pRνq. We still have to prove the invariance property. Let f “ pg,
where g belongs to L1 pRνq. Then we obtain
rPptqfs pxq “ E pf px ` Xptqqq “ E ppg px ` Xptqqq
“
ż
exp p´i ⟨ξ, x⟩q E pexp p´i ⟨ξ, Xptq⟩qq gpξqdξ.
(5.37)
By the lemma of Riemann-Lebesgue (Theorem 5.12), the equalities in (5.37)
imply the equality
lim
xÑ8 rPptqfs pxq “ 0.
The continuity of the function Pptqf is clear as well. As a consequence, Pptq
maps the space tpg : g P L1 pRνqu to C0 pRνq. The theorem of Stone-Weierstrass
implies that the space tpg : g P L1 pRνqu is dense in C0 pRνq for the uniform
topology.
Because of the contractive character of the operator Pptq it then
follows that Pptq leaves the space C0 pRνq invariant. In order to ﬁnish we prove
the semigroup-property. Again we take the Fourier transform pg of a function
g P L1 pRνq and we consider

The semigroup-property then follows from (5.38) together with the Theorem of
Stone-Weierstrass which, among other things, implies that the space

This completes the proof of Theorem 5.41.

2. Convergence of positive measures
We begin with the continuity theorem of L´evy.
5.42. Theorem (L´evy). Let pµn : n P Nq be a sequence of bounded positive Borel
measures on Rν. Assume that there exists a function φ : Rν Ñ C, which is
continuous at 0, such that
lim
nÑ8 pµnpxq “ φpxq
for all x P Rν. Then there exists a bounded positive Borel measure such that
weak- lim
nÑ8 µn “ µ.
Proof. The function φ is a point-wise limit of positive-deﬁnite functions
and so it is itself positive-deﬁnite as well. Since the function φ is continuous
at 0, inequality (c) in Theorem 5.15 implies the continuity of φ. By Bochner’s
theorem (Theorem 5.17) there exists a positive bounded Borel measure µ such
that
lim
nÑ8 pµnpxq “ φpxq “ pµpxq
(5.39)
for all x P Rν. Next, let f be an arbitrary function in C00 pRνq. Then we see

|fpxq| |pµnpxq ´ pµpxq| dx.
(5.40)
In view of (5.39) we see that the integrand in (5.40) converges pointwise to 0.
Write c “ supnPN ppµnp0q ` pµp0qq. Then c is ﬁnite and |fpxq| |pµnpxq ´ pµpxq| is
dominated by the L1-function c |fpxq|. By the dominated convergence theorem
(Lebesgue) it follows from (5.40) that

Since the subspace

orem 5.14), from (5.41) it follows that limnÑ8

Let pfk : k P Nq be a sequence in C0 pRνq
with a linear span which is dense in C0 pRνq. The following assertions are then

holds and limα µα pRνq “ µ pRνq.
Proof. The equivalence of the assertions (1) and (9) is a consequence of
Theorem 5.25. The equivalence of (1) and (3) is a consequence of Theorem 5.26.
The implication (1) ñ (8) is trivial. The implication (8) ñ (3) can be proved

(1), (3), (8) and (9) are equivalent.

where the function f is ν times continuously diﬀerentiable, and where Dj de-
notes diﬀerentiation with respect to the j-th coordinate, 1 ď j ď ν.
The
equality in (5.50) can be proved by successive integration. The second equality
is a consequence of Fubini’s theorem.
5.45. Definition. A topological space E is called a Polish space if E possesses
the following properties:
(i) E is separable;
(ii) E is metrizable;
(iii) There exists a metric d on E that determines the topology and relative
to which E is complete.
Since E is metrizable property (i) is equivalent with the existence of a countable
basis for the topology.
5.46. Lemma. Let E be a Polish space.
(a) A closed subset F of E is, with the induced metric, again Polish.
(b) An open subset G of E is again Polish.
Proof. (a) The proof of assertion (a) is not diﬃcult. If pUj : j P Nq is a
countable basis for the topology of E, then pUj X F : j P Nq is a countable basis
for the topology on F. Moreover, F is closed and hence it is complete with
respect to the induced metric.
(b). Let d be a metric on E, which turns E into a complete metric topological
space. Then the open subset G is Polish for the metric dG deﬁned by

only if A is the countable intersection of open subsets of E.
Proof. Let A “ Ş

a metric on E, which makes E into a Polish space. Deﬁne then the metrics dj

Then, endowed with the relative topology, A is a Polish space with respect to
the dA. Conversely, let d ď 1 be a metric on A which is compatible with the
topology that A inherits from E, and which turns A into a complete metric
space. Let A be the closure of A. Then there exists a decreasing sequence
of open subsets pGnqnPN such that A “ Ş
n Gn; i.e. closed subsets of E are
Gδ-subsets. For n P N, n ‰ 0, we deﬁne the open subset An of A as follows:
An “
␣
x P A : there exists an open neighborhood Upxq in E of x
for which dpy, zq ă 1

*

(5.52)
Then the following assertions about the sets An will be proved:
(1) For all n P N we have A Ă An.
(2) The sets An, n P N, are open in A.
(3) The inclusion Ş
n An Ă A holds, and so by (1) A “ Ş
n An.
Since, by (2), the subsets An, n P N, are open in A there exist open subsets On,
n P N, of E such that An “ On X A, n P N. It follows that

and hence, A is a countable intersection of open subsets of E. Next we prove
the assertions (1), (2) and (3).
(1) Pick x P A, and consider the ball

There exists an open neighborhood Upxq of x in E such that B1{p2nqpxq “
A X Upxq. If y, z belong to A X Upxq we have dpz, yq ď dpz, xq ` dpx, yq ă 1{n.
It follows that x P An. This is true for all n P N.
(2) That the subset An is open in A can be seen as follows. Pick x P A. There
exists an open neighborhood Upxq in E of x such that dpz, yq ă 1{n for all
z, y P A X Upxq. The set Upxq X A is an open neighborhood of x in A. It
suﬃces to show that Upxq X A Ă An. To this end choose x1 P Upxq X A. Then
Upxq is an open neighborhood in E of x1 as well, and since x1 belongs to A it
follows from the deﬁnition of An that x1 is a member of An.
(3) Let x belong to An for all n P N. Then x belongs to A. We will prove that
x P A. Let D ď 1 be a metric on E which is compatible with its topology, and
which turns E into complete metric space. For the moment ﬁx n P N. Since

(5.53)
Since x P A there exists xn P A X Bn. In this way we obtain a sequence of balls
tBn : n P Nu relative to the metric D centered at x, which we take decreasing,
and which are such that the D-radius of Bn is strictly less than 1{n. In addition,
we obtain a sequence of points txn : n P Nu in A such that xn P Bn for all n P N.
Since the balls Bn are decreasing we have xm P Bn for m ě n. From this fact and
(5.53) it follows that d pxm, xnq ă 1{n for m ě n. Consequently, it follows that
the sequence txn : n P Nu is a d-Cauchy sequence in A. Since A is d-complete
there exists a point x1 P A such d pxn, x1q ď 1{n, n P N. Since D and d are
topologically compatible on A it also follows that limnÑ8 D pxn, x1q “ 0. We
also have limnÑ8 D pxn, xq “ 0, and consequently x “ x1 P A.
This completes the proof of Theorem 5.47.

intersection of open subsets.

Proof of Theorem 5.48. Let d : E ˆ E Ñ r0, 1s be a metric op E
which is compatible with its topology, and which turns E into a Polish space,
and let pxℓ: ℓP Nq be a countable dense subset of E.
Deﬁne the mapping
Ψ : E Ñ r0, 1sN by Ψpxq “ pd px, xℓqℓPNq. Then, as can be checked, the mapping
Ψ is a homeomorphism from E onto a subset of r0, 1sN. So far we have not
yet used the fact that E, equipped with the metric d is complete; we did use
the fact that E is a metrizable separable space.
Since E is complete with
respect to d and Ψ is a homeomorphism, it follows that the image of E under
Ψ, that is A “ Ψ pEq, is complete subspace of the Hilbert cube r0, 1sN. Let
D : r0, 1sN ˆ r0, 1sN Ñ r0, 1s be the metric deﬁned by
D ppξℓqℓPN , pηℓqℓPNq “
8
ÿ
ℓ“1
2´ℓ|ξℓ´ ηℓ| ,
pξℓqℓPN , pηℓqℓPN P r0, 1sN.
Then D is a metric on r0, 1sN which turns this space into a Polish space. It
follows that A is a subset of r0, 1sN which is homeomorphic to a Polish space,
and so it itself is Polish. Since it is a Polish subspace of the Polish space r0, 1sN,
A is a countable intersection of open subsets of r0, 1sN: see Theorem 5.47. This
completes the proof of Theorem 5.48.

The space N of positive integers with the usual metric inherited from the real
numbers R is Polish. Then the countable product NN with metric

is Polish. The proofs of Propositions 5.49 and 5.50 are taken from Garrett [57].
5.49. Proposition. Totally order NN lexicographically. Then every closed sub-
set C of NN has a least element.
The lexicographic ordering of NN can be recursively deﬁned. An element a “
pa1, a2, . . .q precedes an element b “ pb1, b2, . . .q if a1 ď b1; however, if a1 “ b1,
then a2 ď b2; however, if a1 “ b1 and a2 “ b2, then a3 ď b3, and so on.
Proof. Let n1 be the least element in N such that there is x “ pn1, . . .q
belonging to C.
Let n2 be the least element in N such that there is x “
pn1, n2, . . .q belonging to C, and so on. Choosing the ni inductively, let x0 “
pn1, n2, n ` 3, . . .q. This x0 satisﬁes x0 ď x in the lexicographic ordering for
every x P C, and x0 belongs to the closure of C in the metric topology introduced
in (5.54). This completes the proof of Proposition 5.49.
□
5.50. Proposition. Let E be a Polish space. Then there exists a continuous
surjective mapping F0 : NN Ñ E. Moreover, there exists a measurable function
G0 : E Ñ NN such that F0 ˝ G0pyq “ y for all y P E.
Proof. The mapping F0 can be constructed as follows. For a given ε ą 0
there is a countable covering of E by closed sets of diameter less than ε. From
this one may contrive a map F from ﬁnite sequences tn1, . . . , nku in N to closed
sets F pn1, . . . , nkq in E such that

(3) The diameter of F pn1, . . . , nkq is less than 2´k.
Then for x “ tniu P NN the sequence Ek “ F pn1, . . . , nkq is a nested sequence
of closed subsets of E with diameters less than 2´k, respectively. Thus, the
subset Ş
k Ek consists of a single point F0pyq of E. On the other hand, every
x P E lies inside some Ş
k Ek. Continuity is easy to verify. The mapping G0
can be constructed as follows. The space NN, endowed with the lexicographical
ordering is totally ordered, and by Proposition 5.49 every closed subset contains
a least element for this order. For y P E the subset F ´1
0 pyq is closed in NN, and
therefore it contains a least element G0pyq. This assignment is a measurable
choice (because it can be performed in countably many steps). Then F0˝G0pyq “
y for y P E. The proof of Proposition 5.50 is complete now.
□
The proof of the following theorem is based on the fact that a Polish space is
homeomorphic with a Gδ-subset of the Hilbert cube, which, being a countable
product of closed intervals, is a compact metrizable space.
5.51. Theorem. Let µ be a ﬁnite positive measure on the Borel ﬁeld of a Polish
space. Then µ is regular in the sense that
µpBq “ inf tµpOq : O open, B Ă Ou “ sup tµpKq : K compact, K Ă Bu .
(5.55)
Proof. Let Ψ and A be as in the proof of Theorem 5.48. Then Ψ : E Ñ A
is a homeomorphism. Let µ ě 0 be a ﬁnite measure on the Borel ﬁeld of E.
Deﬁne the measure ν on the Borel ﬁeld of r0, 1sN by
νpBq “ µ
“
Ψ´1 pB X Aq
‰
“ µ rΨ P B X As ,
B Borel subset of r0, 1sN. (5.56)
Then, since the Hilbert cube is compact and complete metrizable, and A is a
Gδ-subset of the Hilbert cube, we see that the measure ν is regular on the Borel
ﬁeld of r0, 1sN. It also follows that the restriction of ν to the Borel ﬁeld of A
is regular. However, under the homeomorphism Ψ : E Ñ A the Borel subsets
of E are in a one-to-one correspondence with those of A. It easily follows that
the measure µ is regular in the sense of (5.55), which completes the proof of
Theorem 5.51.
□
5.52. Theorem. The following assertions hold for Banach spaces.
(a) Let E be a separable Banach space. Then its dual unit ball B1, endowed
with the weak˚-topology, is a Polish space.
(b) (Helly) The set M`
ď1 is compact-metrizable, and thus Polish for the
vague topology.
Let E1 be the topological dual space of E. The weak˚-topology is denoted by
σ :“ σ pE1, Eq.
Proof. (a) Let pxn : n P Nq be a sequence in the unit ball B of E of which
the linear span is dense in E. Deﬁne the mapping Φ : pB1, σq Ñ r0, 1sN via the

n“1. The mapping Φ is continuous and, by the Theorem of
Banach-Alaoglu, the dual unit ball B1 is compact relative the topology σ pE1, Eq.
It follows that ΦpB1q is a compact subset of r0, 1sN. This image is Polish, and
because the inverse of Φ is continuous, B1 itself is Polish as well.
Let r be a positive real number. Let the set M`

ď1 is compact for the vague topology. The
fact that the set M`

the proof of Theorem 5.52.

We

a sequence of functions pfk : k P Nq in tf P C00 pRνq : 0 ď f ď 1u whose linear
span is uniformly dense in C0 pRνq. We also choose a sequence puℓ: ℓP Nq in

Since µ “ vague- limm µm from (5.66) it also follows that µ is the weak limit of

The proof Theorem 5.54 is now complete.
□
Part of the proof of Theorem 5.54 comes back in the proof of Theorem 5.55.
5.55. Theorem. A subset S of M`
ďr is relatively weakly compact if and only if
S is a Prohorov subset.
Proof. First, suppose that S is a Prohorov subset of M`
ďr. Let pµm : m P Nq
be a sequence in S. We will prove that there exists a subsequence that con-
verges weakly. We may assume that, possibly by passing to a subsequence,
that this sequence converges vaguely. By employing the Prohorov property we
will show that, in fact, this sequence converges weakly. Let ϵ ą 0 be arbitrary.
Then there exists a compact subset K such that µm pKcq ď ϵ and also that
µ pKcq ď ϵ. Then choose u P C00 pRνq in such a way that 1 ě u ě 1K. Then we

Since µ “ vague- limm µm from (5.67) it also follows that µ is the weak limit of
the sequence pµm : m P Nq.
Conversely, suppose that the set S is weakly compact. We will prove that S
possesses the Prohorov property. Assume the contrary. Then there exists an
η ą 0 and there exists an increasing sequence of compact subsets pKm : m P Nq
with the following properties:
(a) Km Ă
˝
Km`1 and Rν “ Ť8
m“1 Km;
(b) For every m P N there exists a measure µm P S such that µm pKc
mq ě η.
Then choose a sequence of functions pum P C00 pRνqq such that 1Km ď um`1 ď

(5.68)
Since the subset S is relatively weakly compact, there exists a subsequence
pµmk : k P Nq which converges weakly to a measure µ. From (5.68) we then
see that η ď
ş
p1 ´ uℓq dµ for all ℓP N. From this we obtain a contradiction,
because the sequence p1 ´ uℓ: ℓP Nq decreases to 0.
This completes the proof of Theorem 5.55.
□
5.56. Corollary. Let pµm : m P Nq be a sequence of measures in M` and let
µ also belong to M`. Choose a sequence of functions pfk : k P Nq in
tf P C00 pRνq : 0 ď f ď 1u
with a linear span that is uniformly dense in C0 pRνq and choose another se-
quence puℓ: ℓP Nq in C00 pRνq such that 1 ě uℓ`1 ě uℓě 0 and such that

3. A taste of ergodic theory
In this section we will formulate and prove the pointwise ergodic theorem of
Birkhoﬀ. We also indicate its relation with the strong law of large numbers.
We will also show that the strong law of large numbers (SLLN) implies the
weak law of large numbers (WLLN). However, we begin with von Neumann’a
ergodic theorem in a Hilbert space. In what follows the symbol H stands for
a (complex) Hilbert space with inner-product ⟨¨, ¨⟩and norm }¨}. An operator
U : H Ñ H is called unitary if it satisﬁes U ˚U “ UU ˚ “ I. An operator
P : H Ñ H is called an orthogonal projection if P ˚ “ P “ P 2. Let L be closed
subspace of H. Then H can be written as
H “ L ‘ LK “ PH ` pI ´ Pq H,
where P : H Ñ H is an orthogonal projection with range L. The following
theorem is the same as Theorem 7.1 in Romik [115].

Let L be any linear subspace of H. From Hilbert space techniques it is known

and that the subspaces N pU ´ Iq and R pU ´ Iq are orthogonal. Moreover, we

Let pΩ, F, P; Tq be a measure preserving system. We associate with the measure
preserving mapping T : ΩÑ Ωan operator UT on the Hilbert space L2 pΩ, F, Pq
deﬁned by UTpfq “ f˝T, f P L2 pΩ, F, Pq. The fact that T is measure preserving

From (5.74) it follows that U ˚
TUT “ I. In order that UT is a unitary operator
it should also be surjective. Since the range of UT is closed, this is the case
provided that the set of functions f ˝ T, f P L2 pΩ, F, Pq, constitutes a dense
subspace of L2 pΩ, F, Pq. The latter is true if the mapping T has the property
that there exists a measurable mapping rT : ΩÑ Ωsuch that rT ˝ Tpωq “ ω for
P-almost all ω. Then the operator rU deﬁned by rUf “ f ˝ rT, f P L2 pΩ, F, Pq
is the adjoint of UT. This can be seen as follows. Now we do not only have
U ˚
TUT “ I, but we also have UT rUf “ rUf ˝ T “ f ˝ rT ˝ T “ f, f P L2 pΩ, F, Pq.

Note also that the subspace NpU ´ Iq consists exactly of the invariant (square-
integrable) random variables, or equivalently those random variables which are
measurable with respect to the σ-algebra I of invariant events. Recalling the
discussion of conditional expectations in Theorem 1.4, item (11), in Chapter 1,
we also see that the orthogonal projection operator P is exactly the conditional
expectation operator E

with respect to the σ-algebra of invariant events

Let X P L2 pΩ, F, Pq be bounded.

Lebesgue’s theorem of dominated convergence that the equality in (5.77) holds

The pointwise ergodic theorem of Birkhoﬀrequires some more work. In what
follows pΩ, F, µq is positive measure space, and T : ΩÑ Ωis a measure preserv-
ing mapping, i.e. µ tT P Au “ µ tT ´1Au “ µ tAu for all A P F with µ tAu ă 8.
An equivalent formulation reads as follows. For all f P L1 pΩ, F, µq the equality
ş
f ˝T dµ “
ş
f dµ holds. In other words the quadruple pΩ, F, P; Tq is a measure
preserving system, or dynamical system. The operator Pµ in (5.80) is a projec-
tion mapping from L1 pΩ, F, µq onto a space consisting of T-invariant functions.
Hence a function of the form g “ Pµf satisﬁes g ˝ T “ g µ-almost everywhere,
and so g is measurable with respect to the invariant σ-ﬁeld I. In addition, if h
is a bounded, T-invariant function in L1 pΩ, F, µq, then we have
ż
pPµfq h dµ “
ż
Pµ pfhq dµ “
ż
fh dµ.
(5.79)
In other words the function Pµf is the µ-conditional expectation of the function
f on the σ-ﬁeld of invariant subsets. A measure preserving system pΩ, F, µ; Tq
is called ergodic if a T-invariant function is constant µ-almost every, and so the
σ-ﬁeld I is trivial, i.e. I consists, up to sets of µ-measure zero, of the void set
and of Ω.
5.59. Theorem (The pointwise ergodic theorem in L1). Let pΩ, F, µ; Tq be a
measure preserving system. For any function f P L1 pΩ, F, µq the equality

We will formulate some of the results in terms of positivity preserving operators
S : L1 pΩ, F, µq Ñ L1 pΩ, F, µq.
5.61. Lemma. Let S : L1 pΩ, F, µq Ñ L1 pΩ, F, µq be a linear map, and let f ě 0
belong to L1 pΩ, F, µq. Then the following assertions are equivalent:
(i) min pSf, 1q “ S pmin pf, 1qq;
(ii) max pSf ´ 1, 0q “ S pmax pf ´ 1, 0qq;
(iii) min pSf, 1q ď S pmin pf, 1qq, and max pSf ´ 1, 0q “ S pmax pf ´ 1, 0qq.
Suppose that for every f ě 0, f P L1 pΩ, F, µq the operator S satisﬁes one, and
hence all of the conditions (i), (ii) and (iii). In addition, assume that
ż
|Sf| dµ ď
ż
f dµ, for all f P L1 pΩ, F, µq, f ě 0.
(5.82)
Then S is positivity preserving in the sense that f ě 0, f P L1 pΩ, F, µq, implies
Sf ě 0, and contractive in the sense that
ş
|Sf| dµ ď
ş
|f| dµ for all f P
L1 pΩ, F, µq. Then the equivalent conditions (iv), (v), (vi). and (vii) given by
(iv) The equality S pfgq “ pSfq pSgq holds for all f P L1 pΩ, F, µq, and for
all g P L1 pΩ, F, µq Ş L8 pΩ, F, µq,
(v) S pmin pf, gqq “ min pSf, Sgq is true for all f, g P L1 pΩ, F, µq,
(vi) The equality S pmax pf ´ 1, 0qq “ max pSf ´ 1, 0q holds for every f P
L1 pΩ, F, µq.
(vii) The S1tfą1u “ 1tSfą1u holds for every f P L1 pΩ, F, µq.
are also true. Moreover, (vi) implies that if the assertions (i), (ii) and (iii)
are true for all positive functions f in L1 pΩ, F, µq, then they are true for all
functions f in L1 pΩ, F, µq. If the measure µ is ﬁnite, then all assertions (i),
(ii), (iii) (for all f ě 0, f P L1 pΩ, F, µq,) and (iv), (v), (vi) and (vii) are
equivalent. Finally, the operator S : L1 pΩ, F, µq Ñ L1 pΩ, F, µq is continuous,
more precisely,
ż
|Sf| dµ “
ż
S |f| dµ ď
ż
|f| dµ,
f P L1 pΩ, F, µq .
(5.83)
5.62. Remark. Assertion (iv) also holds for all f, g P L1 pΩ, F, µq Ş L2 pΩ, F, µq.
The equality in (v) can be replaced with
S pmax pf, gqq “ max pSf, Sgq
for all f, g P L1 pΩ, F, µq.

The latter is true because minpf, gq ` maxpf, gq “ f ` g.
Proof of Lemma 5.61. The equivalence of the assertions (i), (ii) and (iii)
follows from the following identities:
min pSf, 1q ` S pmax pf ´ 1, 0qq “ Sf “ min pSf, 1q ` max pSf ´ 1, 0q .
Now assume that for all f ě 0, the operator S satisﬁes (i), (ii) or (iii), and
assume that S is contractive in the sense of (5.82).
Let f ě 0 belong to
L1 pΩ, F, µq, and put fn “ max pf ´ n´1, 0q. Then the sequence pf ´ fnqn de-
creases to 0, and hence, by (5.82), limnÑ8
ş
|Sf ´ Sfn| dµ “ 0. Then there
exists a subsequence pfnkqk such that the sequence pSfnkqk converges to Sf µ-
almost everywhere. Hence Sf ě 0 µ-almost everywhere. In fact it follows that
the sequence pSfnqn increases to Sf µ-almost everywhere. Let f P L1 pΩ, F, µq,
and write f “ f` ´ f´ where f` “ max pf, 0q, and f´ “ max p´f, 0q. Then
|f| “ f` ´ f´, and |Sf| ď Sf` ` Sf´. From (5.82) it the follows that

By 2020, wind could provide one-tenth of our planet’s 
electricity needs. Already today, SKF’s innovative know-
how is crucial to running a large proportion of the 
world’s wind turbines. 
Up to 25 % of the generating costs relate to mainte-
nance. These can be reduced dramatically thanks to our 
systems for on-line condition monitoring and automatic 
lubrication. We help make it more economical to create 
cleaner, cheaper energy out of thin air. 
By sharing our experience, expertise, and creativity, 
industries can boost performance beyond expectations. 
Therefore we need the best employees who can 
meet this challenge!

in (5.87) is proved now.
(ii) plus (v) ñ (vi) We apply (5.84), which is equivalent to (v), with f P
L1 pΩ, F, µq arbitrary and g “ 0 to obtain
S pmax pf ´ 1, 0qq “ S pmax pmax pf, 0q ´ 1, 0qq

Hence, assertion (vi) follows from (ii) and (v).

S max pf, 0q “ lim

Whence, S max pf, 0q “ max pSf, 0q. Since |f| “ 2 max pf, 0q ´ f we easily infer

If the measure µ is ﬁnite, then the constant functions belong to L1 pΩ, F, µq.
Since S1 “ 1, it is easy to see that assertion (iv) implies assertion (i), and hence
by what is proved above, we see that for a ﬁnite measure µ all assertion (i)
through (vi) are equivalent. The equality and inequality in (5.83) follow from
assertion (v) and the inequality in (5.82). This completes the proof of Lemma
5.61.

5.63. Proposition. Let g and h be functions in L1 pΩ, F, µq. Deﬁne, for ´8 ă
a ă b ă 8, the subset Ctg,hu
a,b
by
Ctg,hu
a,b
“ tg ă a ă b ă hu .
(5.93)
Then the following equality holds:
S1Ctg,hu

“ 1CtSg,Shu

.
(5.94)
Proof. Since Ct´h,´gu
´b,´a
“ tg ă a ă b ă hu we may assume that b ą 0. If
a ă 0, then 1tgăaăbăhu “ 1t´gą´au1thąbu.
From assertions (iv) and (vii) of
Lemma 5.61 it follows that
S1tgăaăbăhu “ 1t´Sgą´au1tShąbu “ 1tSgăaăbăShu,
and consequently (5.94) follows for a ă 0 ă b. If a “ 0, then we replace a with
a ´ ε and let ε Ó 0. If a ą 0, then we consider, for 0 ă ε ă a,
1tgďa´εăbăhu “ 1thąbu ´ 1tgąa´εu1thąbu.
(5.95)
Another application of the assertions (iv) and (vii) of Lemma 5.61 then yields
by employing (5.95) the equality:
S1tgďa´εăbăhu “ 1tShąbu ´ 1tSgąa´εu1tShąbu “ 1tSgďa´εăbăShu.
(5.96)
In (5.96) we let ε Ó 0 to obtain the equality in (5.93) for 0 ă a ă b. This
completes the proof of Proposition 5.63.

Then the following equality holds:

5.65. Theorem (Maximal ergodic theorem). Let S : L1 pΩ, F, µq Ñ L1 pΩ, F, µq
be a linear map, which is positivity preserving and contractive. So that f P

(5.103)
Observe that the second inequality in (5.103) resembles the Doob’s maximal
inequality for sub-martingales: see Theorem 5.110 or Proposition 3.107.

function hn by

Then we have hn`1 ě hn ě 0, and for ω P Ωsuch that hn`1pωq ą 0, we have

(b) Let f ě 0 belong to L1 pΩ, F, µq, and ﬁx a ą 0.
We ﬁrst prove that
µ tSf ą au ď µ tf ą au, i.e. the ﬁrst inequality in (5.103). Let m be a positive
integer. By the extra hypothesis in (b), together with assertion (ii) in Lemma
5.61, we have
min pm max pSf ´ a, 0q , 1q “ S pmin pm max pf ´ a, 0q , 1qq .
(5.109)
From (5.109) we deduce
ż
min pm max pSf ´ a, 0q , 1q dµ “
ż
S pmin pm max pf ´ a, 0q , 1qq dµ

(5.111)
This proves the ﬁrst inequality in (5.103). In order to show the second inequality
in (5.103) we proceed as follows. Let f be a member of L1 pΩ, F, µq, and deﬁne,
always for a ą 0 ﬁxed, the subset D by D “

In addition, deﬁne for n a positive integer, the subset Dn by

5.66. Theorem (Theorem of Birkhoﬀ). Let S : L1 pΩ, F, µq Ñ L1 pΩ, F, µq be
a linear operator such that for every f ě 0, f P L1 pΩ, F, µq, the following two
conditions are satisﬁed:
(i) S pmin pf, 1qq “ min pSf, 1q;
(ii) }Sf}1 :“
ş
|Sf| dµ ď
ş
f dµ “ }f}1.
(It follows that all properties mentioned in Lemma 5.61 are available as well
as the Propositions 5.63 and 5.64, and Theorem 5.65.) Then for every f P
L1 pΩ, F, µq the pointwise limit

exists µ-almost everywhere. In addition, Pµf belongs to L1 pΩ, F, µq, and the
operator Pµ is a projection operator, i.e. P 2
µ “ Pµ, with the following properties:
(a)
ş
|Pµf| dµ ď
ş
|f| dµ, and
(b) SPµf “ PµSf “ Pµf, where f belongs to L1 pΩ, F, µq.

limit, and Pµf “ Eµ

Before we prove this theorem we insert a corollary.
5.67. Corollary. Let the notation and hypotheses be as in Theorem 5.66.
Suppose that the operator S is ergodic in the sense that S1 “ 1, and Sf “ f,
f P L1 pΩ, F, µq, implies f “ constant µ-almost everywhere. If µ pΩq “ 8, then
Pµf “ 0, f P L1 pΩ, F, µq. If µ pΩq “ 1, then Pµf “

Proof. Let f P L1 pΩ, F, µq. Then SPµf “ Pµf, and so by ergodicity Pµf
is a constant µ-almost everywhere. If µ pΩq “ 8, then this constant must be
zero, because Pµf belongs to L1 pΩ, F, µq. If µ pΩq “ 1, then, by the L1-version

the (one-dimensional-)projection of ΩI on its j-th coordinate Ωj. Often these

that

(5.127)
The inclusions B Ă B1 Ă AI are obvious.
5.68. Definition. Let B be a subset of the powerset of ΩI. Then B is called a
Boolean algebra, if it is closed under ﬁnite union, and under taking complements.
5.69. Lemma. The set B is a Boolean algebra, B1 is a σ-ﬁeld, and
σ tBu “ B1 “ AI.

In order to get the equalities in (5.128) it remains to show that AI Ă σ tBu.
Considering the deﬁnition of AI it is suﬃcient to prove that pi, i P I, is mea-
surable for σ tBu and AI. However, this follows from (5.125). So the proof of
Lemma 5.69 is complete now.
□
5.70. Remark. The fact that B1 “ AJ is important. It shows that each B P AI
only depends on at most a countable number of indices, in the sense that B can
be written as B “ A ˆ ΩIzJ where J is countable or ﬁnite and where A P AJ.
The observation in this remark shows that the product σ-ﬁeld is relatively
“poor” when the index set I is uncountable. The following two examples will
clarify this.
5.71. Example. Take I uncountable, let each Ωi, i P I, be an arbitrary topo-
logical Hausdorﬀspace with at least two points, and let Ai be the Borel ﬁeld
of Ωi. For every i P I we select ωi P Ωi. Since the singleton tpωiqiPIu is a closed
subset of ΩI with respect to the product topology, it belongs to the Borel σ-ﬁeld
of ΩI. But it does not belong to AI because it cannot be written as the set B
in Remark 5.70.

5.72. Example. Take I “ r0, 8q and suppose that Ωi “ Ω, where Ωis a
topological Hausdorﬀspace consisting of at least two points. Hence Ωr0,8q “
Ωr0,8q is the set of all mappings from r0, 8q to Ω. Let B be the subset of Ωr0,8q
consisting of all right-continuous (or all continuous) mappings from r0, 8q to Ω.
Assuming that B belongs to Ar0,8q “ Abr0,8q, where A is the Borel σ-ﬁeld of Ω
will lead to a contradiction. Because, if B belongs to Ar0,8q, then by Remark
5.70 B is of the form B “ AˆΩr0,8qzJ where J Ă r0, 8q is countable, and where
A P AJ. We may suppose that J contains all rational numbers. Pick f P B and
t P r0, 8q zJ. We deﬁne the function g : r0, 8q Ñ Ωas follows: gpsq “ fpsq
if s ‰ t, and gpsq ‰ fptq if s “ t. Then g P B, but it is not right-continuous,
which can be seen as follows. In J there exists a sequence ptnqn which decreases
to t. Then
lim
nÑ8 g ptnq “ lim
nÑ8 f ptnq “ fptq ‰ gptq.
It follows that B R Ar0,8q.

whenever J, K P H pIq, J Ă K, and A P AJ. Then the family tPJ : J P H pIqu,
or the family tpΩJ, AJ, PJq : J P H pIqu, is called a projective system of proba-
bility measures, or spaces. Such a system is also called a consistent system, or
a cylindrical measure.
The following theorem says that a cylinder measure is a genuine measure pro-
vided that the spaces Ωi are topological Hausdorﬀspaces which are Polish,
endowed with their Borel σ-ﬁelds Bi. From Theorem 5.51 it follows that all
probability measures µ on a Polish space S are inner and outer regular in the
sense that
µpBq “ sup tµpKq : K Ă B, K compactu “ inf tµpOq : O Ą B, O openu
(5.131)
whenever B belongs to the Borel σ-ﬁeld of S. The following theorem is a slight
reformulation of Theorem 3.1. We also make the following observations. A
second-countable locally-compact Hausdorﬀspace is Polish. See Theorem 1.16,
and see the formula in (1.18) which gives the metric. As mentioned earlier this
construction can be found in Garrett [57].
A countable disjoint union of Polish spaces pEj, djq is Polish, with metric
dpx, yq “
#
1,
pfor x, y in distinct spaces in the unionq,
dnpx, yq
pfor x, y in the nth space in the unionq.
(5.132)
Here we assume that djpx, yq ď 1, x, y P Ej. From this result it follows that a
σ-compact metrizable Hausdorﬀspace E “ Y8
j“1Kj, Kj Ă Kj`1, Kj compact,
is a Souslin space, i.e. a continuous image of a Polish space. This is so because
every subset Kj is compact metrizable, and therefore separable. Therefore the
complements Kj`1zKj, j P N, are Polish, and since E is the disjoint union of

such spaces E itself is Polish. It is known that probability measures on the class
of Borel subsets of Souslin spaces are regular. For details the reader is referred
to Bogachev [21]. Before we formulate and prove the Kolmogorov’s extension
theorem we will discuss the Carath´eodory’s extension theorem. We need the
notion of semi-ring, ring, and (Boolean) algebra of subsets of a given set Ω.
5.74. Definition (Deﬁnitions). Let Ωbe a given set. A semi-ring is a subset
S of PpΩq, the power set of Ω, which has the following properties:
(i) H P S;
(ii) For all A, B P S, the intersection A X B belongs to S (S is closed under
pairwise intersections);
(iii) For all A, B P S, there exist disjoint sets Ki P S, with i “ 1, 2, . . . , n,
such that AzB “ Ťn
i“1 Ki (relative complements can be written as
ﬁnite disjoint unions).
A ring R is a subset of the power set of Ωwhich has the following properties:
(i) H P R;
(ii) For all A, B P R, the union A Y B belongs to R (R is closed under
pairwise unions);
(iii) For all A, B P R, the relative complement AzB belongs to R (R is
closed under relative complements).
Thus any ring on Ωis also a semi-ring.
A Boolean algebra B is deﬁned as a subset of the power set of Ωwith the
following properties:
(i) H P B;
(ii) For all A P B and B P B the union A Y B belongs to B;
(iii) If A belongs to B, then its complement Ac “ ΩzA belongs to B.
Sometimes, the following constraint is added in the measure theory context: Ω
is the disjoint union of a countable family of sets in S.
Without proof we mention some properties. Arbitrary (possibly uncountable)
intersections of rings on Ωare still rings on Ω. If A is a non-empty subset of
PpΩq, then we deﬁne the ring generated by A (noted R pAq) as the smallest
ring containing A. It is straightforward to see that the ring generated by A is
equivalent to the intersection of all rings containing A.
For a semi-ring S, the set containing all ﬁnite disjoint union of sets of S is the
ring generated by S:
R pSq “
#
A : A “
nď
i“1
Ai, Ai P S
+
.
This means that R pSq is simply the set containing all ﬁnite unions of sets in S.

A content µ deﬁned on a semi-ring S can be extended on the ring generated by
S. Such an extension is unique. The extended content is necessarily given by:
µpAq “
nÿ
i“1
µpAiq
for A “
nď
i“1
Ai, with the Ai P S’s mutually disjoint.
In addition, it can be proved that µ is a pre-measure if and only if the extended
content is also a pre-measure, and that any pre-measure on R pSq that extends
the pre-measure on S is necessarily of this form.
Some motivation is at place here. In measure theory, one is usually not inter-
ested in semi-rings and rings themselves, but rather in σ-algebras (or σ-ﬁelds)
generated by them. The idea is that it is possible to build a pre-measure on a
semi-ring S (for example Stieltjes measures), which can then be extended to a
pre-measure on R pSq, which can ﬁnally be extended to a genuine measure on a
σ-algebra through Carath´eeodory’s extension theorem. As σ-algebras generated
by semi-rings and rings are the same, the diﬀerence does not really matter (in
the measure theory context at least). Actually, the Carath´eodory’s extension
theorem can be slightly generalized by replacing ring with semi-ring.

5.75. Definition. Let S be a semi-ring in P pΩq. A pre-measure on S is a map
µ : S Ñ r0, 8s such that

We also need the concept of outer or exterior measure.
5.76. Definition. An outer measure on P pΩq is a map λ : P pΩq Ñ r0, 8s with
the following properties:
(i) λ pHq “ 0.
(ii) A Ă B implies λpAq ď λpBq.
(iii) If pAnqn is a sequence in P pΩq, then λ pŤ
n Anq ď ř
n λ pAnq.
By taking all but ﬁnitely many An to be the empty set one sees that an outer
measure is sub-additive: λ pA Y Bq ď λpAq ` λpBq, A, B P P pΩq. Let λ be an
outer measure on P pΩq. We deﬁne Σλ to be the set of all subsets A Ă Ωsuch
that for any D Ă Ωwe have
λpDq “ λ pA X Dq ` λ pAc X Dq .
(5.133)
Since an outer measure λ is sub-additive we may replace the equality in (5.133)
be an inequality of the form
λpDq ě λ pA X Dq ` λ pAc X Dq .
(5.134)
In other words, Σλ consists of all subsets A Ă Ωthat split Ωin two in a good
way. Clearly, ΩP Σλ and by the very form of the deﬁnition of Σλ, we have a
subset A belongs to Σλ if and only if its complement Ac belongs to Σλ. We now
present the following proposition, whose proof is a bit tedious. For details the
reader is referred to, e.g., [5] or [10]. The reader may also want to consult the
Probability Tutorials by Noel Vaillant: http://www.probability.net/. The
sets in Σλ are called Carath´eodory measurable relative to the outer measure λ.
5.77. Proposition. Let λ be an outer measure on Ω, and let Σλ be as deﬁned
above. Then Σλ is a σ-algebra on Ω.
The Lebesgue-Stieltjes integral

a fpxq dgpxq is deﬁned when f : ra, bs Ñ R

where the inﬁmum is taken over all coverings of E by countably many semi-open
intervals Ii. This measure is sometimes called the Lebesgue-Stieltjes, or Stielt-
jes measure associated with g. The Lebesgue-Stieltjes integral
şb
a fpxq dgpxq is
deﬁned as the Lebesgue integral of f with respect to the measure µg in the usual
way. If g is non-increasing, then deﬁne
şb
a fpxq dgpxq :“ ´
şb
a fpxq dp´gqpxq. If
the function g : ra, bs Ñ R is right-continuous, and of bounded variation on
ra, bs, then g may be written in the form g “ g1 ´ g2, where the functions g1
and g2 are monotone non-decreasing and right-continuous. So that µg ps, ts “
gptq ´ gpsq, a ď s ă t ď b, extends to a real-valued measure on the Borel ﬁeld
of ra, bs. Of course, if g were right-continuous, complex-valued and of bounded
variation, then g can be split as follows g “ Re g ` iIm g “ g1 ´ g2 ` i pg3 ´ g4q
where the functions gj, 1 ď j ď 4, are right-continuous, and non-decreasing.
To the function g we can associate a complex-valued measure µg such that
µg ps, ts “ gptq ´ gpsq, a ď s ă t ď b. For more details on Riemann-Stieltjes
integrals the reader is referred to [130]. The book by Tao [137] contains a
discussion on Stieltjes measures.
The deﬁnition of semi-ring may seem a bit convoluted, but the following simple
example shows why it is useful.
5.78. Example. Think about the subset of P pRq deﬁned by the set of all half-
open intervals pa, bs for a and b reals. This is a semi-ring, but not a ring. Stieltjes
measures are deﬁned on intervals; the countable additivity on the semi-ring is
not too diﬃcult to prove because we only consider countable unions of intervals
which are intervals themselves.
Proving it for arbitrary countably union of
intervals is proved using Carath´eodory’s extension theorem.
Now we are ready to formulate the Carath´eodory’s extension theorem.
5.79. Theorem (Carath´eodory’s extension theorem). Let R be a ring on Ω
and µ : R Ñ r0, 8s be a pre-measure on a R. Then there exists a measure
µ1 : σ pRq Ñ r0, 8s such that µ1 is an extension of µ. (That is, µ1 ˇˇ
R“ µ). Here
σ pRq is the σ-algebra generated by R.
If µ is σ-ﬁnite then the extension µ1 is unique (and also σ-ﬁnite).
If R is a Boolean algebra, then Theorem 5.79 is also called the Hahn-Kolmogorov
extension theorem. A complete proof can also be found in [21] Theorem 1.5.6.
We will present just an outline. Another interesting book is Tao [137]; in partic-
ular see Theorems 1.7.3 (Carath´eodory’s extension theorem) and 1.7.8 together
with Exercise 1.7.7 (Hahn-Kolmogorov’s extension theorem). An (older) paper,
which treats Carath´eodory’s extension theorem thoroughly, is Maharam [90].
Proof. The proof is based on the σ-ﬁeld corresponding to the outer (or
exterior) measure associated to pre-measure µ.
This exterior measure µ˚ is
deﬁned by

(If A can not be covered by a countable union of sets in R, then we put µ˚ pAq “
8.) Then it is not too diﬃcult to prove that µ˚ is an outer measure. Like in
Proposition 5.77 let Σµ˚ be the σ-ﬁeld consisting of those subsets A of Ωfor
which
µ˚ pDq ě µ˚ pA X Dq ` µ˚ pAc X Dq
for all D Ă Ω. Then it follows that the σ-ﬁeld Σµ˚ contains the ring R. Put
µ1 pBq “ µ˚ pBq, B P Σµ˚. Then µ1 is a measure on Σµ˚ which extends µ, and
which unique provided that µ is σ-ﬁnite. For details see [21] Theorem 1.5.6.
This concludes an outline of the proof of Theorem 5.79.
□
5.80. Example. Let E be a σ-compact topological Hausdorﬀspace, and assume
that each compact subset Kj is metrizable, and hence separable. Deﬁne the
sequence of open subsets pOjqj of E as follows: O0 “ H, O1 “ EzK1, Oj`1 “
pEzK1qX¨ ¨ ¨XpEzKjq, j ě 1. Then, for an appropriate metric px, yq ÞÑ djpx, yq,
x, y P Kj X Oj, 0 ď djpx, yq ď 1, the spaces Kj X Oj is complete metrizable and
separable, and so a Polish space. Moreover, by construction the spaces Kj XOj,
j “ 0, 1, . . ., are mutually disjoint, and so the E can be supplied with the metric
dpx, yq deﬁned by dpx, yq “ 1, if x, y belong to diﬀerent spaces Kj X Oj, and
dpx, yq “ djpx, yq, if x and y belong to Kj X Oj, j “ 0, 1, . . .. Then this metric
turns E written as a disjoint union of Kj X Oj into a Polish space. Its topology
is stronger than the original one, and hence E itself is continuous image of a
Polish space (via the identity map). It follows that E is a Souslin space.

The equality in (5.141) proves the ﬁnite additivity of the mapping PI on the
collection of cylinder sets B.
Finally we prove that the mapping PI is σ-additive on B. For that purpose we
consider a decreasing sequence pZnqn of cylinder sets such that PI rZns ě a ą 0
for all n P N.
We will show that Ş
n Zn ‰ H.
By contraposition it then
follows that Ş

As a consequence of the previous arguments, we see that PI is a σ-additive
on the Boolean algebra B which consists of cylinders in ΩI. This measure PI
satisﬁes (5.136). By the classical Carath´eodory theorem the mapping PI extends
in a unique fashion as a probability measure on the σ-ﬁeld σ tBu “ BI. Then,
technically speaking, the mapping PI, deﬁned on the Boolean algebra B, is a
pre-measure. This corresponding exterior measure P˚

Then it is not so diﬃcult to prove that the set function deﬁned by (5.150) is an
outer measure indeed. Deﬁne the associated σ-ﬁeld D by
D “ tA Ă ΩI : P˚
IpDq ě P˚
I pA X Dq ` P˚
I pAc X Dq : for all D Ă ΩIu .
(5.151)
The fact that D is a σ-ﬁeld indeed follows from Proposition 5.77: see Theorem
5.79 as well. It is fairly easy to see that D contains the Boolean algebra B which
consists of the cylinder sets in ΩI.
This completes the proof of Theorem 5.81.

The next Theorem is often used as a replacement for the dominated convergence
theorem of Lebesgue.
5.82. Theorem (Theorem of Scheﬀ´e). Let pΩ, F, µq be an arbitrary measure
space and let pfn : n P Nq be a sequence of non-negative functions in L1pΩ, F, µq.
In addition, let the function f belong to L1 pΩ, F, µq.
Suppose that fpxq “

Instead of uniformly integrable the term equi-integrable is often used. A family

a function g ě 0 in L1 pΩ, F, µq such that

6. Stochastic processes
We begin with some deﬁnitions.
5.86. Definition. Let pΩ, F, Pq be a probability space, and let pE, Eq be a
locally compact Hausdorﬀspace, that satisﬁes the second countability axiom,
with Borel σ-ﬁeld E.
Often E will be chosen as R or as Rν.
A stochastic
process X with values in the state space E is a mapping X : r0, 8q ˆ ΩÑ E.
For every ω P Ωthe mapping t ÞÑ Xpt, ωq deﬁnes a path of the process. A
path is sometimes also called a realization. If we ﬁx n P N, then the mappings
Pt1,...,tn : E b ¨ ¨ ¨ b E
looooomooooon
nˆ
Ñ r0, 1s, where pt1, . . . , tnq varies over r0, 8qn, and which
are deﬁned by
Pt1,...,tnpBq “ P tpXpt1q, . . . , Xptnqq P Bq ,
B P E b ¨ ¨ ¨ b E
looooomooooon
nˆ
,
(5.164)
are called the n-dimensional distributions of the process X. Here Xptq is the
mapping Xptqpωq “ Xpt, ωq, ω P Ω.
Sometimes we write Xt instead of Xptq. If n “ 1, then the distributions in
(5.164) are also called the marginal distributions, or marginals. However, no-
tice that a process is much more than the corresponding collection of ﬁnite-
dimensional distributions. In particular the paths or realizations of a process
are very important. For example, the continuity properties of the paths are
relevant. Often we will suppose that the paths are continuous, or that they are
continuous from the right, and possess limits from the left {c`adl`ag paths}, or
cadlag paths. So that the process X is cadlag provided that for all t ě 0 the
equality limsÓt Xpsq “ Xptq holds P-almost surely (this is continuity from the
right, or continue `a droite in French) and if the limit limsÒt Xpsq exists in E
(this means that the left limits exist in E, limit´e `a gauche in French).

5.87. Definition. A family sub-σ-ﬁelds pFt : t ě 0q of F is called a ﬁltration (or,
sometimes, also called history), if t ă s implies Ft Ă Fs. Thus the probability
P is deﬁned on all σ-ﬁelds Ft.
With F8, or also F8´ the σ-ﬁeld generated
by Ť
tě0 Ft is meant.
If for every t ě 0 the equality Ft “ Ş
sąt Fs holds,
then the ﬁltration pFt : t ě 0q is called continuous from the right, or right-
continuous. Let pFt : t ě 0q be a ﬁltration, and put Ft` “ Ş
sąt Fs. Then the
family pFt` : t ě 0q is a right-continuous ﬁltration. This ﬁltration is called the
right closure of the ﬁltration pFt : t ě 0q. A subset A of Ωis called a P-null
set if there exists a subset A0 P F with the following properties: A Ď A0 and
PrA0s “ 0. Usually this is expressed by saying that A is a null set instead
of A is a P-null set. Often it is assumed that F0 contains all null sets, and
that the ﬁltration pFt : t ě 0q is right-continuous. Sometimes it i said that F0
has the usual properties.
The process X is called adapted to the ﬁltration
pFt : t ě 0q if for every t ě 0 the state variable Xptq is measurable with respect
to σ-ﬁelds Ft and E. Let Ht “ σ pXpuq : 0 ď u ď tq be the σ-ﬁeld generated
by the state variables Xpuq, 0 ď u ď t. The ﬁltration pHt : t ě 0q is called
the internal history of the process X.
If t ą 0 is given, then Ht is called
the (information from the) past, σ pXptqq is called the (information from the)
present, and σ pXpuq : u ě tq the (information from the) future. The process X
is adapted if and only if Ht Ď Ft for every t ě 0.
5.88. Definition. Let X and Y be two processes. The processes X and Y are
said to be non-P-distinguishable or P-indistinguishable provided there exists a
P-null subset N with the property that for every ω R N and for every t ě 0
the equality Xpt, ωq “ Y pt, ωq holds. The process X is called a modiﬁcation of
the process Y (or also Y is a modiﬁcation of X) if for every t ě 0 there exists
a P-null set Nt with the property that Xpt, ωq “ Y pt, ωq for ω R Nt. Thus the
null set is t-dependent. If the processes X and Y are not distinguishable, then
X is a modiﬁcation of Y . In general, the converse statement is not true.
5.89. Theorem. Suppose that the process X as well as the process Y possesses
right-continuous paths. If X is a modiﬁcation of Y , then X and Y are not
distinguishable (also called stochastically equivalent).
Proof. Let X be a modiﬁcation of the process Y . For every t ě 0 there
then exists a null set Nt such that Xptq “ Y ptq on the complement of Nt. Put
N “ Ť
tPQ Nt. Then PpNq “ 0 and for every t P Q the equality Xptq “ Y ptq
holds on the complement of N. By right-continuity of the paths it then follows
that
Xptq “
lim
sÓ0,sPQ Xpsq “ lim
sÓt,sPQ Y psq “ Y ptq

5.90. Definition. Let pFt : t ě 0q be a ﬁltration and let T : ΩÑ r0, 8s be a
“stochastic time”. The function T is called a stopping time for the ﬁltration
pFt : t ě 0q if for every ﬁxed time t the event tT ď tu belongs to Ft.
Since
the event tT ă 8u “ Ť
nPN tT ď nu belongs to F8, the complementary event
tT “ 8u is also an element of F8.

5.93. Theorem. Let pFt : t ě 0q be a right-continuous ﬁltration, let X be an
adapted cadlag process, let G be an open subset and let F be a closed subset of
E. In addition, let pGn : n P Nq be a sequence of open subsets of E such that
F “ Ş
n Gn and such that Gn Ą Gn`1, n P N. Finally, let pFn : n P Nq be an
increasing sequence of closed subsets with the property that G “ Ť

the times S, Sn, T and Tn by means of the equalities:
S “ inf ts ě 0 : Xpsq P F or Xps´q P Fu ;

Tn “ inf ts ě 0 : Xpsq P Gnu
and T “ inf ts ě 0 : Xpsq P Gu .
(5.165)
Then these times are stopping times and the following assertions hold: Sn Ó T

□
5.94. Theorem. Let S and T be stopping times for the ﬁltration pFt : t ě 0q.
Then minpS, Tq, maxpS, Tq and S `T are also stopping times for this ﬁltration.
If pSn : n P Nq is a sequence of stopping times, then supn Sn is also a stopping
time, and if, moreover, the ﬁltration pFt : t ě 0q is right continuous, then infn Sn
is stopping time as well.
Proof. The proof is left as an exercise for the reader.

Indeed, the collection FT is a σ-ﬁeld and if T “ t is a ﬁxed time, then FT “ Ft.
If S ď T is also a stopping time, then FS Ă FT. If the ﬁltration pFt : t ě 0q
is continuous from the right, then an event A belongs to FT if and only if A
belongs to F8, and if for every t ą 0 the event A X tT ă tu belongs to Ft. If S
and T are stopping times, then FminpS,Tq “ FS XFT. If the ﬁltration pFt : t ě 0q
is right continuous and if pSn : n P Nq is a sequence of stopping times which
converges downward to S, then S is a stopping time and Ş
nPN FSn “ FS.
5.96. Definition. A process X : r0, 8q ˆ ΩÑ E is called progressively mea-
surable for the ﬁltration pFt : t ě 0q if for every t ą 0 the restriction of X to
r0, ts ˆ Ωis measurable for the σ-ﬁelds Br0, ts b Ft and E.
5.97. Theorem. If X is right-continuous adapted process, then X is progres-
sively measurable.
Proof. Deﬁne the sequence of processes pXn : n P Nq by means of the for-
mula:

(5.167)
So Xn is progressively measurable. Because the process X is P-almost surely
right-continuous it follows that limnÑ8 Xn “ X, and, consequently, X is pro-
gressively measurable. This completes the proof of Theorem 5.97.
□
5.98. Theorem. Suppose that X is progressively measurable for the ﬁltration
pFt : t ě 0q. Let T be a stopping time. The the state variable XpTq : ω ÞÑ
XpTpωq, ωq measurable for the σ-ﬁelds E and FT.
Proof. On the event tT ď tu the mapping ω ÞÑ X pTpωq, ωq is the com-
position of the mapping ω ÞÑ pTpωq, ωq, which goes from tT ď tu to r0, ts ˆ Ω
and which is measurable for the σ-ﬁelds Ft and Br0, ts b Ft, and the mapping
pu, ωq ÞÑ Xpu, ωq, which goes from r0, ts ˆ Ωto E and which is measurable for
the σ-ﬁelds Br0, ts b Ft and E. (In the latter argument the progressive mea-
surability of X was used.) The composition of measurable mappings is again
measurable, and hence XpTq is measurable for de σ-ﬁelds FT and E.
This completes the proof of Theorem 5.98.

The next lemma is often employed instead of the monotone class theorem.
5.100. Lemma. Let F be a σ-ﬁeld on Ωand H a vector space consisting of
F-measurable real-valued bounded functions on Ω. Suppose that the following
hypotheses are fulﬁlled:
(1) H contains the constant functions;
(2) If f and g belong to H, then the product fg belongs to H;
(3) If f is the pointwise limit of a sequence of functions pfn : n P Nq in H,
for which |fn| ď 1, then f belongs to H;
(4) F “ σ pf : f P Hq.
Then H contains all bounded F-measurable functions.
Proof. Let D be the collection D “ tA P F : 1A P Hu. Then D is a Dynkin
system and by (2) D is closed for taking ﬁnite intersections. So D is a σ-ﬁeld.
Pick f P H and let a P R. We will prove that the set tf ě au belongs to D.
By taking an appropriate combination of f and the constant function 1 we may
assume that 0 ď f ď 1 and that 0 ď a ď 1. Let p be a polynomial. By (2) ppfq
belongs to H. Let φ : r0, 1s Ñ R be a continuous function. By the theorem
of Stone-Weierstrass there exists a sequence of polynomials ppn : n P Nq such
that supxPr0,1s |φpxq ´ pnpxq| ď n´1. Consequently, φpfq belongs to H. Since
the function 1ra,8q is a (decreasing) pointwise limit of a sequence of continuous
functions, it follows that 1ra,8qpfq “ 1tfěau belongs to H. So the set tf ě au
belongs to D. From which it follows that D “ F. But then we infer F Ă
tA P F : 1A P Hu. From this the assertion in Lemma 5.100 immediately follows.
□
5.101. Definition. Let pFt : t ě 0q be a ﬁltration on the probability space
pΩ, F, Pq ,
and let X be an adapted process.
(i) The process X is called a martingale (relative to P and to the ﬁltration
pFt : t ě 0q) if for every t ě 0 the variable Xptq belongs to L1 pΩ, F, Pq
and if for every pair 0 ď s ă t the equality Xpsq “ E
`
Xptq
ˇˇ Fs
˘
holds
P-almost surely.
(ii) The process X is called a sub-martingale (relative to P and to the
ﬁltration pFt : t ě 0q) if for every t ě 0 the variable Xptq belongs to
L1 pΩ, F, Pq and if for every s ă t the inequality Xpsq ď E
`
Xptq
ˇˇ Fs
˘
holds P-almost surely.
(iii) The process X is called a super-martingale (relative to P and to the
ﬁltration pFt : t ě 0q) if for every t ě 0 the variable Xptq belongs to
L1 pΩ, F, Pq and if for every s ă t the inequality Xpsq ě E

Instead of assuming Xptq P L1 pΩ, F, Pq in (ii) it is sometimes assumed that the
variable Xptq` “ maxpXptq, 0q belongs to L1 pΩ, F, Pq. In (iii) it is sometimes
only assumed that Xptq´ “ max p´Xptq, 0q belongs to L1 pΩ, F, Pq. If T is a
(discrete) subset of r0, 8q and if pXptq, Ftqtě0 is a martingale (sub-martingale,
super-martingale), then the process pXptq, FtqtPT is so as well. Then we can use
“discrete results” and via a limiting procedure we then obtain results in the
“continuous case”.

5.103. Lemma. Let D by the set of non-negative dyadic numbers and let f : D Ñ
R be a function, which is bounded on D X r0, ns for all n P N. Assume that,
for all n P N and for all real numbers a ă b, with a and b (dyadic) rational,
the number of upcrossings UDXr0,nspf, a, bq of f is ﬁnite. Then the following
assertions are true:
(a) For every t P R the following left and right limits exist:
lim
sÒt,sPD fpsq
and
lim
sÓt,sPD fpsq;
(5.169)
(b) Deﬁne the function g by gptq “
lim
sÓt,sPD fpsq. Then g is right-continuous
and for every t ą 0 the left limit limsÒt gpsq exists.
Proof. (a) We will show that the limit limsÓt,sąt fpsq exists. Since the func-
tion f is bounded it suﬃces to prove that lim infsÓt,sąt fpsq “ lim supsÓt,sąt fpsq.
Assume that this not the case. Then there exist dyadic rational numbers a and
b such that lim infsÓt,sąt fpsq ă a ă b ă lim supsÓt,sąt fpsq. This means that
there exists s0 ą t, s0 P D, with fps0q ą b. There also exists s1 ă s0, s1 ą t,
s1 P D, such that fps1q ă a. In general we obtain t ă s2k´1 ă s2k´2, s2k´1 P D,
for which fps2k´1q ă a and we obtain t ă s2k ă s2k´1, s2k P D, with fps2kq ą b.
For m P N we write t2m “ s0, t2m´1 “ s1, . . ., t2 “ s2m´1, t1 “ s2m´1. Pick
n ą s0. Then we have UDXr0,nspf, a, bq ě m. Since m P N is arbitrary it follows
that UDXr0,nspf, a, bq “ 8. So we obtain a contradiction. The existence of the
left limit can be treated similarly.
(b) Put gptq “ limsÓt,sąt,sPD fpsq. By (a) this function is well deﬁned. Since,
for every n P N, the function f is bounded on the set D X r0, ns the function
g possesses this property as well.
Let now ptn : n P Nq be a sequence that
decreases to t and for which tn ą t for all n P N. We will prove limnÑ8 gptnq “
gptq. Then this shows that g is right-continuous at t. Assume lim infnÑ8 gptnq ă
gptq. This will lead to a contradiction. By passing to a subsequence, which we
call again ptn : n P Nq, we may suppose that lim infnÑ8 gptnq “ limnÑ8 gptnq
and that there are numbers a and b P D such that for all n P N, gptnq ă
a ă b ă gptq. Then pick s0 ą t0 such that fps0q ă a: this possible, because
gpt0q ă a. The pick s0 ą t0 ą s1 ą t in such a way that fps1q ą b: this is
possible, because gptq ą b. Then choose tn2, s1 ą tn2 ą t, with gptn2q ă a. Then
there exists s1 ą s2 ą tn2, such that fps2q ă a. This is so because gptn2q ă a.
This procedure can be continued. Like in (a) we arrive at UDXr0,nspf, a, bq “ 8,
for a certain nN, n ą t.
This is a contradiction.
But then it follows that
lim infnÑ8 gptnq ě gptq. In the same fashion we see that lim supnÑ8 gptnq ď
gptq. Consequently, gptq “ limnÑ8 gptnq. In order to prove the existence of the
left limit of the function g at t, we choose a sequence ptn : n P Nq, that increases
to t, and which has the property that tn ă t for all n P N. Assuming that
lim infnÑ8 gptnq ă lim supnÑ8 gptnq, then, as above, we arrive at the conclusion
that, for certain dyadic numbers a ă b, for which lim infnÑ8 gptnq ă a ă b ă
lim supnÑ8 gptnq, the number of upcrossings of the function f on the interval
D X r0, ns with n ą t is inﬁnite.

(a) Let H “ pHpnq : n P N, n ě 1q be a positive bounded process with the

5.111. Lemma. Let pAn : n P Nq be a sequence of σ-ﬁelds decreasing to the σ-
ﬁeld A8. So that An`1 Ď An, n P N, and A8 “ Ş
nPN An. Let pfn : n P Nq Y
tf8u be a sequence of stochastic variables with the following properties:
(i) fn is An-measurable, n P N, and f8 is A8-measurable;
(ii) fm ď E

, n P N;
(iii) limnÑ8 E pfnq “ E pf8q.
Then the sequence pfn : n P Nq is uniformly integrable.
Proof. For m “ 1, 2, . . . , 8 we have
fm ď E
`
f1

and maxpfm, 0q ď E
`
maxpfm, 0q

.
From this it follows that the sequence pmaxpfm, 0q : 1 ď m ď 8q is dominated
by an integrable function (in fact by E pmaxpf1, 0qq). So it follows that this se-
quence is uniformly integrable. The fact that the sequence pmaxp´fn, 0q : n P Nq
is also uniformly integrable, is much less trivial. To this end we consider
´ λP pfn ă ´λq ě E pfn : fn ă ´λq “ E pfnq ´ E pfn : fn ě ´λq

(5.172)
From (5.172) it follows that
λP pfn ă ´λq ď E pmaxpf1, 0q ` maxp´f8, 0qq ă 8.
Then choose ϵ ą 0 and m0 in such a way that E pfm0q ď E pf8q`ϵ. For n ě m0
we then see E pfm0q ď E pfnq ` ϵ. Hence, E pfnq ě E pfm0q ´ ϵ. Then choose
δ ą 0 such that PpAq ď δ implies E p|fk| : Aq ď ϵ for k “ 1, . . . , m0. After that
choose λ0 so large that P pfk ă λq ď δ for all k P N and for all λ ě λ0. For
1 ď k ď m0 we then get E p|fk| : fk ď ´λq ď ϵ, λ ě λ0. For k ě m0 we see

E p|fk| : fk ă ´λq “ ´E pfk : fk ă ´λq

for a certain λ ą 0. Thus we see that the sequence pmaxp´fn, 0q : n P Nq is also
uniformly integrable. This yields the desired result in Lemma 5.111.

5.112. Theorem. Let, relative to the right-continuous ﬁltration pFt : t ě 0q,
the process X be a sub-martingale. Suppose that F0 contains the zero-sets, and
that the function t ÞÑ E pXptqq is right-continuous. Then there exists a process
Y “ pY ptq : t ě 0q which is cadlag is which cannot be distinguished from X. So
for every t ě 0 the equality Y ptq “ Xptq holds P-almost surely.
Proof. There exists an event Ω1 in Ω, with PpΩ1q “ 1, such that on Ω1 the
following claims hold:
sup
tPDXr0,ns
|Xptq| ă 8, for all n P N;
UDXr0,nspX, a, bq ă 8, or all n P N and for all a ă b, a and b rational.
Since P pΩ1q “ 1 we see that Ω1 belongs to F0 and, hence Ω1 belongs to Ft for
all t ě 0. On Ω1 we deﬁne the process Y “ pY ptq; t ě 0q as follows: Y ptq “
limsÓt,sąt,sPD Xpsq. Then Y ptq is measurable for all σ-ﬁelds Fu with u ą t. By the
right continuity of the ﬁltration pFt : t ě 0q we then see that Y ptq is measurable
for the σ-ﬁeld Ft. Then take t “ limnÑ8 sn, where sn Ó t, and where, for every
n P N, sn belongs to D.
Then Y ptq “ limnÑ8 Xpsnq in probability.
Then
apply Lemma 5.111 to conclude that the sequence pXpsnq : n P Nq is uniformly
integrable, and hence Y ptq “ L1 ´ limnÑ8 Xpsnq. We may apply Lemma 5.111.
for fn :“ Xpsnq, f8 “ Y ptq, A8 “ Ft and An “ Fsn.
Then notice that
Xptq ď E
`
Xpsnq
ˇˇ Ft
˘
, P-almost surely. By L1-convergence, from the latter we
see that Xptq ď E
`
Y ptq
ˇˇ Ft
˘
and thus Xptq ď Y ptq P-almost surely. Since,
in addition, E pY ptqq “ limnÑ8 EpXpsnqq “ EpXptqq, the equality Y ptq “ Xptq
follows P-almost surely.
This completes the proof of Theorem 5.112.
□
5.113. Theorem. Let X “ pXptq : t ě 0q be a sub-martingale with property that

(a) The limit Xp8q :“ limsÑ8,sPD Xpsq exists P-almost surely.
(b) If X is a cadlag process, then the limit Xp8q :“ limsÑ8 exists P-almost
surely.
(c) If, in addition, the process pXptq` : t ě 0q is uniformly integrable, then
the inequality Xptq ď E

regularity starting from (5.175) and (5.174) (in fact from their consequences),
we now obtain that Xp8q :“ limsÑ8,sPD Xpsq exists.
(b) If X is cadlag, then, like in the proof of the regularity, the limit Xp8q “
limsÑ8 Xpsq exists.

5.114. Theorem. Let X “ pXptq : t ě 0q be a sub-martingale with the property
that the process pXptq` : t ě 0q is uniformly integrable. In addition, suppose that
X is cadlag.If S and T are a pair of stopping times such that 0 ď S ď T ď 8,
then the following inequality holds: XpSq ď E
`
XpTq

.
Proof. Put Sn “ 2´nr2nTs and, similarly, Tn “ 2´nr2nTs. Then the stop-
ping times Sn and Tn attain exclusively discrete values (in fact they take their
values in 2´nN). It is true that Sn Ó S (if n Ñ 8) and the same is true for the
sequence pTn : n P Nq. Moreover, Sn ď Tm for n ě m. From Doob’s theorem
about discrete optional stopping times it follows that

formly integrable. Then the limit Xp8q :“ limtÑ8 Xptq exists P-almost surely,

equalities hold:

□
In what follows the process X : r0, 8q ˆ ΩÑ Rν is a process with values in Rν,
where ν may be 1.
5.117. Definition. Let X be a stochastic process, which is adapted to the
ﬁltration pFt : t ě 0q. The process X is said to be a L´evy process if X possesses
the following properties:
(a) For all s ă t the variable Xptq ´ Xpsq is independent of Fs;
(b) For all s ď t the variable Xptq ´ Xpsq has the same distribution as
Xpt ´ sq;
(c) For all t ě 0 and for every sequence ptn : n P Nq in r0, 8q that converges
to t, the limit limnÑ8 Xptnq “ X exists in P-law (or in P-measure).
Sometimes this is denoted by P-limnÑ8 Xptnq “ Xptq.
5.118. Theorem. Let X be a stochastic process, which is adapted to the ﬁltration
pFt : t ě 0q, and which takes it values in Rν. The following assertions are true:
(a) Let X be a L´evy-process. Deﬁne for t ě 0 the probability measure µt as
being the distribution of Xptq. So µtpBq “ P pXptq P Bq, where B is a
Borel subset of Rν. Then the family tµt : t ě 0u is a vaguely continuous
semigroup of probability measures.
(b) Conversely, let tµt : t ě 0u be a vaguely continuous semigroup of prob-
ability measures on Rν. Then there exists a L´evy-process
X “ tXptq : t ě 0u

Some related results
with cadlag paths such that µtpBq “ P pXptq P Bq for all Borel subsets
B of Rν.
Proof. (a) Deﬁne for t ě 0 the characteristic function ft of Xptq as being
the Fourier transform of the P-distribution of Xptq. So that
ftpξq “ E pexp p´i ⟨ξ, Xptq⟩qq ,
ξ P Rν.
Since, for t, s P r0, 8q, Xps ` tq “ Xps ` tq ´ Xpsq ` Xpsq, since, in addition,
Xps ` tq ´ Xpsq is independent of Xptq, and because Xps ` tq ´ Xpsq possesses
the same distribution as Xptq we infer
fs`tpξq “ E pexp p´i ⟨ξ, Xps ` tq⟩qq
“ E pexp p´i ⟨ξ, Xps ` tq ´ Xpsq⟩q exp p´i ⟨ξ, Xpsq⟩qq
“ E pexp p´i ⟨ξ, Xps ` tq ´ Xpsq⟩qq E pexp p´i ⟨ξ, Xpsq⟩qq
“ E pexp p´i ⟨ξ, Xptq⟩qq E pexp p´i ⟨ξ, Xpsq⟩qq
“ ftpξqfspξq.
(5.181)
Since Xp0q and Xp0q ´ Xp0q “ 0 have the same distribution we see f0pξq “ 1.
Since P-limuÓ0 Xpuq “ Xp0q we see, for example by Theorem 5.85 in combination
with the implication (1) ñ (9) of Theorem 5.43, that limsÓ0 fspξq “ f0pξq “ 1.
From (5.181) it then follows that
lim
tÓs ftpξq ´ fspξq “ lim
tÓs fspξq pft´spξq ´ f0pξqq “ 0
for all s ě 0. Because, by applying equality (5.181) repeatedly, we see ftpξq “
pft2´npξqq2n. In addition we have limsÓ0 fspξq “ 1. So it follows that for no value
of t P r0, 8q the function ftpξq vanishes for any ξ. Since, for t ă s, ftpξq´fspξq “
pf0pξq ´ fs´tpξqq ftpξq, it also follows that limtÒs ftpξq “ fspξq, for s ą 0. From
the previous considerations it follows that the function t ÞÑ ftpξq, t P r0, 8q,
is a continuous function, which satisﬁes the relation fs`tpξq “ fspξqftpξq for
all s, t ě 0 and this for all ξ P Rν.
Furthermore, we deﬁne the family of
measures tµt : t ě 0u as being the P-distributions of the L´evy-process X. So
that µtpBq “ P pXptq P Bq, B Borel subset of Rν. From the previous arguments
it then follows that
pµs`tpξq “ fs`tpξq “ fspξqftpξq “ pµspξqpµtpξq
(5.182)
and that limsÓ0 pµspξq “ 1. So that the family tµt : t ě 0u is a vaguely continuous
semigroup of probability measures on Rν. By Theorem 5.31 there then exists a
continuous negative-deﬁnite function ψ such that ftpξq “ pµtpξq “ exp p´tψpξqq.
(b) Deﬁne pΩ, F, Pq as in Proposition 5.36. Likewise we deﬁne the state vari-
ables Xptq : ΩÑ Rν as in Proposition 5.36.
Let the ﬁltration pFt : t ě 0q
be determined by Ft “ σ pXpuq : 0 ď u ď tq. So the ﬁltration pFt : t ě 0q is
the internal history of the process X. Then X is a L´evy-process, which pos-
sesses the properties as described in (b). The fact that for t ą s the variable
Xptq ´ Xpsq is independent of Fs was proved in Theorem 5.37. We must show

that, for ϵ ą 0 ﬁxed, limsÓ0 P p|Xpsq ´ Xp0q| ą ϵq “ 0. Therefore, notice ﬁrst
that P pXp0q “ 0q “ µ0t0u “ 1. Hence, with Bpϵq “ tx P Rν : |x| ď ϵu, we have
P p|Xpsq ´ Xp0q| ą ϵq “ P p|Xpsq ´ Xp0q| ą ϵ, Xp0q “ 0q
“ P p|Xpsq| ą ϵ, Xp0q “ 0q
“ P p|Xpsq| ą ϵq
“ µs tRνzBpϵqu “ 1 ´ µs tBpϵqu .
(5.183)
Since the convolution semigroup tµt : t ě 0u is vaguely continuous it follows that
lim
sÓ0 µs tBpϵqu “ 1. From (5.183) we then see that limsÓ0 P p|Xpsq ´ Xp0q| ą ϵq “
0. The only problem which is still left, is the fact that the process X is not
necessarily cadlag. In the following propositions and lemmas we will, among
other things, resolve this problem.
From Theorem 5.121 it follows that the
process X is also a L´evy process for the ﬁltration pGt : t ě 0q, where Gt “ FtYN.
By Theorem 5.123 we then see that the process X possesses a cadlag version.
The proof of Theorem 5.118 is now complete.

But (5.186) is the same as (5.184) with m replaced by m ` 1. Next we look
at the situation for the ﬁltration tFt` : t ě 0u which is closed from the right.
Without loss of generality we may assume that s1 ą 0. In case s1 “ 0 we have

(5.188)
From (5.188) it then follows that (5.184) holds for the ﬁltration tFt` : t ě 0u
which is closed from the right.
This completes the proof of Proposition 5.119.
□
5.120. Corollary. Let the assumptions and hypotheses be as in Proposition
5.119. For every bounded complex-valued random variable Y , that is measurable
for the σ-ﬁeld σ tXpuq : u ě 0u the following equality holds P-almost surely de
equality:
E

.
(5.189)
Proof. Put Y “ exp
´
´i řm
j“1 ⟨ξj, Xpsjq⟩
¯
. By Proposition 5.119 we see
that for all such random variables Y the equality in (5.189) holds, provided
that sj ě t, for 1 ď j ď m. By splitting and using the standard properties
of a conditional expectation we see that the restriction sj ě t is superﬂuous.
In other words the equality in (5.189) holds for all variables Y of the form
Y “ exp
´
´i řm
j“1 ⟨ξj, Xpsjq⟩
¯
where all sj belong to r0, 8q and where all ξj
are members of Rν. Let Y0 be a bounded complex-valued random variable, which
belongs to the linear span of variables of the form exp
´
´i řm
j“1 ⟨ξj, Xpsjq⟩
¯
.
Then consider the vector space HpY0q deﬁned by
HpY0q
“ tY : ΩÑ C : Y is bounded and measurable for the σ-ﬁeld σ tXpuq : u ě 0u
and E
`
Y Y0
ˇˇ Ft
˘
“ E
`
Y Y0
ˇˇ Ft`
˘(
.
By employing Lemma 5.100 or, even better, the monotone class theorem we see
that HpY0q contains all complex-valued bounded random variables, which are
measurable for the σ-ﬁeld σ tXpuq : u ě 0u. Among others we may put Y0 “ 1,
and the claim in Corollary 5.120 follows.
□
5.121. Theorem. Let X “ tXptq : t ě 0u be a L´evy-process. Let H“tHt : tě0u
be the internal history of the process X. Let N be the null sets in H8. Then
the ﬁltration G, with Gt “ σ tHt Y Nu, is continuous from the right.
Proof. Let A P Gt`. By Corollary 5.120 we have 1A “ E
`
1A

˘
. Let
B P Ft be such that 1B “ E

, P-almost surely. Then P pA△Bq “ 0.
Since A “ B△pA△Bq, we see that A in fact belongs to Gt.
□
5.122. Lemma. Let pxn : n P Nq be a sequence of vectors in Rν with the property
that the sequence pexp p´i ⟨ξ, xn⟩q : n P Nq converges for almost all ξ P Rν. Then
the sequence pxn : n P Nq converges.
Proof. Fix 1 ď j ď ν, and let U j be a vector valued stochastic variable
which is zero for the coordinates k ­“ j and with the property that U j
j is uni-
formly distributed on the interval r0, 1s. The following inequalities are true for

Since this inequality holds for every 0 ă δ ă 1, it follows that the j-th coordinate
pxn,j : n P Nq of the sequence pxn : n P Nq converges. This holds for 1 ď j ď
ν. Hence, the limit limnÑ8 xn exists. This makes the proof of Lemma 5.122
complete.
□
Among other things, in Theorem 5.123 the proof of item (b) in 5.118 is com-
pleted.
5.123. Theorem. Let pXptq, Ftqtě0 be a L´evy-process. Suppose that the ﬁltration
pFt : t ě 0q is right-continuous, and that F0 contains the null sets. Then there
exists a cadlag modiﬁcation of X “ pXptq : t ě 0q.

The result in Theorem 5.123 can be applied in case we take the internal history,
completed with null sets, as the ﬁltration pFtqtě0.
Proof of Theorem 5.123. We will make use of the following product
set:

endowed with the product-σ-ﬁeld E “ btPQ`BpCq. Put

it can be proved that D belongs to the σ-ﬁeld E. Consider the mapping:
Φ : Rν ˆ ΩÑ E
deﬁned by
Φpξ, ωq “ exp p´i ⟨ξ, Xptq⟩q “: αt.
(5.190)
The mapping Φ is measurable for the σ-ﬁelds F8 and E. As a consequence
Λ :“ Φ´1pDq belongs to the σ-ﬁeld BpRνqbF8. So for every pair pξ, ωq P RνˆΩ
there exists a cadlag function f : r0, 8q Ñ C with the property that the equality
fptq “ exp p´i ⟨ξ, Xptq⟩q holds for all t P Q`. Now let the negative-deﬁnite
function corresponding to the process X be given by ψ.
Then the process
t ÞÑ exp p´i ⟨ξ, Xptq⟩` tψpξqq is a martingale. This is so, because, for 0 ď s ă t,
we have the following equalities:

From martingale theory it follows that there exists a cadlag version M ξ “

of the martingale t ÞÑ exp p´i ⟨ξ, Xptq⟩` tψpξqq. By this we
mean that for every pξ, tq P Rν ˆ r0, 8q there exists an event Nt,ξ with the

exp p´i ⟨ξ, Xpt, ωq⟩` tψpξqq holds. Hence, for every ξ P Rν there exists a P-null

surely the following limits exist for all t ě 0:

sPQ
Xpsq.
Deﬁne the process Y by Y ptq “
lim
sÓt, sPQ Xpsq. Then the process Y is cadlag:
see (the proof of) Lemma 5.103 (b). Furthermore, Xptq “
lim
sÓt,sPQ Xpsq (in P-
distributional sense), and thus Xptq “ Y ptq P-almost surely.
The proof of
Theorem 5.123 is now complete.
□
5.124. Theorem (Dynkin-Hunt). Let pXptq, Ftqtě0 be a cadlag L´evy process
with a right-continuous ﬁltration pFt : t ě 0q. Let T : ΩÑ r0, 8q be a stopping
time which is not identically 8. So that P tT ă 8u ą 0. On the event tT ă 8u
the process Y “ tY ptq : t ě 0u is deﬁned by Y ptq “ Xpt ` Tq ´ XpTq.
(a) Under rP the process Y has the same distribution as the process X under
P.
(b) The σ-ﬁelds FT and σ tY psq : s ě 0u are P-independent.
Proof. (a) For n P N we write Tn “ 2´nr2nTs. Then pTn : n P Nq is a
sequence of stopping times with the following properties:
(i) tTn ă 8u “ tT ă 8u;
(ii) T ď Tn`1 ď Tn ď T ` 2´n, n P N.
Deﬁne the sequence of processes pY n : n P Nq via the formula:
Y nptq “ Xpt ` Tnq ´ XpTnq op de event tTn ă 8u “ tT ă 8u .
Let now f : pRνqm Ñ C be a bounded continuous function, let A be an event
in FT Ď FTn, and let s1 ă ¨ ¨ ¨ ă sm be an increasing sequence of ﬁxed times.
Then the following equalities hold:

In (5.194) we let n tend to 8. Since the process X is right-continuous it follows
that lim

follows. By taking, in (5.195), the function f of the form f “ f0 ˝ Vm, where
Vm : pRνqm Ñ pRνqm is give by Vm px1, . . . , xmqq “ px1, . . . , x1 ` ¨ ¨ ¨ ` xmq we

(5.196)
Here f0 : pRνqm Ñ C is an arbitrary bounded continuous function. By passing
to limits (5.196) follows for arbitrary bounded Borel measurable functions f0 :
pRνqm Ñ C. Via the monotone class theorem the assertion in (a) follows.
(b) By taking the function f of the form f “ f0˝Vm, where Vm : pRνqm Ñ pRνqm
is given by Vm px1, . . . , xmqq “ px1, . . . , x1 ` ¨ ¨ ¨ xmq in (5.195), we get

Then
choose A “ Ωand divide by P tT ă 8u. We get
rE rf0 pY ps1q, . . . , Y psmqqs “ E rf0 pXps1q, . . . , Xpsmqqs .
(5.198)
Inserting the result in (5.198) into (5.197) entails
rE rf0 pY ps1q, . . . , Y psmqq 1Aq “ rE rf0 pY ps1q, . . . , Y psmqqs rPpAq.
(5.199)
From (5.199) it follows that the σ-ﬁeld FT is independent of the one generated
by tY psq : s ě 0u: for this employ the monotone class theorem.
This completes the proof of Theorem 5.124.

7. Markov processes
Let pΩ, F, Pq be a probability space and let X, Y and Z be stochastic variables
on Ωwith values in a topological Hausdorﬀspace E. We assume that E is
locally compact and that E is second countable, or, what is the same, that
E satisﬁes the second countability axiom. In other words E has a countable
basis for its topology. The space E is supplied with the Borel σ-ﬁeld E and
we suppose that the variables X, Y and Z are measurable for the σ-ﬁelds F
and E. The symbol PX stands for the image measure on E of the probability P
under the mapping X. So PXpBq “ P pX P Bq, B P E. The symbol PY

probability kernel from Ωto E with the property that

Proof. The equality in (5.201) follows in fact from the deﬁnition of PY
ˇˇX.
By choosing the function g of the form gpx, yq “ 1Bpxq1Cpyq in (5.200) we see
that (5.200) coincides with (5.201). An arbitrary bounded measurable function
g can be approximated by linear combinations of functions of the form px, yq ÞÑ
1Bpxq1Cpyqi, with B and C in E. Let g : E Ñ E be a bounded measurable
function. Then the following equalities hold:

be a stochastic process with values in the state space E adapted to the ﬁltration
pFt : t ě 0q. So every state variable Xptq is a mapping from Ωto E, measurable
for the σ-ﬁelds Ft and E.
In addition, suppose that the family of operators
tϑt : t ě 0u from Ωto Ωsatisﬁes the translation property Xpsq˝ϑt “ Xps`tq for
all s and t ě 0. Then the following assertions are equivalent (for the implication

(i) ñ (iv). By the fact E satisﬁes the second countability axiom, and by the
fact E is the Borel ﬁeld it suﬃces to prove (iv) for functions f P C0pEq instead

(5.217)
We see that (5.216) and (5.217) are the same. It follows that the assertion in
(iv) is proved for Tn instead of T. By letting n tend to 8 we then obtain (iv)
for T (by employing the right-continuity of paths of the process).
So the proof of Theorem 5.126 is complete now.
□
We continue with some deﬁnitions.
5.127. Definition. Let pΩ, F, Pq be a probability space, and let E be a locally
compact Hausdorﬀspace with a countable basis for its topology. In addition, let
pFt : t ě 0q be a ﬁltration on Ω. Let X “ tXptq : t ě 0u be a process attaining
values in E. The state space E is equipped with the Borel ﬁled and it is assumed
that X is an adapted process. Suppose that for every x P E the (sub-)probability
kernel PXps`tq
ˇˇXptqpx, Cq, C P E, is deﬁned. Here the (sub-)probability kernel
PY |Xpx, Cq possesses the following deﬁning property:
ż
B
PY
ˇˇXpx, CqP pX P dxq “ P tY P C, X P Bu ,
where B and C are Borel subsets of E and where X and Y are stochastic
variables with values in E. In addition, it is assumed that there are so-called
translation operators ϑt : ΩÑ Ωwith the property that Xpsq˝ϑt “ Xps`tq for
all s, t ě 0. Moreover, by hypothesis the process X is cadlag. We say that the
process X is a Markov process if for every C P E and every t ě 0 the equality

is P-almost surely true for all s ě 0. The process X is called a strong Markov
process if equality (5.218) also holds for stopping times. More precisely, if for
every s ě 0, for every C P E and for every stopping time T : ΩÑ r0, 8s the
equality

5.128. Remark. The expectation value ExpY q is in fact the Radon-Nikodym
derivative of de measure B ÞÑ E rY, Xp0q P Bs with respect to the measure B ÞÑ

then we obtain the probability kernel PXpsq

Hence, these quanti-
ties are deﬁned as Radon-Nikodym derivatives. So, in general, the expression

these probability kernels exist for every x P E indeed, and that the correspond-
ing semigroup is a Feller. Many authors deﬁne a (time homogeneous) Markov

The equality in (5.225) can be proved in the same manner as equality (5.209) in
Theorem 5.126. Therefore pick f P C0pEq and a stopping time T : ΩÑ r0, 8s.

From (5.226) it follows that (5.225) for Y “ fpXpsqq and for Tn in the place of
T. By taking the limit in (5.226) for n Ñ 8 the equality in (5.225) follows for
Y “ fpXpsqq. Precisely as in the proof of the implication (iv) ñ (v) in Theorem
5.126 the equality in (5.225) then follows for arbitrary random variables Y : ΩÑ
C, which are bounded and measurable for the σ-ﬁeld F8.
8. The Doob-Meyer decomposition via Komlos theorem
Let pΩ, F, Pq be a probability space, let tFt : t ě 0u be a right continuous ﬁltra-
tion in F and let tXptq : t ě 0u be a real-valued Ft-submartingale. The Doob-
Meyer decomposition theorem states that there exists an Ft-martingale tMptq :
t ě 0u together with an increasing predictable adapted process tAptq : t ě 0u,
which is right continuous P-almost surely, such that Xptq “ Mptq ` Aptq, t ě 0,
provided that the process tXptq : t ě 0u is of class (DL). The latter means that
for every t ą 0 the family tXpτq : 0 ď τ ď t, τ stopping timeu is uniformly inte-
grable. Moreover this decomposition is unique in case we assume that Ap0q “ 0.
By Doob’s optional sampling theorem every martingale is automatically of class
(DL) (see e.g. Ikeda and Watanabe [61], p.35, Ethier and Kurtz [54], p.74). An
interesting discussion of the Doob-Meyer decomposition and (sub-)martingale
theory can be found in Kopp [74]. For a nice account of the Doob-Meyer de-
composition theorem the reader may also consult van Neerven [148].
We shall employ the following result of Komlos [73]. In fact it can be interpreted
as kind of a law of large numbers.
5.129. Theorem (Komlos). Let tfk : k P Nu be a sequence in L1pΩ, F, Pq such
that
sup tE p|fk|q : k P Nu ă 8.
Then there exists an inﬁnite large subset Λ0 of N together with a function f in
L1pΩ, F, Pq such that for every inﬁnite subset Λ of Λ0

Some related results
Examples show that this limit need not be an L1-limit. Set Ω“ N with the
discrete σ-ﬁeld and with Ptku “ 2´k, k P N. Let tfk : k P Nu be the sequence
deﬁned by fk “ 2kek, k P N, where tek : k P Nu is the sequence of the unit
vectors. Then n´1 řn
j“1 fj Ñ 0 pointwise, but n´1 ş řn
j“1 fjdP “ 1, n P N.
Standard results on continuity properties of submartingales yield the existence
of a realization (version) which is continuous from the right and possesses left
limits P-almost surely. Henceforth we shall assume that the Ft-submartingale
tXptq : t ě 0u is continuous from the right and has left limits P-almost surely.
We shall prove that there exists a predictable increasing process tAptq : t ě 0u
together with an inﬁnite Λ0 of N such that for every inﬁnite subset Λ of Λ0 and
every t ě 0 the variable Aptq is given as the limit:
Aptq “ lim

(5.229)
Moreover the process tXptq ´ Aptq : t ě 0u is an Ft-martingale. The limit in
(5.228) is a point-wise almost sure limit as well as an L1-limit.
Again let pΩ, F, Pq be a probability space, let tFt : t ě 0u be a right-continuous
ﬁltration in F and let tXptq : t ě 0u be right continuous submartingale of class
(DL) which possesses almost sure left limits. We want to prove the following
version of the Doob-Meyer decomposition theorem.
5.130. Theorem. There exists a unique predictable right continuous increasing
process tAptq : t ě 0u with Ap0q “ 0 such that the process tXptq ´ Aptq : t ě 0u
is an Ft-martingale.
It is perhaps useful to insert the following proposition.
5.131. Proposition. Processes of the form Mptq ` Aptq, with M a martingale
and with A an increasing process in L1pΩ, F, Pq are of class (DL).
Proof of Proposition 5.131. Let tXptq “ Mptq ` Aptq : t ě 0u be the
decomposition of the submartingale tXptq : t ě 0u in a martingale tMptq : t ě
0u and an increasing process tAptq : t ě 0u with Ap0q “ 0 and 0 ď τ ď t be any
Ft-stopping time. Here t is some ﬁxed time. For N P N we have
E p|Xpτq| : |Xpτq| ě Nq ď E p|Mpτq| : |Xpτq| ě Nq ` E pApτq : |Xpτq| ě Nq

Similarly we have the following result.
5.132. Proposition. Let tXptq : t ě 0u be an Ft-submartingale. For any real
number N the process tmaxpXptq, Nq : t ě 0u is an Ft-submartingale which is
of class (DL).
Next we come to the heart of the matter. The symbol rxs, x P R, denotes the

By 2020, wind could provide one-tenth of our planet’s 
electricity needs. Already today, SKF’s innovative know-
how is crucial to running a large proportion of the 
world’s wind turbines. 
Up to 25 % of the generating costs relate to mainte-
nance. These can be reduced dramatically thanks to our 
systems for on-line condition monitoring and automatic 
lubrication. We help make it more economical to create 
cleaner, cheaper energy out of thin air. 
By sharing our experience, expertise, and creativity, 
industries can boost performance beyond expectations. 
Therefore we need the best employees who can 
meet this challenge!

t ě 0, q
(5.259)
and hence
E pAΛ0ptq ´ AΛ0psqq “ fptq ´ fpsq.
(5.260)
So that the process tAΛ0ptq : t ě 0u is almost surely right continuous. Again we
have decomposition (5.254) for all t ě 0. From (5.236) and (5.258) it follows
that, P-almost surely,
AΛ0pt0q “ lim

and consequently the process tAΛ0ptq : t ě 0u is predictable.
□
The uniqueness of the Doob-Meyer decomposition does not depend on the (DL)-
property. So the processes tMΛ0ptq : t ě 0u and tAΛ0ptq : t ě 0u do not depend
on the particular choice of Λ0. Henceforth we write
Xptq “ Mptq ` Aptq,
t ě 0,
(5.261)
where tMptq : t ě 0u is an Ft-martingale and where tAptq : t ě 0u is an increas-
ing right continuous process which is predictable. Proposition 5.131 shows that
the process tXptq : t ě 0u must possess the (DL)-property. Let D0 be the count-
able dense subset of r0, 8q given by
D0 “ tt P Q : t ě 0u Y tt ě 0 : fpt`q ą fpt´qu
(5.262)
and choose Λ0 Ď N, |Λ0| “ 8, and the process tBptq : t P D0u in such a way
that for every inﬁnite subset Λ of Λ0,
Bptq “ lim

|Λ X r1, ns|

jPΛXr1,ns Ajptq,
t P D0.
(5.263)
Then, as in the case of tAjptq : j P Nu it follows that the convergence in (5.263)
is an L1-convergence as well. Again as above the convergence in (5.263) occurs
for all t ě 0. Consequently the process tXptq ´ Bptq : t ě 0u is a martingale,
because the processes tXjptq ´ Ajptq : t ě 0u, j P N, are martingales. Here

These remarks prove the following corollary.
5.133. Corollary. Write a submartingale tXptq : t ě 0u in the form Xptq “
Mptq ` Aptq, t ě 0, where the process tMptq : t ě 0u is a martingale and where
tAptq : t ě 0u is a right continuous increasing predictable process with Ap0q “ 0.
Then there exists an inﬁnite subset Λ0 of N such that for every inﬁnite subset
Λ of Λ0 and every t ě 0:

and the convergence in (5.264) is a P-almost sure as well as an L1-convergence.
Of course the process tAptq : t ě 0u does not depend on the particular choice of
Λ0 for which all the limits in (5.264) exist.
Next the uniqueness part of the Doob-Meyer decomposition will follow from
Proposition 5.134.
5.134. Proposition. Let Z “ tZptq : t ě 0u be a bounded martingale and let
A “ tAptq : t ě 0u and tBptq : t ě 0u be adapted increasing processes such that
B ´ A is a martingale. Also suppose that EpAptqq ă 8, for t ě 0. Then

5.136. Proposition. In addition to the hypotheses in Proposition 5.134, sup-
pose that the martingale B ´ A is predictable. Then Bpt`q “ Apt`q P-almost
surely. So that, if B ´ A is right-continuous, then B “ A P-almost surely,
provided Bp0q “ Ap0q “ 0.
Proof. First we prove that E
´şt
0 pZps`q ´ Zps´qq dpB ´ Aqpsq

we shall employ the predictability of the process B´A. It suﬃces to prove that,
for all s ą 0,
E ppZps`q ´ Zps´qq pBps`q ´ Aps`q ´ Bps´q ` Aps´qqq “ 0.
(5.266)
Since the predictable ﬁeld on Ωˆr0, 8q is generated by the collection tCˆpa, bs :
C P Fa, 0 ď a ă bu it suﬃces to prove (5.266) for all s ě 0 if B ´ A is of the
form
Bpsq ´ Apsq “ 1C ˆ 1pa`ε,8qpsq,
C P Fa.
(5.267)
So let C belong to Fa and let Bpsq´Apsq “ 1C ˆ1pa`ε,8qpsq. Then, for s “ a`ε
(and C P Fa), we have by the martingale property of Z,
E pZ ppa ` εq`q ´ Z ppa ` εq´q 1Cq
“ E pE pZpppa ` εq`q ´ Z ppa ` εq´q | Faq 1Cq
“ E ppZpaq ´ Zpaqq 1Cq “ 0.
(5.268)
Notice that, for s “ a ` ε,
E ppZps`q ´ Zps´qq pBps`q ´ Aps`q ´ Bpsq ` Apsqqq
“ E ppZ ppa ` εq`q ´ Z ppa ` εq´qq 1Cq .
From Proposition 5.134 it now follows that
E pZpt`q pBpt`q ´ Apt`qqq “ E rZp0q pBp0q ´ Ap0qqs “ 0.
Next, ﬁx t ą 0 and deﬁne the martingale Zpsq by
Zpsq “ E

Then

and hence Bpt`q “ Apt`q, P-almost surely for all t ě 0. It also follows that
Bpt´q “ Apt´q, P-almost surely for all t ą 0. If the process B ´ A is right
continuous almost surely, we infer Bptq “ Aptq, t ě 0, P-almost surely. This
completes the proof of Proposition 5.136.

As a special case the following result contains the uniqueness part of the Doob-
Meyer decomposition theorem.
5.137. Proposition. Let A and B be increasing adapted processes. Suppose
that B ´ A is a predictable right continuous martingale. Then Bptq “ Aptq `
Bp0q ´ Ap0q, P-almost surely.
Proof. This result is an immediate consequence of Proposition 5.134 and
Proposition 5.136.
□
5.138. Corollary. There is only one way to write a semi-martingale Y in the
form Y “ M ` A, where M is a (local) martingale and where A is a predictable
right continuous process of ﬁnite variation locally with Ap0q “ 0.
5.139. Remark. An increasing, predictable right continuous real-valued process
tAptq : t ě 0u, with E pAptqq ă 8 for t ě 0, is called a Meyer process.
It is perhaps worthwhile to isolate the following result in the existence part of
Doob-Meyer decomposition theorem: notation is that of the proof of Theorem

5.140. Theorem. Let tXptq : t ě 0u be a right continuous submartingale of class
(DL). For every inﬁnite subset Λ0 of N there exists an inﬁnite subset Λ of Λ0
such that for every further inﬁnite subset Λ1 of Λ, the limit
AΛptq :“ lim

and does not depend on the choice of Λ1. Moreover, since we are dealing with

process tAΛptq : t ě 0u is predictable and right continuous.
Proof. Write

Let Λ0 be an inﬁnite subset of N. Komlos’ theorem, applied to the sequence
tAnptℓq : ℓP NunPN on the measure space tN ˆ Ω, PpNq b F, µ b Pu applies to
the eﬀect that there exists an inﬁnite subset Λ of Λ0 such that for every further
inﬁnite subset Λ1 of Λ, AΛptq “ limNÑ8 AΛ1Xr1,Nsptℓq exists for ℓ“ 1, 2, . . . and
does not depend on the particular choice of Λ1. In addition,
lim

“ 0.
Next let t ě 0 be arbitrary with EpXptqq “ EpXpt´qq “ EpXpt`qq and let
Λ1 Ď Λ0, Λ1 inﬁnitely large. For t1 ă t ă t2, t1, t2 in Q1, we have

5.141. Corollary. Let X “ M ` A be the Doob-Meyer decomposition of a

This limit is an P-almost sure limit as well as a limit in L1pΩ, F, Pq.
Proof. A combination of the existence and uniqueness of the Doob-Meyer
decomposition yields the desired result.
Notice that by Proposition 5.131 a
process of the form M`A, where M is a martingale and where A is an increasing
adapted process in L1pΩ, F, Pq is of class (DL): see (5.230) and (5.231). So the
proof of Corollary 5.141 is complete now.
□
Another corollary is the following one.
5.142. Corollary. Let tXptq : t ě 0u be a right continuous submartingale of
class (DL) with left limits. Fix t0 ą 0 and let tτℓ: ℓP Nu be sequence of stopping
times which increases to the ﬁxed time t0. Suppose τℓă t0, P-almost surely, for
all ℓP N. Then E p|Xpt0´q|q ă 8 and limℓÑ8 E p|X pτℓq ´ X pt0´q|q “ 0. In
addition, limhÓ0 E p|X pt0 ` hq ´ X pt0q|q “ 0.
The following result also follows from our discussion.
5.143. Corollary. Let tXptq : t ě 0u be a submartingale. If the function t ÞÑ
E pXptqq is P-almost surely continuous, then the process tAptq : t ě 0u is P-
almost surely continuous as well.
5.144. Remark. Several people have reformulated and extended Komlos’ result
as a principle of subsequences, e.g. see Chatterji [30]. Others have treated an
inﬁnite dimensional version, e.g. see Balder [7]. In [96], Exercise 3, p. 103 the
authors give an example of a submartingale which is not of class (DL). In fact
M´etivier and Pellaumail give the following example. Let Ωbe the interval r0, 1s
with Lebesgue measure and let 0 “ t0 ă t1 ă . . . ă tn ă . . . ă 1 be a sequence
such that limnÑ8 tn “ 1. Deﬁne the process X by
Xpt, ωq “ ´

n“1 2n1rtn´1,tnqptq1p1´2´n,1spωq,

t ě 0.
Then X is a submartingale, X is not of class (DL) and X is a martingale on
the interval r0, 1q. If tn´1 ď t ă tn, we write Ft for the σ-ﬁeld generated by
tpj ´ 1q2´n, j2ns : 1 ď j ď 2nu. If t ě 1, then Ft is the Borel ﬁeld of r0, 1s.
5.145. Definition. Let tY ptq : t ě 0u be a martingale in L2pΩ, F, Pq. Then
t|Y ptq|2 : t ě 0u is a submartingale of class (DL). So by Theorem 5.130 there

exists a unique martingale tMptq : t ě 0u with Mp0q “ |Y p0q|2 and an increasing
predictable right-continuous process t⟨Y ⟩ptq : t ě 0u in L1pΩ, F, Pq such that
|Y ptq|2 “ Mptq ` ⟨Y ⟩ptq,
P-almost surely.
The process t⟨Y ⟩ptq : t ě 0u is called the (quadratic) variation or variance pro-
cess of tY ptq : t ě 0u.
5.146. Example. Let tBptq : t ě 0u be ν-dimensional Brownian motion. Then
the process tt ÞÑ νt : t ě 0u is the corresponding quadratic variation process.

Subjects for further research and presentations
The following topics may be of interest for a presentation and/or further re-
search:
(1) Certain pseudo-diﬀerential operators of order less than or equal to 2
can be put into correspondence with space-homogeneous or non-space-
homogeneous Markov processes. A detailed exposition can be found in
Jacob [62, 63, 64].
(2) Viscosity solutions to partial diﬀerential equations. The standard ref-
erence for this subject is Crandall, Ishii, and Lions [35]. This topic
can also be treated in the context of Backward Stochastic Diﬀerential
Equations (BSDEs): see, e.g., Pardoux [109].
(3) Elliptic diﬀerential operators of second order (and Markov processes);
see, e.g., Øksendael [106].
(4) Parabolic diﬀerential operators (of second order and Markov processes).
An interesting article in this context is Bossy and Champagnat [23].
The abstract of this paper reads: “We present the main concepts of the
theory of Markov processes: transition semigroups, Feller processes, in-
ﬁnitesimal generator, Kolmogorov’s backward and forward equations,
and Feller diﬀusion.
We also give several classical examples includ-
ing stochastic diﬀerential equations (SDEs) and backward stochastic
diﬀerential equations (BSDEs) and describe the links between Markov
processes and parabolic partial diﬀerential equations (PDEs). In par-
ticular, we state the Feynman-Kac formula for linear PDEs and BSDEs,
and we give some examples of the correspondence between stochastic
control problems and Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (HJB) equations and
between optimal stopping problems and variational inequalities. Sev-
eral examples of ﬁnancial applications are given to illustrate each of
these results, including European options, Asian options, and Ameri-
can put options.”
(5) Solutions to stochastic diﬀerential equations and the corresponding sec-
ond order diﬀerential equation (of parabolic type) satisﬁed by the one-
dimensional distributions.
(6) Backward stochastic diﬀerential equations and their viscosity solutions;
see, e.g. Pardoux [109], Van Casteren [147], Boufoussi and Van Cast-
eren [24, 25], Boufoussi, Van Casteren and Mhardy [26].
(7) Heat equation on a Riemannian manifold.
A relevant book in this
context is [59]. For connections with stochastic diﬀerential equations
on manifolds see, e.g., Elworthy [52, 53].
(8) Oscillatory integrals and related path integrals. There is a lot of lit-
erature on this subject. Nice papers on this topic are Albeverio and
Mazzucchi [1, 2]. Interesting books are, e.g., Mazzucchi [95], Johnson
and Lapidus [65], and Kleinert [69].
(9) Malliavin calculus, or stochastic calculus of variations, and applica-
tions to regularity properties of integral kernels. For details see e.g.

Some related results
Nualart [103, 104]. Other references which contain results on and ap-
plications of Malliavin calculus include: Cruzeiro and Malliavin [36],
Stroock [127, 128, 129], Cruzeiro and Zambrini [37], [38]. Of course
the original work by Malliavin should not be forgotten: [92]. The book
by Bismut [18] combines Malliavin calculus with the theory of large
deviations. For a discussion on Malliavin calculus in relation to L´evy
processes see, e.g., Osswald [108]. A rather elementary approach to
Malliavin calculus can be found in Friz [56]. For application to sto-
chastic diﬀerential equations see, e.g., Takeuchi [135]. For applications
of Malliavin calculus to operator semigroups see, e.g., L´eandre [83, 84].
For Malliavin calculus without probability theory see [82].
(10) Books and papers with literature on ﬁnancial mathematics include:
Le´on, Sol´e, Utzet, and Vives [85], Nualart and Schoutens [105], Malli-
avin and Thalmaier [93], Karatsas and Shreve [66], Gulisashvili [60],
El Karoui and Mazliak [51], El Karoui, Pardoux and Quenez [49], Lim
[87].
Other references include Zhang and Zhou (editors) [155] and
Tsoi, Nualart and Yin [138].
(11) Another interesting subject is “Ergodic theory” and, correspondingly,
invariant measures. We mention some references: Krengel [75], Karlin
and Taylor [67], Meyn and Tweedie [97], Eisner and Nagel [48], Van
Casteren [146], Seidler [119], Goldys [58], [115].
(12) Central limit theorems and related results are also relevant.
Again
we mention some references: Bhattaraya and Waymire [15], Nourdin
and Peccati [101], Barbour and Chen [8], Berckmoes, Lowen and Van
Casteren [11, 12, 13, 14], Tao [137], Stein [124, 125], Chen, Goldstein
and Shao [31], Barbour and Hall [9].
(13) Investigate Markov processes with a Polish space as state space: see,
e.g., Sharpe [120], Swart and Winter [134], Van Casteren [146], Bovier
[27].
(14) Discuss and make a careful study of the Skorohod space as described
in Remark 3.40. Try to include applications to convergence properties
of stochastic processes.
(15) Discuss stochastic analysis in the inﬁnite-dimensional context. A nice
and relevant survey paper is [150] written by van Neerven, Veraar and
Weis. A simpliﬁed version in Dutch is authored by van Neerven: see
[149].
