Understanding the Brain using Computational Models 
F Descriptive Models of the Brain 
How do neurons respond to external stimuli and how do we 
describe this quantitatively with a neural encoding model?  
How can we extract information from neurons (decoding)?  
F Mechanistic Models of Brain Cells and Networks 
How can we simulate the behavior of a single neuron on a 
computer?  
How do we simulate a network of neurons? 
F Interpretive (or Normative) Models of the Brain 
Why do brain circuits operate the way they do? 
What are the computational principles underlying their 
operation?

programming in Matlab or Octave 
F Up to 3 submissions allowed for a homework 
Maximum score out of these 3 will be used for course grade 
F No Exams! 
F Certificate of completion if total course grade > 60% 

8 
Matlab, Octave, and Programming 
F Some homework questions will be based on results you get 
after programming in Matlab  
F No Matlab? No worries!  
Use Octave: Similar to Matlab but free!  
Compatible with most Matlab programs 
Download Octave from: 
http://www.gnu.org/software/octave/ 
F No programming experience? No problem – learn as part of 
this course! 
Matlab tutorials on course website 
1st homework: Matlab practice homework (submission optional)

Course Goals: What you can expect to learn 
F
At the end of the course, you will be able to: 
1. Quantitatively describe what a biological neuron or 
network of neurons is doing given experimental data 
2. Simulate on a computer the behavior of neurons and 
networks 
3. Formulate computational principles underlying the 
operation of neurons and networks in the brain
