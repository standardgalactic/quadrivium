Dear Mr. Russell, 
Please accept the attached resume for the position of System Administrator as recently 
advertised on indeed.com. I've had the pleasure to review the company’s website and went over 
the job description, and am very enthusiastic about the position. I believe that my combination 
of technical skills, and business sensibilities would serve Vandelay industries well in this 
position. 
 
I know I don’t have the exact number of experience that you are looking for but with the time 
spent on my lab and helping out others with technical issues can be quantified for up to 2 years 
of actual corporate level experience.  I am the “go to guy” for everyone at my current job, and 
among my family and friends.
