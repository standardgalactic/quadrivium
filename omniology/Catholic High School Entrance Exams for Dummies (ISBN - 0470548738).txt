Catholic High School Entrance Exams For Dummies 
 

Introduction
I
f you’re reading this book, you’re probably planning to attend a Catholic high school. 
Congratulations on your dedication to an excellent education! But before you can don your 
uniform and complain about your class schedule, you have to take one of three possible 
entrance exams. The test you take — whether that’s the HSPT, the TACHS, or the COOP — 
will tell your chosen high school a little bit about how prepared you are for the next step in 
your education. High school administrators evaluate your score and use it to determine 
what classes to put you in and even whether to give you a little scholarship money. We 
don’t want to put undue pressure on you, but you do have to get ready for the challenge. 
How do you prepare for a test you’ve never seen? Sure, you can read through your notes 
from English and math classes (if only you’d taken any). Or you can watch a lot of Jeopardy! 
But we have a better way. . . .
Catholic High School Entrance Exams For Dummies puts at your fingertips everything you 
need to know to conquer the exam required by your future Catholic high school. We give 
you a complete review of the language, reading, math, quantitative relationship, and logic 
concepts the various entrance exams test. We also provide insight into how to avoid the 
pitfalls that standardized test-takers sometimes encounter.
About This Book
If you’re like most 13- and 14-year-olds, studying for your Catholic high school entrance 
exam is the absolute last thing you want to do. We get that. Really, we do. That’s why we’ve 
filled Catholic High School Entrance Exams For Dummies with clearly written advice pre-
sented in an easy-to-swallow, casual tone. The other great thing about this book is that you 
can get in and get out to find what you need quickly. You don’t have to read this book from 
cover to cover. If you have an extra hour before basketball practice or clarinet lessons, you 
can devour a chapter or even a particular section within a chapter. If you just want to brush 
up on your grammar skills or perfect your analogy-deciphering ability, you can gobble up 
the relevant chapter or section and forget about the rest. (If these eating metaphors are 
making you hungry, then by all means take a snack break.)
Note: Some of the sections in this book are applicable to only one or two tests. For instance, 
if you’re taking the TACHS exam, you won’t encounter any of the question types covered in 
the chapter on verbal reasoning. You may want to refer to the table of contents at the front 
of this book to see which sections apply to the particular test required by the high school 
you’re planning to attend.
The sample questions we sprinkle throughout each chapter in Parts II and III read like the 
actual test questions. Because the best way to gear up for any standardized test is to prac-
tice, practice, practice on lots of test questions, we give you well over 1,000 opportunities to 
answer questions and get familiar with the way your exam phrases questions and presents 
answer choices. Then there’s the pièce de résistance of the book: two full-length practice 
tests for each of the three Catholic high school entrance exams (complete with full-length 
answer chapters to explain the answers to each and every test question).
Ultimately, we want you to succeed on whichever exam you’re taking, so we’re dedicated to 
giving you time-tested techniques for improving your score. In the following pages, you dis-
cover how to quickly spot incorrect answer choices, make educated guesses based on what 
you know, and manage your time wisely for the best possible score. With Catholic High 
School Entrance Exams For Dummies, you have all you need to ace the HSPT, TACHS, or

Catholic High School Entrance Exams For Dummies 
COOP so you can move on to more important matters — arranging to get the cute classmate 
sitting next to you in science class to be your lab partner without seeming too interested.
Conventions Used in This Book
To help you find your way through this book — as in all For Dummies books — we’ve used 
the following basic conventions:
 
✓ Italics highlight new words and terms that we’re defining. They also point out individ-
ual words or short phrases that we want to draw your attention to.
 
✓ Boldfaced text indicates the actions in numbered steps and keywords in bulleted lists.
 
✓ Monofont alerts you to the presence of a Web address.
You’ll also notice that some of the chapters contain sidebars (a paragraph or two in a 
shaded box). Sidebars contain quirky bits of information that we think may interest you but 
that aren’t essential to your performance on any of the Catholic high school entrance 
exams. Skip over ’em if you’d prefer; you won’t hurt our feelings — too much.
Finally, some words may appear in this font. These are vocabulary words we’ve chosen to 
shine a spotlight on to help you prep for your exam.
Foolish Assumptions
Here’s the most important assumption we’re making about you: You’re most likely an 
eighth-grader planning on attending a Catholic high school, and you’ve been told you must 
take an entrance exam. (Yes indeed — we’ve been praised for our startling ability to recog-
nize the obvious!) Generally, students who attend parochial schools make learning a top pri-
ority, so we’re also thinking that you’re a pretty motivated student. And it’s likely that your 
grade and middle school years have been spent in a parochial environment too, which 
means you’ve had an awesome education already. Good for you!
Most of the concepts you’ll encounter on the Catholic high school entrance exam you’re 
facing aren’t new to you, but the way they’re presented can be downright weird for some 
question types. So, even if you’re a math whiz with a college-level vocabulary, you should 
expose yourself to the question types ahead of time just so you know what to expect. What 
if you’re at the other end of the spectrum and are wishing you paid a little more attention in 
Miss O’Brien’s algebra class? No worries; we’re ready for you, too. Inside these pages are 
thorough math and English reviews just in case you’ve been napping in class.
How This Book Is Organized
Catholic High School Entrance Exams For Dummies is divided into five parts that are packed 
with important information to get you ready for exam day. We organized these parts so you 
can easily navigate through the book to find whatever topic you’re looking for. Following is 
a quick look at what each part covers.

3
 Introduction
Part I: Providing Perspective on Catholic 
High School Entrance Exams
This part tells you how to figure out which exam you’re supposed to take, how Catholic high 
schools use each of the exams, and what each exam looks like. It also helps you get super-
organized for your test-taking adventure. It features information on registering for your 
exam, assembling everything you need to take with you to the testing site, and developing a 
tried-and-true strategy for moving successfully and efficiently through the test questions.
Part II: Vanquishing the Verbal Questions
Here’s where you discover what kinds of language and reading questions appear on the 
entrance exams. Get ready to encounter all sorts of ways to play with vocabulary words, 
find out how to approach analogies in words and pictures, train your brain to think logi-
cally, and create a plan for working through reading comprehension passages and their 
questions. This part also includes pithy reviews of proper grammar, usage, punctuation, 
spelling, and sentence construction.
Part III: Mastering Math and Conquering 
Quantitative Questions
The third part of the book is more than just an exciting overview of every math class you’ve 
had since kindergarten. In addition to reviews of the traditional math concepts of arithme-
tic, geometry, algebra, and word problems, you discover how to tackle other inventive 
quantitative question types. The Catholic high school entrance exams present you with cre-
ative questions that ask you to complete number and picture sequences, evaluate shapes 
and figures, balance squares and triangles on scales, and figure out strange-seeming hole-
punch problems.
Part IV: Practice Makes Perfect
As promised, after you feel comfortable with your increased vocabulary, memorized math 
formulas, and that hole-punch question type, you can put your skills to the test tackling the 
full-length exams contained in this part. For your testing enjoyment, we include two HSPTs, 
two TACHSs, and two COOPs. Each exam comes complete with a sample bubble answer sheet 
so you can practice filling in circles, as well as thorough explanations of all the answers.
Part V: The Part of Tens
No For Dummies book is complete without The Part of Tens, and this book is no different. 
Here, we include ten important test-taking strategies you should apply to master the exam 
you’re facing. We also include a chapter for you to share with your parents so they know 
their role in helping you do your best. (They didn’t think they could just buy you this book 
and ditch you, did they?)

Catholic High School Entrance Exams For Dummies 
Icons Used in This Book
One exciting feature of Catholic High School Entrance Exams For Dummies is the icons that 
highlight especially significant portions of the text. These little pictures in the margins alert 
you to areas where you should pay particularly close attention.
 
This icon is pretty self-explanatory. When you see it, you know you’re going to get to prac-
tice the particular area of instruction covered in that section with a question like one you 
may see on the test. Our examples include detailed explanations of how to most efficiently 
answer exam questions and avoid common pitfalls.
 Information tagged with this icon relates specifically to one (or all) of the entrance exams. It 
highlights facts you should know about each exam that’ll help you perform your best.
 
This icon points out those general concepts, such as math formulas and grammar rules, 
that you should keep in mind as you tackle the test questions.
 
Throughout the book, we give you insights into how you can enhance your performance on 
the entrance exam you’re facing. Text featuring the Tip icon presents you with juicy test-
taking timesavers.
Where to Go from Here
Wondering where to get started? Well, if you’re a test-taking whiz or straight-A student who 
only needs to brush up on a few areas, you can go right to the chapters and sections that 
cover those areas. (Use the table of contents and index as your guides.) Then again, if you 
really want to ace the HSPT, TACHS, or COOP, we suggest you take a more thorough 
approach to preparing. Familiarize yourself with the general test-taking process in Chapter 2 
and then work through the complete verbal and math reviews. You can skim through 
 sections that you know a lot about by just reading the Tip, Remember, and Heads Up 
 paragraphs and working through the Example questions.
If nothing else (and after you’ve done some preparatory work), we encourage you to take at 
least one of the practice exams in Part IV. Taking a practice test shows you which questions 
you seem to cruise through and which ones you need more work on. One way to use the 
practice tests is to take the first practice test for your exam and calculate your score. Then 
read through the verbal and math reviews in Parts II and III. After that, take the second 
practice test and compare your new score to the one you got on the first test so you can see 
just how much you improved with a little practice.
Wherever you begin, be confident that you’re making a giant contribution to bettering your 
future by working through this book. Now, get ready to pass that Catholic high school 
entrance exam with flying colors!

Part I
Providing Perspective on 
Catholic High School 
Entrance Exams

In this part . . .
H
ere’s where you really get to know your Catholic 
high school entrance exams. First, you discover just 
what your school of choice might do with your scores. 
Then you spend time becoming familiar with the formats 
of the HSPT, TACHS, and COOP, as well as how they’re 
scored. (Here’s a hint: You really only need to review the 
section for the test you’re taking. How’s that for speed 
reading?)
Next, we introduce you to the nitty-gritty details of taking 
a Catholic high school entrance exam, including register-
ing and requesting testing accommodations if you need 
them. We also share helpful tips for achieving a stellar 
score, organizing your time, and relaxing if you get ner-
vous. Do yourself a favor and spend the 20 or so minutes 
it takes to read through these two informative chapters. 
You won’t regret it!

Chapter 1
Getting to Know You: Meet the HSPT, 
TACHS, and COOP
In This Chapter

▶ Familiarizing yourself with the format and scoring of the HSPT, TACHS, and COOP
I
f you’re planning to attend a Catholic high school, you need to be prepared to pass a 
special entrance exam. Just what is a Catholic high school entrance exam? And why on 
earth do you have to take one aside from the fact that most Catholic high schools require 
it? We enlighten you on that and more in this chapter. Prepare to discover why Catholic 
high schools want you to take an entrance exam, how they use your scores, and what the 
particular exam you’re facing looks like.
Understanding How Schools Use Your Score
What a Catholic high school does with your entrance exam score really depends on the poli-
cies of that particular school. Many schools consider the exam a way to weed out appli-
cants for the incoming freshman class, but some schools also use your score to determine 
what classes you should be placed in and whether you deserve a scholarship. The following 
sections delve into these uses of Catholic high school entrance exams in greater detail.
The entrance exam as an admissions requirement
Before you apply to any Catholic high school, you and your parents should research its 
admissions requirements. You can usually find the most up-to-date information by browsing 
the high school’s Web site or by calling the admissions office or school official in charge of 
admissions. Read the admissions requirements carefully to find out what entrance exam the 
high school requires and how the school uses your score. Note: Most Catholic high schools 
require an entrance exam for new freshmen only; transfer students are usually exempt.
Here are some of the degrees to which Catholic high schools may consider your entrance 
exam for admissions purposes:
 
✓ Some actually don’t consider your entrance exam score at all. (They do, however, use 
it as a placement tool for honors classes; see the next section.)
 
✓ Some may consider your entrance exam score with the same weight as they do your 
sixth-, seventh-, and eighth-grade report cards.
 
✓ Other schools put more emphasis on your previous grade point average but do use 
your entrance exam score for additional admissions consideration (along with letters 
of recommendation and lists of extracurricular activities).

8
Part I: Providing Perspective on Catholic High School Entrance Exams 
Most Catholic high schools require more than just your entrance exam score and grade 
records from the previous three years. Depending on the school, you may also have to 
submit letters of recommendation, write an essay (some schools even ask your parents to 
write an essay, too), and participate in an interview. So, there’s a good chance your 
entrance exam score is just one of several admissions requirements you must fulfill to be 
considered.
 
Find out how your high school of choice evaluates your entrance exam score by calling the 
admissions office. Knowing just what’s at stake when you walk into the exam is always a 
good idea.
The entrance exam as a placement tool
Some Catholic high schools actually use your entrance exam score to figure out what 
classes to place you in during your freshman year. For instance, your score may indicate 
that you’re qualified to take honors courses, such as an advanced math class, or it may let 
the school’s faculty know that you should stick with basic algebra to start.
The number of Advanced Placement (AP) or honors classes you take in high school may 
influence your chances of being accepted to certain colleges. Some colleges give you college 
credit as a result of your successful completion of AP courses and AP exams, which means 
qualifying for and taking AP courses could lessen your college course load and tuition pay-
ments down the road. So, scoring your best on your Catholic high school entrance exam 
can result in big-time future benefits. (See Chapter 2 for tips on how to maximize your 
entrance exam score.)
The entrance exam as a source of scholarships
Your entrance exam score may also make you eligible for scholarship money, which no 
doubt would make your parents happy. This extra help toward tuition can be based on your 
overall score or on how well you do in a specific test section. Perhaps a generous donor 
who has made a fortune in selling top-of-the-line hole punches has allocated funds designed 
specifically for freshmen who excel at figuring out those clever holes-in-the-folded-paper 
questions on the TACHS. Hey, it could happen!
Covering Most of the Country: The HSPT
HSPT stands for High School Placement Test. The exam is produced by the Scholastic 
Testing Service and is designed for eighth-graders interested in attending a Catholic high 
school practically anywhere in the country (the New York City area and parts of New Jersey 
have their own tests, as you find out later in this chapter). The individual high schools that 
require the HSPT have a lot of control over when it’s given, but the test is often held on a 
Saturday in early December. Usually, you take the test at the high school you’re applying to. 
(Note: If you’re considering more than one school, it’s best to take the test at the high 
school you like the most.) Whether you’re charged a fee to take the exam is up to the high 
school that administers it. Contact the school official in charge of admissions to get more 
information on fees and other exam administration policies.
The sections that follow introduce you to the ins and outs of the HSPT, from format to 
scoring.

 Chapter 1: Getting to Know You: Meet the HSPT, TACHS, and COOP
Figuring out the format of the HSPT
The HSPT has nearly 300 multiple-choice questions that you’re expected to answer in just 
over two hours. The questions are numbered from 1 to 298, which is nice because you’ll 
never see a question with the same number as one in a different section. To see what a full-
length HSPT test looks like, check out the two practice tests in Chapters 17 and 19.
The content of the HSPT is broken down into five sections called Verbal Skills, Quantitative Skills, 
Reading, Mathematics, and Language. The different sections have roughly 60 questions each, 
but the time allotted for each section varies. Except for a few questions in the Verbal Skills and 
Mathematics sections, each question has four answer choices designated (A), (B), (C), and (D).
 
Even though we’re pretty sure the question types won’t change from HSPT to HSPT, make 
sure you read the directions for each section just to be safe.
 The creators of the HSPT have also made available to Catholic high schools three optional 
multiple-choice tests in the specific areas of Catholic religion, mechanical aptitude, and sci-
ence. High schools choose whether to require one of these tests in addition to the HSPT, and 
only a few use them. To find out whether you have to take one of the optional exams, contact 
the official who’s in charge of admissions at the school where you plan to take the HSPT.
The Verbal Skills section
The HSPT’s Verbal Skills section contains 60 questions that you must answer in 16 minutes. 
If you just did the math on that one, you realize that you have about 15 seconds to answer 
each question. Relax! That should be enough time because you don’t have to do a bunch of 
reading to answer these questions. Here’s what you find in the Verbal Skills section:
 
✓ Synonyms and antonyms: These questions give you a word and ask you to choose the 
answer that’s either most similar to it or most opposite. We explain how to answer syn-
onym and antonym questions in Chapter 3.
 
✓ Grouping words questions: Expect to see two question types that ask you to categorize 
words. One type is the analogy question, which we cover in Chapter 4; the other is the type 
that asks you to find the word that doesn’t belong, which we cover in Chapters 3 and 8.
 
✓ Verbal reasoning: This question type gives you some statements as well as a conclu-
sion based on those statements. You have to determine whether the conclusion is true, 
false, or uncertain, which means there are only three answer choices. We show you 
how to answer these babies in Chapter 8.
The Quantitative Skills section
The Quantitative Skills section features 52 questions that ask you to complete a sequence, 
compare values, and create equations. You have 30 minutes to answer all the questions, 
which means you should spend no more than about 30 seconds per question. Three kinds 
of questions appear in this section:
 
✓ Sequence questions: The HSPT gives you a sequence of numbers and tells you to find 
the answer that completes the missing number or numbers in the sequence. Flip to 
Chapter 14 for help answering these questions.
 
✓ Comparing values: These questions give you three values and ask you to figure out 
their relationship. One may be greater than another, or they may all be equal. You 
choose the answer that describes the correct relationship. See Chapter 15 for insight 
into how to answer these questions.
 
✓ Creating equations: This question type expresses a quantity in words. Your mission is 
to translate the problem into an equation and solve it. You can find the mathematical 
equivalents to words in Chapter 13.

10
Part I: Providing Perspective on Catholic High School Entrance Exams 
The Reading section
The HSPT’s Reading section provides you with 62 questions to answer in 25 minutes, which 
gives you less than 30 seconds per question. Approximately 40 of the questions are based 
on a series of about five or six reading passages. The remaining questions are more vocabu-
lary questions. To discover how to answer reading comprehension questions, head to 
Chapter 5. You can improve your performance on vocabulary questions with the pointers in 
Chapter 3.
 
Because reading comprehension questions take more time to answer than vocabulary ques-
tions, you may want to jump ahead and answer the vocabulary questions at the end of the 
Reading section before you answer the reading comprehension questions. Just make sure 
you mark the answers in the proper places on your answer sheet!
The Mathematics section
The Mathematics section is broken down into two subsections: Concepts (with 24 ques-
tions) and Problem Solving (with 40 questions). The problem-solving questions are mostly 
word problems (which you can find out more about in Chapter 13). To improve your score 
in both sections, be sure to review Chapters 10, 11, and 12.
The Language section
The 25 minutes the HSPT gives you to complete the Language section should be sufficient 
to answer all 60 questions. Those 60 questions are broken down into 50 questions that ask 
you to find errors in punctuation, capitalization, usage, and spelling and 10 questions that 
test your knowledge of sentence construction and written composition. Help for how to rec-
ognize punctuation and spelling errors lies in Chapter 6. Chapter 7 offers a refresher on 
basic grammar, and Chapter 5 helps you figure out how to answer written composition 
questions.
Scoring the HSPT
The Scholastic Testing Service (STS) computes how many questions you answer correctly 
on your HSPT and converts that score to a scaled score that ranges anywhere from 200 to 
800. (Yes, you get 200 points just for taking the test. How awesome is that?) The STS then 
compares you to all the other HSPT test-takers and gives the high school you’re applying to 
a report that shows where you rank both nationally and locally. From there it’s up to the 
high school to figure out what to do with that information. If you have questions, talk to the 
admissions office at your high school of choice. And if you want to find out your HSPT 
score, ask the school about that as well, but be prepared for it to pass on sharing your 
score with you.
HSPT-takers beware: The optional essay
Some Catholic high schools like to see how you write 
without outside help from parents, siblings, teachers, 
or your best friend’s cousin. So on test day they may 
ask you to write an essay before taking the HSPT. The 
topic will be fairly general, along the lines of “Why do 
you want to attend our school?” Ask a school official in 
charge of administering the HSPT whether or not you’re 
expected to write an essay. If the answer is yes, prepare 
ahead of time by coming up with three reasons that you 
want to attend that particular high school, such as the 
school athletic program, its academic reputation, acting 
opportunities, or other areas that interest you. Just make 
sure your answer doesn’t include the phrase “because 
my parents are forcing me” and take care to spell the 
name of the school correctly.

 Chapter 1: Getting to Know You: Meet the HSPT, TACHS, and COOP
For New Yorkers Only: The TACHS
The TACHS is more formally known as the Test for Admission into Catholic High Schools, 
and it’s exclusively required of eighth-graders who want to go to Catholic high schools in 
the Diocese of Brooklyn/Queens and the Archdiocese of New York. It’s usually given on a 
November morning at Catholic high schools in the New York City area.
When you sign up for the TACHS, you have to pay an examination fee (which is currently 
$49, although that can change), which includes the registration materials, a student hand-
book, test materials, and score reports to three high schools of your choice and the 
Catholic elementary school you attend (or your home if you don’t go to a Catholic elemen-
tary school). The TACHS has a very informative Web site (www.tachsinfo.com) where 
you can download a handbook and see a sample practice test. Or you can just head to 
Chapters 21 and 23 for the two TACHS practice tests you already have right here in your hot 
little hands.
Following is some information on the format of the TACHS’s various sections and how the 
exam is scored.
Deciphering the format of the TACHS
The TACHS varies a bit from year to year, but generally it contains around 200 multiple-
choice questions. Plan for a total testing time of around three or four hours, including the 
time it takes for you to fill in the preliminary test sections and for the proctor to explain the 
directions. The odd-numbered questions designate the answers as (A), (B), (C), and (D), 
and the even-numbered questions mark the answer choices as (J), (K), (L), and (M). Each 
section of the test begins with question number 1, so make sure you’re marking your 
answers on the right section of your answer sheet.
Most of the four sections of the TACHS break down into subcategories. The Reading section 
has subsections on vocabulary and comprehension. The Language section has one part for 
spotting errors in usage and mechanics and another for testing your knowledge of written 
composition. The Math section features standard math problems and an entire section dedi-
cated to estimating. Finally, the unusual questions in the Ability section test your reasoning 
skills. The creators of the TACHS change the test’s format a little bit every year, so the 
number of questions of each type vary.
The Reading section
The approximately 10 to 20 vocabulary questions in the TACHS’s Reading section are mere 
synonym questions (find out more about these in Chapter 3). You have about 5 to 10 min-
utes to answer them all. Standard reading comprehension passages and questions make up 
the rest of this section. Expect to encounter around 20 to 30 questions based on several 
passages and have about 25 minutes to answer them. (We cover how to answer reading 
comprehension questions in Chapter 5.)
The Language section
To study for the approximately 40 capitalization, spelling, punctuation, and usage questions 
in the Language section, read Chapters 6 and 7. Assistance for the remaining 10 questions 
(which, by the way, deal with written composition) can be found in Chapter 5. The TACHS 
gives you about 23 minutes to spot the errors and around 7 minutes to correct the sentence 
composition.

The first 30 questions or so in the TACHS’s Math section ask you standard math questions 
about numbers, basic operations, charts and graphs, and problem solving. The remaining 
questions (approximately 18) ask you only to estimate the answers to simple math prob-
lems. Brushing up on your math by reading Chapters 10, 11, 12, and 13 will help you fly 
through this section in the approximately 40 minutes you’re given.
The Ability section
The TACHS presents you with a few question types you may not have seen before. 
Depending on the whims of the test-makers, the TACHS’s Ability section features about 10 
to 30 questions that you must answer in roughly 5 to 15 minutes. The majority of them have 
you evaluate the similarities and differences in shapes and figures. Reading Chapter 15 on 
quantitative comparisons and Chapter 4 on analogies can help you answer these questions. 
The last approximately 10 questions in this section provide you with pictures of a folded 
piece of paper with holes punched in it. Your charge? To use your powers of reasoning to 
choose the answer choice that displays the proper pattern of holes when the page is 
unfolded. (We share tips for answering this very distinct question type in Chapter 15.)
Scoring the TACHS
The TACHS administrators calculate your score based on how many of the questions you 
answer correctly. They then report your score to up to three high schools of your choosing 
and to your Catholic elementary school if you attend one. If you don’t, they send your 
scores directly to you. Scores are usually sent to the high schools in December, but you 
won’t receive your report until January. From there the high schools can interpret and use 
your score as they see fit. To get more information on how the high school you’re inter-
ested in attending uses your TACHS score, contact its admissions office.
Strictly for the Garden State: The COOP
The COOP exam (or the Cooperative Admissions Examination Program) is administered to 
eighth-graders who want to attend a Catholic high school in New Jersey’s Archdiocese of 
Newark or Diocese of Paterson. The test is usually held in November at participating Catholic 
high schools. The COOP test changes a little bit every year, but the tested concepts remain 
the same. To find out exactly what questions will appear on your exam, visit the helpful COOP 
Web site at coopexam.org. In the summer before the exam date, the COOP powers-that-be 
present a practice test there that gives a sampling of the question types they’ll use that year. 
In the meantime, check out the two practice COOPs we include in Chapters 25 and 27.
The COOP charges an application fee (which is currently $40). It reports your score to up to 
three high schools of your choice in January; it also sends a score report to your Catholic 
elementary school (you’ll receive your report at your home if you’re home-schooled). Want 
to find out more about the COOP’s format and scoring? Check out the following sections.
Walking through the COOP’s format
Though the format varies a little bit, the nearly 200 test questions on the COOP usually have 
four answer choices designated (A), (B), (C), and (D) for odd-numbered questions and (F), 
(G), (H), and (J) for even-numbered ones. The roughly two-and-a-half-hour test covers 
sequences, analogies, quantitative reasoning, verbal reasoning, reading and language arts, 
and mathematics.

 Chapter 1: Getting to Know You: Meet the HSPT, TACHS, and COOP
The Sequences section
The approximately 20 sequence questions in the first section of the COOP involve figures, 
shapes, numbers, and letters. You have about 15 minutes to evaluate the given information 
and find the answer choice that completes the sequence. Chapter 14 gives you tips on how 
to cruise through this section on exam day.
The Analogies section
The 20 analogy questions on the COOP are a little different from some of the others you 
may have seen — they compare pictures rather than words. To find out how to work 
through these questions in the approximately 7 minutes allotted, read through Chapter 4.
The Quantitative Reasoning section
The Quantitative Reasoning section gives you 15 minutes to answer about 20 questions that 
ask you to deal with numbers in unusual ways. Following is a rundown of the question types 
(find out how to answer them in Chapter 15):
 
✓ Finding the quantitative relationship: These questions feature a series of three 
number relationships joined by the same mathematical operation. Your job is to find 
the operation and use it to pick an answer choice that completes the last relationship.
 
✓ Calculating shaded areas: Several questions present you with a shape that has a shaded 
portion. Your must choose the fraction that indicates how much of the shape is shaded.
 
✓ Balancing the scale: This unusual question type tells you what quantity of squares 
equals a certain number of triangles. Based on this information, you have to choose an 
answer that balances the scale.
The Verbal Reasoning sections
A glutton for your punishment, the COOP boasts two Verbal Reasoning sections: One deals 
with word relationships, and the other deals with logic problems. Each section has around 
20 questions for you to answer within 15 minutes. The first Verbal Reasoning section fea-
tures several different question types:
 
✓ Finding the necessary part: These questions give you a word and then ask you to 
choose the answer that’s necessary to the given word. In other words, they want you 
to pick the answer that conveys something that must be present for the given word to 
exist. For instance, a necessary part of the word dentist is teeth. Without teeth, dentists 
wouldn’t exist. See Chapter 8 for more on this question type.
 
✓ Examining series of analogies: You may see a question that gives you two rows of 
words. The words in the top row have a relationship to one another, and the words in 
the bottom row are related similarly. After you’ve figured out the relationship in the 
top row, you must choose the answer that properly completes the analogy in the 
second row. Chapters 4 and 8 can help you with series-of-analogies questions.
 
✓ Eliminating the word that doesn’t belong: Yes, technically you want the word that 
doesn’t fit with the others, but the way to find it is to find the words in the answer 
choices that are alike. Check out Chapter 8 for more on this question type.
 
✓ Choosing the word that does belong: Just when you get comfortable eliminating words 
that don’t belong, the COOP asks you to pick a word that does belong. It gives you three 
words that are similar, and you have to choose the answer that has a similar meaning. 
These are really just fancy synonym questions; head to Chapters 3 and 8 for tips.
The second Verbal Reasoning section requires you to examine a bunch of statements and 
draw the most logical conclusion. Expect to face about 20 of these questions. We show you 
how to pick the best answer (and avoid the wrong ones) in Chapter 8.

Part I: Providing Perspective on Catholic High School Entrance Exams 
The Reading and Language Arts section
The COOP combines reading comprehension questions and questions about proper English 
usage and writing in the same section. The passages you see in this section draw on the 
concepts we review in Chapters 5, 6, and 7 to provide you with a combination of questions 
that test your ability to understand what you read and evaluate sentences for all sorts of 
errors. Luckily, the test gives you about 40 minutes to answer the 40 questions in this sec-
tion, so you have a lot of time to take on this task.
The Mathematics section
You have 35 minutes to complete the approximately 40 questions in the COOP’s 
Mathematics section. The variety of concepts tested in this section spans everything from 
basic operations and inequalities to geometry, charts, and graphs. Make sure you under-
stand what’s covered in Chapters 10, 11, and 12 if you want to ace this section.
Scoring the COOP
The COOP test-makers scale your raw score of total questions answered correctly and con-
vert that scale to a percentage. They then send your report to the three (or fewer) Catholic 
high schools of your choice. The schools get to decide how to interpret and use your score. 
To find out just how your scores will be interpreted and used, contact the high school 
you’re interested in attending.
Introducing the ISEE and SSAT
Not all Catholic high schools require the HSPT, COOP, 
or TACHS. A few may examine your scores on tests 
you’ve already taken in elementary or middle school, 
such as the Iowa Basics or SRA tests, or they may rely 
on other standardized entrance exams, such as the 
ISEE (Independent School Entrance Exam) and SSAT 
(Secondary School Admission Test). Private schools 
generally rely on these two tests for admitting freshmen 
and placing them in classes, but neither test is used 
specifically by Catholic high schools. Some Catholic 
high schools, however, may require you to take one of 
them, or you may wind up deciding to apply to a private 
high school that isn’t Catholic. In either case, you should 
know that both of these exams test concepts that are 
very similar to those found on the HSPT, TACHS, and 
COOP. In fact, preparing for the three tests covered in 
this book gives you an excellent preparation for the ISEE 
and SSAT too.
You’ll see questions on math, reading, verbal reasoning, 
and vocabulary on all five exams, but one of the big dif-
ferences between the ISEE and SSAT and the three tests 
covered in this book is that the ISEE and SSAT require you 
to write an essay. (That makes your Catholic high school 
entrance exam seem lots better all of a sudden, doesn’t 
it?) Another thing you don’t have to worry about that SSAT 
test-takers do is a penalty for a wrong answer. The SSAT 
takes off a quarter of a point for every wrong answer, 
which gives you a whole guessing philosophy to master.
If you need to take one of these other tests, you can 
find out more about it by contacting the high school 
that requires it. The SSAT also has a very informative 
Web site; check it out at www.ssat.org. You can find 
information about the ISEE at www.erbtest.org; 
choose ISEE where it asks you to select the test you 
want to know about.

W
ho in his or her right mind wants to spend an early morning crammed into a class-
room with a bunch of other #2-pencil-wielding, half-awake-and-wanting-to-go-back-
to-bed test-takers? No one, that’s who. But most Catholic high schools won’t admit you if 
you don’t pass an entrance exam, so here you are. You may as well reward yourself with the 
best exam score you can get. This chapter contains the tools you need to pull together a 
winning strategy. You find out how to arrive at the testing site perfectly prepared, eliminate 
wrong answers, manage your time well, avoid a panic attack, and so much more in the fol-
lowing pages. But don’t take our word for it. Dive on in!
Looking at What You Need 
to Do before the Exam
Part of preparing for your Catholic high school entrance exam is knowing how to register 
for the exam, where to take it, and what to bring with you. You can get most of this informa-
tion from the high school you’re applying to, but the next sections give you a general sum-
mary of what you need to know.
Registering for your entrance exam 
and picking a testing site
It’s best not to walk into a testing site without giving officials prior notice that you’re 
coming. This is one party you don’t want to crash because there might not be a seat for you 
if you just walk in. Contact the high school(s) you want to attend to find out what proce-
dures you need to follow to register for the exam.
 Both the TACHS and COOP have online registration options on their official Web sites. You can 
find the TACHS information at www.tachsinfo.com and the COOP forms at coopexam.org. 
You register for the HSPT through the Catholic high school you want to attend.
The TACHS and COOP are usually offered in November each year, and registration is gener-
ally available beginning in September or October. The HSPT test dates are determined by 
the Catholic high schools that administer it. Most give it on the first Saturday in December, 
but some schedule the exam as late as January. Registration usually begins about one or 
two months before the test date.

16
Part I: Providing Perspective on Catholic High School Entrance Exams 
 
The tests are intended to be taken only once, so make sure you’re fully prepared for the 
exam on your scheduled date. Any makeup test dates are for those unable to take an exam 
on its original date — not people who aren’t happy with their original scores.
 
As for where you take the test, most of the exams are offered at the Catholic high schools 
themselves. If you’re considering several high schools that require the HSPT but prefer one 
over the others, we suggest you sign up to take the HSPT at your top choice of high school, 
if possible. Signing up to take an exam at a particular high school is a great way of telling the 
admissions personnel that you really want to go to their school. When they know you’re 
eager to attend, they’re more likely to accept you.
When you register for either the COOP or the TACHS, you get to choose where you want to 
take your exam (the location isn’t necessarily related to what high school you want to 
attend). You also get to pick which schools you want your scores sent to. Both tests let you 
choose up to three schools.
Deciding what to bring to the exam 
 (and what to leave at home)
Regardless of where you take your Catholic high school entrance exam, you need to bring 
certain items with you (and leave other items at home!).
 
The absolute essentials to bring with you to the exam are
 
✓ Your registration confirmation: When you register for the exam, you’ll receive an 
admissions ticket or other form of confirmation receipt. Have it on you on test day 
because you may be asked to prove that you’re registered for the exam.
 
✓ A form of identification: You may also have to prove that you’re really you and not 
your neighbor with the borderline genius IQ and current Teen Jeopardy! champion 
status coming in to take the test for you. Here are the kinds of acceptable IDs (double-
check with the school to make sure your ID is what it wants to see):
 
• A government or state-issued identification card
 
• A school identification card
 
• A valid passport
 
• A library card
 
✓ A bunch of new and sharpened #2 pencils with good erasers: Make sure they’re #2s 
and that you have a few of them. Most importantly, the erasers on the end should be 
new and not the kind that create more marks than they eliminate (you know the kind 
we’re talking about). Mechanical pencils (even if they contain #2 lead) aren’t tradition-
ally allowed for use on the entrance exams, so make sure the pencils you take with you 
are the kind that have to be sharpened.
 
Don’t even think about bringing one of the following items with you on test day; just leave 
’em at home:
 
✓ Cellphones, calculators, watches that contain calculators, or MP3 players: Any elec-
tronic device is taboo at the testing site. Leave them at home, or else you may be asked 
to leave yourself.
 
 Watches of any kind aren’t allowed on the TACHS, so leave your watch at home if 
you’re taking this test. The COOP allows watches if they don’t have built-in calculators 
or computers. The high schools that give the HSPT make determinations about whether 
or not watches are allowed, so contact the high school administrator in charge of 
admissions if you want to know whether you can have a watch at your HSPT site.

17
 Chapter 2: Executing a Plan for Success
 
✓ Scratch paper: You aren’t allowed to take in paper of any kind. You can, however, write 
anything you want in your test booklet. If a test administrator allows you to use scratch 
paper during the test, he or she will give it to you.
 
✓ Highlighters, pens, or protractors: Any kind of writing utensil or mechanical device 
other than your lucky #2 pencil is a no-go.
 
✓ Books: Even if you think you’ll have time to read between test sections, you won’t. You 
can’t have a book with you. Period.
Requesting accommodations
Pretty much the only testing accommodation that the Catholic high school entrance exams 
make for students with documented learning differences is extended testing time. If you 
have an Individualized Education Program (IEP) or other documentation that shows that 
you require extra test-taking time, you can fill out an eligibility form to request accommoda-
tion. The test administrators need these eligibility forms before the regular registration 
forms, though, so get them in early. More information is available from the TACHS and COOP 
Web sites (see the earlier “Registering for your entrance exam and picking a testing site” 
 section for the addresses) or from the individual high schools if you’re taking the HSPT.
 The nitty-gritty details regarding the administration of the HSPT are determined by the par-
ticular high school that requires it. Always contact the school administrator in charge of 
admissions to find out about exam specifics such as test dates, registration procedures, and 
items to bring with you and leave at home.
Maximizing Your Score on Test Day
You’ll feel better on test day (and score better too) if you have a plan and stick to it. Your 
pretest plan should include studying the concepts and practice tests in this book, laying out 
all the stuff you need for the test the night before you take it, getting a good night’s sleep, 
eating a breakfast with a balance of carbohydrates and protein for energy and sustenance, 
and arriving at the testing site with plenty of time to check in and get settled. Of course, 
your plan should also include strategies for tackling the test itself on exam day. The follow-
ing sections present you with several key strategies for carrying out a plan during the test 
to achieve the best possible score on your Catholic high school entrance exam.
 
Before you start answering exam questions, the test administrator will go over testing proce-
dures and walk you through completing the preliminary sections of the test (those parts that 
ask you to fill in your complete name and address so that they know the test is yours). Be 
sure to listen carefully and ask questions before the exam begins. When the clock starts run-
ning, you need to devote all of your attention to finishing the whole test in the time allotted.
Answer every question
To get the best score possible, you must provide one answer (and only one answer) for each 
question in every section. You can’t get credit for a question if you don’t answer it, and if you 
don’t answer all the questions, you miss the points you receive just by being lucky.
 
None of the entrance exams penalizes you for wrong answers. Your raw score is just the 
total number of questions you answer correctly. You don’t lose any points or a fraction of 
points for questions you answer incorrectly. So, never ever leave an answer bubble blank 
on your answer sheet and mark only one answer per question.

18
Part I: Providing Perspective on Catholic High School Entrance Exams 
 
 
If you notice that you have only three or four minutes remaining in a section and more than 
five questions left, spend the remaining minutes marking an answer for every question — 
even if you don’t have time to read them. For questions with four answer-choice possibili-
ties, you have a 25 percent chance of randomly guessing the correct answer (which is way 
better than not answering the question at all).
 
If you have to guess randomly at the end of a section, mark the same bubble for each 
answer. Marking the same bubble saves you time because you don’t need to choose which 
answer to mark for each question.
Manage your answer sheet
The answer sheets for the Catholic high school entrance exams, like those for most stan-
dardized tests, have a series of bubbles for each of the answer choices in the test booklet. 
The questions on the HSPT answer sheet are numbered from 1 to 298, but the TACHS and 
COOP start again with 1 for each new test section. When you mark the answer to Question 
12 in the TACHS Reading section, be careful that you do so in the Reading section of the 
answer sheet and not in the Mathematics section.
 
One handy way to keep track of your answers is to move them from your test booklet to 
your answer sheet in chunks of five. After you’ve determined the answer to a question, 
circle the answer in the booklet and move on to the next question. When you’ve answered 
five questions, take a few seconds to transfer those answers to your answer sheet, making 
sure to mark the answer in the appropriate bubble for that question.
Before the proctor calls out the end of time on a section, check your answer sheet for the 
following issues:
 
✓ Your answer sheet shouldn’t contain any stray marks; erase any that you see.
 
✓ Only one bubble should be filled in per question, and it should be filled in completely.
 
✓ The answers should correspond with the proper questions.
If you discover that you’ve been marking answers in the wrong places, go up and talk to the 
test administrator about it at the end of the test. Sometimes he or she will give you time to 
correct the problem. The best way to avoid this unfortunate occurrence, though, is to mark 
your answers carefully from the start.
Take advantage of extra time
You may finish a section or two before the time is up. Instead of using this time to investi-
gate the ceiling pattern or practice balancing pencils on the side of your desk, use it to return 
to questions in that section that you aren’t sure you answered correctly on the first try.
 
You can’t use extra time at the end of a section to return to questions in an earlier section. 
Stick to the section you’re in, or else you could be asked to leave the testing site and may 
have your test score canceled.
 
Following is a simple system you can use to help you organize your test booklet so you 
know which questions are most worthy of reexamination if you have some extra time at the 
end of a section:
 
1. Read the question quickly but thoroughly.
 
2. Examine each answer choice (again, quickly but thoroughly).

19
 Chapter 2: Executing a Plan for Success
 
3. Use your pencil to cross out answer choices that are obviously incorrect.
 
 See the next section for great tips on eliminating incorrect answer choices.
 
4. If you can eliminate three answer choices (and, therefore, know the correct answer), 
transfer that choice to your answer sheet.
 
 Mark a big X next to the question in your test booklet and go on to the next one.
 
5. If you can eliminate at least two of four answer choices, choose one of the remaining 
answer choices and fill in its bubble on the answer sheet.
 
 Put a big 2 next to this question in your test booklet and move along.
 
6. If you can eliminate only one of the four answer choices, choose one of the remain-
ing answer choices and fill in its bubble on the answer sheet.
 
 Write a large 3 next to the question and keep going.
 
7. If you can’t cross out any of the four answer choices, choose one of the answer 
choices and fill in its bubble on the answer sheet.
 
 Write a large 4 by the question and go on to the next one.
 
8. If you finish before the proctor calls time, first look at the questions with 2s by them, 
then those with 3s, and, only as a last resort and if you have lots of time, the 4s.
 
9. Change the answer you previously marked if you’re pretty sure another answer is 
better.
Try out this technique on the practice tests in Part IV. We bet you’ll be glad you did!
Eliminate incorrect answer choices
Drawing a big fat line through the wrong answers in your test booklet is perhaps the biggest 
favor you can do for yourself when you want to achieve a stellar exam score. The next sec-
tions explain the value of tossing wrong answer choices aside and give you a strategy for 
figuring out when an answer is incorrect.
Getting the lead out
Concerned that crossing out wrong answers actually wastes what little time you have? Bah! 
You can push your pencil through a line of text in less than a second. And if you’re worried 
about your pencil supply, take a bunch of them with you to the test. Here’s why using your 
#2 pencil to cross out wrong answers is a good idea:
 
✓ You don’t waste time rereading an incorrect answer choice.
 
✓ Crossing out answers gives you a psychological boost because when you look at the 
question, you see one or two possible answers rather than four.
Why doubling back is beneficial
Studies have shown that test-takers who reconsider 
their answers to previously answered questions and 
decide to change them often improve their scores. Two 
of the main reasons for this are that
 ✓ Your brain may be working on the question sub-
consciously while you’re answering subsequent 
questions.
 ✓ Sometimes information you receive in later ques-
tions helps you answer questions you had trouble 
answering earlier.

20
Part I: Providing Perspective on Catholic High School Entrance Exams 
 
If crossing out answer choices doesn’t come naturally to you, practice at home. Use the 
practice tests in Part IV to not only practice your approach to the question types but also to 
train yourself to mark up your question booklet.
Knowing what to cross out
 
Some answers are obviously incorrect, but others aren’t. By applying these techniques, you 
can more easily recognize incorrect answers and cross ’em out:
 
✓ Use common sense. Answer choices that don’t make sense can’t possibly be right; elim-
inate them. For instance, if the HSPT asks you how many marbles Derek has if he began 
with 50 and lost 20 of them to Jennifer, you can immediately eliminate an answer choice 
of 50 because Derek wouldn’t end up with the same number of marbles he started with.
 
✓ Rely on what you know. Use simple stuff you know to narrow your choices. For exam-
ple, if a math question asks for an absolute value, you know you can eliminate any neg-
ative answer choices because absolute values are positive. If you’re looking for the 
answer to a reading comprehension question that asks for a passage’s main point, you 
know you can eliminate answers that contain information that isn’t discussed in the 
passage.
 
✓ Avoid choices with debatable words. Weed out answer choices by crossing out ones 
that contain debatable words, which are words that leave no room for exception. Some 
examples of debatable words are all, always, only, completely, never, must, every, and 
none. Unless a reading comprehension passage or question gives you a really good 
reason to choose an answer with such words, eliminate it.
 
 Don’t avoid choices with debatable words without thinking, though. If a question asks 
you to choose an answer that is not true, a choice that contains a debatable word may 
be your clue to the correct answer.
 
✓ Pick the more specific choice. When you’ve narrowed your choices down to two and 
can’t decide between them, the one that’s more specific is usually the best answer. 
(Note: The opposite is true when you’re picking among three or more options. In 
this case, going with an answer just because it’s the most specific answer isn’t a good 
strategy.)
Manage your time wisely
Each of the Catholic high school entrance exams has roughly 200 to 300 questions for you 
to answer. On average, depending on the question type, you have about 30 to 60 seconds to 
answer each question. Now, before you panic, go grab a watch with a second hand. Take a 
deep breath and hold it for 30 seconds. Unless you’re an underwater distance swimmer or a 
tuba player, you probably have a tough time holding your breath that long. A half a minute 
seems like forever now, huh?
 
Keep track of your timing while taking your test, but don’t continually waste precious sec-
onds glancing at the clock. Instead, check your progress as you go. In a section that has 60 
questions, check your time every 20 questions or so. Depending on the section, you should 
be about 20 minutes into the exam when you hit Question 20. At Question 40, you should be 
about 40 minutes into the test.
If at any time you find yourself to be way off pace, say by five or more questions in either 
direction, you need to make adjustments.
 
✓ If you’re behind, you’re probably spending too much time on hard questions. Recall 
that an easy question and a hard one are both worth one point. Don’t spend so much 
time on hard questions that you don’t have time to answer the easy ones.
 
✓ If you’re ahead, you may be moving through questions too quickly at the risk of read-
ing carelessly. Slow down a little and read each question thoroughly.

21
 Chapter 2: Executing a Plan for Success
You’re much less likely to find yourself in either of these situations if you practice time man-
agement when you take the practice tests in Part IV.
Calm your nerves
Repeat this to yourself: I will be prepared for whatever the Catholic high school entrance 
exam dishes out, and I will score well. Sure, you may feel nervous on test day, but that feel-
ing is normal. Heck, it’s even a little beneficial. The extra shot of adrenaline keeps you alert. 
However, too much anxiety isn’t good for you or your test performance. One important way 
to make sure you’re relaxed and ready before the test begins is to get to the testing site a 
little early so you have time to get settled and comfortable.
To avoid becoming paralyzed by a frustrating question during the test, we suggest you 
develop and practice a relaxation plan. At the first sign of panic, take a quick time out. 
You’ll either calm down enough to handle the question, or you’ll get enough perspective to 
realize that it’s just one little test question and not worth your anguish. Mark your best 
guess and move on. If you have time, you can revisit the question later. The sections that 
follow give you some additional practical ways you can combat anxiety.
 
Practice a quick relaxation routine in the days before you take the exam so that when you 
feel panicky on test day you know just what to do to calm your nerves.
Inhale deeply
Stressing out causes you to tighten up and take quick breaths, which doesn’t do much for 
your oxygen intake. Restore the steady flow of oxygen to your brain by inhaling deeply. Feel 
the air go all the way down to your toes. Hold it and then let it all out slowly. Repeat this 
process again several times.
Stretch a little
Anxiety causes your muscles to get all tied up in knots. Combat its evil effects by focusing 
on reducing your muscle tension while breathing deeply. If you feel stress in your neck and 
shoulders, also do a few stretches in these areas to get the blood flowing.
The following quick stretches are quite soothing and should take you ten seconds tops:
 
✓ Shrug your shoulders toward your ears; hold this position for a few seconds and then 
release.
 
✓ Roll your head slowly in a circle.
 
✓ With your hands together, stretch your arms straight over your head as high as you 
can. Relax and then repeat.
 
✓ Stretch your legs out in front of you and move your ankles up and down (but don’t kick 
the person in front of you!).
 
✓ Shake your hands vigorously as if you just washed your hands in a public restroom 
that’s out of paper towels.
 
✓ Open your mouth wide as if to say “Ahhh.” (But don’t actually say it out loud.)
Think positive thoughts
 
Your Catholic high school entrance exam isn’t the end-all, be-all of your life. Cut yourself some 
slack during test day. You probably won’t feel comfortable about every question, so don’t beat 
yourself up when you feel confused. If you’ve tried other relaxation efforts and you still feel 
frustrated about a particular question, fill in your best guess and mark the question in your test 
booklet in case you have time to review it at the end, but don’t think about it until then. Put your 
full effort into answering the remaining questions. Focus on the positive, congratulate yourself 
for the answers you feel confident about, and force yourself to leave the others behind.

Part I: Providing Perspective on Catholic High School Entrance Exams 
 
Catholic saints to call on for help
Reviewing math concepts, vocabulary, and usage 
rules, as well as practicing with sample test questions, 
prepares you amply for taking a Catholic high school 
entrance exam, but enlisting the help of those saints 
who have a special interest in your situation certainly 
can’t hurt. Following is a list of several Catholic saints to 
appeal to as you prepare for and take your exam:
 ✓ St. Thomas Aquinas: A great teacher in the medieval 
Catholic Church, St. Thomas Aquinas saw reason 
as a divine gift, and the ability to reason gets you 
through all question types, especially those nasty 
verbal reasoning ones. As the patron saint of stu-
dents and Catholic schools, St. Thomas Aquinas 
may provide guidance throughout the process of 
deciding which Catholic high school to attend.
 ✓ St. Ambrose: If you have difficulty nailing down a 
concept, request assistance from the patron saint of 
learning, St. Ambrose, who was dedicated to gain-
ing knowledge from many sources.
 ✓ St. Catherine of Alexandria: A woman with incred-
ible wisdom and debating skills, St. Catherine of 
Alexandria is the patron saint of students.
 ✓ St. Francis de Sales: For assistance with written 
composition questions, call on St. Frances de Sales, 
who was a prolific writer and just so happens to be 
the patron saint of writers.
 ✓ St. Teresa of Avila: If all of your studying and test-
taking result in justifiable pain, seek relief from St. 
Teresa of Avila, the patron saint of headaches.
Take a little vacation
Create a place in your imagination that makes you feel calm and comfortable. Maybe 
you like the beach. Or perhaps a ski slope. Wherever your relaxation zone, sit back in 
your chair, close your eyes, and visit your happy place for a few seconds when you’re 
really tense about a particular question. Just make sure you come back to reality!

ocabulary, synonyms and antonyms, analogies, punc-
tuation, capitalization, usage, reading comprehen-
sion, written composition, and verbal reasoning. You face 
a combination of most (or all!) of these question types on 
your upcoming Catholic high school entrance exam. Never 
fear, though. In this part, we show you how to excel on all 
of these question types.
Chapter 3 helps you broaden your vocabulary. Chapter 4 
offers insight into analogies. Chapter 5 prepares you for 
reading comprehension questions that rely solely on what 
you read in the related passage and written composition 
questions that test your knowledge of how sentences 
should be structured. Chapter 6 helps you brush up on 
your spelling and mechanics, and Chapter 7 serves as your 
refresher of basic grammar rules. Chapter 8 introduces 
you to the kinds of verbal reasoning questions that appear 
on the HSPT and COOP. Last, but certainly not least, 
Chapter 9 gives you the opportunity to put all of this 
knowledge together to solve a variety of verbal practice 
questions.

Synonyms, and Antonyms

▶ Pumping up your mental word bank
▶ Acing synonym questions
▶ Outsmarting antonym questions
W
hen you sit down to take your entrance exam, you’ll suddenly realize why all the 
grown-ups in your life keep nagging you to work on your vocabulary. Words that 
you never knew existed are bound to show up on the test in one way or another. All three 
Catholic high school entrance exams give you an opportunity to show off your vocabulary. 
They may ask you to find an answer that means the same thing as a particular word (a syn-
onym), or they may want you to come up with a word that has the opposite meaning (an 
antonym).
Regardless of whether you’re looking for a synonym or an antonym, your level of success 
depends on how well you know the meaning of the word you have to duplicate or the words 
in the answer choices. But you knew that already! Sometimes a word’s meaning is obvious. 
Other times you may wonder whether the word is even English. You probably don’t need a 
bunch of help answering vocabulary questions about the words you know, so this chapter 
concentrates on how to answer questions about vocabulary that’s not so familiar.
 The HSPT and TACHS test your vocabulary directly with questions that come right out and 
ask you to choose a synonym or antonym. The COOP sneaks a little vocabulary into its 
Verbal Reasoning section, which we cover in more detail in Chapter 8.
Improving Your Vocabulary
The more you expose yourself to new words, the better you’ll do on vocabulary questions 
(and the more intelligent you’ll sound). Don’t worry. We’re not suggesting you should mem-
orize the dictionary. That’s simply not practical. Besides, you have better things to do with 
your time. Instead, we show you how to play around with mysterious words in order to 
glean as much information about them as you can. (In case you’re wondering, glean means 
“to pick up or gather.”)
 
Whenever you encounter an unfamiliar word, look it up. If you’re social networking on your 
computer (and we bet you are) and you come across a word you don’t know, use an online 
dictionary to discover what it means. Doing so takes about a minute. Keep a list of words 
and their definitions, and you’ll be surprised at how many stick with you.

26
Part II: Vanquishing the Verbal Questions 
Noticing parts of speech
Sometimes the same word has a different meaning depending on whether it’s used as a noun, 
adjective, or verb (to review the properties of different parts of speech, head to Chapter 7). 
For example, the noun form of the word bark can refer to the tough exterior of a woody stem 
or root (for example, “the bark on a tree”). But this word’s verb form may refer to making the 
sound a dog speaks (for example, “to bark at the mail carrier”). Before you choose an answer 
to a vocabulary question, make sure you know how the word is being used. You can figure 
this out in one of two ways, depending on the kind of question you’re answering:
 
✓ Put the word in context. In other words, note how the term is used in the question. 
Most of the vocabulary questions put the word you must define in a phrase with other 
words so you can more easily tell which part of speech the question wants.
 
✓ Look at the answer choices. Some of the vocabulary questions on the HSPT don’t put 
the word in context. To figure out which part of speech the HSPT is dealing with for 
these questions, look at the answer choices. If all the answer choices are nouns, the 
test is looking for the noun form of the word.
Breaking up unfamiliar words
Vocabulary questions can be difficult if the words are unfamiliar to you, but sometimes you 
can get an idea of what a word means by breaking it up. Remember when you studied pre-
fixes, suffixes, and roots in English class? If not, here’s a refresher: A prefix introduces the 
word, the root conveys the main gist of the word, and the suffix rounds it out. For example, 
undoable is a word with a prefix (un-), a root (do), and a suffix (-able). Un- means “not,” do 
means “perform,” and -able means “having the necessary skill.” Put all that together and you 
realize that undoable means “not having the necessary skill to perform.”
Not all words contain all three parts. And many words don’t have any recognizable prefixes, 
suffixes, or roots at all. Still, getting a little cozy with some of the more common word parts 
may help you understand some words you’ve never seen or even heard of before. Table 3-1 
lists some prefixes, Table 3-2 contains a sampling of common roots, and Table 3-3 supplies 
some suffixes. Tons more exist, but we won’t torture you by listing them all.
 
Strongly consider studying all three tables before exam day. If you can’t tackle them all, 
skimp on the suffixes because they supply the least amount of info about a word.

Say, for instance, your exam gives you this phrase: a tenacious attitude. To choose a word 
that has a similar meaning to tenacious, you probably need to know what tenacious means. 
The word may sound vaguely familiar — perhaps you heard it in class or read it in a book — 
but you’re not certain about its definition. If you remember your root and suffix lists (see 
Tables 3-2 and 3-3), you can analyze tenacious to see that it has a root of ten (which means 
“hold”) and a suffix of -cious (which tells you the word describes a quality). So tenacious 
roughly means “the quality of having a hold on something.” From that rough definition, you 
can conclude that a tenacious attitude is strong, fixed, or determined — it holds tight.
 
Even if you can’t remember the meaning of a bunch of suffixes, roots, and prefixes, you can 
probably get a pretty good idea of what a word means by thinking of other words you know 
that contain the same prefixes, roots, or suffixes. Think of other words that have the root 
ten in them, words such as attend, tension, or tentacle. All of these words give you the 
feeling of strength. Knowing this little bit of information makes it easier for you to find the 
best synonym.
Although it’s a handy trick, you should know that breaking a word into its parts isn’t an 
exact science. It won’t provide you with a precise definition of the word, and not all words 
can be divided into common prefixes, suffixes, and roots. But it does force you to begin 
thinking about words so you can have a plan of action. After all, the more confident and 
relaxed you are during your exam, the more access you’ll have to your personal memory 
bank where you store words you don’t even realize you know.

29
 Chapter 3: Unlocking the Mysteries of Vocabulary, Synonyms, and Antonyms
Scoring Points with Synonyms
Most of the vocabulary questions on the entrance exams ask you to find a word that has a 
similar meaning to the underlined word in a phrase. In other words, they ask you to identify 
the word’s synonym from a list of choices. The HSPT also throws in some other types of syn-
onym questions in its Verbal Skills section. The following sections walk you through the dif-
ferent kinds of synonym questions you may encounter.
Working out the meaning of words in 
context for the TACHS and HSPT
 Vocabulary-in-context questions are a popular way the TACHS and HSPT try to test your 
knowledge of synonyms. These questions give you a word in the context of a short phrase. 
Your task is to
 
1. Figure out the meaning of the underlined word and restate it in your own words.
 
2. Substitute the answer choices for the underlined word and eliminate answers that 
don’t convey the same meaning.
We walk you through these steps in the following vocabulary-in-context question.
 
a bellicose temperament
 
(A) moody
 
(B) hostile
 
(C) loud
 
(D) generous
The underlined word is bellicose, a word you probably don’t use too much in everyday con-
versation. You know it’s an adjective because it’s describing a type of temperament (and 
because all the answer choices are adjectives). Try figuring out what it means by analyzing its 
parts (if you don’t know how to do that, see the earlier “Breaking up unfamiliar words” sec-
tion). The root of the word is bell, which, according to the root list in Table 3-2, means “war.” 
The suffix -ose means “full of,” so you can think of bellicose as roughly meaning “full of war.” 
With this information at your disposal, glance at the answer choices. Choice (D), generous, 
doesn’t relate to being warlike, so you can eliminate it. Moodiness doesn’t relate to war either, 
so cross out Choice (A). Choice (B), hostile, and Choice (C), loud, remain. War is definitely hos-
tile, and it can be loud. Which choice fits best? It makes less sense to describe a temperament 
as loud, and hostile more clearly relates to war than loud does. The best answer is Choice (B).
Handling other types of synonym 
questions on the HSPT
 The HSPT features two special kinds of synonym questions, both of which appear in its 
Verbal Skills section. One comes right out and asks you what a word means; the other asks 
you to find which of the four answer choices doesn’t belong with the others.

30
Part II: Vanquishing the Verbal Questions 
“Most nearly means” questions
When the HSPT asks you what a word most nearly means, think of the word’s definition. 
Then look at the answer choices to see which one comes closest to the meaning you’ve 
thought of. Eliminate any obviously incorrect answers, such as opposites or words that are 
way off the mark. Remember: You’re looking for the best answer of the four choices, not the 
perfect one. Try your hand at this question.
 
Oppressive most nearly means
 
(A) sad
 
(B) burdensome
 
(C) light
 
(D) controversial
You may not know exactly what oppressive means, but you do know that it has the word 
press in it. What image comes to mind with the word press? Push down. Heavy. Hmm. You 
can probably eliminate Choice (C). As an adjective, light means having little weight, so its 
meaning is opposite.
 The HSPT may include an antonym in the list of possible answers. If one of the answer 
options has a different meaning than the others, it just may be the opposite of the word you 
have to define. Watch for this word because it may give you a clue as to the question word’s 
meaning. (Be careful with this strategy, though, because an obvious opposite can’t always 
be found among the answer choices.)
In this example, light is different from the other three answer choices, so it may be the 
opposite of oppressive. You can therefore conclude that oppressive means “heavy.” You may 
be tempted to pick Choice (A), but sad is better related to depressed. Something that’s 
oppressive may make you sad, but sad isn’t the best definition. The word that relates best 
to heavy or pressing is Choice (B), burdensome.
“One of these things is not like the others” questions
Remember when you used to watch Sesame Street and it had that game where one of the 
characters had to choose which object didn’t fit with the others? Some of the HSPT ques-
tions are like that game. These questions ask you to choose which of the four answer 
choices doesn’t belong with the other three. They’re synonym questions because you have 
to eliminate the three words that mean relatively the same thing (the three synonyms) and 
then pick the remaining choice. Following is an example of this type of tricky HSPT problem.
 
Which of these words does not belong with the others?
 
(A) energetic
 
(B) lively
 
(C) leisurely
 
(D) active
The three words with relatively the same meaning are Choice (A), energetic; Choice (B), 
lively; and Choice (D), active. Cross out those choices and pick Choice (C). Leisurely means 
“relaxed and unhurried,” which is the opposite of the pace suggested by the other answers.

31
 Chapter 3: Unlocking the Mysteries of Vocabulary, Synonyms, and Antonyms
Outwitting the Ever-Tricky Antonym
Some of the HSPT’s Verbal Skills questions direct you to pick an antonym, a word with an 
opposite meaning. You approach antonyms pretty much the same way you do synonyms — 
which can make them tricky. When you’re facing an antonym question and you’ve defined 
the question word, make sure you choose an answer that has an opposing meaning rather 
than the same meaning.
 
Here are a few ways to avoid being tricked by antonym questions:
 
✓ Establish the meaning of the question word and then eliminate any answer choices 
that have a similar meaning. So if the question asks for the opposite of right, eliminate 
answer choices such as correct, unmistaken, and so on.
 
✓ After you determine what the question word means, think of a word that’s its oppo-
site and look for an answer choice that’s a synonym of the antonym you’re thinking 
of. For example, if you’re supposed to find the opposite of good, think of its opposite, 
bad. Then look for an answer that means bad.
 
✓ Check every answer choice, even if you think you know the right answer. Another 
answer choice may be a better opposite than the one you first picked.
The best way to show you how to approach antonym questions is by giving you an example.
 
Avoid is the opposite of
 
(A) evade
 
(B) devoid
 
(C) confront
 
(D) solidify
You probably know what avoid means, but we’re going to remind you anyway. It means “to 
stay away from something.” Before you check the answer choices, come up with an ant-
onym for avoid, something like go toward or approach. Now look for an answer that means 
the same thing as going toward. The best synonym for going toward something is Choice (C), 
confront. You may have picked Choice (B) because it has the same root as avoid, but devoid 
means “lacking,” which isn’t the opposite of staying away. Choice (A), evade, is a synonym 
for avoid, and Choice (D) isn’t really related to avoiding something. It’s neither a synonym 
nor an antonym of avoid.

Analyzing Analogy Questions
In This Chapter
▶ Contrasting COOP picture analogies with HSPT word analogies
▶ Seeing how to solve any analogy question
▶ Looking at the six types of relationships you may encounter
C
OOP and HSPT analogy questions test your ability to recognize the relationship 
between things and thoughts by presenting you with three words or images. The first 
two words or images are somehow related. Your job is to find the word or image that dem-
onstrates the same relationship when paired with the third word or image. To accomplish 
this task, you must first figure out the nature of the relationship between the first set of 
words/images. We show you how to do just that in this chapter.
Comparing COOP and HSPT Analogy Questions
 Two of the entrance exams, the COOP and the HSPT, contain analogies, but they present 
them quite differently. The HSPT uses words, and the COOP uses pictures. Even though 
they look different, the analogy questions in both tests require the same approach. They set 
you up with a primary relationship (the relationship between the first two words/images), 
give you a third word or image, and ask you to find the answer that relates to that third ele-
ment in the same way as the primary relationship. The COOP has about 20 analogy ques-
tions, which is twice as many as the HSPT has. The COOP puts its analogies in a completely 
separate section; the HSPT includes them throughout its Verbal Skills section.
Before you can tackle analogies on either test, you need to know what they look like. Here 
are two examples that present the same analogy. The first example shows the way analogies 
appear on the HSPT, and the second gives you a preview of how they look on the COOP.
 
Cat is to yarn as baby is to
 
(A) woman
 
(B) crib
 
(C) knitting needle
 
(D) rattle

34
Part II: Vanquishing the Verbal Questions 
(A)
(B)
(C)
(D)
 Because the COOP relies on drawings rather than words, its analogies must be pretty con-
crete, like the one in the example. The only tricky thing about the COOP analogies is that 
you first have to figure out exactly what the images are picturing. You may initially think a 
picture of a clock represents a clock, but when you examine the relationship, you may dis-
cover that the clock is really intended to represent time. The HSPT version of analogies 
presents easy-to-picture analogies, too, but it also tests more abstract concepts, such as 
impoverishment or ease. What does that mean for you? If you’re taking the HSPT, be pre-
pared to face slightly more complex analogies than you would if you were taking the COOP.
Working Your Way through Analogies
Analogies can be fun if you know what you’re doing. To make sure you enjoy every last one 
of them, follow this tried-and-true approach to tackling any analogy question you may encoun-
ter. (We work through the question from the preceding section to show you how it’s done.)
 
1. Examine the primary relationship and determine what kind of relationship it is.
 
 The primary relationship is the relationship between the first two words or pictures. 
Cats play with yarn, so the primary relationship in the sample question is that the 
second word/image is a toy for the first word/image.
 
2. Create a sentence that links together the two words or images in the primary rela-
tionship and shows how they’re related.
 
 Depending on the words/images, the sentence can be pretty general: A cat plays with 
yarn. Or it can be more specific: The purpose of the rib cage is to protect the lungs.
 
3. Apply the sentence you’ve created to the second relationship and choose the answer 
that best completes the second relationship.
 
 The second relationship is the relationship between the third word/image and the answer 
choices. Plug in the answer choices to see which one fits best. The third word/image in 
the sample question is baby. Which of the answer choices is a toy for a baby? Well, 
babies sleep in cribs, and we certainly hope that babies don’t play with knitting needles! 
Choices (B) and (C) are clearly incorrect. And although a woman may play with a baby, 
her primary purpose isn’t to be a baby’s toy. You can safely eliminate Choice (A). This 
means that the best answer is Choice (D), a rattle, which makes a fine toy for a baby.
 
 If no answer seems to fit, you’ve made your analogy sentence too specific. Go ahead 
and make it more general. If, however, more than one answer works in your sentence, 
the sentence is too general, and you have to make it more specific.

35
 Chapter 4: Analyzing Analogy Questions
 
If you can’t figure out the primary relationship or you don’t know what one of the words means, 
concentrate on the second relationship. See whether the third word/image forms any of the pos-
sible relationship types (covered later in this chapter) with any of the answer choices. Eliminate 
choices that don’t form a logical relationship with the third word/image and make your best 
guess from the remaining answers. (To improve your vocabulary, study the tips in Chapter 3.)
By categorizing the primary relationship and making a sentence, you should have little trou-
ble defeating COOP or HSPT analogies.
Recognizing the Types of Relationships 
Featured in Analogy Questions
Analogies are all about relationships, but how do you know what type of relationship to 
look for out of the hundreds of possibilities? Well, lucky for you both the COOP and the 
HSPT have a staple of six relationship types they commonly test for:
 
✓ Functional
 
✓ Degree
 
✓ Part-of-a-whole
 
✓ Developmental
 
✓ Characteristic
 
✓ Uncharacteristic
 If you’re taking the COOP, expect to see the relationships that deal primarily with nouns, 
(functional, part-of-a-whole, and degree) because these relationships are usually easier to 
illustrate than relationships relying on verbs or adjectives.
The following sections explain how to figure out which relationship type you’re dealing with 
so you can ace every analogy question you face. Don’t worry too much if you can’t classify 
every analogy question you see into one of the six categories. The purpose for giving you 
these possible relationships is simply to help you do better on analogy questions. Neither 
test actually asks you to state the type of relationship an analogy has.
Functional relationships
A functional relationship describes what something (or someone) does, as well as how and 
where that thing or person does it. Some of the sentences you can create for a functional 
relationship are as follows:
 
✓ Something is used to . . . An example of this noun-to-verb relationship is “knife is to 
cut.” A knife is used to cut things.
 
✓ Something or someone uses another thing for . . . An example of this relationship, 
where a noun is associated with a noun, is “lumberjack is to axe.” A lumberjack uses an 
axe to do his or her job. In fact, the axe is an essential part of the lumberjack’s job.
 
✓ Something is used to do something to another thing . . . This is a noun-to-noun rela-
tionship. For instance, “knife is to bread.” A knife is used to cut bread.
 
✓ Something or someone belongs or works in . . . Here’s yet another noun-to-noun rela-
tionship, like “teacher is to classroom” or “bird is to cage.” A teacher works in a class-
room, and a bird belongs in a cage.

36
Part II: Vanquishing the Verbal Questions 
Here’s an example of a COOP analogy question that’s looking for a functional relationship.
 
(A)
(B)
(C)
(D)
The primary relationship in this question is “knife is to bread.” Ask yourself what the rela-
tionship is between a knife and bread. Well, a knife is used to cut bread. Use this sentence 
to figure out the second relationship. The third picture is of a saw. A saw is used to cut 
what? Try the possible answers. Using a saw to cut a piece of bread or a stick of butter is 
overkill. Eliminate Choices (A) and (C), which are there to lure you down the wrong path. 
But you aren’t fooled! You know you’re looking for an answer that completes the relation-
ship, not one that looks similar to one of the words in the primary relationship. Choice (D) 
is another distraction. Saws and hammers are both tools, but that’s not what the primary 
relationship in this question is all about. Only Choice (B), a piece of wood, shows you some-
thing that you use a saw to cut through. Therefore, it’s the best answer.
Degree relationships
A degree relationship shows objects or concepts that are basically similar except that one’s 
bigger, smaller, taller, shorter, older, newer, more intense, less intense, and so on than the 
other. The words in a degree relationship are usually adjectives or abstract nouns, like emo-
tions or thoughts. But sometimes they can be concrete nouns, like boats or houses, that are 
larger or smaller than other similar concrete nouns.
 
The sentences you create for degree relationships can be fairly general. For instance, “Rage 
is a more intense degree of emotion than anger.” Or they can be pretty darn specific: A pair 
of shorts is an item of clothing with two legs that are shorter than the length of the two legs 
in a pair of pants.
Following are two examples of degree analogies. The first one is more abstract and there-
fore in the HSPT format because you can’t show abstract terms using pictures. The second 
one is more concrete and therefore the type of degree analogy you may find on the COOP.
 
Fond is to infatuated as enthusiastic is to
 
(A) fanatical
 
(B) apathetic
 
(C) cautious
 
(D) realistic
To be fond of something is to have a warm feeling toward it. To be infatuated with something 
is to be so fond of it as to be obsessed. Therefore, to be infatuated is to have a much more 
intense feeling of liking than to be fond. Apply this sentence to the third word: To be _____ 
is to have a more intense feeling of excitement than to be enthusiastic. Check out the 
choices to see which one fills in the blank the best.

37
 Chapter 4: Analyzing Analogy Questions
Choice (A), fanatical, means “to be enthusiastic to the point of obsession.” This answer 
seems pretty good. Obsessive enthusiasm is a much more intense feeling than everyday, 
garden-variety enthusiasm. Look over the other choices just to make sure no other word 
conveys overenthusiasm even better. Choice (B) expresses an emotion that’s the opposite 
of enthusiastic, and Choices (C) and (D) have unrelated meanings. They don’t come close to 
showing a more intense degree of enthusiasm. Choice (A) is the best answer.
 
(A)
(B)
(C)
(D)
The primary relationship in this question is “rain is to snow.” What’s the difference between 
a rain shower and a snow shower? The temperature of the precipitation. Snow is colder 
than rain, so you can phrase your sentence this way: A rain shower isn’t as cold as a snow 
shower. The third image is a glass of water. Which of the answers is colder than a glass of 
water? You don’t think of an umbrella or a cloud as being hot or cold, so Choices (A) and 
(C) don’t apply. You’re down to an igloo and a glass of ice, both of which are colder than a 
glass of water. To choose the better answer, try modifying your sentence: A rain shower is 
like a snow shower, but a snow shower is colder. A glass of ice cubes is more like a glass of 
water than an igloo. Choice (D) is the better answer.
Part-of-a-whole relationships
Another relationship you see quite often is the part-of-a-whole relationship. This relationship 
is usually of the noun-to-noun variety and has two types:
 
✓ One thing is an individual unit in a larger whole made up of a bunch of the same 
kind of unit. An example of this type of part-of-a-whole relationship is that a flower is 
part of a bouquet (which is the name for a group of flowers).
 
✓ Something is a specific type of a more general grouping. For instance, you can say 
that rice is a type of grain. Rice is one type of a general classification called grain. 
(Note: You rarely see this type of part-of-a-whole relationship on the COOP because 
general categories [such as grain] are usually too generic to show in pictures.)
The first type of part-of-a-whole relationship is pretty easy to spot, but the second type may 
be a little more difficult. Here’s an example of the second type for your viewing pleasure.
 
Baseball is to sport as biology is to
 
(A) microscope
 
(B) school
 
(C) plant
 
(D) science

38
Part II: Vanquishing the Verbal Questions 
If you don’t examine the primary relationship first, you may be tempted to pick either 
Choice (A) or Choice (B) because a microscope and a plant have something to do with biol-
ogy. But a glance at the primary relationship tells you that you’re looking for a part-of-a-
whole relationship. Baseball is one of many kinds of sports. Biology is one of many kinds of 
sciences. It isn’t a type of school. Choice (D) is your answer.
Developmental relationships
Another type of analogy involves the stages of physical development of someone or some-
thing. This noun-to-noun relationship shows that something grows into another, more 
mature thing. In other words, a developmental relationship shows that something becomes 
another thing through a developmental process. Classic examples of a developmental rela-
tionship are a caterpillar becoming a butterfly and a tadpole becoming a frog.
Developmental relationships work pretty well for the COOP because depicting physical traits with 
pictures is rather easy. Here’s an example of what a COOP-style developmental analogy looks like.
 
(A)
(B)
(C)
(D)
The primary relationship is that between a duckling and a duck. Specifically, the duckling is 
the less mature version of the duck, so your sentence may be that the duckling grows up to 
be a duck. The third image is a kitten. The kitten doesn’t grow up to be a mouse or a dog, so 
Choices (B) and (D) are wrong. Kittens play with yarn, but they don’t become a ball of yarn; 
eliminate Choice (A). If you’ve thought carefully about the primary relationship, then you 
know that the only fitting option is Choice (C), a cat. A kitten grows up to be a cat.
Characteristic relationships
If two words have a characteristic relationship, then one of the words is an essential feature 
of the other. The sentences you create for this noun-to-noun relationship show that some-
thing is a primary feature or characteristic of another thing. The relationship “liar is to dishon-
esty” is an example of a characteristic relationship because a fundamental characteristic of a 
liar is dishonesty. Following is an example of how this type of analogy appears on the HSPT.
 
Shortage is to paucity as surplus is to
 
(A) army
 
(B) abundance
 
(C) knowledge
 
(D) underperformance

39
 Chapter 4: Analyzing Analogy Questions
Figuring out the primary relationship in this question is tough if you’re not familiar with the 
meaning of paucity. So stop and consider what you do know: Paucity is paired with shortage, 
a shortage is a state of scarcity, and a surplus is a state of oversupply. Because Choice (A), 
army, and Choice (C), knowledge, have absolutely nothing to do with scarcity and oversup-
ply, you can safely eliminate them. The remaining answers are Choice (B), abundance, and 
Choice (D), underperformance. You may think you need to know what paucity means in 
order to pick between Choices (B) and (D), but you can use what you know about analogy 
relationships to find the right answer.
The analogy types that might be appropriate in this situation are either degree or character-
istic. A degree relationship would mean that the sentence for the primary relationship 
would be “Shortage is a lesser (or greater) limit of resources than paucity,” which would 
make the sentence for the second relationship “Surplus is a lesser or greater degree of 
resources than _____.” A characteristic relationship would mean that “Paucity is a funda-
mental feature of a shortage” and that “_____ is a fundamental feature of a surplus.” Choice 
(D) doesn’t work for either relationship. Underperformance is neither a lesser nor greater 
degree of resources; it’s not a fundamental feature of a surplus either.
Indeed, paucity means “scarcity,” so a fundamental characteristic of a shortage is paucity, 
and a fundamental characteristic of a surplus is abundance, Choice (B). See? You really can 
figure out the answer even when you don’t know the definition of one of the words in the 
question.
Uncharacteristic relationships
An uncharacteristic relationship is the opposite of a characteristic relationship. It’s expressed 
as not having a particular characteristic. The sentence that results from this type of analogy 
may be “A fundamental characteristic of something is that it is not another thing” or “This 
thing is not something that this other thing would do.” For instance, your exam may present 
you with this primary relationship: exception is to rule.
Consider the relationship between exception and rule. It’s uncharacteristic of an exception 
to go along with a rule. The second relationship will therefore be two nouns that are 
uncharacteristic of each other, something like “conformist is to rebellion.” It’s uncharacter-
istic of a conformist to go along with a rebellion.
Try this example of an HSPT question featuring an uncharacteristic analogy.
 
Sloth is to activity as bee is to
 
(A) importance
 
(B) idleness
 
(C) hive
 
(D) buzz
A sloth is a slow, inactive mammal, so “Activity is uncharacteristic of a sloth.” Apply this 
sentence to the answer choices, substituting each answer for activity and bee for sloth.
 
✓ Importance is uncharacteristic of a bee. Bees aren’t particularly unimportant. In fact, 
their distribution of pollen is pretty crucial to the environment. Choice (A) is wrong.
 
✓ Idleness is uncharacteristic of a bee. We’re guessing you know the expression “busy 
as a bee,” which hints that bees probably aren’t characterized by sitting still. Choice 
(B) has a lot of potential.

40
Part II: Vanquishing the Verbal Questions 
 
✓ Hive is uncharacteristic of a bee. This sentence makes little sense. Bees live in hives, 
so a hive is more characteristic of a bee than not. Eliminate Choice (C).
 
✓ Buzz is uncharacteristic of a bee. Buzzing is what bees do; it also means hum, as in 
“the hive was a buzz of activity.” Like hive, buzz is more beelike than not. Choice (B) 
has to be the right answer because Choice (D) sure isn’t.

Two out of Three “Rs”: Reading and 
Writing Questions
In This Chapter
▶ Examining the ins and outs of reading and writing questions on all three tests
▶ Sharing the process for answering reading comprehension questions accurately
▶ Providing pointers for success on the various written composition questions
A
ll three Catholic high school entrance exams want to know what you know about read-
ing and writing. Consequently, all three contain questions that quiz you on how well 
you comprehend material that you read and how well you put together sentences and para-
graphs. Get ready to ace any reading comprehension and written composition questions 
you face with the advice we provide in this chapter.
Distinguishing among the Different Reading 
and Writing Question Formats
The HSPT, TACHS, and COOP present reading comprehension and written composition 
questions similarly, but there are some distinctions that you should be aware of before you 
take your seat on test day.
On each test, the reading comprehension portion presents you with a passage that you’re 
supposed to read and questions about that passage that you’re supposed to answer. The 
questions can be about the main point of the passage, information covered in the passage, 
the meaning of words used in the passage, or the author’s point of view.
Written composition questions on all three tests are primarily concerned with how sen-
tences and paragraphs should be constructed. For these question types, you evaluate indi-
vidual sentences and whole paragraphs to make sure they’re put together clearly.
 Here’s how reading comprehension and written composition questions appear on each exam:
 
✓ HSPT: The Reading section of the HSPT bestows upon you 40 reading comprehension 
questions that it spreads out among approximately five to six passages that can be 
anywhere from two to six (or more!) paragraphs long. Its Language section contains 
ten written composition questions that may ask you to choose the best way to show 
transition, begin or complete a sentence, express ideas clearly, position sentences in a 
paragraph, or deal with paragraph topics.

42
Part II: Vanquishing the Verbal Questions 
 
✓ TACHS: The TACHS’s Reading section presents you with four or five passages that 
have around four or five reading comprehension questions each for a total of approxi-
mately 20 questions. Its ten written composition questions chill out in the second part 
of the Language section, where you find four or five paragraphs with two to three ques-
tions each that test you on how to express sentences clearly and correctly.
 
✓ COOP: This exam combines reading comprehension and written composition ques-
tions in its 40-question Reading and Language Arts section. Expect to see about four to 
six fairly lengthy passages with anywhere from six to ten questions that ask you about 
the information in the passage. Also included are several paragraphs with two to three 
questions about anything from sentence structure and clear transitions to topic sen-
tences and paragraph organization.
How Not to Get Stumped by Reading 
Comprehension Questions
Reading comprehension questions are designed to find out how much you understand 
about what you read. Just about every standardized test has a section with reading pas-
sages and questions about those reading passages. If you’re like many test-takers, you may 
not be too fond of reading comprehension questions, but the following sections may just 
change your outlook. There we show you how to follow what you’re reading, move swiftly 
through a passage, indentify the types of questions you’re facing, narrow down your answer 
options, and handle the occasional exception question.
Comprehending what you read regardless 
of the subject matter
The range of topics covered in reading comprehension passages includes natural sciences 
(think plants and animals), social sciences (think history and politics), literature and the 
arts, and personal stories of everyday life. Fortunately, reading comprehension questions 
don’t assume you’ve had any previous training on the subject of a passage. The answer to 
every question is based on information located somewhere in the related passage. All you 
have to do is find it.
 
Reading comprehension questions test your reading skills, not the multitude of details 
tucked away in your long-term memory. When you come across a passage on a subject that 
you’re pretty familiar with, avoid turning to your outside knowledge. Answer the questions 
based only on information that’s in the passage — not what’s in your head.
 
Don’t let a perplexing sentence (or paragraph) rattle you. Mark it with an exclamation point 
and keep reading. If you’re actually asked a question about the frustrating text, then you 
can easily find where it’s located in the passage because you’ve marked it. You can try to 
figure out the puzzling text when you’re asked the question, or you can mark your best 
guess for the question and come back to it after you’ve answered the other questions in 
the section.
To give you an idea of what a reading comprehension passage might look like on any of the 
entrance exams, here’s a short sample passage. This one falls under the social sciences cat-
egory. We refer to this passage throughout the sections that follow.

 Chapter 5: Two out of Three “Rs”: Reading and Writing Questions
 
 
Under the United States Constitution, persons accused of crimes have an absolute right 
to trial by jury. Parties to most civil lawsuits, like ones involving automobile accidents, may 
choose to have their cases heard by a judge and a jury or by just a judge.
 
At trial, the function of the jury and judge are significantly different. The judge decides 
questions of law, such as how a specific statute should be interpreted and applied. The jury 
has the duty to decide questions of fact, such as whether a person acted reasonably in driv-
ing through a yellow caution light. Therefore, at trial, the judge decides questions of law, 
and the jury applies the law to the facts of a particular case.
 
Most parties in civil suits choose to have a jury hear their cases. This is because they 
think that a “jury of their peers” is more likely to sympathize with a party’s experience than 
a judge. Plus, a jury consists of many members, so parties have more personality types to 
empathize with them than if their cases were heard by just one judge with one viewpoint. 
Usually the only civil cases that are presented to just a judge without a jury are cases that 
involve complicated contract matters, like divorce cases, because a jury would have a hard 
time understanding the legal complexities of a contract.
Moving quickly by knowing what to focus on
Time is of the essence when you’re tackling reading comprehension questions. Generally, 
you shouldn’t spend more than a couple minutes reading a passage before you answer the 
questions that follow it (spending only a minute or so per question, we might add). This 
time crunch means you need a plan for getting through each passage in a way that allows 
you to answer the questions quickly and correctly.
 
When you read a passage, focus on these important aspects of it:
 
✓ The passage’s main point
 
✓ The author’s tone
 
✓ The way the author organizes information in the passage
 
✓ Commonly tested details
 
Unless you have a photographic memory, you won’t be able to remember all of a passage’s 
details long enough to answer the questions without referring back to the passage. Because 
you’ll probably need to refer to the passage later anyway, don’t spend time trying to figure out 
every little thing the passage talks about while you’re reading it. If you come across a question 
that asks you about one of those little details, you can go back and reread the relevant section.
Identifying the main point
Authors usually write passages for one of two reasons: to inform or to persuade. Most of the 
passages on the entrance exams are informative rather than argumentative (and even the argu-
mentative ones are pretty tame). You can probably identify an author’s main point — whether he 
or she is trying to inform you about a topic or persuade you to think/do something — in the first 
few seconds of reading a passage. If the main point isn’t clear in the first couple paragraphs, then 
head to the end of the passage because the author has likely summarized his or her point there.
 
So that you don’t forget the author’s main point shortly after figuring it out, write a word or 
two about it in your test booklet. Your notation gives you something to refer to when you 
come across the inevitable question that asks you to summarize the passage’s main point.
For the sample passage (see the earlier “Comprehending what you read regardless of the 
subject matter” section), you could write down diff judge/jury to signify that the passage 
primarily discusses the differences in jury trials versus trials by just a judge.

44
Part II: Vanquishing the Verbal Questions 
Deciphering the author’s tone
In addition to understanding the author’s point, you need to know how the author feels 
about the issue. You get clues as to the author’s tone or mood by noticing the kinds of 
words he or she uses. Informative passages are often more objective than persuasive ones, 
so the author’s tone is usually neutral in a passage whose main point is to inform you of 
something. Authors of persuasive passages may use more emotion to get their points 
across. In these passages, you may sense that an author is critical, sarcastic, pessimistic, 
optimistic, or supportive.
 
When you figure out how the author feels about the topic, write down a short description of 
the tone in your test booklet, something like objective (like the tone of the sample passage), 
enthusiastic, or critical. Knowing the tone of a passage helps you choose answers that have 
the same type of tone.
 
Regardless of the author’s mood, don’t let your personal opinions about a passage’s subject 
matter decide the answer choice you pick. Getting emotionally involved with the content of 
a passage may hurt your ability to answer questions objectively because you may subcon-
sciously rely on your own opinions to answer the questions. Remind yourself to stay objec-
tive by asking yourself what’s true “according to the passage” or “according to the author.”
Outlining so you can see the organization clearly
Knowing how a passage is organized is much more important than understanding its 
details. Instead of trying to understand everything being covered in a passage, focus on how 
the author organizes the information.
As you may have learned in English class, a standard essay has an introduction with a 
thesis statement, two or three supporting paragraphs, and a conclusion. Many passages on 
the various Catholic high school entrance exams are excerpts from larger works, so they 
may not be in standard essay form, but they will contain evidence of an introduction, body, 
and conclusion.
 
As you read a passage, determine its overall point as well as the main points of each individ-
ual paragraph. You may find it helpful to create an outline of the passage as you read it. 
Underneath the passage’s main point, jot down a word or two that describes the type of 
information contained in each paragraph.
So under the main theme of diff judge/jury that you jotted down for the sample passage in 
this chapter, you’d list a short summary of each of the supporting paragraphs — what each 
decide for the second paragraph and why choose jury/judge for the third. When you look at 
your outline while trying to answer a question, you can recall that the second paragraph 
contains information about what a jury and judge are responsible for deciding and that the 
third paragraph explains why a party would choose a jury to hear his or her case and what 
cases are appropriate for a judge only.
Although a quick read of a passage may not give you a complete understanding of all the 
fascinating details surrounding the author’s description, thanks to your outline you know 
where to go in the passage when one of the questions asks you about a detail. For instance, 
if a question asks you about what a jury is responsible for deciding, your outline tells you to 
look in the second paragraph of the sample passage for that information.
 
Even though you don’t need to read and understand every detail of a passage before you 
answer its questions, don’t try to answer a single question without reading the passage first. 
You need to read the passage to get an idea of what it’s about and how it’s organized before 
you look at the questions. Any minutes you save by skipping a passage and jumping into the 
questions will be lost because you won’t know where information is located or what the 
passage is about.

45
 Chapter 5: Two out of Three “Rs”: Reading and Writing Questions
Noting commonly tested details
Although details shouldn’t be your primary focus as you read through a passage, you 
should circle, underline, or otherwise mark a few common types of details that the reading 
comprehension questions are usually interested in. These commonly tested details include 
the following:
 
✓ Dates and other indicators of time, such as the phrase twenty years ago
 
✓ Numbers, such as the quantity of people who prefer orange soft drinks over grape ones
 
✓ Names of people and places
 
✓ Topic sentences of paragraphs if they’re pretty obvious
 
✓ Information in a series, such as “most people prefer orange, grape, root beer, and 
 sassafras soda”
 
✓ Transition words, such as however and furthermore, that reveal the author’s thought 
process
 
You don’t have colored pencils to clarify what type of information you’re marking, so use 
different kinds of marks to distinguish information. For instance, circle numbers, put boxes 
around people’s names, and surround transition words with fluffy clouds.
Answering questions by first pinning 
down the question type
The first step in answering a reading comprehension question correctly is to figure out what 
type of question you’re dealing with. We’ve found that most reading comprehension ques-
tions fall into one of these five categories:
 
✓ Main-point questions
 
✓ Details questions
 
✓ Vocabulary-in-context questions
 
✓ Inference questions
 
✓ Tone questions
Each of the five question types requires a slightly different approach. Main-point, tone, and 
some inference questions ask you about the passage as a whole, whereas details, vocabulary-
in-context, and other inference questions ask you about particular portions of a passage. 
When you know, for example, that a question is about specific details in a passage, you can 
focus your attention on the part of the passage that covers that information. The next sec-
tions break down each of these question types and explain how to answer them correctly.
Main-point questions
When you’re asked to identify the primary purpose of an entire passage, you’re dealing with 
a main-point question. Almost every reading comprehension passage has at least one main-
point question, and many times it’s the first in the set of questions for a passage.
This question type tests your ability to distinguish the main idea from its supporting evi-
dence. You can usually find the main idea of a passage in the opening and closing para-
graphs of the passage. In fact, more often than not, the main point is set forth in the first 
sentence of the opening paragraph.

46
Part II: Vanquishing the Verbal Questions 
 
You can easily identify main-point questions by noting the language that they use. Main-
point questions are often worded in one of three ways:
 
✓ The passage deals mainly with . . .
 
✓ What is a good topic sentence for this passage?
 
✓ Which of these is a good title for this passage?
 
The best answer to a main-point question is general rather than specific. If an answer choice 
for a main-point question involves information that’s covered in just one part of the pas-
sage, it probably isn’t the best answer. Here are some other ways to eliminate answer 
choices for main-point questions:
 
✓ Avoid answer choices that contain information that comes only from the middle 
paragraphs of the passage. These paragraphs probably deal with specific points rather 
than the main theme.
 
✓ Cross out any answer choices that contain information that isn’t covered in the 
 passage. These choices are irrelevant.
 
✓ See whether you can eliminate answer choices based on just the first words. For 
example, if you’re trying to find the author’s main point in a natural science passage 
with an objective tone, you can eliminate answers that begin with more subjective 
words, like argue or criticize.
Here’s a sample main-point question for the passage presented in the earlier 
“Comprehending what you read regardless of the subject matter” section.
 
The best title for this passage would be
 
(A) Applying the United States Constitution
 
(B) Defending a Civil Lawsuit
 
(C) The Different Roles of a Judge and Jury
 
(D) The Personality Types of Jury Members
A good title summarizes the main point of the passage, which means you can safely elimi-
nate titles that deal with information not covered in the passage. The passage mentions 
the Constitution in the first sentence, but it doesn’t go on to describe how one applies it to 
any area other than a right to a jury trial. Choice (A) is too general to be the right answer. 
Likewise, Choice (B) is irrelevant. The passage mentions that jury trials are often chosen for 
civil lawsuits, but it says nothing about how someone defends a lawsuit in general. The sub-
ject of jurors’ personality types is mentioned only briefly in the last paragraph. It isn’t dis-
cussed enough to be a main point of the passage, so eliminate Choice (D). The best answer 
is Choice (C) because the passage covers the differences between what juries and judges 
do at trial and shows how the differences affect whether a party would choose to have a 
jury trial.
Details questions
Details questions, which (no surprise here) ask you about specific details in a passage, are 
potentially the easiest type of reading comprehension question because everything you need 
to answer them is right there in the passage. The information may be about numbers, such as 
years, dates, and figures, or it may be about ideas, emotions, or thoughts. The key to answer-
ing details questions is knowing where the information is located in the passage so you can 
get to it quickly. (Here’s where noting the main point of each paragraph as you read comes in 
handy; see the earlier “Outlining so you can see the organization clearly” section for more.)

47
 Chapter 5: Two out of Three “Rs”: Reading and Writing Questions
 
Pinpointing the wording of details questions is tough because they’re worded in different 
ways depending on the specific facts of the passage. However, we decided to give it a go 
just for you. Often (but not always!) details questions contain a reference to the passage. 
Here are some examples:
 
✓ The passage states that . . .
 
✓ Which of the following is true about . . .
 
✓ In the passage, the author indicates that . . .
 
To succeed on a details question, read the question carefully and refer to the outline of the 
passage that you wrote in your test booklet to remind you where information is found in 
the passage. And keep in mind that the right answer may paraphrase the passage instead of 
repeating it word for word.
A details question for the earlier sample passage might look like the following.
 
According to the passage, parties to civil lawsuits may choose to have their cases heard by 
which of these?
 
(A) a jury made up of judges
 
(B) only a jury
 
(C) a jury and judge or only a judge
 
(D) only a judge because there is no right to a jury in civil lawsuits
Eliminate obviously incorrect answers. Choice (D) contradicts the information in the 
second sentence that says that parties in civil lawsuits can have their cases heard by a jury. 
The same sentence also tells you that parties can have their cases heard by a judge, so 
Choice (B) is wrong too. Nowhere does the passage suggest that juries are made up of 
judges, so Choice (A) must be wrong. Choice (C) is the correct answer; it paraphrases the 
information provided in the second sentence.
Vocabulary-in-context questions
Questions that ask you for the meaning of a word contained in the passage are known as 
vocabulary-in-context questions. They’re pretty easy to answer correctly because you can use 
the passage to figure out what the word in question means. The only potentially tricky part 
about these questions is that they may test you on a word that you know the meaning of but 
whose usage in the passage is slightly different from what you’re familiar with. Make sure 
the answer you choose matches the meaning of the word as it’s used in the passage.
 
Vocabulary-in-context questions are easy to spot; they’re most often phrased like this:
 
✓ As it is used in the passage, the word genuine most nearly means . . .
 
✓ The word genuine is used in the passage to mean . . .
 
✓ Which of these answers best captures the meaning of genuine?
 
The key to finding the best answer for a vocabulary-in-context question is to substitute the 
answer choices for the word in the passage. The answer choice that replaces the vocabu-
lary word and makes sense is the right answer.
Here’s a vocabulary-in-context question you could reasonably expect to see following the 
earlier sample passage.

48
Part II: Vanquishing the Verbal Questions 
 
As it is used in the passage, party most nearly means
 
(A) festivity
 
(B) participant
 
(C) victim
 
(D) event
If you answer this question too quickly, you may be tempted to pick Choice (A) or Choice 
(D) because the definition of party that you’re probably used to is festivity or event, as in a 
birthday party. But if you substitute either of these words for party in any of the places that 
it’s used in the passage, you see that these definitions don’t make sense. Saying that “most 
festivities in civil suits choose to have a jury hear their cases” would be silly. Now just 
Choices (B) and (C) remain. Not every person involved in a lawsuit is a victim, so Choice (B) 
is a better answer than Choice (C). Substitute participant in the sentence: Most participants in 
civil suits choose to have a jury hear their cases. It makes sense! Choice (B)’s your answer.
Inference questions
Inference questions ask you about information that a passage implies rather than states 
directly; they test your ability to draw conclusions that aren’t directly mentioned in the pas-
sage. For instance, suppose you read a passage about hummingbirds. Information in one 
paragraph may state that hummingbirds fly south for the winter. Information in another 
paragraph may say that the Speckled Rufus is a kind of hummingbird. From this informa-
tion, you can infer that the Speckled Rufus flies south for the winter.
 
You can spot inference questions pretty easily because they often contain the words infer 
or imply.
 
✓ It can be inferred from the passage that . . .
 
✓ The author implies that . . .
 
✓ The author brings up southern migration patterns to imply which of the following?
 
When facing an inference question, look for the choice that extends the information in the 
passage just a little bit. Answer choices that make inferences that aren’t covered by what’s 
stated in the passage are usually incorrect. Don’t choose an answer that requires you to 
come up with information that isn’t somehow covered in the passage. Also, be sure to use 
only what’s provided in the passage — not what’s in your head. Sometimes knowing a lot 
about a passage’s topic can throw you off because you may be tempted to answer questions 
based on your own knowledge rather than what’s provided in the passage. Make sure any-
thing you infer can be justified by information in the passage.
Following is an inference question (based on the earlier sample passage, of course) for you 
to try your hand at.
 
The author of the passage implies which of the following?
 
(A) A jury may be able to relate to a party’s situation better than a judge.
 
(B) A judge is more important than a jury in the U.S. system of justice.
 
(C) Juries are more crucial to maintaining justice than judges are.
 
(D) The duties of judges and juries are very similar.
Good news! You don’t actually have to do a lot of inferring to answer this question. The 
author doesn’t reveal any indication that either the judge or jury is more important in pro-
moting justice, so you can’t infer either Choice (B) or Choice (C). Choice (D) contradicts the 
author’s statement in the first sentence of the second paragraph that the roles of judge and 
jury are different; toss it out. The best answer is Choice (A). The last paragraph tells you 

49
 Chapter 5: Two out of Three “Rs”: Reading and Writing Questions
that juries are made up of different personality types, so you can infer that the author 
thinks the chances of someone on the jury relating to a party are better than they are for 
just one judge.
Tone questions
Questions that ask you to figure out the author’s attitude or complete the logical flow of the 
author’s ideas are tone questions. Your job is to discover the author’s feeling from the way 
he or she presents the passage. With practice, you can discover how to distinguish between 
an enthusiastic author and one who’s faking enthusiasm to make fun of the passage’s subject.
 
Tone questions stand out thanks to the way they’re worded. Watch for verbiage such as
 
✓ The author’s attitude appears to be one of . . .
 
✓ With which of the following statements would the author most likely agree?
 
✓ The tone of the passage suggests that the author is most skeptical about which of the 
following?
 
As you read through the passage, get to know the author. Pay attention to the vocabulary 
she uses and the way she advances the main point. Objective authors tend to use more 
formal language and apply traditional essay structure. Authors who tell a story or offer a 
subjective opinion often rely on informal language and first-person narratives.
Here’s an example of a question about the author’s tone in the sample passage.
 
Which of the following best describes the author’s tone?
 
(A) critical of the U.S. jury system
 
(B) enthusiastic about the importance of juries
 
(C) disappointed that more people do not choose to have a jury trial
 
(D) descriptive about the differences between the roles of judge and jury
Reading the passage is your chance to get a handle on the author’s tone. Because you did 
that earlier, you already determined that the author’s tone in the passage is relatively neu-
tral. Consequently, you can forget about Choices (A), (B), and (C). Critical, enthusiastic, and 
disappointed are subjective terms that don’t convey the author’s objectivity. The only neu-
tral option is Choice (D); the author is primarily descriptive in the passage.
Eliminating answer choices
One of the most effective ways of moving speedily through reading comprehension ques-
tions is to eliminate incorrect answer choices. That’s because you’re looking for the best 
answer choice, not necessarily the perfect answer choice. Sometimes you have to choose 
the best choice out of three pretty great choices; other times you must choose from four 
really crummy options. Because the definitive answer doesn’t always jump right out at you, 
knowing how to eliminate obviously wrong choices is essential.
 
Common wrong answers to reading comprehension questions include the following:
 
✓ Choices that contain information that isn’t covered in the passage: Even if the infor-
mation in these choices is true in real life, you can’t pick them because the passage 
isn’t the source of the information. Eliminate these choices no matter how tempting 
they may be.
 
✓ Choices that contradict the passage’s main point, author’s tone, or specific details: 
After you’ve read the passage, you should be able to quickly eliminate most of the 

50
Part II: Vanquishing the Verbal Questions 
choices that contradict what you know from the passage (without having to refer back 
to the passage).
 
✓ Choices that don’t answer the question: Paying careful attention to the wording of 
each question can help you narrow down your answer options. For example, a ques-
tion may ask about a disadvantage of something discussed in the passage. If one of the 
answer choices lists an advantage rather than a disadvantage, you can eliminate that 
choice without thinking twice.
 
Sometimes you need to think twice about eliminating an answer option, as in the case of 
choices containing debatable words, words that leave no room for exception. Examples of 
debatable words are all, always, complete, never, every, and none. An answer choice that 
contains a debatable word is probably wrong, but you shouldn’t automatically throw it out 
the window. If information in the passage justifies the presence of a debatable word in an 
answer choice, that choice may be right. For instance, if a passage tells you that all hum-
mingbirds travel south in the winter, a choice that has all in it may in fact be okay.
Dealing with exception questions
Most questions ask you to choose the one correct answer, but some questions are cleverly 
disguised to ask for the one answer that isn’t true. We call these beauties exception ques-
tions; you can recognize them by the presence of a negative word (usually except or not) in 
the question. When you see questions worded this way, you know you’re looking for the 
one answer choice that isn’t true.
 
Exception questions aren’t that difficult if you approach them systematically. Determining 
which answer choice isn’t touched on in the passage takes time because you may think you 
have to look in the passage for the choice and not find it. But there’s a better way. Instead 
of determining whether an answer isn’t true, just eliminate the three true answers. Doing so 
leaves you with the one false (and therefore correct) answer. Identifying choices that are 
true according to the passage is much easier than determining the one choice that isn’t. 
Take your time, and you’ll do exceptionally well on exception questions.
See how the process works by trying this exception question based on the earlier sample 
passage.
 
Each of these is true about judges and juries except
 
(A) Juries are better at making decisions in complex contract cases.
 
(B) Judges interpret statutes.
 
(C) Juries apply laws to the facts of the case.
 
(D) Juries decide questions about facts.
Reword the question so that it’s clear what you’re looking for: Which of these statements 
says something false about judges and juries? The second paragraph tells you it’s true 
that judges interpret statutes and that juries deal with facts and how the law applies to 
the facts. Eliminate Choices (B), (C), and (D) because all of them say something true, and 
you’re looking for the choice that states something false. The passage says that judges, 
not juries, are better at deciding complex contract cases. Choice (A) is false and therefore 
correct.

Tackling Written Composition Questions
You don’t jot down one sentence of your own creation on any of the Catholic high school 
entrance exams, but you’re still tested on how clearly you write sentences and organize 
ideas in paragraphs.
 All three Catholic high school entrance exams feature written composition questions, but 
they present them in slightly different ways, as you can see from the following information:
 
✓ HSPT: This exam has the most thorough approach to written composition questions. 
You may be shown four different ways of expressing something and asked to choose 
the answer choice that does the best job of getting the message across. However, you 
may also be asked to fill in the blank in a sentence in the way that offers the best transi-
tion from one thought to another. Other HSPT written composition questions look for 
the group of words that best completes or starts a sentence, and still others test your 
ability to determine what ideas go best with particular topics.
 
✓ TACHS: The TACHS’s written composition questions follow several paragraphs with 
numbered sentences. The focus of these questions is less on paragraph construction 
and topic sentences and more on proper word use, such as whether the tense of a verb 
is correct or whether a sentence is complete.
 
✓ COOP: Some of the COOP’s written composition questions are also related to specific 
paragraphs containing numbered sentences. The COOP usually picks out one of the 
sentences and asks you to figure out which of the answer options does the best job of 
expressing the idea in the sentence. Other written composition questions on the COOP 
ask you to evaluate how a passage is organized by having you pick a good topic sen-
tence for it or determine which sentence doesn’t belong in it.
The next sections help you tackle written composition questions effectively without getting 
bogged down in how awful some of the answer options can be.
Clarifying sentences
Questions that ask you to choose the best or clearest way to write a sentence usually con-
centrate on three specific elements of good writing — sentence structure, transitions, and 
usage. Throw out answer choices that contain any of these problems:
 
✓ Poor sentence structure
 
✓ Inappropriate transition words
 
✓ Faulty word usage
The sections that follow give you practice spotting these errors so you can make a sentence 
crystal clear on a moment’s notice.
Arranging sentences clearly
 
As a rule, simple, straightforward sentences are clearer than complex ones. So when you have 
to choose the clearest way to write a sentence, pick the option that states the message in the 
simplest way possible and eliminate choices that use passive voice. (For more on avoiding 
unnecessary wordiness, as well as a general review of grammar rules, head to Chapter 7.)

52
Part II: Vanquishing the Verbal Questions 
Following are two examples of written composition questions about recognizing clear sen-
tence structure. The first one is in the HSPT format; the second is a COOP-style question.
 
Which choice expresses the idea most clearly?
 
(A) After doing homework, playing the guitar, reading science fiction, and running around 
the block are things I like to do.
 
(B) Things I like to do are running around the block, playing the guitar, and reading science 
fiction after doing homework.
 
(C) After I do my homework, I like to play the guitar, read science fiction, and I also enjoy 
running around the block.
 
(D) After doing homework, I like to run around the block, play the guitar, and read science 
fiction.
Eliminate answer choices that contain serious grammar problems (such as misplaced modi-
fiers, unparallel structure, and passive voice). Choice (A) expresses the thought in passive 
voice (“playing, reading, and doing are things I like” instead of “I like playing, reading, and 
doing”), plus it has a modifier problem. The way it’s phrased makes it sound like “playing,” 
“reading,” and “running” did the homework. Choice (B) is better, but it still has a modifier 
problem. Putting “after doing homework” right after “reading science fiction” makes it 
sound like the thing I like is reading science fiction only after doing homework, not at any 
time. Choice (C)’s addition of “I do” to the beginning phrase makes it clear who’s doing the 
homework, but there’s a lack of parallel structure in the last part of the sentence. All the 
things I like should be listed in a similar way: I like to play, read, and run. Choice (D) cor-
rects all of these problems. The subject of the sentence is “I,” so it’s clear who’s doing the 
homework mentioned in the beginning phrase, and the list of things I like to do after I do my 
homework maintains parallel structure. (Notice how the right answer in this case is also the 
shortest sentence?)
 
The shortest sentence isn’t always the correct answer to a written composition question, 
but if one sentence is significantly shorter than the other answer options, that’s a good indi-
cation that the sentence isn’t using unnecessary words to make its point.
 
(1)On Sunday mornings, my father reads the paper, walks the dog, and eats breakfast. (2)He 
also goes to church every Sunday morning. (3)He thinks these activities are very relaxing.
 
What is the best way to combine Sentence 1 and Sentence 2?
 
(A) On Sunday mornings, my father reads the paper, walks the dog, eats breakfast, and goes 
to church.
 
(B) On Sunday mornings, my father reads the paper, walks the dog, eats breakfast, and he 
also goes to church.
 
(C) My father reads the paper, walks the dog, eats breakfast, and goes to church on 
Sundays during the mornings.
 
(D) During the morning hours of a Sunday, reading the paper, walking the dog, eating break-
fast, and going to church are what my father does.
Choice (A) is the only option that doesn’t contain a modification problem, lack of parallel 
structure, or wordiness issue. The second part of the sentence in Choice (B) doesn’t apply 
parallel structure in the list of things my father does. The placement of the phrase “on 
Sundays during the mornings” in Choice (C) doesn’t make it clear that that the activities 
other than going to church also occur on Sunday mornings. “Sunday during the mornings” 
also uses more words than is necessary; saying “Sunday mornings” is better and more 
straightforward. Choice (D) is a real mess. It uses too many words to mean “Sunday morn-
ings,” and it uses passive rather than active voice in the second part of the sentence.

 Chapter 5: Two out of Three “Rs”: Reading and Writing Questions
Providing clear transitions
Transition words and transition phrases are signals that tell the reader how ideas are related. 
Using the wrong transition word can completely change the meaning of a sentence. Table 5-1 
introduces you to common transition words/phrases and their purpose in a sentence.
Table 5-1 
The Purpose of Common Transition Words & Phrases
Transition Words/Phrases
Purpose
Similarly, in fact, likewise, also
To show that one idea is similar to another
But, however, although, on the contrary
To reveal a dissimilarity between ideas
Therefore, for this reason, because
To show that one element results in or causes another
Finally, formally, after, first
To show the time relationship between elements in a 
sentence
For instance, for example
To indicate that part of a sentence is providing an illus-
tration of another part
To answer written composition questions regarding transition words/phrases, examine the 
sentence to figure out how its elements are related. Here’s an example from the HSPT to 
show you how to do just that.
 
Choose the word or words that best join the thoughts.
 
 Stanley has never enjoyed watching baseball; _____ he didn’t join us at the baseball league 
championship game.
 
(A) but,
 
(B) therefore,
 
(C) finally,
 
(D) none of these
Use what you know about the purpose of transition words to answer this question. The first 
part of the sentence supplies a reason for the second part of the sentence: Stanley didn’t go 
to the championship game because he has never liked watching baseball. The answer that 
shows cause or reason is Choice (B), therefore. Choice (A) shows contrast, so it’s not right. 
No time element is involved in the sentence, which makes Choice (C) incorrect. Because 
Choice (B) works, you know that Choice (D) is wrong.
 
Transitions also apply to linking ideas in paragraphs. To show how paragraphs are related, 
use transition words/phrases the same way you would in a sentence.
Using words correctly
Some written composition questions are there to test you on whether you know the rules of 
standard written English. To be prepared for all the usage rules you might be tested on, 
review the information in Chapter 7 on how to recognize sentence fragments, proper verb 
tenses, standard English expressions, subject-verb agreement, appropriate use of adverbs, 
and so on.
When you’re ready, check out this example of a TACHS-style written composition question 
that concerns proper word usage.

54
Part II: Vanquishing the Verbal Questions 
 
(1)Poodles make great pets for kids with allergies. (2)Studies have shown that poodle hair is 
similar to the kind of hair that humans had.
 
In Sentence 2, which word is in the wrong tense?
 
(A) shown
 
(B) kind
 
(C) had
 
(D) is
All the verbs in both sentences are in the present tense except had, Choice (C). To maintain 
consistent verb tense, you must change had to the present tense have. Choice (A), shown, 
is the proper form to follow have. Choice (D), is, is also properly in present tense. As it’s 
used in Sentence 2, Choice (B), kind, is a noun, and nouns don’t have tenses. The answer 
you’re looking for is Choice (C).
Organizing paragraphs
Most of the questions on the HSPT, TACHS, and COOP that ask you about organizing para-
graphs concern how to stick to a topic. Here are some facts to remember about the topics 
of paragraphs:
 
✓ Each paragraph should have no more than one main topic.
 
✓ Usually the first sentence of a paragraph introduces the topic (and may hint at what 
topic was covered in the prior paragraph).
 
✓ The rest of the sentences in the paragraph give more detailed information about the topic.
 
• The sentences should be arranged in a logical order.
 
• The sentences shouldn’t mention things that have nothing to do with the topic.
 
✓ The last sentence of the paragraph usually gives you a little hint about what the topic 
of the next paragraph will be.
 
Some paragraphs may arrange their information in a format that contradicts the standard 
paragraph organization you’re taught in English class. Some logical, nonstandard ways a 
paragraph can be organized are chronologically, from general topics to more specific ones, 
and from the least important fact to the most important fact (or vice versa).
Only the HSPT and COOP have questions that deal with paragraph organization. Here’s an 
example to show you what this type of question looks like on either exam.
 
Which title works best for a matter that can be discussed in one paragraph?
 
(A) The Effects of World War II on the European Economy
 
(B) The Big Cats of Africa
 
(C) The Reason That Poodles Make Good Pets for Kids with Allergies
 
(D) None of these
Because you know that a paragraph should discuss only one main idea, you can eliminate 
Choices (A) and (B). You could probably write a whole book about the effects of World War II 
on the European economy, and supplying complete information about all the big cats that live 
in Africa would require at least several chapters. Choice (C) suggests that it discusses just 
one reason why a specific dog breed, poodles, makes a good pet for specific types of kids, 
those with allergies. Because Choice (C) is so specific, it could be covered in one 
paragraph. Choice (C) is a good answer, which means Choice (D) must be wrong.

S
pelling is one of those things that some people are good at and others just aren’t. If 
you’re among the ace-speller crowd, you’ll do great on this question type. If you’re not, 
take comfort in knowing that spelling questions make up just a tiny part of the TACHS and 
HSPT (the COOP doesn’t have spelling questions). You can improve your spelling profi-
ciency by familiarizing yourself with a few rules (and their exceptions).
Of course, spelling is only one component of good writing. You also need to be able to show 
your proficiency at writing mechanics — punctuation and capitalization. The HSPT and 
TACHS have separate sections dedicated to writing mechanics questions; the COOP 
includes these types of questions in its Reading and Language Arts section. Consider this 
chapter your go-to guide for all kinds of spelling- and mechanics-related tips and tricks.
Spelling 101: I before E except after 
C and All That Other Stuff
English doesn’t have hard-and-fast spelling rules like, say, Spanish does. A lot of words you 
just have to know. One of the best ways to improve your spelling is by reading — a lot. 
Another way is to pay attention to the spell-check feature on your word-processing program 
to see which words you commonly misspell. Keep a running list of those words and their 
correct spellings and study it from time to time to refresh your memory. You can also ask 
your English teacher for a list of problem words and review that periodically. However you 
choose to go about improving your spelling, we suggest you take some time to memorize 
the rules, tricky words, and tips we present in the following sections.
 
To really get serious about improving your spelling, search for “commonly misspelled 
words” in your favorite Internet search engine. Read through the lists that appear on the 
Web sites you find and write down the words that give you trouble on 3-x-5 cards. Then use 
the cards as flashcards to help you memorize the correct spellings.

Part II: Vanquishing the Verbal Questions 
Following the rules
English words have very few spelling restrictions, which means you must memorize both 
the rules and the exceptions to them. Table 6-1 lists the most important spelling rules and 
the exceptions you may be tested on. Study this list closely because knowing which words 
don’t follow the rules is just as important as knowing which ones do.
 These rules and exceptions don’t tell you how to spell every word in the English language, 
but they do give you enough information so you can spot most of the incorrectly spelled 
words on the TACHS and the HSPT.

Honing in on some commonly 
confused homophones
Homophones are words that sound alike but have different meanings and may be spelled dif-
ferently. The test you take may ask you to distinguish between or among homophones to 
determine which spelling is appropriate in a particular sentence. To help you out with this 
task, we list some of the commonly tested (and confused!) homophones in Table 6-2.

Too means also or more than 
enough.
Two refers to the number 2.
Use to in all other circumstances: as 
a preposition, as a part of the infinite 
form of verbs, and so on.
Shelly is going to the park; I want to 
go too. I ate too much.

Proper Use
Examples
you’re, your
You’re is the contraction of you are.
Your is the possessive form of you.

I value your friendship.
who’s, whose
Who’s is the contraction of who is.
Whose is the possessive form of who.
Who’s coming to the party tomorrow?
Whose purse is that?
As you can see, most of the commonly misused homophones involve confusion between a 
pronoun’s contracted form and its possessive form. Here’s an example of how the HSPT 
may test you on homophones.
 
Choose the answer than contains the spelling error. If there is no error, pick Choice (D).
 
(A) The man walked into the building.
 
(B) The dog chased it’s tail.
 
(C) Have you seen my sister?
 
(D) No mistakes
Did you notice the pesky homophone in Choice (B)? Remember: It’s is the contraction of it is. To 
figure out whether this homophone is used correctly, ask yourself this question: If I change the 
homophone (it’s) to a pronoun plus to be verb (it is), does the sentence still make sense? If the 
answer is “yes,” the contraction is proper; if the answer is “no,” the possessive form is probably 
correct. Lengthen the contraction to see whether the sentence still makes sense: The dog 
chased it is tail. Whoops! You must need the possessive form instead: The dog chased its tail. 
Now you know that Choice (B) contains a spelling error, which makes it the correct answer.
Approaching spelling questions 
on the TACHS and HSPT
Both the TACHS and HSPT test your spelling ability in their Language sections. You can 
expect to see a series of three sentences that may or may not contain a misspelled word. 
The fourth answer choice gives you the option to claim that none of the sentences contains 
a mistake. Because the misspelled words appear in sentences, you must read carefully in 
order to spot them. Here’s what you can do to make sure you’re checking the sentences as 
thoroughly possible:
 
✓ If you spot a misspelled word immediately, go ahead and mark it on your answer sheet 
but still review the rest of the sentences to make sure you haven’t missed something.
 
✓ Skim the words in the sentences to see whether any of them involve any of the rules 
listed in Table 6-1 or the homophones listed in Table 6-2. If you find any such words, 
make sure they properly follow the rules (and exceptions).
 
✓ Scan each of the first three answer choices to see whether any of the words seem to 
belong to the list of commonly misspelled words that you’ve compiled from your 
research. If you spot one from the list, double-check its spelling.
 
✓ If your initial skimming doesn’t reveal any misspellings, carefully read through each 
word in each sentence to make sure you haven’t glanced over a problem word.
 
✓ If you really can’t find a thing wrong with any of the words in any of the sentences, pick 
Choice (D).

59
 Chapter 6: Acing Spelling and Mechanics Questions
 
About two of the ten spelling questions on the TACHS and HSPT have no spelling mistakes 
at all, so don’t hesitate to pick Choice (D) if you scanned the sentences carefully and didn’t 
find any spelling errors.
Following is an example of what a spelling question on the TACHS or HSPT looks like.
 
(A) She maintained a high grade throughout the semester.
 
(B) Mary was happy to recieve the top score on the spelling test.
 
(C) You have to commend Mary on her awesome performance.
 
(D) No mistakes
To answer this question, first look for words that involve any of the many spelling rules. Choice 
(B) contains recieve (which concerns the i-before-e-except-after-c rule) and spelling (which has an 
-ing ending). Spelling adds the ending properly, but recieve violates its rule. The vowel combina-
tion follows a c, which means it should be ei rather than ie. Recieved should therefore be spelled 
received. Choice (B) is probably the answer, but check the other sentences just in case. Commend 
is sometimes misspelled with only one m, but Choice (C) properly spells it with two m’s. All the 
words in Choice (A) are spelled correctly. The problem word is definitely recieved in Choice (B).
Recalling Writing Mechanics
Writing mechanics — punctuation and capitalization — are the foundation of a well-written 
sentence or paragraph. Without them, even the best grammar is practically useless. After 
all, a paragraph can be pretty hard to decipher if the punctuation is sloppy. That’s why all 
three Catholic high school entrance exams devote precious space to questions that test 
your knowledge of punctuation rules. And beCause Sentences just Look siLlY when 
THEY’RE capitalizEd incorrectly (case in point!), the exams also test your ability to properly 
capitalize words depending on the context in which they’re being used.
Unless you write a lot, remembering every little punctuation and capitalization rule is tough, 
so we help refresh your memory of these rules in the following sections. We also share 
some helpful strategies for spotting writing mechanics errors in sentences.
Punctuation rules for every persuasion
You use periods, commas, semicolons, and other forms of punctuation all the time when 
you write. But are you using them correctly? Punctuation rules are pretty straightforward, 
so after you have them down, you can be sure you’re practicing proper punctuation. (Note: 
Understanding the rules of punctuation is much easier when you know the rules of gram-
mar. If your handle on grammar is a little shaky, be sure to review Chapter 7.)
 The entrance exam you’re facing probably isn’t going to ask you directly about a punctua-
tion rule, but it is going to expect you to know how to the follow the rules in order to spot 
punctuation errors and choose properly punctuated sentences.
Get ready to review everything from commas and semicolons to apostrophes and quotation 
marks in the sections that follow.
Placing periods and question marks
The two simplest types of punctuation to use properly are periods and question marks. 
Periods end sentences that aren’t questions (like this one). Periods also follow initials, as in 
J. K. Rowling, and abbreviations, such as etc. But you don’t use periods for initials in agency 
names, such as ROTC and YMCA, or for commonly used shortened forms, such as ad or memo.

Part II: Vanquishing the Verbal Questions 
Question marks end direct questions, like “When will dinner be ready?” However, you 
should never put a question mark at the end of indirect questions, such as “Pam asked me 
when dinner would be ready.”
Conquering commas
The comma is perhaps the most-often-misused punctuation mark in the English language. 
When you’re dealing with commas in sentences, always know what purpose they serve. 
Don’t just place a comma in a sentence because you think it needs a pause.
Knowing these comma rules takes the guesswork out of placing commas:
 
✓ Series: In a series of three or more expressions joined by one conjunction, put a 
comma after each expression except the last one, as in the sentence “Rachel, Bryan, 
and Tyler bought sandwiches, fruit, and doughnuts for the picnic.” Notice that there’s 
no comma after Tyler and no comma before doughnuts.
 
 Commas should never separate a subject from its verb or a verb from its complement. 
(See Chapter 7 if you need to know more about the parts of a sentence.)
 
✓ Omitted words: Use a comma to replace words omitted from a sentence. In the second 
clause of the sentence “I studied with Jerry yesterday, with Pam today,” the comma 
replaces the and.
 
✓ Separation of clauses: Put a comma before the conjunction when you’re joining two 
independent clauses with a conjunction (flip to Chapter 7 for the definitions of inde-
pendent and dependent clauses). Here’s an example of what we mean: The polka-dot 
suit was Sammie’s favorite, but she didn’t wear it when she was feeling shy.
 
 You should also use a comma to set apart a beginning dependent clause from the rest 
of a sentence, as in “Because Sammie was feeling shy, she didn’t wear her polka-dot 
suit.” But don’t put in a comma when the dependent clause comes after the indepen-
dent clause. So the revised sentence looks like this: Sammie didn’t wear her polka-dot 
suit because she was feeling shy.
 
 Run-on sentences appear when a sentence with a bunch of independent clauses is 
improperly punctuated. Here’s an example: I had an interview that morning and I combed 
my hair and wore my best suit. Both “I had an interview that morning” and “I combed my 
hair and wore my best suit” are independent clauses. You can’t stick a coordinating con-
junction between them to make a sentence, but you do have three other options: put a 
comma before the first and (I had an interview that morning, and I combed my hair and 
wore my best suit), eliminate the first and and add a semicolon (I had an interview that 
morning; I combed my hair and wore my best suit), or create two separate sentences by 
putting a period after morning and taking out the first and (I had an interview that morn-
ing. I combed my hair and wore my best suit).
 
✓ Nonessentials: When a sentence includes information that’s important but not crucial 
to the meaning of the sentence, that information gets set off with commas on both 
sides (unless the nonessential info begins or ends a sentence — then you just use one 
comma). Sometimes determining whether an expression is essential is difficult, but fol-
lowing these guidelines should help:
 
• Asides consist of words such as however, in my opinion, and for example and are 
set apart from the rest of the sentence. Here’s an example: In my opinion, Sammie 
looks smashing in her polka-dot suit.
 
• Appositives provide additional information about a noun that isn’t critical to 
understanding the main idea of the sentence. In the sentence “The science 
teacher, Ms. Paul, scheduled a meeting with her top students,” Ms. Paul lets you 
know the science teacher’s name. Yet without that information, the sentence still 
retains its meaning. When a name is part of a title, as in the sentence “Professor 
Paul requested a meeting,” don’t use commas.
 
• Titles and distinctions that follow a name are always enclosed in commas. Case 
in point: Georgia White, RN, is the first speaker for career day.

61
 Chapter 6: Acing Spelling and Mechanics Questions
 
• Abbreviations such as etc., e.g., and i.e., are enclosed in commas. Here’s an exam-
ple: Tyler pulled out the sandwiches, drinks, doughnuts, etc., from the picnic basket.
 
• Dates and place names contain what can be considered nonessential information 
and are therefore punctuated with commas. For example, “Mike attended school 
in Boulder, Colorado, from September 1, 2008, to May 23, 2009.” Notice that there 
are commas on both sides of the state name and both sides of the year in the date.
 
• Nonrestrictive clauses are by definition nonessential (as you can see from the nearby 
sidebar). Because nonrestrictive clauses always provide information that doesn’t 
affect the meaning of a sentence, commas always set them apart from the rest of a 
sentence. The second clause in the sentence “The meeting took place in Ms. Paul’s 
classroom, which is just down the hall from the library” provides important informa-
tion, but the meaning of the sentence wouldn’t change if that information wasn’t there.
 
Only important information that isn’t essential to the sentence is included in a nonessential 
phrase or clause. Information that’s interesting but not important shouldn’t be included in 
the sentence at all.
Improving sentence clarity with semicolons
A semicolon looks like a period placed over a comma (;). The break made by a semicolon is 
more definite than that made by a comma but less final than that made by a period. Here 
are the times when using semicolons is appropriate:
 
✓ To join two independent yet closely related clauses without a conjunction: For example, 
the sentence “It’s almost the weekend; I can finally relax” has two independent clauses that 
are closely related, so they appear together in the same sentence separated by a semicolon.
 
✓ To begin a second clause with a conjunctive adverb: Clauses that begin with conjunc-
tive adverbs (such as accordingly, also, besides, consequently, furthermore, hence, how-
ever, indeed, likewise, moreover, nevertheless, otherwise, similarly, so, still, therefore, 
and thus) use a semicolon to separate them from another clause. Here’s an example: 
I should relax this weekend; otherwise, I’ll be tired all week. Note that a comma comes 
after the conjunctive adverb.
 
✓ To provide clarity in compound-complex sentences: Semicolons appear in sentences that 
have a numbered series or when using commas would be confusing. See what we mean in 
this sentence: The secretary’s duties include (1) creating, sending, and filing documents; 
(2) making and organizing appointments; and (3) scheduling and planning meetings.
Classifying clauses
Dependent clauses can be classified as either restric-
tive or nonrestrictive. Distinguishing between the two 
can be tricky unless you know the following:
 ✓ Restrictive clauses are vital to the meaning of a 
sentence. Without them, the sentence is no longer 
true. For example, in the sentence “Susan never 
wins long-distance races that are held in the after-
noon,” the restrictive clause “that are held in the 
afternoon” provides essential information about the 
particular type of long-distance races Susan never 
wins. The point of the sentence is that she never 
wins afternoon long-distance races.
 ✓ Nonrestrictive clauses provide clarifying informa-
tion, but they don’t have to be there for the sentence to 
make sense. In the sentence “Susan never wins long-
distance races, which are held in the afternoon,” the 
nonrestrictive clause “which are held in the afternoon” 
makes a “by the way” statement. It provides additional 
information about when Susan’s long-distance 
races are held. The main point of the sentence is that 
she never wins a long-distance race, period.
Tip: In these examples, the restrictive clause begins 
with that and the nonrestrictive clause begins with 
which. You don’t use a comma before the clause that 
begins with that because it’s a restrictive clause and an 
integral part of the sentence. However, you should use 
commas to set the nonrestrictive clause apart from the 
rest of the sentence.

Part II: Vanquishing the Verbal Questions 
Understanding the many purposes of colons
Colons have several functions. You can use them in place of periods to separate two inde-
pendent clauses (although usually semicolons fill this role). You can also use them to intro-
duce a list of specifics, long appositives and explanations, or quotations that relate to the 
clause that came before.
 
The main rule to remember regarding colons is twofold: A colon should always follow an 
independent clause, and it should never separate a verb from its complement or a preposi-
tion from its object. (If all that sounds like grammar mumbo jumbo to you, definitely read 
through Chapter 7.)
The words that come before a colon form a complete sentence, as in “Megan will be finished 
with her homework when she completes three assignments: a rough outline for an essay, 
a worksheet of math problems, and the final draft of her chemistry report.” If the words 
before the colon don’t form a complete sentence, then you’ve used the colon incorrectly, like 
this: Megan will be finished with her homework when she completes: a rough outline for an 
essay, a worksheet of math problems, and the final draft of her chemistry report.
Another hint that the preceding sentence is incorrect is the fact that the colon separates 
the verb completes from its complements — the objects outline, worksheet, and draft. An 
example of a sentence containing a colon that improperly separates a preposition from its 
object is “After finishing her assignments, Megan went to: the store, the deli, and the movie 
theater.” If you want to use a colon in this sentence, you have to keep the preposition and 
its object together, as in “After finishing her assignments, Megan went to these places: the 
store, the deli, and the movie theater.”
Colons also serve a few other purposes. They separate the hour and minutes when indicat-
ing clock time (for example, 10:28 a.m.), and they separate a main title from its subtitle, as 
in The Big Book of Punctuation: Everything You Ever Wanted to Know About Colons. Last but 
not least, colons end the salutation of a business letter (think along the lines of “Dear Dr. 
Lawrence:”).
Using dashes to shake up a sentence’s flow
Dashes typically appear in less formal writing. In addition to introducing long appositives, 
they separate a beginning series from the rest of a sentence and signal abrupt breaks in the 
continuity of a sentence. Here’s an example: A state championship, a college scholarship, 
and a Super Bowl ring — such were the dreams of the high school quarterback.
 
A dash isn’t the same as a hyphen, which is a punctuation mark used to join words. 
Hyphens have two specific purposes (although because most of the rules regarding when 
you use hyphens aren’t hard and fast, the exams likely won’t test you on ’em):
 
✓ Joining written-out compound numbers, such as seventy-two and twenty-four
 
✓ Linking two or more words that are used as a single adjective right before a noun, such 
as well-known celebrity
Knowing when (and when not) to add apostrophes
Apostrophes have two purposes: creating contractions and forming possessives. The apos-
trophe takes the place of the missing letter or letters in a contraction (think they’re [they 
are], can’t [cannot], here’s [here is], and so on). If you can show ownership of one noun by 
another, you show that possession by using an apostrophe. For example, a dog owned by a 
girl is “the girl’s dog” and an opinion of a judge is “a judge’s opinion.” Here are some rules 
for forming possessives:
 
✓ Most possessives are formed by adding ’s to the end of a singular noun. This state-
ment is true even if the noun ends in s. Here are three examples: “Mrs. Roger’s car,” 
“the committee’s decision,” and “Charles’s surgery.”

63
 Chapter 6: Acing Spelling and Mechanics Questions
 
✓ If the possessive noun is plural and ends in s, only add the apostrophe. Some exam-
ples include “the four boys’ bikes” and “the Smiths’ front porch.”
 
✓ Plural nouns that don’t end in s become possessive when you add ’s. Women’s, 
 children’s, and men’s are some examples.
 
Of course, not all possessive forms use apostrophes. Specifically, the possessive forms of 
proper pronouns have no use for apostrophes whatsoever. We strongly suggest you memo-
rize the following list of apostrophe-avoiding possessive pronouns:
 
✓ Possessive pronouns that come before other nouns: My, his, her, your, its, our, and their
 
✓ Possessive pronouns that occur at the end of a clause or are used as a subject: Mine, 
his, hers, yours, its, ours, and theirs
 
None of the possessive proper pronouns contains an apostrophe. (It’s is a contraction of it 
is, not the possessive form of it, as in “The dog wagged its tail.”) But indefinite pronouns do 
contain apostrophes, as in the sentence “Somebody’s dog chewed my carpet.”
Qualifying quotation marks
Quotation marks have three specific jobs that are tested on the various entrance exams. 
Here’s a brief breakdown:
 
✓ They indicate exact phrasing of another person’s spoken or written words. Direct 
quotes are separated from any introductions or embellishments by a comma, like this:
 
 Jeffrey shouted, “All hands on deck!”
 
 “But my hands will get dirty,” replied Steve, “and I won’t be able to stand.”
 
✓ They mark words that are used ironically or in a “so-called” sense. If someone tells 
you not to count on Dave’s offer of “help” because he rarely comes through, that 
person is using quotation marks ironically.
 
✓ They set off certain titles of short works, such as songs, short stories, essays, short 
poems, chapters, and newspaper or magazine articles. “Let It Be” (a classic song by 
The Beatles) and “The Raven” (a famous poem by Edgar Allan Poe) are two examples 
of this quotation mark function.
 
Whether a punctuation mark appears inside or outside a set of quotation marks depends 
almost entirely on what the punctuation mark is. Periods and commas always go inside a 
set of quotation marks (When she called him a “lazy bum,” Missy didn’t mean that Larry 
was homeless). Colons and semicolons, on the other hand, appear outside of quotation 
marks. Finally, if an exclamation point or question mark is part of the quoted material, it 
goes inside the quotation marks (Susan asked, “Where did you put your wallet?”); other-
wise, it appears after the last quotation mark (Have you ever listened to “Let It Be”?).
Putting it all together with an example
The entrance exam you’re facing may test several rules of punctuation in one question, like 
the following HSPT-type question does.
 
Choose the sentence that contains an error. If no sentence has an error, select Choice (D).
 
(A) It’s not enough to want to win the race; you have to work hard, too.
 
(B) When you arrive at school, check in with the office before you go to class.
 
(C) Before he went to sleep, Sam wanted to: finish his homework, brush his teeth, and 
straighten up his room.
 
(D) No mistakes

64
Part II: Vanquishing the Verbal Questions 
Each of the three choices has punctuation considerations. Choice (A) includes a semicolon 
that separates two complete thoughts; okay, there’s no problem here. It also has a word 
with an apostrophe. Because it’s is a contraction of it is, that’s also fine. Looks like Choice 
(A) has no punctuation errors. Choice (B) properly uses a comma to separate the beginning 
clause from the rest of the sentence; that one’s okay too. Choice (C) contains a colon. Check 
the words that come before the colon: Sam wanted to. Is that a complete sentence? Nope, 
which means the colon is used improperly. The correct answer to this question is Choice (C). 
(Although the question doesn’t ask you to correct the sentence, you could fix it by making 
a complete sentence with the words before the colon, as in “Before he went to sleep, Sam 
wanted to do three things: finish his homework, brush his teeth, and straighten up his room.”)
Capitalization issues, large and small
Don’t expect to get out of the testing room without first tackling a few verbal questions that 
ask you to spot capitalization errors. The first word of any sentence, as well as the first 
word of a quotation that’s a complete sentence, is always capitalized. Capitalization rules 
get trickier beyond that, so make sure you know the ones regarding
 
✓ Proper names: Capitalize the name of a particular person (Sally), place (Canada), event 
(Cherry Creek Arts Festival), language (Latin), or thing (U.S. Supreme Court). Don’t 
capitalize nouns that aren’t specific. So in the sentence “Many states hold festivals 
throughout the year,” festivals shouldn’t be capitalized.
 
 If you struggle with remembering when and when not to capitalize names, repeat this to 
yourself a few times: If a noun is the proper name of a specific entity, it should be capi-
talized; if it names a generality, it should appear in lowercase. The sentence “The sena-
tors will meet with Governor Stanton next week” demonstrates both parts of this rule.
 
✓ Family relationships: Capitalize them when they’re used like a name, as in “You know, 
Dad, you’re the best father a guy could ask for” or “Uncle Steve is my favorite uncle.”
 
✓ Titles of people: Capitalize titles that come before a person’s name, as in Professor 
John Hill, Senator June Grey, or President Hammond. Generally, professional titles that 
follow a name or stand alone should be in lowercase. For example, “John Hill, a profes-
sor of geology, will speak tonight” and “The senator and the president will attend.” 
Degrees and distinctions that follow a person’s name are capitalized, though, as in the 
case of Stephanie Stephens, MD.
 
✓ Titles of literary works, songs, articles, and so on: Capitalize the first word and all 
major words in the title, such as A Tree Grows in Brooklyn (a novel by Betty Smith).
 
✓ Days of the week, months of the year, and holidays: Always capitalize ’em. Here’s an 
example of what we mean: Next Friday, April Fool’s Day, Ms. Hammond will post the 
schedule of classes for the Fall semester. Notice how Fall is capitalized in that sen-
tence? That’s because it’s part of a title. If a season isn’t part of a title, it should be in 
lowercase, as in “I’m glad we’ll know the schedule before summer begins in June.”
 
✓ Directions: Capitalize the words east, west, north, and south only when they name a sec-
tion of the United States. For example, “People who live in the Northwest tend to travel 
south to California for their vacations.”
Quite a few questions in the exams’ Verbal sections include capitalization issues, so be on 
the lookout for the proper use of upper- and lowercase letters when you see questions like 
this one (which is in the HSPT format).

65
 Chapter 6: Acing Spelling and Mechanics Questions
 
Choose the answer that contains the error. If there is no error, pick Choice (D).
 
(A) Aunt Cathy scheduled a party for my cousin, Jerry, on Friday, March 21st, a day after 
spring begins.
 
(B) Professor Roberts decided against reading War and Peace aloud to the English class.
 
(C) The group of homesteaders traveled west to the area of the United States that is now 
considered to be the Midwest.
 
(D) No mistakes
Every sentence is capitalized (and punctuated) correctly, so the answer is Choice (D). In 
Choice (A), Aunt is part of Cathy’s name, so it’s capitalized. The reference to cousin isn’t 
part of Jerry’s name, so it shouldn’t be capitalized. The names of days and months are 
always capitalized, so Friday and March are right. In this sentence, spring isn’t part of a title, 
so it should be lowercase. Professor is used as a title in Choice (B), so it’s properly capital-
ized. The book title is capitalized and so is English because languages are capitalized. In 
Choice (C), west refers to the direction the homesteaders traveled, not a place they traveled 
to, so it correctly appears in lowercase. Midwest refers to an actual location name, so the 
capitalization is right there too.
Strategies for spotting errors in 
punctuation and capitalization
 Even when you master the rules, finding errors in sentences can be difficult. Both the HSPT 
and the TACHS give you several sentence constructions that you must check for errors. 
Sometimes no errors exist, so you have to be able to recognize perfection, too. Other times 
the questions may include all kinds of errors to look for. Finding them all can get a little 
overwhelming! Curb your frustration by developing a system for handling these questions. 
We suggest you
 
✓ Analyze each answer choice one at a time.
 
✓ Look for error clues as you read through the choices.
 
• If the sentence contains a punctuation mark, such as a comma, semicolon, or 
colon, make sure it’s used properly.
 
• If the commas check out, look for how possessives are formed to make sure an 
apostrophe isn’t misplaced or missing.
 
• Confirm that quotations are properly marked and punctuated.
 
• Look at uppercase letters to check for proper capitalization. Make sure every 
word in a place or organization name is capitalized and that there’s a good 
reason for every uppercase letter in the answer choices.
 
✓ Stop looking for errors after you find one. Mark the answer with the error (or “No mis-
takes,” if that’s the answer) on your answer sheet and move on to the next question.
Here’s a sample question for you to try. This one is in the TACHS format, where each of the 
first three answer choices is one part of one sentence.

66
Part II: Vanquishing the Verbal Questions 
 
Choose the last answer if none of the first three contains an error.
 
(A) So I wouldn’t lose my dog, spot,
 
(B) I added an address tag
 
(C) to its collar.
 
(D) No mistakes
The comma placement in Choice (A) is correct. Spot renames the dog, so you can set the 
name off with commas. The second comma works for separating the beginning clause from 
the rest of the sentence, too. But because it’s a proper name, spot should be capitalized. 
The answer is Choice (A). If you picked Choice (C), you may have thought that its should be 
it’s. But the possessive form of it is its, so that part of the sentence is fine. There’s nothing 
wrong in Choice (B).

In This Chapter
▶ Solidifying your grasp on grammar basics
▶ Sharing commonly tested usage errors so you can spot them when you need to
W
e bet you were so excited to see a chapter on grammar and usage in this book that 
you raced right here as soon as you could! Well, maybe not. In fact, you may be 
asking yourself why you have to study these questionably interesting topics in the first 
place. After all, don’t you speak English every day? The cold hard facts are that all three 
entrance exams test your knowledge of standard written English, and most of us don’t 
follow all the rules when we speak. When you enter that testing room, you need to be able 
to evaluate sentences and find errors (and sometimes even correct them!). You can’t rely 
on sounding things out to catch grammar and usage errors; you must have a plan instead. 
Never fear. This chapter reviews the rules you need to know and points out the most com-
monly tested errors.
Building a Solid Foundation: Grammar Basics
After you understand the basic rules regarding the parts of speech and the elements of a 
sentence, you pretty much have the hang of grammar. The following sections cover what 
you need to know to do well on grammar and usage questions.
Reviewing the parts of speech
Most of the usage questions ask you to evaluate sentences. Every word in a sentence has a 
purpose, known as its part of speech. The parts of speech in the English language that are 
important to know for your Catholic high school entrance exam are nouns, pronouns, verbs, 
adjectives, adverbs, conjunctions, and prepositions.
Obtaining information from nouns
You’ve undoubtedly heard nouns defined as persons, places, or things. They provide infor-
mation about what’s going on in a sentence and who or what is performing or receiving 
the action, such as the italicized nouns in the sentence “The social studies teacher gave the 
students five pages of homework regarding countries in Europe.”
Avoiding repetition with pronouns
Pronouns rename nouns and provide a way to avoid too much repetition of nouns in a sen-
tence or paragraph. You should be familiar with the three types of pronouns:

68
Part II: Vanquishing the Verbal Questions 
 
✓ Personal pronouns rename specific nouns. They take several forms: subjective, objec-
tive, possessive, and reflexive.
 
• The subjective personal pronouns are I, you, he, she, it, we, you (plural), and they. 
No surprise here, but they serve as the subjects of sentences.
 
• The objective personal pronouns are me, you, him, her, it, us, you (plural), and 
them. They appear as objects in sentences.
 
• Possessive pronouns, such as my, mine, your, yours, his, her, hers, its, our, ours, 
their, and theirs, are used to show possession of other nouns.
 
• Reflexive pronouns — myself, yourself, himself, herself, itself, ourselves, yourselves, 
and themselves — indicate that the doer and the receiver of an action are the same.
 
✓ Indefinite pronouns refer to general nouns rather than specific ones. Some common 
examples are everyone, somebody, and anything.
 
✓ Relative pronouns connect descriptions to nouns. Examples include that, which, and 
who (the subjective form), whom (the objective form), and whose (the possessive form).
Taking action with verbs
A sentence must have a verb to be complete. There are three types of verbs:
 
✓ Action verbs state what’s going on in a sentence. For example, “Sam runs.”
 
✓ The verb to be (conjugated as am, is, are, was, were, been, and being) links one 
part of a sentence to another, sort of like an equal sign in an equation. So the sen-
tence “Zach is a student” really means “Zach = student.”
 
✓ Linking verbs, like the verb to be, join the parts of a sentence together but give a 
little more information than the verb to be does. Common linking verbs are feel, 
seem, appear, look, sound, taste, and smell.
Verbs appear in a variety of tenses. Table 7-1 outlines the verb tenses that are tested most 
frequently on the Catholic high school entrance exams and gives you examples.

hours before his owner awakens him for a walk.
 Occasionally the COOP and the HSPT may include a test question that requires you to recognize 
the irregular construction of verb tenses. You usually form the past and perfect tenses by adding 
-ed to the present-tense form of a verb, but like all things in the English grammar world, excep-
tions do exist. For example, the past tense of bring isn’t bringed or even brang — it’s brought. If 
you need a refresher of irregular verb tenses for the rare occasions when you’ll face them on 
your exam, type “irregular verbs” into an Internet search engine and review the lists that appear.
Filling in the details with adjectives
Adjectives describe and clarify nouns. In the sentence “The putrid odor in the lab resulted in 
a bunch of sick students,” putrid defines the kind of odor, and sick describes the condition 
of the students. Without the adjectives, the sentence takes on a different and silly meaning: 
The odor in the lab resulted in a bunch of students.
 
When you check a sentence on your exam for errors, make sure the adjectives are posi-
tioned correctly so each adjective describes the word it’s supposed to.
Describing verbs with adverbs
Adverbs give extra information about verbs, adjectives, and other adverbs. They include all 
words and groupings of words (called adverb phrases) that answer the questions where, 
when, how, how much, and why. In the sentence “The chemistry students gradually recov-
ered from smelling the very putrid odor,” gradually explains how the students recovered.
 
Many adverbs end in ly, but not all of them do. If you can’t figure out whether a word is an 
adverb because it doesn’t end in ly, ask yourself whether it addresses where, when, how, 
how much, or why in the sentence.
Connecting with conjunctions and prepositions
Conjunctions and prepositions link the main elements of a sentence.
 
✓ Conjunctions join words, phrases, and clauses. The three types of conjunctions are 
coordinating, correlative, and subordinating. Don’t worry about memorizing these terms; 
just know that they exist.
 
• The seven coordinating conjunctions — and, but, for, nor, or, so, and yet — are the 
ones you probably come up with when you think of conjunctions.
 
• Correlative conjunctions always appear in pairs: either/or, neither/nor, not only/
but also.
 
• Subordinating conjunctions introduce dependent clauses and connect them to 
independent clauses. Although, because, if, when, and while are common exam-
ples of subordinating conjunctions. (For more on clauses, see the later “Figuring 
out phrases and clauses” section.)

70
Part II: Vanquishing the Verbal Questions 
 
✓ Prepositions join nouns to the rest of a sentence. We’d need several pages to list all 
the prepositions, but common examples are about, above, for, over, and with. Preposi-
tions always appear in prepositional phrases, which also include a noun. Prepositional 
phrases usually modify nouns (as in “the students in the band”) or verbs (as in “the 
football player ran down the field”).
Piecing together the parts of a sentence
The parts of speech described earlier in this chapter work together to form sentences. Every 
sentence has at least a subject and a verb, but most add a little (or a lot) more information.
Identifying the subject and the predicate
Every sentence has two parts: the subject and the predicate. The subject is the main actor in 
the sentence; it’s the noun that’s doing the action in the sentence or whose condition the 
sentence describes. The predicate is the verb and pretty much everything else in the sen-
tence that isn’t part of the subject. Subjects and predicates can be simple, complete, or 
complex. Table 7-2 shows you examples of each kind.

Comprehending complements
Complements are parts of the predicate that add to the meaning of the sentence. You should 
be able to recognize the following complements in a sentence:
 
✓ Predicate adjectives: Adjectives that follow linking verbs and describe something 
about the subject. An example is “The dog is brown and looks furry.”
 
✓ Predicate nouns and pronouns: Nouns that follow the verb to be and name the subject 
in a new way. “The dog is a collie” is one example of a predicate noun. In the sentence 
“It was she who arrived late,” she is a predicate pronoun.
 
✓ Direct objects: Nouns and pronouns that receive the action of action verbs. Examples 
include “Dogs eat meat” and “The dog licked her and me.”
 
✓ Indirect objects: Nouns and pronouns that receive the action of the verb when there’s 
also a direct object in the sentence. For example, “The dog gave Julia the stick” and 
“The dog gave her the stick.”
 Your entrance exam won’t ask you to locate complements in sentences, but if you know 
what they are, you’ll be able to spot them and the errors that may accompany them.
Figuring out phrases and clauses
A sentence usually contains single words, phrases, or clauses that convey more information 
about the sentence’s main message. Phrases and clauses are groups of words that work 
together to form a single part of speech, like an adverb or adjective. The difference between 
phrases and clauses is that clauses contain their own subjects and phrases don’t.

71
 Chapter 7: Getting a Grip on Grammar and Usage
There are two types of clauses: independent and dependent. Understanding the difference 
between the two helps you recognize sentence fragments and reference errors as well as 
punctuation errors (see Chapter 6 for more about punctuation).
 
✓ Independent clauses express complete thoughts and can stand as sentences by them-
selves. The sentence “Jeff opened the door, and the cat slipped out” contains two inde-
pendent clauses.
 
✓ Dependent clauses express incomplete thoughts and are therefore sentence frag-
ments if left by themselves. “Although the cat slipped out” is an example of a depen-
dent clause. To convert any dependent clause into a complete sentence, you must add 
an independent clause, as in “Although the cat slipped out, Jeff caught him before he 
could run away.”
Knowing the rules of grammar and usage helps you spot errors, but the entrance exam 
you’re facing may also test you directly on recognizing parts of speech. Here’s an example 
of how one of these questions may appear on the TACHS. (For additional grammar- and 
usage-related questions, flip to Chapter 9.)
 
What is an adverb in this sentence?
 
 The crafty burglar in the black cape slipped away silently.
 
(A) crafty
 
(B) in
 
(C) burglar
 
(D) silently
Adverbs answer the questions where, when, how, or why. Silently tells you how the burglar 
slipped away, so the answer is Choice (D). (Note: Away is also an adverb because it answers 
the question of where, but it isn’t one of the possible answers.) Choice (B) is a preposition, 
and Choice (A) is an adjective that describes the noun burglar. Because burglar is a noun, it 
can’t be an adverb, making Choice (C) incorrect.
Spotting Mistakes: Commonly Tested Errors
The TACHS, HSPT, and COOP test a bunch of English usage rules. The next sections high-
light the errors that appear pretty frequently so you’re prepared to spot ’em without 
breaking a sweat.
Picking up on pronoun errors
All three entrance exams test you on how to use pronouns correctly. A pronoun’s job is to 
rename a noun, so it should refer clearly to the noun it renames. A pronoun also needs to 
be in agreement with the noun it represents, meaning it must keep the same number (singu-
lar or plural) and appear in the proper form (subjective or objective).
Recognizing unclear pronoun references
If you can’t tell which noun a pronoun refers to, something’s wrong with the sentence. It, 
that, this, these, and which are some of the more common pronouns involved in this type of 
error, but no pronoun is immune to this issue. For example, the pronoun reference in the 
sentence “Bob and Tom went to the store, and he purchased a candy bar” is unclear. Because 
the subject of the first clause is plural, the pronoun he could refer to either Bob or Tom.

72
Part II: Vanquishing the Verbal Questions 
Finding faulty pronoun references
A pronoun must agree in number with the noun (or other pronoun) it refers to. In other 
words, plural nouns take plural pronouns, and singular nouns take singular pronouns. So 
the sentence “You can determine the ripeness of citrus by handling them and noting their 
color” has improper noun-pronoun agreement. Citrus is a singular noun, so using plural pro-
nouns to refer to it is wrong. To correct this sentence, you’d say, “You can determine the 
ripeness of citrus by handling it and noting its color.”
Noticing improper pronoun forms
A pronoun needs to be in the same form (objective or subjective) as the noun it’s substitut-
ing for. (See the earlier “Avoiding repetition with pronouns” section for a list of pronoun 
forms.) That makes sense, doesn’t it? The problem is that some of the rules about pronoun 
forms have been violated so often in general speech that errors may not seem wrong to you 
when you see them.
 
Make sure you know these pronoun rules:
 
✓ Use the subjective form when a pronoun is the subject of a clause. This construction 
is incorrect: Amy is taller than me. Why? Because me is the subject of an understood 
clause, and you can’t use an objective pronoun as a subject. The correct construction 
is “Amy is taller than I (am).”
 
✓ Use the subjective form of pronouns in compound subjects. The construction “Him 
and me saw a movie last night” is wrong. Him and me is the compound subject of the 
sentence, so you have to use subjective forms. The correctly written version of the 
example sentence is “He and I saw a movie last night.”
 
✓ Use the objective form of pronouns that serve as objects. Writing “Jessie eats lunch 
with Dave and I every day” is inaccurate. I is the object of the preposition with, so it 
has to be in the objective form, as in “Jessie eats lunch with Dave and me every day.”
 
✓ Use reflexive pronouns only when the receiver and the doer of an action are the 
same. The sentence “Please return the forms to the secretary and myself” is wrong 
because you’re not the one returning the forms; you’re telling someone else to give 
the forms to you and your secretary. The correct version of this sentence is “Please 
return the forms to the secretary and me.” (Note that a sentence such as “He came up 
with the idea all by himself” is accurate because the doer and the receiver of the action 
are the same person.)
 
✓ Use who to refer to people, which to refer to animals and things, and that to refer to 
both. You can’t say, “There’s the police officer which pulled me over yesterday.” But 
you can say, “There’s the police officer who pulled me over yesterday.” (You can also 
say, “There’s the police officer that pulled me over yesterday.”)
Getting subjects and verbs to agree
Okay, so subjects and verbs don’t actually fight, but they do sometimes disagree. To bring 
peace to the situation, you must pair plural subjects with plural verbs and singular subjects 
with singular verbs. To find errors in subject-verb agreement, locate the subject and the 
verb that goes with it.
When the subject isn’t simple or obvious, finding it may be difficult. Just take a look at this 
sentence: Terry’s continual quest to embellish his truck with a ton of amenities make it 
hard for him to stick to a budget. The subject is quest (a singular noun), but the interjection 
of “to embellish his truck with a ton of amenities” between the subject and verb may con-
fuse you into thinking that amenities (a plural noun) is the subject. However, amenities can’t 
be the subject of the sentence because it’s the object of a preposition, and a noun can’t be 
an object and a subject at the same time.

73
 Chapter 7: Getting a Grip on Grammar and Usage
 
To spot subject-verb agreement errors in a complex sentence, focus on the main elements 
of the sentence by crossing out words and phrases that aren’t essential to the point. Then 
you can check the subjects and verbs to make sure they agree. When you remove all the 
fluff from the sentence “Terry’s continual quest to embellish his truck with a ton of ameni-
ties make it hard for him to stick to a budget,” you get “Terry’s quest make it hard.” Now the 
problem is obvious! The singular noun quest requires the singular verb makes.
Calling out sentence fragments
Sentence fragments are incomplete sentences. They usually show up on the various entrance 
exams either as dependent clauses that pretend to convey complete thoughts or as a bunch 
of words with something that looks like a verb but doesn’t act like one.
 
Always keep the following points about sentence fragments in mind:
 
✓ Dependent clauses that appear by themselves are sentence fragments because they 
don’t provide complete thoughts. Case in point: “Although the stairs are steep” is far 
from a complete thought.
 
✓ Phrases with a verb phrase rather than a verb can appear complete if you don’t read 
them carefully. In the sentence “The peacefulness of a morning warmed by the summer 
sun,” warmed looks like a verb but doesn’t act like one. The lack of a verb in this “sen-
tence” leaves you hanging. You’re not told what you’re supposed to know about “the 
peacefulness of a morning warmed by the summer sun.”
 
Having trouble spotting sentence fragments? Try reading the words under your breath. That 
way you should be able to tell whether they express a complete thought.
Dealing with verb tense issues
Verb forms must be in the proper tense for a sentence to make sense. Review the purposes 
for each verb tense in Table 7-1 in the earlier “Taking action with verbs” section so you can 
be better prepared to spot incorrect tenses. For example, you know that using future per-
fect tense in the sentence “Yesterday, I will have read 300 pages” is incorrect because yes-
terday is in the past, and the future perfect tense isn’t used to refer to past events.
Also, the other verbs in a sentence give you clues as to what tense a particular verb should 
be in. All verbs in a sentence should be in the same general tense. So the sentence “I had 
read 300 pages in the book when my friends invite me to see a movie” must be incorrect 
because it mixes tenses. Had read is past perfect tense, so the other verb in the sentence 
should be changed from present tense, invite, to past tense, invited.
 
Whenever you see a verb in a usage question, check to make sure it agrees with its subject 
and that it’s in the proper tense.
Identifying problems with parallelism
All phrases joined by conjunctions should be constructed in the same manner. For example, 
this sentence has a problem with parallelism: Ann spent the morning taking practice tests, 
studying word lists, and she read a chapter in a novel. Not all of the elements joined by the 
and in this sentence are constructed in the same way. The first two elements are phrases 
that begin with a gerund (or -ing form); the last element is a clause. Changing read to a 
gerund and dropping she solves the problem: Ann spent the morning taking practice tests, 
studying word lists, and reading a chapter in a novel.

74
Part II: Vanquishing the Verbal Questions 
 
When you see a sentence with a list of any sort, check for a lack of parallelism.
Eliminating redundancy and wordiness
Sentences that exhibit awkward, wordy, redundant, or unclear constructions can be gram-
matically correct but still need fixing. The good news is that the right answer often just 
sounds better.
 
✓ Passive rather than active voice makes a sentence seem weak and wordy. Passive 
voice beats around the bush to make a point. The passive voice in this sentence hides 
who’s doing the action: The speech was heard by most of the students. The sentence 
isn’t technically incorrect, but it’s better said this way: Most of the students heard the 
speech. Notice also that the active-voice sentence uses fewer words. When given the 
chance, choose active voice over passive voice.
 
✓ Repetitive language adds unnecessary words. A sentence shouldn’t use more words 
than it needs to. Saying “The custodian added an additional row of desks to accommodate 
the large class” is silly. The construction of “added an additional” is needlessly repetitive. 
This is better: The custodian added a row of desks to accommodate the large class.
 
A sentence that uses an excessive amount of words to convey its message probably has 
construction problems. Think of how you can tighten it up and make it active.
Sticking to standard expressions
English speakers use certain words in certain ways for no particular reason other than 
because that’s the way it is. But sometimes even native English speakers fail to use standard 
expressions correctly. It’s common to hear people use further rather than farther when they 
mean distance or less rather than fewer when they refer to a number of countable items.
The only way to know the proper construction of standard expressions is to study them, 
but you probably know many of them already. To help you along, Table 7-3 lists some com-
monly tested expressions and how to use them correctly.

lying) to mean the act of reclining 
or the state of resting or reclining.
Note: To further confuse matters, 
the present tense of lay and past 
tense of lie are both lay.
I always lay a plastic cloth over 
the table to protect it. Grandma is

hours. I couldn’t find my hat in the

floor. I think it has lain there for 
several weeks and would be lying 
there still if I hadn’t seen it when I 
dropped my gloves.
Recognizing misplaced modifiers
The entrance exam you’re facing may test how well you can spot errors in modification. 
Modifier is a fancy term for words or phrases, such as adjectives and adverbs, that give 
more information about other words, usually nouns. Errors occur when modifiers are too 
far away from the words they modify and when what they’re modifying is unclear.

76
Part II: Vanquishing the Verbal Questions 
 
✓ Modifiers should be as close to the words they modify as possible. This sentence is 
incorrect because of a misplaced modifier: Sam set down the speech he wrote on the 
desk. It sounds like Sam wrote the speech on the desk. Writing “Sam set down his 
speech on the desk” is much better.
 
✓ Beginning phrases must have a clear reference. A beginning phrase in a sentence 
always modifies the subject of the sentence, so the sentence has to be constructed in a 
way that relates the phrase to the subject. Consider this sentence: Driving down the 
road, a deer darted in front of me, and I had to swerve to miss it. If you read that liter-
ally, you may believe the deer drove down the road because the beginning phrase 
“driving down the road” refers to the subject of the sentence, which is deer. To make it 
clear that the driver drove down the road and not the deer, you’d need to rewrite the 
sentence as follows: As I was driving down the road, a deer darted in front of me, and I 
had to swerve to miss it.
 
 Beginning clauses don’t have to modify the subject of the sentence because they have 
a subject in them, so often the best way to correct the sentence is to make the phrase a 
clause. (For more on clauses, see the earlier “Figuring out phrases and clauses” section.)
 
Because the test-makers tend to focus on modification errors involving beginning phrases, 
you should check for this error every time you see a sentence with a beginning phrase.
Here’s a sample TACHS-style question that tests your ability to find a usage error. Chapter 9 
features additional practice questions you can try.
 
Choose the part of the sentence that contains an error, if any.
 
(A) Much of the work performed by teachers,
 
(B) like completing paperwork and creating lesson plans,
 
(C) go unnoticed by their students.
 
(D) (No mistakes)
Read each part of the sentence together as a whole. Is there a problem? Isolate the main 
elements of the sentence:
 
✓ The subject is work.
 
✓ The main verb is go.
 
✓ The complement is unnoticed.
The essential sentence states that “work go unnoticed.” Well, that doesn’t sound right! You 
know there’s an error, so cross out Choice (D). The problem is in Choice (C). To correctly 
construct the last part of the sentence, go should be changed to the singular verb goes to 
make it agree with the singular subject work. The rest of the sentence is fine. (You may have 
thought there was a parallel structure error in Choice (B), but both duties have the same 
-ing form.)

Solving the Puzzle of Verbal 
Reasoning Questions
In This Chapter
▶ Getting to know the four kinds of verbal reasoning questions
▶ Discovering the essential elements of informal logic
▶ Figuring out how to approach logic questions on the COOP and the HSPT
I
f you’re taking the HSPT or COOP, get ready to encounter verbal reasoning questions, 
problems that specifically test your critical reasoning skills. (That’s right, TACHS-takers; 
you don’t have any of these babies on your test, so feel free to skip this chapter!) These 
questions are kind of like the logic puzzles you might find in a book of brainteasers. Most of 
them appear on the COOP in its Verbal Reasoning—Words and Verbal Reasoning—Context 
sections (how appropriate). The HSPT has a few of them spread throughout its Verbal Skills 
section. The COOP features a few different types of verbal reasoning questions; the HSPT 
has but a couple. In this chapter, we give you everything you need to know to answer every 
last verbal reasoning question on both tests.
 There’s one COOP question type that we don’t cover here. Within the COOP’s Verbal 
Reasoning—Words section, you’ll see some questions where you’re given three underlined 
words and asked to find a fourth word that has a similar meaning. These verbal reasoning 
questions are essentially synonym questions, so you should approach them by following 
the guidelines for answering synonym questions (presented in Chapter 3).
Introducing the Types of Verbal 
Reasoning Questions
Verbal reasoning questions on the COOP and HSPT come in four different types:
 
✓ What element does the question word need to make it what it is?
 
✓ What’s the missing word in the row?
 
✓ Which word doesn’t belong?
 
✓ What must be true?
 All four types of verbal reasoning questions appear on the COOP; the HSPT contains 
questions that are similar to the third and fourth types.

78
Part II: Vanquishing the Verbal Questions 
Deciding what’s necessary
On the COOP, you may be shown an underlined word followed by four answer options and 
then asked to pick the answer that describes a “necessary part” of the word in the question. 
Sounds like mumbo jumbo, we know, but take a minute to hear us out.
 
For an answer option to be absolutely essential to the question word’s definition or purpose 
(in other words, for it to be the “necessary part”), you must be able to answer “yes” to the 
following questions:
 
✓ Does the answer choice describe the real meaning of the word in the question?
 
✓ Does the answer choice tell me the overriding purpose of the word in the question?
 
✓ Does the answer choice describe an element of the word in the question that’s so 
important that the word wouldn’t exist without it?
Getting a “no” answer to one or more of these questions should help you eliminate incor-
rect answers for a necessary-part question. Following are a couple examples of necessary-
part questions; we walk you through the thought process so you can feel confident when 
you face these questions on the COOP.
 
mystery
 
(A) novel
 
(B) detective
 
(C) secrecy
 
(D) solution
Think about the nature of a mystery. If there’s a mystery, something is unknown. Eliminate 
choices that don’t describe the essential element of not knowing. What about Choice (A)? 
Mystery novels exist, but a mystery doesn’t have to be told in a novel to be a mystery. A mys-
tery without a novel would still be a mystery. Toss out Choice (A). A detective, Choice (B), 
tries to solve a mystery, but even if no detective showed up to figure out the mystery, the 
mystery would still exist. A mystery doesn’t require a solution. In fact, after there’s a solution, 
a mystery is no longer a mystery. So Choice (D) actually describes something that’s an unnec-
essary part of a mystery. Now you’re left with Choice (C), secrecy. If a mystery didn’t contain 
an element of secrecy, would it still be a mystery? No, the very nature of a mystery is that 
something is unknown, hidden, or secret. Choice (C) is the correct answer.
 
parka
 
(A) fashion
 
(B) comfort
 
(C) snow
 
(D) warmth
Eliminate answer choices that don’t state the primary reason for wearing a parka. Sure, you 
can wear a parka to make a fashion statement, but a parka isn’t necessarily fashionable. 
Choice (A) isn’t right. A cozy parka may offer comfort, but comfort isn’t the main reason you 
wear a parka. (You may want to leave Choice (B) alone until you read through the rest of the 
choices, though.) Snow isn’t the only condition that necessitates wearing a parka; you could 
need a parka because it’s supercold out without a trace of precipitation. Eliminate Choice (C). 
You wear a parka for warmth in all sorts of chilly conditions. The primary reason for a 
parka — its essential purpose for existing — is to provide warmth, which means Choice (D) 
is a better answer than Choice (B).

 Chapter 8: Solving the Puzzle of Verbal Reasoning Questions
Filling in the blank
If you enjoyed Mad Libs as a child, as in the story game where you got to fill in the blanks to 
your heart’s content, then you’re going to love this second type of verbal reasoning ques-
tion (found only on the COOP, we might add). The fill-in-the-blank question type provides 
you with two rows of three words. The words in the top row are related to each other, and 
the words in the bottom row are related in the same way. However, one of the words in the 
bottom row is missing. Your mission? To find the answer choice that fills in the blank by 
keeping the proper relationship.
 Fill-in-the-blank verbal reasoning questions are really just another way that the COOP tests 
you on analogies. (We guess the COOP test-makers feel their pretty picture analogies just 
aren’t enough relationship training for you.) Fortunately, the COOP doesn’t give you very 
many of them — only about four or five. To do your best on these questions, head to 
Chapter 4 to review our technique for solving analogy questions.
Try this sample fill-in-the-blank question for practice.
 
quick 
intellectual 
genius
 
 
stupid 
obtuse
 
(A) slow
 
(B) acute
 
(C) insensitive
 
(D) smart
The relationship among the three words in the first row shows greater degrees of intelli-
gence from the first word to the third. The second row has the same type of relationship as 
the first, which means it also moves toward a greater degree of its topic from the first word 
to the third one. The first word in the second row is missing, but you know the second and 
third words. Both have to do with a lack of intelligence. The third word is a greater degree 
of stupidity than the second, which tells you you’re looking for a word that shows a little 
lesser degree of stupidity than stupid.
Eliminate Choice (D) immediately because it’s the opposite of stupid. Choice (B) is also 
an opposite; acute is the opposite of obtuse (as we explain in Chapter 12). The process of 
elimination leaves you with Choices (A) and (C). Insensitivity isn’t the same as stupidity, so 
the best answer is Choice (A). To be slow is to be unintelligent to a lesser degree than 
stupid.
Selecting the word that isn’t like the others
Both the COOP and the HSPT contain questions that ask you to choose a word from among 
the answer choices that doesn’t belong with the other options. These questions may fall 
under the verbal reasoning category, but they’re essentially vocabulary questions. Three 
words are synonymous or analogous; one word isn’t. (Read Chapter 3 for tips on how to 
recognize synonyms and Chapter 4 for advice on spotting analogies.)
 
The word that doesn’t belong can be an antonym, but it doesn’t have to be. As long as it 
doesn’t relate to the other three words in some way, it doesn’t belong.
The COOP and HSPT questions that ask for the word that doesn’t belong look almost identi-
cal. Here’s an example.

80
Part II: Vanquishing the Verbal Questions 
 
Which word does not belong with the others?
 
(A) coat
 
(B) shoe
 
(C) sock
 
(D) slipper
Examine the answer choices carefully to uncover a relationship. All four options are articles 
of clothing, which means you need to find a more specific relationship among three of them. 
Choices (B), (C), and (D) are all items of clothing worn on the feet, whereas Choice (A) 
covers the upper body. Therefore, Choice (A) doesn’t belong with the others and is the 
 correct answer. See how easy and fun this question type can be?
Determining truth for logic questions
Some verbal reasoning questions on the COOP and HSPT ask you to use informal logic. On 
the COOP, you evaluate a series of two or more statements and choose the answer that 
must be true based on the statements. The HSPT provides you with a few statements fol-
lowed by a conclusion; it then asks you to determine whether the conclusion is true, false, 
or uncertain.
A fair number of logic questions appear on the Catholic high school entrance exams (20 on 
the COOP and about 10 on the HSPT, to be exact). That’s why we devote the rest of this 
chapter to telling you how to perform your best on this question type.
Grasping the Basics of Informal Logic
You can do well on the COOP’s and HSPT’s logic questions without knowing anything about 
informal logic, but understanding a few of the basic terms and concepts makes logic ques-
tions easier to answer. For starters, you should know that a logical argument has two basic 
components and two main types of reasoning.
 
A logical argument consists of premises and a conclusion. The premises give the supporting 
evidence that you can draw a conclusion from. For example, here’s an argument with two 
premises and a conclusion: All cheerleaders are strong. Amy is a cheerleader. Therefore, 
Amy is strong. The premises in the argument are that “all cheerleaders are strong” and 
“Amy is a cheerleader.” Because these statements provide supporting evidence for the third 
statement, you have no logical choice but to conclude that Amy is strong.
The sections that follow introduce you to the types of reasoning you can use to solve logic 
questions as well as ways of spotting faulty logic.
Drawing conclusions
Every logical argument has premises and a conclusion, but not every argument reaches a 
conclusion in the same way. Some require deductive reasoning, and others require induc-
tive reasoning. (You use a combination of both types of reasoning to answer COOP and 
HSPT logic questions.)

81
 Chapter 8: Solving the Puzzle of Verbal Reasoning Questions
Moving from the general to the specific: Deductive reasoning
With deductive reasoning, you come up with a specific conclusion from general premises. 
The great thing about deductive reasoning is that if the premises are true, the conclusion 
must be true. We used deductive reasoning in the previous section to determine that Amy is 
strong. Here’s another example of deductive reasoning:
 
✓ All zebras have stripes. This is the general premise about all zebras.
 
✓ Butch is a zebra. This is the more specific premise about a particular zebra.
 
✓ Therefore, Butch has stripes. This is the specific conclusion about a particular trait of 
a particular zebra.
If it’s true that all zebras have stripes and that Butch is a zebra, it absolutely must be true 
that Butch has stripes.
 
In order to apply deductive reasoning properly, the more specific premise of an argument 
must share an element of the general premise. That’s the only way the resulting conclusion 
can be true without the shadow of a doubt.
Going from specific to general: Inductive reasoning
Inductive reasoning develops a general conclusion from specific premises. So the conclusion 
of an argument that uses inductive reasoning can be false — even if all the premises are 
true. With inductive reasoning, the conclusion is really your best guess based on what you 
have to work with. That’s because an inductive-reasoning argument relies on less complete 
information than a deductive-reasoning argument does.
Consider the following example of an inductive-reasoning argument:
 
✓ Butch is a zebra and has stripes. Specific premise about one zebra.
 
✓ Sydney is a zebra and has stripes. Specific premise about one zebra.
 
✓ Koda is a zebra and has stripes. Specific premise about one zebra.
 
✓ Shadow is a zebra and has stripes. Specific premise about one zebra.
 
✓ Therefore, it is likely that most zebras have stripes. General conclusion about most 
zebras.
Because an inductive-reasoning argument derives general conclusions from specific exam-
ples, you can’t come up with a statement that absolutely must be true. In this case, you 
can’t say that every single zebra has stripes. The best you can say, even if all the premises 
are true, is that the conclusion can be or is likely to be true. The truth of the conclusion is 
uncertain.
Recognizing faulty logic
 
When you evaluate conclusions for any logic question — whether it’s a deductive-reasoning-
based one or an inductive-reasoning-based one — watch for these flaws in logic:
 
✓ Conclusions that assume too much: Don’t choose conclusions that make assertions 
about stuff that isn’t clearly stated in the premises. For example, if you’re told that high 
school girls receive better grades in science courses than high school boys, you can’t 
automatically conclude that high school girls are smarter than high school boys. The 
premises don’t tell you what the grade differences in other subjects may be, nor do 
they tell you that good grades are a proper indicator of intelligence.

82
Part II: Vanquishing the Verbal Questions 
 
✓ Irrelevant conclusions: Avoid choosing conclusions that are off topic. If the premises 
state that Jack creates paper airplanes, it isn’t logical to conclude from this bit of infor-
mation that Jack would make a good pilot. Being a good pilot has nothing to do with 
making paper airplanes.
 
✓ Conclusions that state that what’s true for some or many must be true for all: A 
bunch of specific examples doesn’t justify a general conclusion about the whole. So 
even though you know that most people leave the office at 5 p.m. and that Jack works 
in an office, you can’t say for sure that Jack goes home at 5 p.m.
 
✓ Conclusions that are based on premises that aren’t linked with a common reference: 
If you’re told that Cosmo is south of the North Star and north of the sky station and 
that the rocket is north of Cosmo, you know nothing about the relationship of the 
rocket and the North Star. Why? Because no common element links the rocket and the 
North Star to clarify their relationship.
Puzzling Out Logic Questions
Thinking straight on logic problems requires some practice, especially when you take into 
account that the approach for solving the COOP’s logic questions is a little different than 
the approach for solving the HSPT’s logic questions.
Coping with the COOP’s logic questions
Logic questions on the COOP give you the premises and ask you to find the most logical 
conclusion from four options in the answer choices. Follow these steps to keep focused on 
the task at hand:
 
1. Analyze the premises to define exactly what they state without making assumptions.
 
2. Eliminate answer choices that require faulty logic.
 
3. Unless you’re told otherwise, choose the conclusion that must be true according to 
the statements.
Now we show you how to put these steps into action. 
 
Find the statement that is true based on the information provided.
 
Sophie lives in Scooterville, a small town outside of the city of Livingston. Every weekend 
she and her mother travel to Livingston to shop for groceries.
 
(A) Livingston is the closest city to Scooterville.
 
(B) Most of the residents in Scooterville shop for groceries in Livingston.
 
(C) Scooterville is boring.
 
(D) Livingston has a store that sells groceries.
First, figure out what you know from the premises. You know that Scooterville is a small 
town and that Livingston is a city. Scooterville is located outside of Livingston. Sophie lives 
in Scooterville. She has a mother. She goes with her mother to Livingston every weekend. 
She buys groceries in Livingston.
Then think about what you don’t know based on the premises. The information in the ques-
tion doesn’t tell you anything about the characteristics of Scooterville other than its size. Nor 
does it reveal any details about the activities of the other Scooterville residents. It doesn’t 
state exactly when Sophie and her mother shop, why they shop in Livingston, or how long it 

83
 Chapter 8: Solving the Puzzle of Verbal Reasoning Questions
takes them to travel from Scooterville to Livingston. It also says nothing about any other 
towns or cities.
Great. Now you can immediately eliminate answer choices that rely on any of the details 
you’ve established that you don’t know. You don’t know about other towns or cities, so you 
can’t assume that there’s no other city closer to Scooterville than Livingston. Cross out 
Choice (A). Remember: What’s true for some isn’t necessarily true for all, so just because 
Sophie and her mother shop in Livingston doesn’t mean others do too. Toss Choice (B). 
Choice (C) is irrelevant. The premises don’t discuss the characteristics of Scooterville, so 
you can’t make assumptions about whether it provides stimulating activity or not. The best 
answer is Choice (D). Because Sophie and her mother shop for groceries in Livingston, you 
know that there must be some place there that sells groceries.
Handling the HSPT’s logic questions
Logic questions on the HSPT consist of premises, a conclusion that you must evaluate, and 
three (that’s right, only three) possible answers — true, false, and uncertain. If you decide 
that a conclusion is uncertain, then you’re admitting that there’s not enough information 
in the premises to say whether the conclusion is true or false.
 The HSPT tosses its logic questions into its Verbal Skills section. All the other questions in 
this section have four answer options, which means you need to pay extra attention when 
you hit the three-answer-option logic questions. Even though the questions have only three 
answer options, the answer sheet may have bubbles for four. If you mistakenly mark 
Choice (D) for one of these questions, you’re harming your score for no good reason.
 
Many of the HSPT’s logic questions are easy enough to figure out in your head, but some-
times you may want to visualize them by drawing a helpful diagram. Venn diagrams use cir-
cles to show how things are related. They work best for the few questions that classify 
information according to groups or characteristics; these questions usually begin with the 
word all. Line diagrams work well for questions that compare and position people, places, 
or things.
This next question is an example of one that’s easily solvable with the aid of a Venn diagram.
 
All prupel rocks are smooth. The rock I found is not smooth. The rock I found is prupel. If 
the first two statements are true, the third statement is
 
(A) true
 
(B) false
 
(C) uncertain
Smooth
Prupel
Rock I found

84
Part II: Vanquishing the Verbal Questions 
The diagram shows that you have enough information to determine whether the conclusion 
is true; eliminate Choice (C). Because all pruple rocks are smooth, the entire pruple circle 
fits in the smooth circle. The rock I found isn’t smooth, which means it doesn’t intersect 
with the smooth circle at all. If it doesn’t intersect with the smooth circle, it can’t intersect 
with the pruple circle. Consequently, the rock can’t be pruple, which means the conclusion 
is false, Choice (B).
 The HSPT uses nonsense words (like, say, prupel) in its logic questions so you won’t use 
your own knowledge about things to answer them. Silly, we know; giggle to yourself at the 
test-makers’ ridiculousness and move on.
Try your hand at this HSPT logic question to see how using line diagrams can be helpful.
 
The Brown Building is taller than the Nelson Building. The Stephens Building is shorter than 
the Nelson Building. The Brown Building is the tallest of the three. If the first two statements 
are true, the third statement is
 
(A) true
 
(B) false
 
(C) uncertain
As you read through the premises, create a line diagram that orders the buildings by 
decreasing size: Brown → Nelson → Stephens. Brown is the tallest of the three buildings, so 
the conclusion is true, Choice (A).

In This Chapter
▶ Getting your fill of vocabulary, analogy, and language questions
▶ Giving reading comprehension and written composition questions a go
▶ Preparing for the COOP’s and HSPT’s verbal reasoning questions
T
he HSPT, COOP, and TACHS feature a wide variety of verbal question types. This chap-
ter gives you a sampling of all of them in one place. Each section contains several prac-
tice questions and explanations of the correct answers. Answer the questions on your own 
before you read the explanations — that means no looking ahead! And be sure to review all 
the answer explanations, even for the questions you answered correctly. Something you 
read there may help you with a future question.
Sampling a Mix of Vocabulary Questions
The questions in this section test your vocabulary skills. We give you two HSPT/TACHS-
style vocabulary-in-context questions, one HSPT most-nearly-means question, two HSPT/
COOP-style doesn’t-belong questions, and one HSPT antonym question. If after checking 
your answers you find you need a vocabulary refresher, see Chapter 3.
 
1. a fruitless gesture
 
(A) peachy
 
(B) futile
 
(C) cheery
 
(D) hopeful
When a plant bears fruit, it’s productive. So, a gesture that’s fruitless is unproductive or 
ineffective. Look for the answer that has a negative connotation. Don’t be tempted by 
Choice (A); peachy is a slang term that means “wonderful or groovy.” Because Choices (A), 
(C), and (D) have positive meanings, you can eliminate them and pick Choice (B). Futile 
means “ineffective or wasted.” Correct Answer: Choice (B)
 
2. a daring feat
 
(A) journey
 
(B) memento
 
(C) limb
 
(D) accomplishment

86
Part II: Vanquishing the Verbal Questions 
Immediately cross out Choices (B) and (C) because using daring to describe a memento or 
limb doesn’t make sense. You’re down to a daring journey or a daring accomplishment. A 
feat is an act or achievement, which means Choice (D) is a better answer than Choice (A). 
Correct Answer: Choice (D)
 
3. Puzzle most nearly means
 
(A) brainteaser
 
(B) explanation
 
(C) jigsaw
 
(D) sport
Both a puzzle and a brainteaser, Choice (A), require you to figure out the answer to a mys-
tery. Choice (B) is the opposite of puzzle, Choice (C) is a tool you use to create some types 
of puzzles, and Choice (D) is unrelated. Correct Answer: Choice (A)
 
4. Which word does not belong with the others?
 
(A) glove
 
(B) shirt
 
(C) hat
 
(D) ring
Choices (A), (B), and (C) are articles of clothing. Choice (D) is jewelry and therefore doesn’t 
belong with the other words. Correct Answer: Choice (D)
 
5. Which word does not belong with the others?
 
(A) notice
 
(B) spot
 
(C) drop
 
(D) observe
It’s probably clear to you that Choices (A), (B), and (D) have similar meanings. They’re all 
ways of saying to become aware or to see. The answer that doesn’t fit is Choice (C), drop, 
because it isn’t related to seeing. Correct Answer: Choice (C)
 
6. Bliss is the opposite of
 
(A) enjoyment
 
(B) misery
 
(C) kiss
 
(D) confusion
This particular question is asking for the antonym. Bliss is a positive word that means “delight 
or heaven,” so the right answer will have a negative meaning. Choices (A) and (C) are positive; 
get rid of them. The remaining answers are Choices (B) and (D). Confusion is the opposite of 
understanding, and misery is the opposite of delight. Correct Answer: Choice (B)

87
 Chapter 9: Giving Your Verbal Skills a Workout with Practice Questions
Testing Yourself on COOP- and HSPT-Style 
Analogies
Analogy questions appear in one of two forms, depending on the Catholic high school entrance 
exam you’re taking. Two of the questions in this section appear in the COOP’s picture-analogy 
style, and the other two questions are word analogies like the kind you find on the HSPT. Refer 
to Chapter 4 if you need assistance solving analogy questions of either type.
 
1. 
(A)
(B)
(C)
(D)
Your first inclination may be to think that a worm belongs on a hook. When you apply this 
sentence to the second analogy, you have these options:
 
✓ Cheese doesn’t belong on a fish. Eliminate Choice (A).
 
✓ Cheese could belong on a mousetrap.
 
✓ Cheese doesn’t belong on a lake; it’d get soggy. Cross out Choice (C).
 
✓ Cheese could belong on a cracker.
Looks like you have two possible answer choices. To pick the right one, make your sentence 
more specific. When a worm is on a hook, it’s being used as bait to catch fish. When cheese 
is on a mousetrap, Choice (B), it’s being used as bait to catch mice. You don’t think of 
cheese on a cracker, Choice (D), as bait. Correct Answer: Choice (B)
 
2. 
(A)
(B)
(C)
(D)

88
Part II: Vanquishing the Verbal Questions 
This part-of-a-whole analogy may be a little easier for you to figure out. A window is the part 
of a house that lets in light, just like a porthole is the part of a ship that lets in light. Some 
doors have windows, but they don’t have portholes, which means Choice (A) can’t be right. 
Skyscrapers don’t have portholes, and thinking of a chair with a porthole is ridiculous. 
Correct Answer: Choice (C)
 
3. Sleeve is to arm as glove is to
 
(A) shoulder
 
(B) hand
 
(C) shirt
 
(D) woman
Form a sentence out of the analogy. The function of a sleeve is to cover an arm, and the func-
tion of a glove is to cover a hand, Choice (B). A glove doesn’t cover a shoulder, shirt, or 
woman. Correct Answer: Choice (B)
 
4. Tall is to giant as short is to
 
(A) tiny
 
(B) large
 
(C) elevated
 
(D) unimportant
This is a degree relationship; tall and giant both mean big, but giant is the larger version of 
tall. Tall has a similar meaning to giant but to a lesser degree. Short isn’t a lesser degree of 
large because short and large don’t mean roughly the same thing. The same goes for ele-
vated. Short is unrelated to Choice (D), unimportant. The best answer is Choice (A). Short 
and tiny both mean small, but tiny is a greater degree of smallness than short. Correct 
Answer: Choice (A)
Trying Your Hand at Reading 
and Writing Questions
Reading comprehension and written composition questions test your ability to understand 
what you read and recognize proper sentence and paragraph structure, respectively. All 
three entrance exams feature reading comprehension questions, so we give you four to 
practice on in this section. We also provide you with both a COOP-style and an HSPT-style 
written composition question. (Need additional help answering either question type? Flip to 
Chapter 5.)
Read the following passage and answer the questions.
His name is Frank Clarke, but his real name isn’t really as real as the one the children 
have given him. They call him Toyman because he’s always making the kids things, such as 
kites, tops, sleds, and boats. And he’s always joking around. Laughter and happiness seem 
to follow him wherever he goes.
His face is as brown as saddle leather, with a touch of apple red in it from the sun. His 
face is creased, too, probably because it’s forever crinkled up in a grin. But it’s when 
Toyman appears to be solemn that you want to laugh most, for he’s only pretending. And, 

89
 Chapter 9: Giving Your Verbal Skills a Workout with Practice Questions
best of all, if you hurt yourself or if your pet dog hurts himself, Toyman knows how to fix it 
to make it all well again.
My first experience with Toyman was when I was nine years old. I had competed in a local 
spelling bee and had missed first place by one lousy word. I spelled “misspell” with just one s. 
I was mortified, but hours after the competition, I received a package wrapped in shiny gold 
paper and trimmed with a rainbow-striped bow. I opened the box and pulled out a hand-
carved wooden sailboat. It was the most beautiful toy I’d ever seen. An attached card simply 
said, “Congratulations!” It was signed “Toyman.”
 
1. A good title for this passage would be
 
(A) The Art of Hand-Carved Toys
 
(B) How I Lost a Spelling Bee
 
(C) My Friend the Toyman
 
(D) Toys I Will Always Remember
Eliminate answers, such as Choice (B), that focus on only one part of the passage. The title 
has to be about the passage as a whole. Choices (A) and (D) are far too general. The focus 
of the passage isn’t on toys but a description of Toyman as seen through the author’s eyes. 
Correct Answer: Choice (C)
 
Questions that ask you for a good title are main-point questions. Look for the answer that 
summarizes the main topic of the passage and don’t be concerned if the best answer isn’t 
the cleverest of titles.
 
2. As it is used in the passage, solemn most nearly means
 
(A) ill
 
(B) serious
 
(C) merry
 
(D) jovial
This vocabulary-in-context question asks for the answer that has the same meaning as 
solemn. The word appears in the second paragraph where the author describes Toyman’s 
face. First, the author talks about his smile. The next sentence begins with but, which means 
it contains a contrasting idea. The answer that contrasts with or is opposite to smiling or 
grinning is Choice (B), serious. Plug Choice (B) into the passage to see whether it fits: But 
it’s when Toyman appears to be serious that you want to laugh most, for he’s only pretend-
ing. Choices (C) and (D) have the same meaning. They can’t both be right, so they must 
both be wrong. Choice (A) would be cruel; the children wouldn’t want to laugh at Toyman if 
he looked ill — even if he were pretending! Correct Answer: Choice (B)
 
3. Frank Clarke received his nickname because he was always
 
(A) fixing toys
 
(B) making toys for the children
 
(C) telling stories about toys
 
(D) playing with toys
This is a details question, which means you can find the answer right there in the passage. The 
first paragraph in the passage explains that the children gave Frank the nickname of Toyman 
because he makes toys for them. The passage doesn’t mention the activities in the other 
choices. Correct Answer: Choice (B)

90
Part II: Vanquishing the Verbal Questions 
 
4. Which of these best expresses the attitude of the author?
 
(A) The author is suspicious of Toyman.
 
(B) The author thinks that the children should be nicer to Toyman.
 
(C) The author wishes Toyman had helped him study for the spelling bee.
 
(D) The author is fond of Toyman.
The tone of the passage is light-hearted and positive, which means you can eliminate 
Choices (A) and (B) because they imply that the author has a negative attitude. Concluding 
that the author wanted spelling help from the Toyman is illogical because the passage 
doesn’t contain enough information about the spelling bee. In fact, the passage suggests 
that the author didn’t even know the Toyman until after the spelling bee. Correct Answer: 
Choice (D)
Answer Question 5 based on this paragraph.
Medieval guilds were similar to modern-day labor unions. These groups of merchants 
or craftspeople set rules regarding economic activity in order to protect themselves. Some 
guilds held considerable economic power, but even small guilds protected members. Guilds 
also served a social purpose.
 
5. What might you expect the next paragraph to be about?
 
(A) a description of how medieval guilds fulfilled a social purpose
 
(B) a critique of modern-day labor unions
 
(C) a comparison of the economic power held by medieval guilds and by groups of 
merchants
 
(D) an account of the ways medieval citizens protected themselves
Look for clues to what comes after a paragraph in its last sentence. The last sentence says 
that the guilds served a social purpose, so it makes sense that the next paragraph would 
be about that topic. The paragraph is about guilds rather than labor unions, Choice (B), 
which means the next paragraph likely wouldn’t switch gears so suddenly without notice. 
Medieval guilds and groups of merchants are the same, so comparing their economic power 
doesn’t make sense. Choice (D) is wrong because there’s no indication of why the next para-
graph would stop discussing guilds and begin talking about citizens in general. Correct 
Answer: Choice (A)
 
6. Which of these fits best under the topic of “Knitting a Scarf”?
 
(A) A hand-knit scarf makes a beautiful gift, and it’s easy to create.
 
(B) The yarn produced in South America is denser than the yarn produced in England.
 
(C) One of America’s most famous seamstresses is Betsy Ross.
 
(D) None of the above
Look for a sentence that relates to the title; it should contain both the act of knitting and the 
scarf. Choice (B) talks about yarn, but it doesn’t talk about knitting, and it certainly doesn’t 
mention a scarf. Choice (C) is even further off track. A seamstress isn’t one who knits. This 
sentence would fit better under the topic of “Famous Seamstresses” or in a piece about 
Betsy Ross. Choice (A) includes knitting and the scarf, so it’s a good sentence for the topic. 
Because one of the sentences fits, you can eliminate Choice (D). Correct Answer: Choice (A)

Looking at All the Different Language 
Questions
All three Catholic high school entrance exams test your ability to spot errors in punctuation, 
capitalization, spelling, grammar, and usage of the English language. The TACHS and HSPT 
include more of these questions than the COOP, which mixes its language questions with its 
reading comprehension questions. The first two practice questions are in the COOP style, 
the next two are like the ones you see on the TACHS, and the last two are the kind that show 
up on the HSPT. See Chapters 6 and 7 for pointers on answering these types of questions.
This paragraph has a few mistakes that need correcting. Read the paragraph and answer 
Questions 1 and 2.
(1)Good leaders get involved in their subordinates’ careers. (2)People merely obey arbi-
trary commands and orders, but they respond quickly and usually give extra effort for 
leaders who genuinely care for them. (3)A neglected leadership principle in today’s environ-
ment of technology and specialization is knowing the workers and showing sincere interest 
in their problems career development and welfare. (4)Leadership is reflected in the degree 
of efficiency, productivity, morale, and motivation demonstrated by subordinates. 
(5)Leadership involvement is the key ingredient to maximizing worker performance.
 
1. What is the best way to write Sentence 1?
 
(A) Good leaders get involved in their subordinates careers.
 
(B) Good leaders get involved in their subordinates’s careers.
 
(C) Leaders, who are good, get involved in their subordinate’s careers.
 
(D) Best as is.
There are many subordinates, and the careers belong to them; the proper form for a plural 
possessive is to add an apostrophe after the ending s. Choice (A) neglects to make subordi-
nates a possessive. Choice (B) forms the possessive improperly. Choice (C) forms the singu-
lar possessive of subordinate rather than the plural form, and it improperly makes good a 
nonessential part of the sentence, which changes the sentence’s meaning. Correct Answer: 
Choice (D)
 
2. Which of the sentences contains a punctuation error?
 
(A) Sentence 2
 
(B) Sentence 3
 
(C) Sentence 4
 
(D) Sentence 5
Sentence 2 contains two independent clauses that are joined by the conjunction but. It prop-
erly separates the clauses with a comma before the conjunction, so eliminate Choice (A). 
Sentence 4 has a series of nouns that are separated by commas, which means it’s correct 
and Choice (C) is wrong. The only punctuation in Sentence 5 is the ending period; no other 
punctuation is necessary. The incorrectly punctuated sentence is Sentence 3, Choice (B), 
because it contains a series that should be separated by commas like this: interest in their 
problems, career development, and welfare. Correct Answer: Choice (B)

Part II: Vanquishing the Verbal Questions 
Find the error in spelling.
 
3. (A) Sam wasted a significant amount of time
 
(B) running in the lengthy marathon because
 
(C) he was continually tieing his shoes.
 
(D) No mistakes
Read carefully through the part of the sentence in each answer choice and watch for any 
problems in spelling. Everything seems to be fine until you get to Choice (C). When you add 
-ing to tie, you change the ie to y. Choice (C) should be “he was continually tying his shoes.” 
Correct Answer: Choice (C)
Find the error in capitalization.
 
4. (A) Escaping to the Appalachian Mountains
 
(B) last weekend was a perfect way to celebrate
 
(C) Valentine’s Day.
 
(D) No mistakes
Appalachian Mountains is properly capitalized in Choice (A), and weekend is properly for-
matted with lowercase letters in Choice (B). Valentine’s Day is a holiday, which means the 
capitalization is also appropriate in Choice (C). Correct Answer: Choice (D)
Choose the answer that has an error in punctuation, capitalization, or usage. If there is 
no error, select Choice (D).
 
5. (A) Marcie drove to Fort Worth on Tuesday.
 
(B) Because Jeff could not attend the dinner, we brought him a snack.
 
(C) Gary could of come with us if he had wanted to.
 
(D) No mistakes
The capitalization, punctuation, and usage all look good in Choice (A). Choice (B) correctly 
separates the beginning dependent clause from the independent clause with a comma. 
Choice (C), however, has a problem with usage. The proper construction of the verb is could 
have. Could of is never right. Correct Answer: Choice (C)
 The HSPT doesn’t always tell you what specific kinds of errors to look for like the TACHS 
does, which means you must consider all sorts of issues when you approach an HSPT 
 language question.
 
6. Which of these answers expresses the idea most clearly?
 
(A) Before making breakfast, I relax in the warm sunshine streaming in from the window.
 
(B) Relaxing in the warm sunshine streaming in from the window, it is before I make 
 breakfast.
 
(C) Before making breakfast in the warm sunshine streaming in from the window, I cause 
myself to relax.
 
(D) Before making breakfast, the warm sunshine streaming in from the window causes me 
to relax.

93
 Chapter 9: Giving Your Verbal Skills a Workout with Practice Questions
Whenever you see a sentence that starts with a beginning phrase, check to make sure the 
subject of the sentence relates to the action in the phrase. In Choice (B), it doesn’t do the 
relaxing; I do. However, the way the sentence is constructed makes it seem as if it is 
engaged in relaxing. The same problem occurs in Choice (D). The way that sentence is 
worded makes it sound like the sunshine makes breakfast. Now that’s something we’d like 
to see! The sentence in Choice (C) has I making the breakfast, but it changes the meaning. 
The warm sunshine isn’t where I make breakfast; it’s where I relax. The clearest sentence is  
Choice (A). It states that I make the breakfast and clarifies that the relaxing takes place in 
the sunshine. Correct Answer: Choice (A)
Facing Verbal Reasoning Questions on the 
COOP and HSPT
If you’re taking the COOP or the HSPT, you need to be prepared to face verbal reasoning 
questions that test your ability to draw reasonable conclusions. Fortunately, this section 
contains four for you to try out. The first two are in the COOP style, and the second two are 
in the HSPT style. Chapter 8 can get you better acquainted with verbal reasoning questions 
if you need additional help with ’em.
For Questions 1 and 2, find the statement that is true based on the information provided.
 
1. Kelly is typing a paper. Kelly is perspiring. She often perspires when she is hot.
 
(A) Kelly’s paper consists of many pages.
 
(B) Kelly hates to type papers.
 
(C) Kelly is probably hot.
 
(D) Kelly is sitting at a desk.
You don’t know that Kelly’s perspiration is related to the paper she’s typing, so you can’t 
say that her paper is long or that she hates to type papers. You don’t even know that she’s 
sitting at a desk; she could be typing at the kitchen table. All you know is that Kelly is per-
spiring and that she often perspires when she gets hot. Therefore, Kelly’s probably hot. 
Correct Answer: Choice (C)
 
2. The Michaels family plays board games together every Wednesday. They watch movies 
together every Friday. They eat dinner at a restaurant together twice a week.
 
(A) The Michaels family goes out to dinner before they watch movies.
 
(B) The Michaels family eats dinner at a restaurant on Mondays and Tuesdays.
 
(C) The Michaels family spends time together at least twice a week.
 
(D) The Michaels family does not spend time together every night.
Consider what you do and don’t know. The Michaels family definitely plays board games 
together on Wednesdays and watches movies together on Fridays, which means they spend 
time together at least twice a week. You know that the family eats dinner together twice a 
week, but you don’t know which days they eat dinner together. So, you can’t select Choice (A) 
or Choice (B). Just because the statements don’t reveal that the Michaels family does other 
things together doesn’t mean they don’t; Choice (D) is wrong too. Correct Answer: Choice (C)

(C) uncertain
Chapter 8 shows you how to prepare a diagram to answer these kinds of logic questions. 
The diagram for this question, in order of tallest to shortest, is Jane → Stan → Greta. Looks 
like the third statement is true. Correct Answer: Choice (A)
 
4. All dwezzles are haps. Some haps are jovial. Some dwezzles are jovial. If the first two state-
ments are true, the third statement is
 
(A) true
 
(B) false
 
(C) uncertain
When you draw a Venn diagram like the following one, you see that you don’t know whether 
some dwezzles are jovial or not because the jovial circle could fit in a couple different spots. 
The statement is therefore uncertain. Correct Answer: Choice (C)
Dwezzles
Jovial
Haps

ere it is — the long-awaited math review! In the next 
80 or so pages, we provide you with a thorough run-
through of all the important and most commonly tested 
math concepts on the Catholic high school entrance 
exams. We start with the basics (think fundamental opera-
tions, averages, percentages, fractions, and exponents) in 
Chapter 10 and then dive right into algebra essentials in 
Chapter 11. Chapter 12 gets you in good “shape” for the 
geometry problems on the entrance exams, and Chapter 13 
helps you figure out just what math word problems are 
asking for.
Now, your entrance exam may feature some quantitative 
question types you haven’t seen before. These questions 
may ask you to complete a sequence of numbers or pictures 
or compare the shaded areas of shapes and the values of 
several equations. The COOP even has you balance a scale 
using squares and triangles. Rest assured that after you 
review Chapters 14 and 15 to see how to approach these 
unusual question types, you may find you actually enjoy 
them! Of course, that joy may be short-lived when you tackle 
the math practice questions in Chapter 16. C’est la vie!

hey crop up everywhere: grade school math tests, those dreaded achievement tests, 
and now on your high school entrance exams. We’re talking about multiple-choice math 
questions. Because the various Catholic high school entrance exams test what you’ve 
learned so far, most of the math questions you’ll face cover the basics, such as adding num-
bers and finding averages. This chapter reviews the fundamentals in case some of the con-
cepts have grown fuzzy for you since you first learned them.
Delving into the Details of Numbers
It’s probably no surprise to you that the math problems on the entrance exams involve num-
bers, but it’s also probably been a while since you thought about the properties of numbers. 
That’s why we’re offering you a fairly complete number review. (You can thank us later.)
Keeping it real: Types of numbers
The math problems on the Catholic high school entrance exams deal primarily with real 
numbers — also known as all the numbers that you normally think of and deal with in every-
day life. Think of real numbers as those numbers represented by all the points on a number 
line (see the next section if you’re not familiar with this handy tool), either positive or nega-
tive. Real numbers are also those numbers you use to measure length, volume, or weight. In 
fact, almost any number you can think of is a real number.
Real numbers include integers, rational numbers, and numbers that can’t be written as frac-
tions (called irrational numbers) — all of which you’ll see on your entrance exam.
 
✓ Integers consist of all positive and negative whole numbers, as well as zero. Integers 
aren’t fractions, decimals, or portions of a number, so they include –5, –4, –3, –2, –1, 0, 
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and continue infinitely on either side of zero. Integers greater than zero are 
called natural numbers or positive integers; integers less than zero are called negative 
integers.
 
 Tread carefully when working with zero because it’s neither positive nor negative.

98
Part III: Mastering Math and Conquering Quantitative Questions 
 
✓ Rational numbers include all positive and negative integers, zero, and fractions and 
decimal numbers that either end or repeat. For example, the fraction 1⁄6 can be 
expressed as 0.16666. . . .
 
✓ Numbers that can’t be written as fractions (such as π and 
) round out the set of real 
numbers.
Visualizing the lineup: The number line
If you’re a visual person, you may have an easier time picturing numbers if you see them on 
a number line. The number line is a device used to show all real numbers. Zero sits at the 
middle of the line. All positive numbers extend infinitely to the right of zero, and all negative 
numbers extend infinitely to the left of zero. The numbers increase in value as you move to 
the right and decrease in value as you move to the left. Here’s what a number line looks like:
1½
1
0.5
0
–½
–1
–1.5
–2
4
Numbers can be expressed in a variety of ways on the number line as long as they have the 
same value. For instance, the space between 0 and 1 can be shown as either 0.5 or 1⁄2. 
Likewise, 
 is the same as 2.
Working in absolutes: Absolute value
No review of numbers would be complete without covering the concept of absolute value. 
The absolute value of any real number is that same number without a negative sign. It’s the 
value of the distance a particular number is from zero on a number line (see the preceding 
section). The symbol for absolute value is 
, so the absolute value of 1 is written mathe-
matically as . And because 1 sits one space from 0 on the number line, 
. The absolute 
value of –1 is also 1, because –1 also hangs out one space away from 0 on the number line. 
So, 
.
 
Absolute value relates only to the value inside those absolute value bars. If you see a nega-
tive sign outside the bars, the value of the result is negative. That means 
; the 
negative sign outside the bars makes the end value a negative number.
Absolute value problems can drag down your math score on your entrance exam if you’re 
not careful. Here’s a sample one so you know what to watch for.
 
What is the value of 
?
 
(A) –16
 
(B) –4
 
(C) 4
 
(D) 16

99
 Chapter 10: Acing Arithmetic Problems
You know by the 
 symbol that this question is asking you to find the absolute value of 
–16. Remember that the absolute value of a number equals the number of spaces that 
number extends from zero on the number line. You know that –16 is 16 spaces away from 
zero, so the answer is 16, Choice (D). You can eliminate Choices (B) and (C) because you 
can’t have a different number as your answer for an absolute value problem. Finally, you 
know Choice (A) is wrong because absolute value is always a positive number.
Factoring it all in: Prime numbers
 
Whichever entrance exam you’re taking, be prepared to see a question or two involving 
prime numbers, which are all the positive integers that can be divided only by themselves 
and 1. Here are some of the other facts you should know about prime numbers:
 
✓ One isn’t a prime number.
 
✓ Two is the smallest of the prime numbers, and it’s also the only number that’s both 
even and prime.
 
✓ Zero can never be a prime number because you can divide it by every number in 
 existence.
 
You don’t need to memorize a bunch of prime numbers for your test, but do keep in mind 
that the lowest prime numbers are 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, and 29.
When you know how to recognize prime numbers, you can use prime factorization, which is 
just a fancy way of saying that you can break down a number into all of the prime numbers 
(or factors) that go into it. For instance, 50 factors into 2 × 25, which factors into 5 × 5, giving 
you 2 × 5 × 5 for the prime factors of 50.
Questions on your entrance exam that test you on prime factorization may simply ask you 
for the factors of a particular number, or they may be less obvious, like this one.
 
Which of the following answers contains prime numbers that when multiplied together 
equal 60?
 
(A) 2 × 2 × 3 × 5
 
(B) 2 × 2 × 15
 
(C) 2 × 3 × 3 × 5
 
(D) 2 × 3 × 5
The question says that all the multiplied numbers must be prime numbers, so cross out 
any answers containing a number that isn’t prime. Even though the multipliers equal 60, 
Choice (B) is wrong because 15 isn’t a prime number. You can also eliminate any answers 
that don’t equal 60 when you multiply them. Choice (C) equals 90, and Choice (D) comes 
out to 30; they’re both out. The correct answer must be Choice (A) because it contains only 
prime numbers that equal 60 when you multiply them together.

100
Part III: Mastering Math and Conquering Quantitative Questions 
 
You can also solve this question by using prime factorization to create a diagram called a 
factor tree. To find the prime factors of 60, think of numbers that equal 60 when multiplied 
together. Do the numbers 30 and 2 come to mind? (We hope so, because that’s what we’re 
going with.) You can break 30 into 2 and 15, which gives you factors of 2 × 2 × 15. Ah, but 15 
can be broken down again into 3 and 5. Therefore, the prime factorization of 60 is 2 × 2 × 3 × 5, 
which is — drumroll please — Choice (A).

Minor Surgery: Reviewing Basic 
Mathematical Operations
Performing the basic mathematical operations — addition, subtraction, multiplication, and 
division — is a little like performing surgery on numbers, only you don’t have to be a brain 
surgeon to do it right. All you have to do is refresh your memory of the rules once in a 
while. Consider the following sections your basic-math refresher.
Adding up the properties of addition
Addition — the act of combining two or more numbers to get an end result called the sum — 
just may be the simplest of all the mathematical operations. Your basic addition problem 
looks like this: 2 + 3 + 4 = 9.
 
Addition also has two important properties that we bet you use pretty frequently in math 
class. Burning these properties into your mind will help you greatly on your exam:
 
✓ The associative property: This one means that the grouping you use to associate num-
bers doesn’t matter in addition. Regardless of whether you add 2 and 3 together first 
and then add 4, which looks like (2 + 3) + 4, or you add 3 and 4 together followed by 2, 
which looks like 2 + (3 + 4), you still get 9.
 
✓ The commutative property: Thanks to this property, it doesn’t matter what order you 
use to add the same numbers. Regardless of what number you list first in a set of num-
bers, those numbers always produce the same sum. So 2 + 3 = 5 is the same as 3 + 2 = 5.
Cutting down the properties of subtraction
Subtraction is the opposite of addition. When you subtract one number from another, you’re 
taking away a value from another value and ending up with the difference (the answer to a 
subtraction problem). So if 4 + 5 = 9, then 9 – 5 = 4.
 
Unlike addition, grouping does matter in subtraction. You get completely different answers 
for the problem 20 – 7 – 4 = ? depending on how you associate the values. Here’s what we 
mean: (20 – 7) – 4 = 9, but 20 – (7 – 4) = 17. The order of the values counts in subtraction, 

101
 Chapter 10: Acing Arithmetic Problems
too. The problem 2 – 3 isn’t the same as the problem 3 – 2. The first one gives you a differ-
ence of –1, but the second one gives you a difference of +1.
None of the entrance exams lets you bring in a calculator, so the actual calculations that 
you have to perform on your test won’t be so complex that you can’t do them in your head 
or work them out quickly in the space in your test booklet. So, an entrance exam subtrac-
tion question may be pretty straightforward, like this one.
 
What is the difference between 18 and 30?
 
(A) 12
 
(B) 48
 
(C) –12
 
(D) 0.6
First off, you should recognize that the question is asking for the answer to a subtraction 
problem. (Why? Because you know that difference is defined as the answer to a subtraction 
problem.) Don’t forget that order matters in subtraction; keep the proper order: 18 – 30 = 
–12. The correct answer is Choice (C). If you picked Choice (A), you switched the order of 
the numbers. Choice (B) is the answer you’d get if you added the two numbers, and 
Choice (D) is the quotient rather than the difference (see the later “Splitting hairs with 
 properties of division” section for an explanation of the term quotient).
Increasing greatly through properties 
of multiplication
Think of multiplication as repeated addition with an end result called the product. The multi-
plication problem 3 × 6 is therefore the same as the addition problem 6 + 6 + 6. Both prob-
lems equal 18.
 
Multiplication is also like addition in that the order of the values doesn’t matter. It too 
obeys the commutative property, which means 2 × 3 = 3 × 2, and the associative property, 
which means (2 × 3) × 4 = 2 × (3 × 4). Check out the earlier “Adding up the properties of 
addition” section for the definitions of these two properties.
Another property associated with multiplication is the distributive property over addition. 
Say you encounter a multiplication problem like 2(3 + 4) = ? You can solve this problem 
by adding the numbers in parentheses (3 + 4 = 7) and then multiplying that sum by 2 (as in 
7 × 2 = 14). But you can also do a little distribution, which means you multiply the value out-
side the parentheses (the 2 in this case) by each of the values within the parentheses (the 
3 and the 4). So, you multiply 2 by 3 and 2 by 4 and then add the products together. You get 
the same answer: (2 × 3) + (2 × 4) = 6 + 8 = 14. And because subtracting is really just adding a 
negative, you can use the distributive property even when you have a minus sign inside the 
parentheses.
 
The distributive property comes in handy when you multiply variables in algebra problems. 
(You find out more about that in Chapter 11.)
 Your entrance exam may use several different signs to represent the multiplication opera-
tion. A multiplication sign can be designated simply with a dot (·) or by ×. And in many 
instances, especially when variables are involved (refer to Chapter 11), multiplication can 
be indicated by just putting the factors right next to each other. So, ab means the same 
thing as a × b, and 2a is the same as 2 × a.

102
Part III: Mastering Math and Conquering Quantitative Questions 
Splitting hairs with properties of division
Division is taking your total number of items and breaking them up into equal groups. The 
result (the number of items in each group) is called the quotient. You may also consider 
division to be the opposite of multiplication, so because 4 × 6 = 24, 24 ÷ 6 = 4 and 24 ÷ 4 = 6.
Just so you’re prepared in case your test throws some math terminology at you, you should 
know that the number at the beginning of any division problem (24 in the preceding expres-
sion) is called the dividend, and the number that goes into the dividend is called the divisor 
(that’s 4 in the preceding expression).
 
Order is just as important in division as it is in subtraction. The quotient of 10 ÷ 2 (which is 5) 
is a much different answer than the quotient of 2 ÷ 10 (which is 1⁄5 or 0.2).
Performing basic operations with odds and evens 
and positives and negatives
Basic math operations are pretty simple, but some elements can make them a bit trickier. 
Know the rules for dealing with odd/even and positive/negative numbers.
Rules for odds and evens
The number line (depicted earlier in this chapter) gives you an easy way to visualize even and 
odd numbers. We’re pretty sure you know that even numbers are numbers that are evenly 
divisible by 2 (2, 4, 6, 8, 10, and so on) and that odd numbers are numbers that aren’t evenly 
divisible by 2 (1, 3, 5, 7, 9, and so on).
You’re probably with us so far, but what’s important to remember for the math questions is 
what happens to even or odd numbers when you add, subtract, multiply, or divide them by 
one another.
 
Here are the rules regarding the addition and subtraction of odd and even numbers:
 
✓ When you add or subtract two even numbers, your result is an even number.
 
✓ When you add or subtract two odd numbers, your result is also even.
 
✓ If you add or subtract an even number and an odd number, your result is an odd 
number.
 
When it comes to multiplying even and odd numbers, don’t forget the following:
 
✓ When you multiply an even number by an even number, you get an even number.
 
✓ When you multiply an odd number by an even number, you also get an even number.
 
✓ The only time you get an odd number for your product is when you multiply an odd 
number by another odd number.
 
The division rules for odd and even numbers are as follows:
 
✓ When you divide an even number by an odd number, you get an even number.
 
✓ An odd number divided by another odd number results in an odd number.

103
 Chapter 10: Acing Arithmetic Problems
 
Knowing the rules for performing operations with odds and evens can be a big timesaver 
when it comes to eliminating answer choices. For instance, if you have a problem that multi-
plies only large even numbers, you know you can eliminate any odd-number answer choices 
without even doing the math!
Rules for positives and negatives
 
Positive and negative numbers have their own set of rules regarding operations, and those 
rules are even more important to remember than the ones for even and odd numbers. When 
you multiply or divide
 
✓ Two positive numbers, the answer is positive
 
✓ Two negative numbers, the answer is also positive
 
✓ A negative number by a positive number, you get a negative answer
 
You also have to know a thing or two (or four, actually) about adding and subtracting posi-
tives and negatives:
 
✓ When you add two positive numbers, your answer is positive: 3 + 5 = 8.
 
✓ Adding two negative numbers gives you a negative answer: –3 + –5 = –8. You may have 
to add two negative numbers even though the sign between them is a minus sign. For 
example, –3 – 5 is the same as saying –3 + –5, which is –8. (Subtracting 5 is the same 
thing as adding –5.)
 
✓ When you add a negative number to a positive number, your answer can be positive or 
negative: –3 + 5 = 2, and 3 + –5 = –2.
 
 If adding positive and negative numbers is confusing for you, think of the number line. 
Start at the point of the first number and move right for positive numbers and left for 
negative numbers. To solve the first equation, you’d find –3 on the number line and 
move right 5 spaces to 2. For the second equation, you’d find 3 on the number line and 
move left 5 spaces to –2.
 
✓ If you subtract a negative number from another number, you end up adding the second 
number to the first, and your answer can be either positive or negative: 3 – (–5) is the 
same as 3 + 5, so the answer is 8; –5 – (–3) is the same as –5 + 3, so the answer is –2.
This sample question gives you a chance to test what you know about subtracting negative 
numbers.
 
–24 – (–23) is equal to _____?
 
(A) –47
 
(B) –1
 
(C) 1
 
(D) 47
To subtract a negative number, change it to a positive number and add. So to subtract –23 
from –24, you must change –23 to +23 and add the numbers: –24 + 23 = –1 (start at –24 on 
the number line and move right 23 spaces). The answer is Choice (B). Choice (A) results 
from adding –23 to –24 rather than subtracting it. If you picked Choice (C), you changed –23 
to +23 but subtracted it and neglected the negative sign in front of 24. Choice (D) doesn’t 
recognize that the difference is a negative number rather than a positive one.

Part III: Mastering Math and Conquering Quantitative Questions 
Climbing Up the Complexity Ladder: 
More Advanced Arithmetic
Hey, wouldn’t it be great if simple addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division were all 
you had to know for your entrance exam’s math questions? Sadly, you must master more 
advanced concepts, including fractions, ratios, and averages, before you can say you’re 
completely ready for test day. No fear! It’s all right here.
Breaking a whole into parts: Fractions, 
decimals, and percentages
Fractions, decimals, and percentages all represent parts of a whole. Fractions are really 
answers to division problems. If you divide 3 by 4, you get the fraction 3⁄4 (so 3 ÷ 4 = 3⁄4). 
Decimals show fractions as tenths, hundredths, thousandths, and so on. Percent literally 
means “something per 100” or “something divided by 100.” The following sections detail the 
specifics of these three ways to cut a whole into separate parts.
Converting fractions, decimals, and percentages
 
Because fractions, decimals, and percentages are different ways of showing similar values, 
you can change pretty easily from one form to another (and you may even be required to by 
some test problems).
 
✓ To convert a fraction to a decimal, you just divide: 3⁄4 = 3 ÷ 4 = 0.75.
 
✓ To convert a decimal to a fraction, you first count the digits to the right of the decimal 
point and then divide the number over a 1 followed by the same number of zeros as 
there were digits to the right of the decimal. So 0.75 = 75⁄100. Be sure to reduce your frac-
tion, though! 75⁄100 = 3⁄4.
 
✓ Changing a decimal to a percent is really pretty easy. Just move the decimal two places 
to the right and add a percent sign. To change 0.75 to a percent, simply move the deci-
mal two places to the right and add a percent sign: 0.75 = 75%.
 
✓ To turn a percent back into a decimal, you follow the preceding procedure in reverse. 
You just move the decimal point two to the left and get rid of the percent sign, like so: 
75% = 0.75
Defining fraction terminology
Fractions tell you what part a piece is of a whole. The numerator is the top number in the 
fraction and represents the piece; the denominator is the bottom number of the fraction and 
indicates the value of the whole.
Picture a delicious apple pie sliced into eight equal pieces and a hungry family of seven, 
each of whom has a slice after dinner (or before dinner if they’re sneaky). That pie looks a 
little something like this:

105
 Chapter 10: Acing Arithmetic Problems
The unshaded pieces of pie show how much of the dessert the family gobbled up. The 
shaded piece shows what’s left of the pie when the family is finished. The number of pieces 
in the pie to begin with (the whole) represents the denominator, and the number of pieces 
that were eaten up (the part of the whole) represents the numerator. In this case, the 
number of devoured pieces makes up 7⁄8 of the total pie, so 7 is the numerator, and 8 is the 
denominator.
Proper fractions are those fractions where the numerator is less than the denominator, like 2⁄3. 
Improper fractions are those fractions where the numerator is either greater than or equal to 
the denominator, like 3⁄2 or 3⁄3. You can also show an improper fraction as a mixed number 
(sometimes called a mixed fraction), which is made up of a whole number and a fraction, 
like 11⁄3.
Simplifying fractions
 
When you’re dealing with fractions, it helps to know that 6⁄18 has the same value as 1⁄3. Actually, 
1⁄3 is 6⁄18 in its simplest (or smallest) terms. Usually answers to math questions that involve frac-
tions show the fractions in simplest terms. So if you come up with an answer of 6⁄18, you may 
not find that answer in the list of available choices, which means you have to simplify. To do 
that, find a number that goes into both the numerator and the denominator and divide both 
by that number.
To simplify 5⁄10, find a number that goes into both 5 and 10. That number is 5 because 5 and 
10 are evenly divisible by 5. Dividing both the numerator and the denominator by 5 allows 
you to simplify 5⁄10 as 1⁄2.
Multiplying and dividing fractions
Multiplying fractions is easy. Just multiply the numerators by each other and then do the 
same with the denominators. Then simplify if you have to.
 
When working with larger numbers, you may want to simplify first to make life easier (and 
the numbers smaller) before you multiply straight across. Here’s an example:

106
Part III: Mastering Math and Conquering Quantitative Questions 
 
Dividing fractions is pretty much the same as multiplying them except for one very impor-
tant additional step. First, find the reciprocal of the second fraction in the equation (that is, 
turn the second fraction upside down). Then multiply (yes, you have to multiply when 
dividing fractions) the numerators and denominators of the resulting fractions. Here’s how:
Adding and subtracting fractions
You can bet your Catholic high school entrance exam will ask you to add or subtract a few 
fractions. This task can be as easy as simply adding and subtracting the numerators and 
putting the answer over the original denominator, as you can see from the following:
2⁄5 + 4⁄5 = 6⁄5
6⁄5 – 4⁄5 = 2⁄5
 
You can only add and subtract fractions if they have the same denominator. Simply adding 
or subtracting numerators doesn’t work if the denominators are different.
No sweat, right? But what if you see something like this on your exam: 1⁄3 + 1⁄4 = _____?
To answer this problem, you must find the smallest number that both of the denominators 
go into; in other words, you must find the lowest common denominator. Because your 
denominators in this problem are 3 and 4, you need to find a number that both 3 and 4 go 
into evenly. If you multiply 3 by 4, you get the number 12, so you know that both 3 and 4 go 
into 12. Actually, that just so happens to be the lowest common denominator here. Convert 
1⁄3 to 4⁄12 by multiplying 1⁄3 by 4⁄4. Convert 1⁄4 to 3⁄12 by multiplying 1⁄4 by 3⁄3. Add the numerators of 
the two new fractions and keep the same denominator to get your answer: 4⁄12 + 3⁄12 = 7⁄12.
Adding and subtracting decimals
You add and subtract decimal numbers just like you do integers (see the earlier “Keeping it 
real: Types of numbers” section for a definition of integers). The only special thing about 
decimals is that you have to line them up when you add or subtract them, which means if 
your exam asks you to add 0.53 and 7, you need to arrange the problem like this:
When you add the numbers, you get 7.53.
Figuring percentages
 
Usually the exams ask you to find a percentage of another number: What is 30% of 60? When 
you get a question like this, evaluate the language like so:
 
✓ What means ? or x (the unknown), or what you’re trying to find out.
 
✓ Is means = (equals).
 
✓ Of means × (multiply).
Your job is to multiply: ? = 30% × 60. To do so, just convert 30% to a decimal (0.30) and 
multiply by 60. Tada! The answer is 18.

107
 Chapter 10: Acing Arithmetic Problems
Sometimes they may ask you to figure out what percent one number is of another, like “The 
number 20 is what percent of 80?” Just apply a little translation to the question to get a 
math equation you can work with.
The number 20 is, of course, 20. You know that is means =. What gives you the unknown, or x, 
and of means ×. Put it all together and you get this expression: 20 = x% × 80. All that’s left is 
to solve for x. (See Chapter 11 if you need to find out how to go about solving for x.) Divide 
both sides by 80, and you get this equation: 0.25 = x%. Convert 0.25 to a percent by multiply-
ing by 100, and you have your answer: 0.25 × 100 = 25%.
Drawing comparisons: Ratios and proportions
Ratios and proportions share a similar purpose: They both allow you to draw comparisons 
between two things. A ratio shows a relationship between two like numbers or two like 
values. A ratio may be written as a fraction (1⁄8), as a division expression (1 ÷ 8), with a colon 
(1:8), or as a statement (1 to 8).
So how exactly will your entrance exam test you on ratios? Probably like this.
 
The ratio of 8 to 14 is _____?
 
(A) 1⁄2
 
(B) 14⁄8
 
(C) 4⁄7
 
(D) 2⁄7
Because you know that ratios express division, you can solve this problem by dividing 8 by 
14. Take a quick glance at the answer choices before you engage in a tedious long division 
problem. Notice that all the answer choices are fractions? That means you can just set up a 
fraction to show the ratio, like so: 8⁄14.
Looks like 8⁄14 isn’t one of the answer choices, so you need to simplify the fraction (the ear-
lier section “Simplifying fractions” shows you how). Turns out 8⁄14 is the same as 4⁄7, so the 
correct answer is Choice (C). Choice (B) is wrong because it shows the ratio of 14 to 8; 
order definitely matters in ratios. Choice (D) results from simplifying the fraction incor-
rectly. And if you picked Choice (A), you probably just hazarded a guess.
Your entrance exam may toss in a few proportion problems, too. A proportion is a relation-
ship between two ratios where the ratios are equal. Just like with fractions, multiplying or 
dividing both numbers in the ratio by the same number doesn’t change the value of the 
ratio. So, for example, these two ratios make up a proportion: 2:8 and 4:16, which you may 
also see written as 2:8 = 4:16.
 To test your knowledge of proportions, your entrance exam may give you a couple of equal 
ratios with a missing term and ask you to figure out the missing value. To solve these prob-
lems, you cross multiply, which means you multiply the terms that are diagonal from each 
other and solve for x.
Here’s how you solve for x when you see a proportion problem like 
 :
 
1. Find the terms that are diagonal from each other.
 
 Pair up 1 with x and 2 with 8.

108
Part III: Mastering Math and Conquering Quantitative Questions 
 
2. Multiply each set of diagonal terms and set the products equal to each other.
 
 So 1 × x = 1x, and 2 × 8 = 16. You’re left with 1x = 16.
 
3. Solve for x.
 
 Chapter 11 explains how to solve algebraic equations, but know that in this problem 
x = 16.
Sizing things up: Rounding and estimating
Knowing how to round numbers and estimate calculations is important on any multiple-
choice math test, but if you’re taking the TACHS, expect to see a whole math section 
devoted to estimation. Fortunately, the rules for rounding are pretty simple.
 
1. Figure out which digit (or place value) in the number you need to round to.
 
2. Look at the digit next to it on the right.
 
3. If the digit to the right is a 5 or higher, round up to the next number. If the digit to 
the right is a 4 or lower, keep the digit the same.
 
4. Substitute zeros for all of the places to the right of the digit you started with.
If you’re asked to round 1,345 to the nearest hundred, you’d go to the hundreds place (for a 
list of the names of decimal places, see Chapter 13); in this case, that’s 3. Look at the digit 
next to 3, which is 4. Keep 3 the same and replace the 4 and 5 with zeros to get 1,300. To 
round to the nearest ten, look at the tens place, which is 4. Check out the digit to the right, 
which is 5; because that digit is 5, you have to round up. Add 1 to the 4 and replace the 5 
with a zero to round 1,345 to 1,350.
 
You can use rounding to make estimates. For example, if you have 4,589,734 marbles and 
you want to have at least 5 million marbles in your collection, you can use estimation to 
determine about how many marbles you need to collect to reach your goal. First, round 
4,589,734 to the nearest hundred-thousandth to get 4,600,000. Now you can easily subtract 
your rounded figure from 5 million to determine that you need to collect about 400,000 
more marbles to make you happy.
Here’s a sample rounding problem for you to try.
 
What do you get when you round 42,653 to the nearest hundred?
 
(A) 42,000
 
(B) 43,000
 
(C) 42,600
 
(D) 42,700
The hundreds place is represented by the 6. Look to the immediate right of the 6, and you 
find a 5. A value of 5 or more means you must round up, so add 1 to the 6 and replace the 5 
and 3 with zeros. Your answer is Choice (D). If you picked Choices (A) or (B), you were 
working with the thousands place rather than the hundreds. If you selected Choice (C), you 
didn’t round up.

 Chapter 10: Acing Arithmetic Problems
Covering your bases: Exponents and roots
You may see a few questions on your exam that require you to know about exponents and 
roots, especially if you’re taking the HSPT. To keep you from getting bogged down in all the 
info out there about exponents and roots (which we pair together because finding a root is 
basically like finding the base of an exponent), we cover only what you need to know for 
your exam within the following sections.
Working with exponents
Exponents represent repeated multiplication, much like multiplication itself represents 
repeated addition. This means that 53 is the same as 5 × 5 × 5, or 125. You call the big number, 
the 5, the base. The little number, the 3, is the exponent, and it tells you how many times you 
multiply the base by itself. (By the way, another name for exponent is power.) So the expres-
sion 25 tells you to multiply 2 five times, like this: 2 × 2 × 2 × 2 × 2, or 32.
 Bases with an exponent of 2 are called squares. You should be familiar with the value of the 
squares of the numbers 1 through 12. Bases with an exponent of 3 are called cubes. If you’re 
taking the HSPT, we suggest you memorize the cubes of 2, 3, 4, and 5.
Whichever entrance exam you’re facing, you should know how to add, subtract, multiply, 
and divide numbers with exponents. The best way to perform any basic mathematical opera-
tion with bases and exponents is to figure out the values of the terms and solve. For example, 
to find the product of 32 and 23, figure out the value of each term and multiply: 3 × 3 = 9; 2 × 2 
× 2 = 8; 9 × 8 = 72.
 
Don’t try to add numbers with exponents by simply adding the bases together and then 
adding the exponents together. That definitely doesn’t work.
Your entrance exam may not require you to perform operations completely to answer an 
exponent question like the following one.
 
What is 22 × 33?
 
(A) 5 × 5 × 5 × 5 × 5
 
(B) 2 × 2 × 3 × 3
 
(C) 2 × 2 × 3 × 3 × 3
 
(D) 2 × 2 × 2 × 3 × 3
Remember that an exponent indicates how many times you multiply the base by itself. An 
exponent of 2 means you multiply the base of 2 twice (2 × 2). The expression 33 means 3 
multiplied by itself 3 times (3 × 3 × 3). Multiply the two expressions together and you get 
Choice (C). If you picked Choice (A), you mistakenly added the numbers and exponents 
together. Choices (B) and (D) are what you get if you read the question too quickly and 
mistake the number of exponents.
Powering up by 10
Multiplying or dividing a number by a power of 10 just requires moving around the decimal 
point. To multiply a number by a power of 10, move the decimal point of the number to the 
right as many times as the value of the exponent: 0.1234 × 105 = 12,340.
When you divide by a power of 10, you simply move the decimal point to the left as many 
times as indicated by the exponent and add zeros if you need to: 0.1234 ÷ 105 = 0.000001234.

110
Part III: Mastering Math and Conquering Quantitative Questions 
 
People use powers of 10 to make humongous and teensy-weensy numbers more manage-
able. They also give this simple action a fancy-sounding name: scientific notation. You 
express a number in scientific notation by dividing the entire number so that the decimal 
point moves to the left and all the digits except one are to the right of the decimal point. 
Then you use an exponent to show how many places you moved the decimal point, like this: 
20 million (20,000,000) = 2.0 × 107.
Digging into roots
Various mathematical roots exist, but for your entrance exam, you just need to worry about 
square roots. The square root of a particular number is the number you have to square to 
get that number. Because the square of 3 is 9 (32 = 9), the square root of 9 is 3 (
).
 
You can often use prime factorization to simplify square roots and make them easier to 
handle (see the earlier “Factoring it all in: Prime numbers” section if you need help with this 
technique). For example, if you’re asked to find the square root of 225, don’t panic! Just cal-
culate the factors of 225 to find values that you can determine the square root of.
To factor 
, think of squares that go into 225. You know that 52 is 25. Is 25 a factor of 225? 
Yep! It goes into 225 nine times: 25 × 9 = 225. The number 9 is also a perfect square (32) — 
pretty neat, huh? Put the two factors under the square root sign: 
. The square root of 
25 is 5, and the square root of 9 is 3. Because 5 × 3 = 15, the square root of 225 is 15.
 If you’re feeling a little bewildered by square roots, don’t despair. You’ll see very few of 
them on the HSPT and nearly none on the TACHS or COOP.
Meeting in the middle: Average, 
median, and mode
Don’t be surprised if your entrance exam asks you a few basic statistic questions. Most of 
these will be about averages, but you may see a few that deal with medians and modes. We 
prepare you to face all three in the next sections.
Doing better than average on averages
To perform above average on questions about averages, you need to know how to apply the 
following formula for finding the average value of a set of numbers:
To find the average of 23, 25, 26, and 30, apply the formula
 
You can use given values in the average formula to solve for the other values. For instance, 
if your exam gives you the average and the sum of a group of numbers, you can figure out 
how many numbers were in the set by using the average formula.

111
 Chapter 10: Acing Arithmetic Problems
Check out the following example.
 
Justin tried to compute his average score out of 8 tests. He mistakenly divided the correct 
sum of all of his test scores by 7 and got an average of 96. What is Justin’s actual average 
test score?
 
(A) 76
 
(B) 80
 
(C) 84
 
(D) 106
You know Justin’s average score when the sum is divided by 7, so you can use the formula 
to figure out the sum of Justin’s scores. Then you can use the average formula to determine 
his average over 8 tests. Here’s how:
 
1. Apply the average formula to Justin’s incorrect calculation.
 
 
96 = Sum of scores/7
 
 96 × 7 = Sum of scores
 
 
672 = Sum of scores
 
2. Use the sum of Justin’s test scores to figure out the correct average score.
 
 Average = 672⁄8
 
 Average = 84
Eliminate Choice (D) right away because Justin’s average can’t possibly increase when he 
divides by 8 rather than 7. Any answer greater than 96 has to be wrong. If you picked either 
Choice (A) or Choice (B), you probably just guessed. The correct answer is Choice (C).
Mastering medians
The median is the middle value in a list of several values or numbers. To find out the 
median, list the values or numbers in order, usually from low to high, and choose the value 
that falls exactly in the middle of the other values. If you have an odd number of values, just 
select the middle value. If you have an even number of values, find the two middle values 
and average them. The outcome is the median.
Managing modes
The mode is the value that occurs most often in a set of values. For example, you may be 
asked what income occurs most frequently in a particular sample population. If more 
people in the population or sample have an income of $45,000 than any other income 
amount, the mode is $45,000. Every now and then, you may have a question with more than 
one mode, so don’t panic if you get a set of values with two or more numbers that fit the 
bill. For example, in the set {2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 4, 5, 5, 5}, both 3 and 5 are modes.
Following the Order of Operations
 
Because test-makers like to throw you off your game every now and then, you may see one 
equation that requires you to perform a bunch of operations. It’s going to look a little messy, 
but we promise you can solve it fairly easily by following this specific order of operations:
 
1. Start with the parentheses.
 
2. Move on to the exponents (and roots).

112
Part III: Mastering Math and Conquering Quantitative Questions 
 
3. Then multiply and divide, from left to right.
 
4. Finally, add and subtract, again from left to right.
 
You can use a handy phrase to help you remember the proper order. The traditional phrase 
is “Please Excuse My Dear Aunt Sally,” but we’ve come up with a different one just to keep 
things interesting. Are you ready for it? Here it is: Polly Elf Makes Dolls And Shoes. Use 
whichever phrase you think is easier to remember (although we’re willing to bribe you to 
tell all of your friends about our version).
Enough talk. Here’s a sample equation, just for you.
2(7 – 4)3 – 15 ÷ 3 + 1 = ?
The first word of the catchphrase (Polly) tells you to solve what’s in the parentheses first.
2(3) 3 – 15 ÷ 3 + 1= ?
The next word (Elf) tells you to deal with the exponents.
2 × 27 – 15 ÷ 3 + 1 = ?
The next two words (Makes and Dolls) tell you to multiply and divide.
 
You don’t necessarily multiply before you divide; you just move from left to right. But do 
always multiply and divide before you add and subtract.
 54 – 15 ÷ 3 + 1= ?
 
54 – 5 + 1 = ?
The final words (And Shoes) tell you to do the addition and subtraction from left to right.
49 + 1 = ?
Looks like the final answer is 50. That wasn’t too hard now, was it?

Chapter 11
Venturing into the Unknown 
with Variables
In This Chapter
▶ Looking at the ins and outs of variables
▶ Reviewing the many ways of working with algebraic equations
▶ Solving problems that feature inequalities
A
lgebra’s really just a form of arithmetic with symbols, usually letters, standing in for 
numbers. You use algebra to solve equations and to find the value of a variable. 
Whenever you’re asked to solve an equation for x, you’re working with algebra.
The various Catholic high school entrance exams test elementary algebra, so you’re not at a 
disadvantage if you’ve never taken an advanced algebra course. As long as you have a good 
understanding of the basics, you’ll be just fine. We provide a little refresher on those basics 
in this chapter.
Variables 101: Flashing Back to the Basics
As you probably recall, you encounter a lot of variables in algebra problems. Variables are 
merely symbols that stand in for numbers. Usually the symbols take the form of letters and 
represent specific numeric values. True to their name, variables’ values can change depend-
ing on the equation they’re in.
Think of variables as stand-ins for concrete things. For example, if a store charges a certain 
price per apple and a different price for each orange and you buy two apples and four 
oranges, the clerk can’t just ring up your purchase by adding 2 + 4 to get 6 and then apply-
ing one price. That would be incorrectly comparing apples and oranges! In algebra, you use 
variables to stand in for the price of apples and oranges, something, for instance, like a for 
apple and o for orange. When you include variables, the equation to figure out the total 
price of your order looks something like this:
(2 × a) + (4 × o) = Total cost of apples and oranges
Instead of using the × sign to show multiplication, algebra equations indicate multiplication 
by simply placing the number right next to the variable, like so:
2a + 4o = Total cost
The combination of a number and a variable multiplied together is called a term. In the case 
of your fruit shopping spree, 2a and 4o are both terms. The number part of the term has a 
fancy name; it’s called the coefficient. When you have a collection of these terms joined by 
addition and/or subtraction, you’ve got yourself an algebraic expression.

114
Part III: Mastering Math and Conquering Quantitative Questions 
Terms that have the same variable (and the same exponents on those variables), even if 
they have different coefficients, are called like terms. For example, you may see an expres-
sion that looks something like this:
5x + 3y – 2x + y = ?
5x and –2x are like terms because they both contain an x variable; 3y and y are also like 
terms because they both contain the y variable and only the y variable.
To combine like terms, add or subtract their coefficients. In this example, you combine the 
x terms by adding 5 and –2. To combine the y terms, you add the coefficients of 3 and 1 
(because y is really 1y). Your original expression with four terms simplifies to 3x + 4y.
 
If a variable doesn’t have a coefficient next to it, its coefficient is 1.
Coming to Terms with Basic 
Algebraic Equations
You use the same tools to solve algebraic equations that you use to solve basic arithmetic 
problems. But where arithmetic uses numbers with clear values, such as 4 + 5 = 9, in its 
operations (flip to Chapter 10 for more on basic arithmetic operations), algebra problems 
deal with unknowns, such as x + y = z. You can’t find a definite answer to this problem 
because you don’t know what values x and y represent, let alone what z represents. But ven-
turing into the unknown shouldn’t stop you from solving algebra problems as best you can 
with the given information. Just rely on your old friends — the basic arithmetic operations. 
That’s right. You can still add, subtract, multiply, and divide even when an expression con-
tains a bunch of variables. The following sections show you how to do just that and more.
Adding and subtracting by keeping like with like
Adding and subtracting expressions with variables is pretty simple as long as you remem-
ber that you can only add and subtract like terms. Your exam may try to trick you into 
thinking you can combine terms with different variables in this same manner. Don’t fall for 
it. If you have the expression 3x + 5y, you can’t do any more adding or subtracting unless 
you know the actual value of either x or y.
Pretend for a moment that you’re in charge of buying doughnuts for your annual class 
Groundhog Day party. To feed the crowd, you purchase 4 dozen chocolate doughnuts and 7 
dozen jelly doughnuts for a total of 11 dozen. You know that 1 dozen equals 12 doughnuts, 
so you use the basic operations of addition and multiplication to write an equation that 
shows how many doughnuts you purchased.
(4 × 12) + (7 × 12) = (11 × 12)
But you can also write this equation by using a variable, like x, to stand in for one dozen.
4x + 7x = 11x
And you can subtract to get the opposite result.
11x – 7x = 4x

115
 Chapter 11: Venturing into the Unknown with Variables
 
Don’t forget to combine positive and negative numbers according to the rules of arithmetic. 
If you add two or more numbers in an expression, they keep the positive sign. If you add a 
positive number to a negative number, you may as well be subtracting. (See Chapter 10 for 
an additional refresher on the rules of arithmetic.)
Here’s a sample question to show you how the entrance exams may test you on adding and 
subtracting terms.
 
What is equal to 10x – 5x + 3x?
 
(A) 8x
 
(B) 18
 
(C) 8
 
(D) 2x
To answer this question, focus on the coefficients. You know you can add the two positive 
numbers (10 and 3) and subtract the negative number (5). Well, 10 + 3 = 13, and 13 – 5 = 8. 
Remember to tack on the variable to come up with the right answer of 8x, which is Choice (A). 
If you picked Choice (C), you jumped the gun and chose your answer before you included the 
x variable. Choice (B) is wrong for two reasons: It adds 5 instead of subtracting it, and it 
ignores that all-important x variable. Choice (D) includes the x variable but adds and sub-
tracts incorrectly.
Adding and subtracting like terms is a piece of cake, you say? Hold on just a second because 
your entrance exam may also make you simplify expressions that contain unlike terms. 
Take a look at this problem.
 
What is the value of 3x – 2y + 5x – 4y?
 
(A) 2xy
 
(B) 8x – 2y
 
(C) 8x – 6y
 
(D) x + y
If you tried to add and subtract all the terms, you’d come up with Choice (A), and your 
answer would be marked wrong. Instead, you have to separate the terms with the x variable 
from the terms with the y variable and then add and subtract. So in this problem, you real-
ize that the 3x and the 5x hang out together and the –2y and –4y keep each other company. 
Add the x terms: 3x + 5x = 8x. Combine the y terms: –2y – 4y = –6y. Put it all together and 
voilà! You get 8x – 6y, which is Choice (C). That’s it. You’re done. You can’t do any more 
because there are no more like terms. (Note: If you went for Choice (B), you added 2y 
instead of subtracting it; if you picked Choice (D), you weren’t paying attention to like terms 
when you tackled the problem.)
 
You can’t combine terms with different symbols or variables the way you can when the 
symbols or variables are the same. When adding and subtracting, like terms must always be 
kept together; unlike terms should stay far, far away from each other, never to be mixed.
Multiplying and dividing terms with variables
Not only can you add and subtract expressions with variables (as explained in the preced-
ing section) but you can also multiply and divide them. The rules you need to know for your 
entrance exam are pretty simple.

116
Part III: Mastering Math and Conquering Quantitative Questions 
 
✓ To multiply like variables, add the exponents and keep the variable the same:
 
 x × x = x2
 
 y2 × y3 = y5
 
✓ Divide like variables by subtracting the exponents and keeping the variable the same:
 
 w4 ÷ w7 = w–3
 
 b5 ÷ b3 = b2
You can apply the distributive property of multiplication over addition to variables, too. 
(Flip to Chapter 10 for more on this property.) For instance, when you multiply a number 
by two terms added together, you multiply the number by each term in the parentheses. So 
2(x + y) = 2x + 2y.
Mastering multiple operations 
with variable expressions
Problems that ask you to add, subtract, and multiply terms with variables don’t crop up too 
often on the various Catholic high school entrance exams, but when they do, you’ll congrat-
ulate yourself for knowing how to answer them. Here’s a sample question that gives you a 
chance to do all three operations.
 
Simplify 2x(x + 3) – 3x.
 
(A) 6x
 
(B) 2x2 + 3x
 
(C) 2x2 – 3x
 
(D) 3
 
The word simplify in a math problem means you must add, subtract, multiply, or divide 
terms until there’s nothing more you can do.
According to the order of operations (abbreviated as PEMDAS; see Chapter 10 for the full 
scoop), you solve what’s going on in the parentheses first. But you can’t simplify (x + 3) any 
further because x and 3 aren’t alike, meaning they don’t have the same variables.
The problem doesn’t have any exponents, so the next operation to look at is multiplication. 
Turns out you can use the distributive property to multiply 2x by (x + 3). Here’s how:
 
1. Multiply 2x and x.
 
 The variable in the two terms is the same (x), so you can multiply them. Add the expo-
nents and keep the number and variable the same: 2x × x = 2x2.
 
2. Multiply 2x and 3.
 
 2 × 3 is 6, so you get 6x.
 
3. Add the resulting terms.
 
 The sum is 2x2 + 6x. You can’t simplify that any further because you can’t add variables 
with different exponents.
So far your simplification gives you this expression: 2x2 + 6x – 3x. Now you just need to sub-
tract the like terms (6x – 3x) to get 3x. Tada! You’re done! The simplified expression is 2x2 + 3x, 

117
 Chapter 11: Venturing into the Unknown with Variables
which looks an awful lot like Choice (B), the correct answer. If you picked Choice (A), you just 
added and subtracted without considering that you need to work with like terms. You got 
Choice (C) if you mistakenly found –3x when you subtracted 3x from 6x. If you picked 
Choice (D), you distributed 2x incorrectly.
 Most of the math questions on the Catholic high school entrance exams aren’t terribly com-
plex. (But if you’re still concerned, we suggest you head to Chapter 16 for some additional 
practice using the various arithmetic operations with variable expressions.)
Isolating variables to figure out what they are
A few math questions on your exam will contain an unknown variable (usually x) that you 
must solve for. Here are two things to keep in mind when you’re solving for a variable:
 
✓ Isolate the variable in the equation you’re trying to solve by getting it all alone on one 
side of the equal sign.
 
✓ Whatever operation you perform on one side of the equal sign, you also have to per-
form on the other side.
A math question that asks you to solve for a variable may look like the following problem.
 
Where 2x + 10 = 20, solve for x.
 
(A) 20
 
(B) 10
 
(C) 0
 
(D) 5
You can only solve for x by getting it all by itself on one side of the equal sign. Fortunately, 
here you can isolate x in just two simple steps:
 
1. Eliminate 10 from the picture by subtracting it from both sides of the equation.
 
 Here’s what happens when you subtract 10 from the left and right sides of the equation:
 
 
2x + 10 = 20
 
 2x + 10 – 10 = 20 – 10
 
 
2x = 10
 
2. Divide both sides by 2 to find out what x is.
 
 
Because x = 5, the correct answer is Choice (D). If you wound up with any of the other 
answers, you performed the operations incorrectly.
 
To test your answer, plug it back into the original equation in place of the variable and see 
whether both sides are in fact equal. Here, 2(5) + 10 = 10 + 10 = 20, so you’re in the clear. If 
your answer doesn’t match up, however, you need to recheck your work.

118
Part III: Mastering Math and Conquering Quantitative Questions 
Tackle division problems the same way. So, if you’re asked to solve for x in this problem, 
 , you know what to do. Isolate x to the left-hand side of the equal sign by multiplying 
both sides of the equation by 4.
Substituting to solve equations
It doesn’t happen often, but every now and then the HSPT, TACHS, and COOP throw out an 
equation with two different variables and ask you to solve for one of ’em. You can solve an 
equation that contains two different variables as long as you have another equation that 
contains at least one of the variables. Then all you have to do is substitute the value of one 
of the variables into the equation and solve for the other variable. The following sample 
question shows you what that substitution looks like.
 
If 4x + 5y = 30 and y = 2, solve for x.
 
(A) 2
 
(B) 5
 
(C) 10
 
(D) 15
Perhaps you’re wondering how you can possibly solve for one unknown when you have 
yet another unknown. Never fear. The second equation gives you the value of one of the 
unknowns, so you’re actually ready to start solving! The problem tells you that y = 2, so all 
you have to do is put 2 in the place of y and solve for x, like so:
Choice (B) is the answer you’re looking for, but any of the other choices may seem right if 
you mess up while performing the operations.
 Sometimes substitution problems take the form of age problems. Trust that these complex-
sounding word problems are really just asking you to perform simple substitution. Also, age 
questions show up rarely on the Catholic high school entrance exams, so don’t keep your-
self up at night expecting you’ll have to face one.

119
 Chapter 11: Venturing into the Unknown with Variables
Knowing More Than Enough about Inequalities
Mathematical expressions don’t always have to show equal sides. You may in fact see a few 
symbols of inequality, signs that mean values aren’t equal to each other or that one value is 
greater or less than another.
In addition to the symbols for addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division, mathematics 
also applies standard symbols to show how the two sides of an equation are related. You’re 
probably pretty familiar with these symbols, but a little review never hurts. Table 11-1 gives 
you a rundown of the more common symbols used in algebra to signify inequality. Expect to 
see them on your entrance exam.
Table 11-1 
Mathematical Symbols for Inequality
Symbol
Meaning
 
≠
Not equal to
 
>
Greater than
 
<
Less than
 
≥
Greater than or equal to
 
≤
Less than or equal to
 
When you use the greater than or less than symbols, always position the wide side of the 
arrow toward the bigger value, like this: 5 > 2 or 2 < 5. If it helps, you can think of the greater 
than and less than symbols as sharks and the numbers as fish. The shark always goes for 
the bigger fish, which just so happens to be the bigger value.
You can solve for x in simple inequalities just like you do in equations by adding or sub-
tracting the same number to or from both sides of the inequality, as well as multiplying and 
dividing both sides by the same number.
x + 6 ≤ 0
x + 6 – 6 ≤ 0 – 6
x ≤ –6
 
When you multiply or divide both sides of an inequality by a negative number, you have to 
reverse the direction of the inequality symbol. For example, when you simplify –2x < 6 by 
dividing both sides by –2 to isolate x, you switch the symbol so that the final answer is x > –3.
You can also use inequalities to show a range of numbers as opposed to one single value. 
For instance, your entrance exam may show the range of integers between –3 and +2 as an 
inequality, like this: –3 < x < 2. This expression, called a compound inequality, means that x 
could be any of these numbers: –2, –1, 0, and 1.
To show the range of –3 and +2 including –3 and +2, you’d use the ≤ sign: –3 ≤ x ≤ 2. Now 
integers represented by x include all of these possibilities: –3, –2, –1, 0, 1, and 2.
Note that you can separate compound inequalities into two separate inequalities, using the 
variable in each of the new inequalities. Saying –3 ≤ x ≤ 2 is the same as saying x ≥ –3 and 
x ≤ 2.

120
Part III: Mastering Math and Conquering Quantitative Questions 
The following example problem shows you how inequalities generally appear on the 
Catholic high school entrance exams.
 
If 3 > x > –1, and x is an odd integer, what does x equal?
 
(A) 2
 
(B) 0
 
(C) 1
 
(D) –1
Use the process of elimination to narrow your choices. The problem says that x is odd, so you 
know that Choices (A) and (B) are wrong. Neither 2 nor 0 are odd (for more about odd and 
even integers, see Chapter 10). Because x is greater than –1, it can’t equal –1. Consequently, 
Choice (D) is out. The answer must be Choice (C) because you know that x is between 3 and 
–1. Therefore, the possible integers for x are 2, 1, and 0. The only odd integer in that list is 1.

ecause most students don’t take a geometry class until they hit high school, you’re 
probably wondering what you’re going to do about these questions on your Catholic 
high school entrance exam. Well, geometry questions on the HSPT, TACHS, and COOP cover 
the basics, things like measuring angles and working with basic shapes. We’re pretty sure 
you’ve seen most of these fundamental concepts in the math classes you’ve had so far, but 
in case you’ve missed (or forgotten) something important, this chapter is here to help. 
(Note: Some of the geometry problems require you to use basic math and algebra to solve 
them, so make sure to refer to Chapters 10 and 11 if you need refreshers in these areas.)
Walking the Straight and Narrow (And 
Sometimes Wide) of Lines and Angles
Lines and angles form the foundation of geometry, but perhaps it has been a while since 
you’ve thought about the properties of lines or contemplated the elements of angles. 
Fortunately, the following sections present some important definitions and vital rules you 
need to know before you tackle geometry questions on test day.
Defining lines and angles
You don’t need to make flashcards and memorize the following definitions for your entrance 
exam, but you do need to be familiar with them. Here are the common terms about lines 
and angles that may pop up on your test:
 
✓ Line: A straight path of points that extends forever in two directions. Arrows some-
times show that the line goes on forever in either direction. See Line AB in Figure 12-1.

122
Part III: Mastering Math and Conquering Quantitative Questions 
 
✓ Line segment: The set of points on a line between any two points on that line. 
Basically, it’s just a piece of a line from one point to another that contains those points 
and all the points in between. See Line Segment CD in Figure 12-1.
 
Figure 12-1: 
A line 
and line 
segment.
 
B
D
C
A
 
✓ Midpoint: The point halfway (an equal distance) between two endpoints on a line seg-
ment. In Figure 12-1, Point D is the midpoint between Points A and B.
 
✓ Intersect: To cross. Two lines can intersect each other much like two streets cross 
each other at an intersection.
 
✓ Vertical line: A line that runs straight up and down. Figure 12-2 shows you an example 
of this and the three other kinds of lines.
 
✓ Horizontal line: A line that runs straight across from left to right. Check one out in 
Figure 12-2.
 
✓ Parallel lines: Lines that run in the same direction and keep the same distance apart. 
Parallel lines never intersect one another, as illustrated in Figure 12-2.
 
✓ Perpendicular lines: Two lines that intersect to form a square corner. The intersection 
of two perpendicular lines forms a right, or 90°, angle (see Figure 12-2).
 
Figure 12-2: 
Types of 
lines.

Parallel lines
Perpendicular lines
 
✓ Angle: The intersection of two line segments that share an endpoint (called a vertex). 
An angle is usually measured in degrees or radians.
 
✓ Acute angle: Any angle measuring less than 90°. Like an acute, or sharp, pain, an acute 
angle has a sharp point. Another way of looking at it is that acute angles are small and 
therefore “cute.” See Figure 12-3.
 
✓ Right, or perpendicular, angle: An angle measuring exactly 90°. It makes up a square 
corner. If an angle on your entrance exam has a little square like the one in Figure 12-3, 
you know it’s a right angle.
 
✓ Obtuse angle: An angle that measures more than 90° but less than 180°. The opposite 
of an acute angle, an obtuse angle is dull rather than sharp. Figure 12-3 shows what 
an obtuse angle looks like.
 
✓ Straight angle: An angle that measures exactly 180°. A straight angle looks just like a 
straight line, as shown in Figure 12-3.

123

✓ Complementary angles: Angles that add together to total 90°. When you put them 
together, they create a right angle like the one in Figure 12-4.
 
✓ Supplementary angles: Angles that add together to total 180°. Together they form a 
straight angle (see Figure 12-4).
 
Figure 12-4: 
Comple-
mentary and 
supplemen-
tary angles.
 
Supplementary angles
Complementary angles
Knowing these definitions is important because your entrance exam may ask direct ques-
tions about them, much like this sample question.
 
This angle measures 123°. What type of angle is it?
  
 
 
(A) obtuse
 
(B) right
 
(C) acute
 
(D) perpendicular
Without even looking at the figure, you can eliminate Choices (B) and (D). Right and perpen-
dicular refer to the same type of angle, and you can’t have two right answers. So, the angle 
is either obtuse or acute. Remember that acute angles are sharp and little. The angle on the 
figure is dull and wide — the measure of the angle is more than 90°, which makes it obtuse. 
The answer is Choice (A).

124
Part III: Mastering Math and Conquering Quantitative Questions 
Fishing for the facts about lines and angles
If you want to answer the geometry questions on your entrance exam correctly (and we’re 
guessing that you do), you need to know a few facts about the angles that form when lines 
intersect.
The angles across from each other (called opposite or vertical angles) are always equal, and 
the angles right next to each other (called adjacent angles) are always supplementary (mean-
ing they add up to 180°). Last but not least, all of the angles around the point where the lines 
intersect add up to 360°, but you probably already figured that one out!
 Your entrance exam may refer to an angle by using the symbol that means angle, ∠, and list-
ing its three points. The vertex is the middle point.
In Figure 12-5, ∠ABD and ∠EBC are equal, and ∠EBA and ∠CBD are equal. ∠ABD and ∠CBD 
form a straight line, which makes them supplementary. All the other angles that form 
straight lines are also supplementary.
 
Figure 12-5: 
Intersecting 
lines.
 
E
B
A
D
C
When you see parallel lines that are crossed by another line (called a transversal), you know 
a lot about the angles that are formed. Each of the small angles is equal to each other, and 
the large angles are also equal to each other. Additionally, the measurement of any small 
angle added to that of any large angle equals 180°. In Figure 12-6, the small angles are marked 
with one short line, and the large angles are marked with two short lines. All the angles 
marked with one line are equal to each other, and all the angles marked with two lines are 
equal to each other. (So ∠ACB = ∠ADE = ∠HCF = ∠GDF, and ∠ACH = ∠BCF = ∠ADG = ∠EDF.) 
Pretty simple, huh?

 Chapter 12: Getting the Right Angle on Geometry Problems
Following is a sample question that tests your ability to use what you know about the angles 
formed by intersecting lines.
 
In the following figure, Line m and Line n are parallel, and Line t crosses both lines. Given 
the information contained in this figure, what is the value of e?

60°
 
(A) 30°
 
(B) 60°
 
(C) 100°
 
(D) 120°
 
(E) None of the above
 Attention all COOP-takers: In the math portion, you may occasionally see an extra answer tacked 
on that gives you the option to bow out of any of the other answer choices. Don’t fret too much 
about it. Just solve the question like you would any other math problem. If you don’t see the 
right answer among the first four choices, the correct answer is probably “None of the above.”
At first it may look like the picture doesn’t give you enough information to answer the ques-
tion, but when you apply the facts about intersecting parallel lines, you find that you already 
know everything you need to to uncover the right answer. Here’s what you know (get ready; 
it’s an impressive amount):
 
✓ Lines m and n are parallel.
 
✓ Angle a is 60°.
 
✓ Angle a + Angle c = 180° because a and c form a straight line and angles on a straight 
line add up to 180°.
 
✓ Angle c must be 120° because 180 – 60 = 120.
 
✓ Angle c is equal to e because they’re both large angles formed by the parallel lines and 
the intersecting line.
 
✓ The value of e is 120° because c = e and c = 120°.
The correct answer is Choice (D). If you picked any of the other answers, you either subtracted 
incorrectly or you didn’t recognize that a and c are supplementary angles and that c and e are 
equal.
Getting into Basic Shapes
Lines and angles (covered in depth earlier in this chapter) are the building blocks of most of 
the shapes you’ll see on your entrance exam. The general term for closed shapes made of 

126
Part III: Mastering Math and Conquering Quantitative Questions 
lines and angles is polygon. Three connected line segments form a triangle; connect four lines 
together, and you get a quadrilateral. You can create shapes with a larger number of lines, 
but the various entrance exams generally focus on triangles and quadrilaterals.
However, they also spend a bit of time on circles. When you think about it, even circles can 
result from lines and angles. If you connect a bunch of lines that end in points an equal dis-
tance away from a center point, you get a circle. You won’t have to do this exercise for your 
test, but you will have to know a thing or two about circles to answer some of the geometry 
problems. Never fear. With the workout we give you in the following sections, you’ll be in 
good shape for tackling shapes!
Adding a line to an angle to create triangles
What shape has three sides that form three angles when they come together? You guessed 
it: a triangle (with tri meaning “three”). The entrance exam you’re facing is guaranteed to 
test how much you know about triangles, so we suggest you read the following sections 
carefully.
Presenting your personal crash course in triangle properties and types
Time to get into the nitty-gritty of triangles. First things first: understanding how triangles 
are named. The points where the three sides of a triangle come together form angles. 
Triangles are named by the points where the three lines come together, so a triangle with 
points labeled A, B, and C is called ABC.
 
One of the most important facts to know about triangles is that for every kind of triangle, 
the measurements of the three angles always add up to 180°.
It also helps to know that triangles have great proportions. The opposite sides of angles are 
proportionate to those angles, which means the smallest angle faces the shortest side, and 
the largest angle is opposite the longest side. If two or more angles have the same measure-
ment, their opposite sides are equal.
Finally, you should be able to recognize the following special triangles at a glance:
 
✓ An equilateral triangle has three equal sides and three equal angles, like the one in 
Figure 12-7. Because the three angles add up to 180°, the value of each of the angles in 
an equilateral triangle is 60° (180 ÷ 3 = 60).
 
✓ An isosceles triangle has two equal sides, and the values of the angles opposite those 
two sides are also equal. An example is shown in Figure 12-7.
 
✓ A right triangle, like the one in Figure 12-7, has one angle that measures 90°. The side 
opposite the right angle is called the hypotenuse. The other two sides are called the 
legs (but no, triangles can’t walk).

Calculating the area and perimeter of a triangle
Be prepared for the entrance exam you’re facing to include questions about the perimeter 
or area of a triangle. The perimeter of a triangle is the measurement around the outside of 
the triangle. To find it, just add the lengths of all three sides together. So the perimeter of a 
triangle with side lengths of 2 feet, 3 feet, and 4 feet would be 9 feet (2 + 3 + 4 = 9). Perimeter 
questions are usually pretty easy, but they may throw in some extra work like this sample 
question does.
 
The long side of an isosceles triangle measures 8 inches, and one of the two short sides 
measures 5 inches. What is the perimeter of the triangle?
 
(A) 5 inches
 
(B) 10 inches
 
(C) 18 inches
 
(D) 40 inches
The question tells you that the triangle is isosceles, so you know that two of the sides are 
equal. There’s one long side and two shorter sides, which means the two shorter sides must 
be the equal ones. Therefore, the three side lengths, in inches, are 8, 5, and 5. Add the sides 
together to get a perimeter of 18 inches, Choice (C). If you picked Choice (A), you probably 
got so excited about figuring out the other side length that you forgot to add it to the two 
other sides. Choice (D) is the result of multiplying the two known side lengths, which isn’t 
how you figure out perimeter. If you came up with Choice (B), you either didn’t add cor-
rectly or didn’t understand how to calculate the perimeter.
The area of a triangle is the measurement of all the space inside the triangle. To find a trian-
gle’s area, you must use this formula: 
. A stands for (what else?) area, b is the length of 
the base (often — but not always — the bottom) of the triangle, and h stands for the height 
(or altitude) of the triangle, which is the distance that a perpendicular line runs from the base 
to the angle opposite the base. Check out Figure 12-8 for a helpful visual.

Part III: Mastering Math and Conquering Quantitative Questions 
 
The height of a triangle is always perpendicular to the base, and it can be shown either 
inside or outside the triangle.
Care to try your hand at a triangle area question? Be our guest.
 
A triangle with an area of 6 square centimeters has a base of 4 centimeters. What is the 
 triangle’s height in centimeters?
 
(A) 3
 
(B) 4
 
(C) 10
 
(D) 24
Test-takers who have no idea what to do may just multiply 4 and 6 and pick Choice (D). But 
you’re better prepared. Attack this question by substituting information into the formula 
for finding the area of a triangle. Insert 6 in the place of A and 4 in the place of b. Then solve 
for h, like so:
The answer is pretty clearly Choice (A). Guessing is the only way to come up with Choice 
(B) or Choice (C).
Seeing the resemblance in similar triangles
Triangles are similar when they have exactly the same angle measurements. Similar trian-
gles have the same shape, but their sides can be different lengths. The corresponding sides 
of similar triangles are in proportion to each other. The heights or altitudes of the two trian-
gles are also in proportion. Figure 12-9 provides an illustration of the relationship between 
two similar triangles.

 Chapter 12: Getting the Right Angle on Geometry Problems
In Figure 12-9, ABC and RST are similar and have a scale factor of 3 (meaning one triangle 
is three times as large as the other one). Side AB is three times as long as Side RS, Side BC is 
three times as long as Side ST, and Side AC is three times as long as Side RT. Also, the area 
of ABC is 9 (or 32) times as great as that of RST.
Knowing about similar triangles helps you answer questions like this one.
 
RTS and ACB are similar right triangles. What is the measurement, in inches, of Line AB?

C

(A) 10 inches
 
(B) 12 inches
 
(C) 18 inches
 
(D) 24 inches
Because the two triangles are similar, you can use what you know about RTS to find the 
base measurement of ACB. CA is three times greater than TR, so AB must be three times 
greater than RS. The measurement of RS is 6 inches, and 6 × 3 is 18. So the measurement of 
AB must be 18 inches, Choice (C). If you picked any other choice, you didn’t grasp the con-
cept of similar triangles.
Theorizing with Pythagoras
An important triangle rule that applies only to right triangles is the Pythagorean theorem, 
which states that a2 + b2 = c2, where c is the measure of the hypotenuse and a and b are mea-
sures of the legs. The hypotenuse is always the longest of the three sides and is across from 
the right angle. Here’s an example of a Pythagorean theorem question you may encounter.
 
The following triangle is a right triangle, and the two legs (shorter sides) are 6 inches and 8 
inches. What is the measurement, in inches, of the hypotenuse?
  
6 inches
8 inches
?
 
(A) 10 inches
 
(B) 14 inches
 
(C) 24 inches
 
(D) 48 inches

130
Part III: Mastering Math and Conquering Quantitative Questions 
The two legs, a and b, are 6 inches and 8 inches respectively, so all you have to do is substi-
tute those values into the formula and solve.
 a2 + b2 = c2
 62 + 82 = c2
 36 + 64 = c2
 
100 = c2
 
10 = c
The length of the hypotenuse is 10 inches, Choice (A). Choices (B) and (D) result from 
adding or multiplying (respectively) the lengths of the legs rather than plugging them into 
the theorem. If you got Choice (C), you found the triangle’s area, not the length of the 
hypotenuse.
Squaring up with quadrilaterals
Quadrilateral is just a fancy term for a closed shape that has four sides and four angles. 
Squares and rectangles are two classic examples of quadrilaterals. For your entrance exam, 
you may need to know a little bit about the properties of quadrilaterals and how to find 
their areas and perimeters. The next sections are here to help.
Examining parallelograms
The kinds of quadrilaterals you’ll see on your entrance exam are usually parallelograms.
 
Parallelograms have several properties that are good to know for solving math problems:
 
✓ The opposite sides are parallel and equal in length.
 
✓ The measurements of the opposite angles are equal to each other.
 
✓ The measurements of the two angles next to each other add up to 180°.
 
✓ The measurements of the four angles always add up to 360°.
 Several types of parallelograms exist, but here are the two that appear most frequently on 
the HSPT, TACHS, and COOP:
 
✓ A rectangle is a parallelogram with four right angles.
 
✓ A square is a rectangle with four equal sides.
Finding the perimeter and area of parallelograms
The perimeter of a parallelogram is the measurement all the way around the shape’s sides. To 
find the perimeter of any parallelogram (or any polygon for that matter) simply add up the 
measurements of all four sides.
 
Because a square has four equal sides, you can find its perimeter just by multiplying the 
length of one side by 4.
The area of a parallelogram is the value of the space inside the parallelogram. Here’s the for-
mula you use to find it: A = bh. In this case, b stands for the base (or bottom) of the figure, 
and h stands for the height.

131
 Chapter 12: Getting the Right Angle on Geometry Problems
 
Another way of stating the formula for the area of a rectangle (which, as you’re well aware, 
is a parallelogram) is this: Area = length × width. In rectangles and squares, the base and 
height are referred to as the length and width, where the length is always the longer side 
and the width is always the shorter side. Of course, in a square, both the length and the 
width are equal to one another. Figure 12-10 gives you the visual.
 
Figure 12-10: 
Area of a 
rectangle.
 
l
w
 
Because a square has four equal sides, you can easily find its area if you know the length of 
only one side. The area of a square can be expressed as A = s2 or A = s × s, where s is the 
length of a side.
Handling polygons with more than four sides
Just to make life interesting, your entrance exam may throw some polygons with more than 
four sides into the mix. No set formula exists for determining the area of a polygon with more 
than four sides. Instead, you need to focus on creating quadrilaterals and triangles within the 
polygon, finding their areas, and adding them together to get the total area of the polygon.
 
You may recall that the sum of the angles of a triangle is 180° and that the sum of the angles 
of a quadrilateral is 360°. Are you starting to detect a pattern here? Just add another 180° 
and you have the sum of the angles in a five-sided polygon — 540°. But if you had to add the 
angles up like this every time, you’d soon run out of fingers to count on. So here’s a formula 
for determining the sum of the interior angles of any polygon:
Sum of the angles = (n – 2) × 180°, where n is equal to the number of sides
If the polygon is regular (meaning all the sides and angles are equal), you can also determine 
the measure of the individual angles by dividing the sum of the angles by the total number 
of angles. Therefore, each angle in a regular pentagon measures 540 ÷ 5, or 108°.
Following is a sample question that tests your knowledge of angles in polygons.
 
What is the sum of the interior angles of a polygon that has seven sides?
 
(A) 180°
 
(B) 900°
 
(C) 360°
 
(D) 1,260°
First, apply the formula — (n – 2) × 180° — and substitute 7 for n. 7 – 2 is 5, and 5 × 180 is 
900, so the answer is Choice (B). As for the other options, Choice (A) would be correct if 
you were working with a triangle, whereas Choice (C) is the sum of the interior angles in a 
quadrilateral. If you selected Choice (D), you forgot to subtract 2 from the number of sides 
in the polygon.

Piecing together circles
A circle, by technical definition, is a set of points in a plane that are at a fixed distance from 
a given point (called the center). Your entrance exam may include a few questions about 
the measurement of circles, so make sure you know all the info presented in the next three 
sections.
Circling ’round the basics: Radius and diameter
The radius of a circle is the distance from the center of the circle to any point on the circle. 
Think of it as a ray going out from the center to the edge of the circle. The radius is usually 
indicated by the letter r, as shown in Figure 12-11.
The diameter of a circle is the length of a line that goes from one side of the circle to the 
other and passes through the center. The diameter is twice the length of the radius, and it’s 
the longest possible distance across the circle. Diameter is usually indicated by the letter d, 
as you can see in Figure 12-11.
 
If you know the radius of a circle, you can figure out the diameter simply by multiplying the 
radius by 2: d = 2 × r.
 
Figure 12-11: 
The radius 
and 
diameter 
of a circle.

d
Calculating specific circle measurements: Circumference and area
The circumference of a circle is the distance around the circle. To figure out circumference (C), 
you can use one of two formulas:
 
✓ C = 2πr
 
✓ C = πd (This is an option because d = 2r.)
The area of a circle is the value of the space within it. Here’s the formula for calculating the 
area of a circle: A = πr2. See the following section for more on π.
Getting acquainted with π
To find other measurements of a circle besides radius and diameter (such as area and cir-
cumference, discussed in the preceding section), you must be familiar with a little symbol 
called pi (π). π is a math value that’s usually used in figuring out measurements involving 
circles and is approximately equal to 3.14. Following is a sample question that shows you 
how the entrance exams expect you to work with π.
 
What is the circumference of a circle with a radius of 4?
 
(A) 8π
 
(B) 16π
 
(C) 8
 
(D) 4π

133
 Chapter 12: Getting the Right Angle on Geometry Problems
You know that the formula for circumference is 2πr, so just plug in 4 for r. 2 × 4 is 8, so the 
answer is Choice (A). If you picked Choice (B), you used the formula for area. Choice (C) 
neglects the presence of π, and Choice (D) forgets to multiply by 2.
Welcome to the 3-D World of Solid Figures
Solid geometry doesn’t appear frequently on any of the Catholic high school entrance 
exams, so we don’t go into a lot of detail about it. The following sections contain just 
enough information so that you won’t be surprised by a question about rectangular solids, 
cubes, or cylinders on your exam.
Working with rectangular solids and cubes
You make a rectangular solid by taking a simple rectangle and adding depth. Good examples of 
rectangular solids are bricks and boxes of your favorite cereal. A rectangular solid has three 
dimensions: length, height, and width. The volume (V) of a rectangular solid takes all of these 
dimensions into account. It’s a measure of how much space a rectangular solid occupies or, 
to put it in terms everyone can appreciate, how much cereal a cereal box holds.
The volume of an object is measured in cubic units. The formula for the volume of a rectangu-
lar solid is simply length (l) × width (w) × height (h). The short form looks like this: V = lwh.
A cube is a solid made of squares. Because the length, width, and height of a cube have the 
same measurement, the formula for the volume of a cube is even simpler: V = s3, where s 
equals the measure of any of the cube’s sides.
You can see what a rectangular solid and cube look like in Figure 12-12.

In case a solids question should appear on your exam, we want you to be prepared, so 
here’s a sample one for your solving pleasure.
 
The side of a square box measures 2 feet. What is its volume in cubic feet?
 
(A) 4
 
(B) 2
 
(C) 8
 
(D) 16

Part III: Mastering Math and Conquering Quantitative Questions 
You only need to know the measure of one of the sides of a cube to determine its volume 
because volume is the measure of the side cubed. 2 × 2 × 2 = 8, so the answer you’re looking 
for is Choice (C). Choice (A) is the area of a square with a side measurement of 2, not the 
volume of a similar-sided cube. If you opted for Choices (B) or (D), you probably didn’t 
know the formula for the volume of a cube and simply guessed.
Summing up cylinders
A cylinder has a radius, a diameter, and a circumference, just like a circle, but it also has a 
third dimension — its height (or altitude). To get an idea of what a cylinder looks like, think 
of the shape of a soda can or just check out Figure 12-13.
 
Figure 12-13: 
Dimensions 
of a 
cylinder.

h
To calculate the volume of a cylinder, you must first find the area of the base (a circle), 
which is πr2, and multiply by the height (h) of the cylinder. Here’s the formula: V = πr2h.
Traveling from Point to Point 
on the Coordinate Plane
Coordinate geometry (yes, there is indeed such a thing) involves working with points on a 
graph that’s officially known as the Cartesian coordinate plane. This perfectly flat surface con-
tains a system where the position of points can be identified by using a pair of numbers. The 
coordinate plane doesn’t have wings, but it does have points that spread out into infinity.
Following are some of the coordinate geometry terms that show up from time to time on the 
various Catholic high school entrance exams:
 
✓ x-axis: The x-axis is the horizontal axis on a coordinate plane, where values or num-
bers start at the intersect point that has a value of 0. Numbers increase in value to the 
right of this point and decrease in value to the left of it. The x value of a point’s coordi-
nate is always listed first. All points along the x-axis have a y value of 0.
 
✓ y-axis: The y-axis is the vertical axis on a coordinate plane, where values or numbers 
start at the intersect point that has a value of 0. Numbers increase in value going up 
from this point and decrease in value going down from it. The y value of a point’s coor-
dinate is always listed second. All points along the y-axis have an x value of 0.

135
 Chapter 12: Getting the Right Angle on Geometry Problems
 
✓ Origin: The origin is the point (0,0) on the coordinate plain. It’s where the x- and y-axes 
intersect.
 
✓ Quadrant: The intersection of the x- and y-axes forms four quadrants on the coordinate 
plane, which just so happen to be named Quadrants I, II, III, and IV.
 
✓ Ordered pair: An ordered pair is made up of two coordinates, which describe the loca-
tion of a point in relation to the origin. The horizontal (x) coordinate is always listed 
first, and the vertical (y) coordinate is always listed second.
You can identify any point on the coordinate plane by its coordinates, which designate its 
location along the x- and y-axes. For example, the ordered pair (2,3) is a point that’s located 
two places to the right of the origin along the horizontal (x) number line and three places 
up on the vertical (y) number line. In Figure 12-14, Point A is at (2,3). Pretty simple, huh?

When it comes to quadrants, Quadrant I starts to the right of the y-axis and above the x-axis. 
In other words, it’s the upper-right portion of the coordinate plane. As shown in Figure 12-14, 
the other quadrants move counterclockwise around the origin.
Here’s a short overview of what you can find in each quadrant (refer to Figure 12-14 to see 
where each specific point is located):
 
✓ All points in Quadrant I have a positive x value and a positive y value. Point A is in 
Quadrant I and has coordinates (2,3).
 
✓ All points in Quadrant II have a negative x value and a positive y value. Point B is in 
Quadrant II and has coordinates (–1,4).

136
Part III: Mastering Math and Conquering Quantitative Questions 
 
✓ All points in Quadrant III have a negative x value and a negative y value. Point C is 
in Quadrant III and has coordinates (–5,–2).
 
✓ All points in Quadrant IV have a positive x value and a negative y value. Point D is in 
Quadrant IV and has coordinates (7,–6).
 You may be asked to identify what quadrant a particular point belongs in, so know how to 
find where a given set of coordinates “flies” on the coordinate plane.

Math Word Problems

N
ot all of the math questions on your Catholic high school entrance exam will contain 
one sentence or request that you simply “Solve for x.” In fact, some of the math ques-
tions get downright wordy. They ask you to sift through bunches of information to figure 
out just what the real question is. These word problems require you to translate words into 
numbers and then arrange them in a way that makes mathematical sense. You know what 
we’re talking about — those problems that tell you how fast Train A travels and what speed 
Train B moves along at and then expect you to figure out exactly what hour the two trains 
will collide. Yikes!
Don’t worry; there’s a system to all of this. Several words translate nicely into mathematical 
expressions; certain types of word problems, like work and rate problems, lend themselves 
perfectly to specific formulas or strategies; and graphs and maps can be downright fun to 
work with — all of which you discover in this chapter.
Translating English into Math
When you see a word problem on a math test, you may feel a little lost. Straightforward 
math equations seem so much more, well, straightforward. Even though they’re written in 
English, word problems may read like a foreign language to you. To help you with the trans-
lation, Table 13-1 provides you with some of the more common words you’ll encounter in 
word problems and tells you what they mean (and look like!) in math terms.

Subtraction phrases such as “taken away from,” “subtracted from,” “less than,” and “fewer 
than” require you to switch the order of the quantities you’re subtracting. For example, 
“Ten decreased by six” means 10 – 6 (which equals 4), but “Ten subtracted from six” is  
6 – 10, or –4.
 
As you read through a word problem, analyze its language to determine what math opera-
tions it involves. First, figure out what you’re supposed to solve for, specifically what the x 
is in the equation. Then analyze the rest of the information to figure out how you arrange 
the equation to solve for x.
Many of the word problems on the various entrance exams concern percentages, like 
this one.
 
To pay for college expenses, Ms. Bond takes out a loan in the amount of $650 with a simple 
interest rate of 8%. What is the total amount of the loan with interest?
 
(A) $658
 
(B) $52
 
(C) $702
 
(D) $1,170
The problem asks for the total amount (that’s the x) of Ms. Bond’s loan with (which means +) 
interest, so you have to add what she owes in interest to the original amount of the loan. 
Before you add the interest amount, you must find out what the amount of interest is. The 
language tells you that there’s an interest rate of (meaning ×) 8% (which means you divide 
8 by 100). Written with numbers rather than words, the problem would look something like 
this: x = (8 ÷ 100) × $650 + $650. When you do the operation in parentheses first (as explained 
in Chapter 10), you find that 8 ÷ 100 is 0.08. Next, multiply $650 by 0.08: $650 × 0.08 = $52. 
Ms. Bond therefore pays $52 in interest. Add the interest amount to the loan amount to get 
your final answer: $650 + $52 = $702. The correct answer is Choice (C). If you picked Choice 
(A), you added 8 to $650, which isn’t the proper way to determine interest. Choice (B) is 
the correct interest amount but not the total amount of the loan plus the interest. If you 
opted for Choice (D), you incorrectly divided 8 by 10 rather than 100 to come up with the 
interest amount.

Punching the Clock: Work Problems
Work problems ask you to find out either how much work two or more workers get done in 
a certain amount of time or how long it takes two or more workers to complete a task 
together or individually. Following is the standard formula for algebra work problems:
Total production = (Rate of work × Time)Worker 1 + (Rate of work × Time)Worker 2
Total production refers to the amount of work that gets done. When you encounter work 
problems, find the information in the story that fills in the formula. Then solve. Here’s an 
example of how you can apply this formula on an entrance exam work problem.
 
There are two furniture movers, Andy and Barbara. Andy can move 16 pieces of furniture per 
day, and Barbara can move 24 pieces per day. If they each work 8-hour days, how many 
pieces of furniture can the two of them move in 1 hour, assuming they maintain a steady rate?
 
(A) 2
 
(B) 5
 
(C) 40
 
(D) 160
Naming numerical place holders
The kind of place holders we’re talking about are most 
definitely not the ones your grandmother uses to show 
where each family member sits at the Thanksgiving 
table! Instead, these place holders are the names you 
use to refer to the place each digit holds in a number. 
Here’s a little chart that shows the name of each digit 
from millions to millionths for the rather unwieldy

Part III: Mastering Math and Conquering Quantitative Questions 
This question asks you to find the amount of production and gives you the rate and the 
time. But to calculate the rate properly, you must state the hours in terms of days. Because 
a day is eight hours, one hour is 1⁄8 of a day. Figure out how much Andy loads in one hour 
(1⁄8 of a day) and add that to what Barbara loads in one hour:
Total production = Andy’s (work rate × time) + Barbara’s (work rate × time)
Total production = (16 × 1⁄8) + (24 × 1⁄8)
Total production = 2 + 3
Total production = 5
You now know that Andy and Barbara can load 5 pieces of furniture in 1 hour (1⁄8 of a day), 
which is Choice (B). If you picked Choice (C), you figured out the total production for 1 day 
rather than 1 hour. And if you selected one of the other two choices, well, that was just 
guessing.
Another type of work problem gives you the amount of time two workers take to complete a 
job alone and then asks you to find the amount of time they need to complete the job when 
they work together. For these types of questions, time is the unknown. Let the job (or total 
production) equal 1 because there’s just one job to complete. Here’s the formula:
The first fraction represents the effort of the first worker, and the second fraction repre-
sents (not surprisingly) the effort of the second worker. An exam question of this type looks 
a little something like the following.
 
Sally can finish sewing a quilt in 3 days; Meg completes a quilt in 9 days. How many days 
does it take for the two women to sew a quilt if they work together?
 
(A) 6 days
 
(B) 4.5 days
 
(C) 1 day
 
(D) 2.25 days
Apply the formula. The unknown for both women is how much time each spends when they 
work together, so make that the x for both of them. You know the amount of time each 
woman spends alone, so enter those figures into the formula:
To add the fractions, make the denominators the same (flip to Chapter 10 if you need a 
refresher on how to do this) and solve:

141
 Chapter 13: Making Sense out of Math Word Problems
It takes the women 2.25 days working together to sew one quilt, which is the answer in 
Choice (D). You can eliminate Choices (A) and (B) because it wouldn’t take longer for the 
two women working together than it takes for Sally to sew a quilt alone. If you picked 
Choice (C), you probably just guessed.
 Work problems are fairly rare on the Catholic high school entrance exams, so don’t worry 
too much if you’re not terribly fond of them. Who likes work, anyway?
Going the Distance: Rate Problems
Any problem involving distance, rate (just a fancy name for speed), or time spent traveling 
can be boiled down into the formula for computing distance: Distance = Rate × Time. Sure, 
that looks easy, but you can mess up quickly if you don’t have your variables and numbers 
plugged in properly. With that in mind, check out this sample rate problem.
 
Paige can run a mile in 8 minutes. How long does it take her to run 1⁄10 of a mile at the 
same rate?
 
(A) 30 seconds
 
(B) 48 seconds
 
(C) 60 seconds
 
(D) 480 seconds
The problem tells you that Paige’s distance is 1⁄10 of a mile. You can figure her rate to be 1⁄8 
because she runs 1 mile in 8 minutes. But because the problem is asking how long she runs, 
you need to solve for time. Plug the numbers into the distance formula:
 Distance = Rate × Time
 
1⁄10 = 1⁄8 × t
To find time, you need to isolate t on one side of the equation, so divide both sides by 1⁄8 or 
multiply both sides by 8. (Here’s a hint: Multiplying is faster.)
 (1⁄10) × 8 = t
 
8⁄10 = t
So Paige runs 1⁄10 of a mile in 8⁄10 of a minute. Because 8⁄10 isn’t an answer choice, you must con-
vert minutes to seconds. One minute equals 60 seconds, so 8⁄10 × 60 seconds is 48 seconds. 
The correct answer must be Choice (B). Choice (D) is obviously wrong because 480 seconds 
is 8 minutes, and you know that it takes Paige less time to run 1⁄10 of a mile than it does for her 
to run a whole mile. Guessing is the only way you can come up with one of the other two 
answers.
 
Always check the possible answer choices for options that don’t make any sense in the 
problem. You can toss those out right away and save your time for doing the math.

The Ins and Outs of Graphs and Charts
Whether you’re taking the HSPT, TACHS, or COOP, expect to encounter some math ques-
tions containing graphs or charts that you have to evaluate. Several different kinds of 
graphs and charts exist, and some are better than others at depicting specific kinds of infor-
mation. The following sections show the various types of graphs and charts and tell you the 
type of information each one portrays best. (Note: Pictographs and maps also tend to 
appear on the various Catholic high school entrance exams. They’re pretty self-explanatory, 
though, so we don’t spend time covering them.)
 
Chart and graph questions appear most frequently on the TACHS.
Reporting values with tables
Tables (like the one shown in Figure 13-1) are good for reporting values. For instance, a 
table is good for displaying the results of a science experiment, reporting the average daily 
high and low temperatures for a city, or listing a band’s top ten hits. On the other hand, 
tables aren’t great for showing percentages or trends. You can use tables to compare data, 
but that usually isn’t their primary purpose.

Depicting range and comparing data 
with bar graphs
Bar graphs are good for showing a range of values or how often values occur in a specific 
data set. For example, you can use a bar graph to show the number of high school students 
employed in specific summer jobs. With two or more types of bars, you can show compari-
sons between, say, the types of jobs seniors hold and those held by juniors. The bar graph 
in Figure 13-2 not only shows the range of test scores in an algebra course but it also com-
pares them by class period.

Looking at things over time with line graphs
Line graphs are good for observations made over time. Time almost always lies on the 
x-axis; what’s being measured usually resides on the y-axis. Line graphs are especially useful 
for showing trends, peaks, or lows, as you can see in Figure 13-3.

Piecing together the whole with pie charts
Pie charts, also known as circle graphs, are very handy for showing values that are parts of a 
whole, such as percentages. They show how much there is of one thing compared to how 
much there is of another. The chart in Figure 13-4 presents a clear picture of the percentage 
of students employed in a variety of summer jobs.

Visualizing relationships with Venn diagrams
Venn diagrams are made of circles (usually two or three on the various entrance exams) and 
are good for showing relationships among things. Each entity or group is represented by a 
circle. How these circles intersect shows how the different members of each group are 
related. Figure 13-5 illustrates the relationship among the members of three school clubs. 
Twelve students are in the math club, 15 are in the service club, and 20 are in the art club. 
Three members of the math club are also in the art club, five members of the art club are 
also in the service club, and two students are members of all three clubs.

Approaching chart and graph questions
Some exam questions present data on some type of chart or graph and then ask you to eval-
uate said data. Your particular test may even ask more than one question about a particular 
graph. When you see such questions, follow these steps to answer them:
 
1. Look over the chart or graph to determine its type.
 
2. Read the question.
 
3. Figure out what you need from the graph.
 
4. Solve the problem.
Here’s a sample problem that shows you how to apply these four simple steps.
 
This bar graph shows how many students received high school scholarships at four differ-
ent schools. Which of the four high schools presented just about twice as many scholar-
ships as the school that gave the fewest number of scholarships?

(A) St. John
 
(B) St. Thomas
 
(C) Carroll
 
(D) Jamestown
The graph presents four bars, one for each high school. The numbers on the y-axis of the 
graph show the number of students who received scholarships. The highest bar represents 
the school that gave out the greatest number of scholarships; the lowest bar is the school 
that distributed the fewest. Jamestown has the lowest bar, so you can eliminate Choice (D). 
Look on the y-axis to determine about how many scholarships Jamestown gave out. The 
Jamestown bar ends at the number 20, but you’re looking for the school that gave out twice 
as many scholarships as Jamestown. Well, 2 × 20 is 40, so find 40 on the y-axis and note 
which bar ends at the 40 mark. Carroll is the one! Choice (C) is your answer. St. Thomas has 
the highest bar, but it ends at 60, which means it gave out at least three times as many 
scholarships as Jamestown. Choice (B) is therefore wrong. St. John gave out 30 scholar-
ships, which isn’t twice the number of Jamestown scholarships; eliminate Choice (A).

146
Part III: Mastering Math and Conquering Quantitative Questions 
Your entrance exam may also ask you to choose which chart is best at showing a particular 
type of data, so make sure you know which charts and graphs are best for showing which 
types of information. Following is a sample of this question type.
 
Which of these diagram methods would be the best way to show what specific percentages 
of total middle school student athletes participate in baseball, football, tennis, golf, and 
 basketball?
 
(A) Table
 
(B) Line graph
 
(C) Venn diagram
 
(D) Pie chart
Usually the best chart for showing parts of a total is a pie chart, Choice (D). A table reports 
data nicely, but it doesn’t show percentages well; cut Choice (A). A line graph is better for 
showing trends over time, but that’s not what you’re looking for, so Choice (B) is wrong. 
A Venn diagram would be good to show how many athletes participate in one sport, two 
sports, or more, but it’s not so great at showing percentages. Choice (C) isn’t right, so 
Choice (D) is the logical answer.

Sifting through Sequence Problems
In This Chapter
▶ Seeing sequences in pictures and symbols
▶ Finding numerical patterns in number sequences
▶ Picturing and counting letters to solve letter sequences
S
equence problems give you a pattern and ask you to complete a missing part of it. The 
patterns come in three varieties: pictures, numbers, and letters. The approach to these 
questions is pretty much the same regardless of the type of pattern.
 Sequence questions appear only on the COOP and HSPT, so if you’re taking the TACHS, 
you don’t have to worry about them. The COOP has a completely separate section for 
these babies, whereas the HSPT just sprinkles a few number sequence questions into its 
Quantitative Skills section.
Discovering the Design in the Picture Sequence
The picture sequence appears only in the COOP exam’s Sequences section. Previous tests 
have had only about six of these questions, and there’s no reason to believe that the COOP-
powers-that-be will add too many more to future tests. The patterns seem to get more com-
plex as you move through the picture sequence questions, so usually the first questions are 
easier than the last ones.
Defining picture sequences
The picture sequence is a list of two to four related figures usually arranged in four groups in 
some sort of logical pattern. The questions can distinguish the figures by shape, shading, 
size, position, or any number of differentiations. At the end of the sequence is a blank. Your 
job is to find the answer choice that logically completes the pattern.
We could spend paragraphs talking about what a picture sequence looks like, but because a 
picture is worth a thousand words, here’s a visual example of one:
(A)
(B)
(C)
(D)

148
Part III: Mastering Math and Conquering Quantitative Questions 
Notice that the sequence is a set of four groups of three figures. A logical pattern exists 
within the group of three figures and among the set of four groups. From your analysis of this 
pattern, you must choose which of the figures in the answer choices completes the pattern.
Strategizing your approach to picture sequence 
questions
Don’t be overwhelmed by picture sequences! They’re not worth it. If you use a strategy to 
answer these questions, you’ll figure them out pretty easily. Here’s how to do just that with 
the sample question from the preceding section:
 
1. Look at the sequence briefly to get a general idea of the types of features it uses to 
distinguish each figure.
 
 When facing picture sequences, it may help to write down a one-word description of 
each figure type in the sequence.
 
 The sequence in question includes four groups of three figures. There are four different 
shapes, and all four shapes are circles. One is completely shaded (shaded), one con-
tains a circle within a circle like a doughnut (doughnut), one looks like a NO sign (NO), 
and the other is plain (plain).
 
2. Examine the groups to see whether you can find an obvious pattern.
 
 Note: In the first question or two, a pattern may jump out at you, but usually clear pat-
terns don’t readily emerge in picture sequences.
 
 There are no duplicate figures in each group, and at least two of each figure appear in 
the whole sequence. There’s a plain in every group, and the doughnut appears in each 
of the first three groups.
 
3. Scan the answer choices to gauge whether you can eliminate any containing figures 
that don’t belong.
 
 Usually, you can eliminate at least two obviously wrong answer choices by looking 
over all the options. In this case, you can eliminate Choice (C), the smiley face, because 
the pattern doesn’t introduce new shapes into the third position within the groups. Also 
cross out Choice (B), because no figure appears twice in one group, which means the pat-
tern doesn’t justify two plains. You’re now left with Choice (A), shaded, and Choice (D), 
doughnut.
 
4. Express the pattern in words to determine which of the remaining answer choices 
fits best.
 
 The pattern goes shaded, plain, doughnut; NO, doughnut, plain; shaded, doughnut, 
plain; NO, plain. . . . The first and third groups start with a shaded circle, and the 
second and fourth groups start with a NO sign. Consequently, it doesn’t make sense for 
the last group to end with a shaded. You can probably cross out Choice (A). Check 
Choice (D), though. Could the last group use a doughnut in the last spot? Yes, all 
groups have a doughnut, and the doughnut appears in either the second or third spot 
of each group. Putting Choice (D) at the end of the last group makes more sense than 
any of the other answer choices.
 
5. If you think you’re spending too much time (like more than a minute) on one ques-
tion, mark your best guess from the remaining answer choices and move on.
 
 As we explain in Chapter 2, marking something on your answer sheet is always better 
than leaving a question blank.

Picture sequences always have a logical pattern, even if it doesn’t seem like that at first. 
Concentrate and you’ll get it!

The pictures in this question are actually symbols. Odd, perhaps, but this still counts as a 
picture sequence. You have four groups of @s (which we’ll call “and”) and #s (which we’ll 
name “pound”). Each group has two @s and two #s. That’s all you need to know to eliminate 
Choices (B) and (D) because both of those choices give the last group three of one of the 
symbols, which just isn’t consistent with the rest of the sequence. You’ve now narrowed 
the possibilities to Choice (A) and Choice (C). Look at the sequence again. The pattern is 
and, and, pound, pound; pound, pound, and, and; and, pound, and, pound; pound, and. . . . 
Notice that the second group is the opposite of the first. You can safely guess that the 
fourth group is the opposite of the third, which is Choice (A). That makes much more sense 
than picking Choice (C).
Noticing the Pattern in Number Sequences
Some sequence problems ask you to recognize the patterns in groups of numbers. The pat-
tern can be about repeating numbers or combinations of numbers, like 4, 5, 6, 4, 5, 6. Or it 
can be a result of adding, subtracting, multiplying, or dividing in a set manner, like a pattern 
of adding 2 to each number to get a sequence of 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12. Or it can be a little of both: 
2, 2, 4, 4, 6, 6.
 Two of the entrance exams contain number sequence questions. The HSPT sticks a few in 
its Quantitative Skills section, and the COOP includes them in its Sequences section, along 
with the picture and letter sequences. The following sections offer advice for solving both 
tests’ number sequence problems.
Solving the HSPT number sequence questions
The patterns of the HSPT number sequence questions result from performing one or more 
mathematical operations. Usually the HSPT presents you with a sequence of numbers and 
asks you to figure out what comes next. But sometimes it asks you to come up with a 
number in the middle of the sequence.
 
The HSPT patterns are pretty easy to spot if you ask yourself what math operation you must 
perform to move from number to number. Be sure to write the operation in your test book-
let as you examine the sequence so you don’t lose track.
Basically, if an HSPT number sequence question wants you to provide the next number in 
this sequence — 44, 48, 52, 56 — just do the math. Look at the first number, 44. What opera-
tion do you perform to 44 to get the second number, 48? You add 4. Write +4 in your test 
booklet in between 44 and 48. Then look at 52. It’s 4 more than 48, so you perform the same 

150
Part III: Mastering Math and Conquering Quantitative Questions 
operation. A quick glance at the next number, 56, tells you that you solved the mystery. Just 
add 4 to 56 to determine that 60 is the next number in the sequence.
Of course, not all patterns are as simple as that. Some require more than one operation, and 
some call for you to rethink the pattern entirely. Check out this example.
 
Consider the following sequence: 2, 4, 6, 12, 14, . . . What number comes next?
 
(A) 16
 
(B) 18
 
(C) 28
 
(D) 21
At first you may look at the 2 and the 4 and think your first operation is +2. Then the second 
operation would be to add 2 to 4 to get 6. You may think you’re on to something, add 2 to 14 
to get 16, and hastily pick Choice (A), but you’d be wrong. Take the pattern a step further, 
and you notice that you don’t add 2 to 6 to get 12. Instead, 12 results from multiplying 6 by 
2. You have to rethink the pattern to get this question right.
Go back and consider the first two numbers of the sequence, 2 and 4. You can also move 
from 2 to 4 by multiplying by 2. Erase the +2 you undoubtedly wrote between 2 and 4 in 
your test booklet and write in ×2 instead. You still add 2 to 4 to get 6, so keep the +2 
between those two numbers. Write ×2 in between 6 and 12. The next number is 14, which is 
2 more than 12. Write in +2 and check out the pattern: ×2, +2, ×2, +2. The next operation in 
the pattern is to multiply by 2: 14 × 2 is 28, which is Choice (C). (If you answered Choice (B) 
or Choice (D), you were probably sleeping!)
Cracking the COOP number sequence questions
The COOP’s number sequences look similar to its picture sequences (described earlier in 
this chapter). They usually consist of three sets of three numbers. Patterns appear within 
the individual sets of numbers and are maintained throughout the entire sequence of num-
bers. One of the numbers in the last set in the sequence is missing. Your mission (should 
you choose to accept it — and we advise that you do) is to uncover its identity. Search for 
clues in the first sets of numbers. Following is an example of what a COOP number sequence 
may look like.
 
17  20  40    11  14  28    33  _____  72
 
(A) 35
 
(B) 36
 
(C) 30
 
(D) 69
 Like the HSPT number sequence questions, the COOP number sequences usually apply 
mathematical operations to the numbers to create patterns. (We reveal how to apply basic 
operations to number sequences in the preceding section.) Unlike those on the HSPT, how-
ever, the COOP questions may also include other operations (such as squares and cubes of 
numbers) and different types of number patterns (like repeating a certain number in each 
set) that aren’t as obvious as patterns that are based solely on addition, subtraction, multi-
plication, and division.

151
 Chapter 14: Sifting through Sequence Problems
Here’s how to approach a COOP number sequence question like the earlier sample one:
 
1. Examine the first two numbers in the first set of the sequence and determine what 
mathematical operation relates them.
 
 The difference between 17 and 20 is 3, so the operation is probably +3.
 
2. Check out the first two numbers in the second set of the sequence to see whether their 
relationship is the same as the relationship of the first two numbers in the first set.
 
 You add 3 to 11 to get 14, so the operation is very likely +3.
 
3. If the relationships are the same, write that relationship in your test booklet.
 
 Write +3 in your booklet and add 3 to 33 (which is 36). Look for 36 in the answer 
choices. It’s there! Just to be safe, though, check the rest of the sequence to make sure 
you haven’t missed something.
 
4. Examine and compare the second and third numbers in the first two sets in a similar 
way and write down the appropriate operation in your booklet.
 
 You add 20 to 20 to get 40, so the operation could be +20. You don’t add 20 to 14 to get 
28, but you can multiply 14 by 2 to get 28. Hmm. 20 × 2 is 40, so the operation must be ×2. 
36 × 2 is 72. You’ve completed the pattern. Well done!
 
5. If a pattern that applies to all sets isn’t obvious, scan the answer choices for clues.
 
 Eliminate choices that have nothing to do with the pattern. Then try replacing the 
blank with the remaining choices; doing so may reveal the proper pattern.
Feeling good about how to tackle the COOP’s number sequence questions? Then apply the 
steps we just walked you through to this potentially tricky sample question.
 
4  9  8    3  9  6    7  _____  14
 
(A) 21
 
(B) 15
 
(C) 9
 
(D) 12
No consistent operation exists that can get you from 4 to 9 and from 3 to 9, so something 
else must be going on in this sequence. The first two sets have a middle number of 9. You 
don’t know about the middle number of the third set because that’s the one you have to 
find. The pattern may simply repeat 9 as the middle number with no related math operation 
at all! (Note that there is a related math operation between the first and third number of 
each set; you multiply the first number by 2 to get the third number.) Look at the answer 
choices. 9 is an option in Choice (C). That’s the only logical answer.
If you picked Choice (A), you may have looked at the second set of numbers and thought 
the pattern was to multiply the first number by 3 to get the second. But that doesn’t work 
for the first set of numbers. If you opted for Choice (D), you may have added 5 to 7 based on 
your observation in the first set that adding 5 to 4 gives you 9. The second set of numbers 
doesn’t follow this operation, though. If you decided to concentrate on the last two num-
bers of the first set, you probably picked Choice (B). You may have decided that the opera-
tion between the last numbers in the set was –1 and filled in the missing number with 15. 
That just doesn’t work for the second set of numbers, so it can’t be right.
 
What’s true about a pattern for one of the sets of numbers in the sequence has to be true 
for all the sets, so check each set before you settle on a solution to the mystery of the 
missing number.

Part III: Mastering Math and Conquering Quantitative Questions 
Looking Closely at Letter Sequences 
on the COOP
The COOP’s Sequences section ends with several questions that ask you to find a pattern in 
sets of letters (sometimes with a few numbers thrown in for sport). The COOP groups the 
letters in several sets that typically have three or four letters each. Your task? Examine the 
sets of letters to determine a pattern and eliminate answers that don’t fit.
Solving letter sequences requires you to combine the skills you need for solving picture and 
number sequences (which we present earlier in this chapter). Think of each letter as a kind 
of figure (like you find in the picture sequences) and consider the numerical properties of 
letters as you move up and down the alphabet. The letter sequences on the COOP often 
involve both properties. The next sections get you acquainted with letter sequences and 
how to solve them.
Picturing letters as figures
Be prepared for the COOP to use the appearance of letters to create a pattern in one of 
these ways:
 
✓ It may create sequences from a combination of lowercase and uppercase letters, such 
as RrRr  SsSs  TtTt  _____.
 
✓ Patterns can emerge from combinations of vowels and consonants similar to some-
thing like this: MOMA  NONA  POPA  _____.
 
Sometimes the easiest way to solve sequences that focus on the appearance of the letters is 
to eliminate answer choices that don’t fit.
Counting letters like numbers
When attempting to solve letter sequence problems, we suggest you look at the alphabet as 
a sort of number line. The COOP forms patterns based on the amount of spaces between let-
ters up and down the alphabet. For example, you can consider the set of {A,C,E} as moving 
up the alphabet 2 spaces (+2). Here’s how this pattern could develop:
ACE  BDF  CEG  DFH
 
If you’re not particularly familiar with the position of each letter in the alphabet, you may 
want to quickly write it out at the top of your test booklet before you tackle the letter 
sequences. Although this step seems time consuming, it may actually save you time 
because you won’t have to continually recite the alphabet song in your head while you’re 
taking the exam.
Some of the letter sequences may contain actual numbers, usually in the form of exponents 
or subscripts. So you may see a sequence like this one on the COOP:
A1B2C3  A2B3C4  A3B4C5  A4B5C6
The letters stay the same, and the numbers increase by 1 within each set. The beginning 
number of each set is 1 more than the beginning number of the previous set.

153
 Chapter 14: Sifting through Sequence Problems
Use the following sample letter sequence question to jump right in!
 
SaTa    UaVa    WaXa    _____
 
(A) YaZA
 
(B) XaYa
 
(C) YaZa
 
(D) TaSa
Each set of this sequence contains an alternating repetitive lowercase a. That means you 
can immediately eliminate Choice (A) because it contains a nonconforming uppercase A. 
(Choice (A) is such a rebel!) All the remaining answers present the lowercase a in the 
proper position, so you need to dig into the pattern more deeply to find the answer.
The consonants of each set move up the alphabet one space from S to X. The next conso-
nant after X is Y, so the next set should be YaZa, which is Choice (C). Choice (B) duplicates 
X, which isn’t part of the pattern, and Choice (D) presents a tricky little reversal of the first 
set, which isn’t justified by the rest of the sequence.

Quantitative Relationships

Q
uantitative questions test your ability to work out logic problems by using quantita-
tive concepts such as space and measure.
 Even though all three Catholic high school entrance exams test essentially the same mathe-
matics concepts, each exam has a quantitative question type that’s a little out of the ordinary.
 
✓ The HSPT includes a question in its Quantitative Skills section that asks you to evalu-
ate and compare three different values.
 
✓ The COOP not only devotes an entire section to three distinctive types of quantitative 
reasoning questions but also throws in a few questions about sets.
 
✓ The TACHS gets really original with its ability questions; one of its question types may 
remind you of arts-and-crafts hour as you mentally fold and punch paper.
Although these question types look different from one another, they test the same concepts 
and are actually pretty fun. In fact, you may find yourself doing some of these problems just 
for grins!
Weighing the Values for Comparison Questions
Some quantitative questions test your ability to compare values. The HSPT accomplishes 
this goal with a few quantitative comparison questions scattered throughout its 
Quantitative Skills section, whereas the COOP has you weigh symbols on a scale to come up 
with an equal balance. We help you figure out how to handle both kinds of questions in the 
following sections.
Sizing up HSPT comparisons
The quantitative comparison questions on the HSPT test a variety of math concepts (so 
check out Chapters 10, 11, and 12 if you need a review of the basics). What makes these 

156
Part III: Mastering Math and Conquering Quantitative Questions 
questions different from other math questions is that they give you three values in the form 
of equations, geometric values, or inequalities and ask you to compare and contrast them.
The questions start by asking you to evaluate three problems, (a), (b), and (c). Here’s how 
you do that:
 
1. To effectively compare the three values, you first have to figure them out, so deter-
mine the value of (a) and write it down in your test booklet and then do the same for 
(b) and (c).
 
 If the three problems contain variables, you may not be able to come up with a clear 
value for each option because the values depend on what the variables are. For these 
questions, focus on what you know about the relationship among the three problems.
 
2. Give a quick consideration to the relationships among the three values before you 
check out the answer choices; assess which value is greater, which is lesser, and 
which values are equal.
 
 Always try to figure out the three values before looking at the answer choices. If you 
skim the answer choices first, you may swerve off track or miss something.
 
3. Look through the answer choices and eliminate those that don’t match the relation-
ships you’ve come up with.
 
 The remaining choice is the right answer!
Try this approach on the following practice question that asks you to evaluate equations.
 
Look at (a), (b), and (c) and choose the best answer.
 
 (a) (2 × 3) + 11
 
 (b) (7 × 3) − 3
 
 (c) (6 × 2) + 6
 
(A) (b) is less than (a) and less than (c).
 
(B) (b) is equal to (c) and less than (a).
 
(C) (a) is equal to (c) and greater than (b).
 
(D) (c) is greater than (a).
To find the values of (a), (b), and (c), you perform simple operations. Solve (a) first: 2 × 3 = 
6, and 6 + 11 = 17. Write 17 next to (a) and move on to (b): 7 × 3 = 21, and 21 – 3 = 18, so 
write 18 next to (b). Finally, calculate the value of (c): 6 × 2 = 12, and 12 + 6 is 18. Write 18 
next to (c). Note that (b) is equal to (c) and (a) is less than (c) or (b). Read through the 
answer choices. The only one that works is Choice (D). If you picked any of the other 
choices, you probably didn’t figure out the values before you looked at the answer choices. 
You may have quickly glanced at (a), (b), and (c) and thought that (a) was greater than the 
other two values because more was added to (a) than to the other two. Or perhaps you 
thought that (b) had a lesser value because it included subtraction rather than addition.

157
 Chapter 15: Comprehending Comparisons and Other Quantitative Relationships
Balancing COOP symbol relationships
The problems described in this section, which only appear on the COOP, feature a scale 
that shows equal measures of combinations of two different shapes (usually squares and 
triangles), like this:
Based on the information provided by the scale, you must choose an answer that shows 
equal measures of the two shapes. The answer choices look a little something like this:
(A)
(B)
(C)
(D)
 
You can balance the scales using substitution just like you would for an algebra problem 
with two variables (see Chapter 11). So, for example, if the problem tells you that one 
square equals two triangles, you can substitute two triangles for every square in the answer 
choices to find the right answer.
When you combine that advice with our ongoing example, you find that you can rewrite the 
answer choices in your test booklet like so:
(A)
(B)
(C)
(D)

158
Part III: Mastering Math and Conquering Quantitative Questions 
After you change all the shapes to triangles, all you have to do is compare the triangles. A 
quick glance shows you that Choice (C) balances the scale: Four triangles are equal to four 
triangles. The other answers don’t balance the scale: Neither six triangles nor two triangles 
are equal to one triangle; similarly, two triangles aren’t equal to three triangles. Make sense? 
Great. Now give this sample question a whirl.
 
(A)
(B)
(C)
(D)
This question requires an additional math step before you do your substitution. The scale 
tells you that two squares are equal to four triangles. That’s great, but you still need to 
know what one square is equal to. It’s probably obvious to you that if two squares equal 
four triangles, then one square equals two triangles. If not, simply set up a proportion and 
solve: 2⁄4 = 1⁄x. (For a refresher on how to solve a proportion, head to Chapter 10.)
Because one square equals two triangles, you replace every square with two triangles.
(A)
(B)
(C)
(D)
Choice (A) says that four triangles are equal to one triangle, so eliminate that answer. You 
can also cut Choices (C) and (D) because five triangles aren’t equal to two triangles and one 
triangle isn’t equal to three triangles. Choice (B) is the answer: Two triangles equal two tri-
angles. See how fun this type of quantitative comparison problem can be?
Deciphering Numerical Relationships 
on the COOP
The COOP’s Quantitative Reasoning section contains a question type that’s a lot like 
number sequence questions (see Chapter 14 for more on sequences). Each question pres-
ents you with three series consisting of a number that points to a box that points to another 

159
 Chapter 15: Comprehending Comparisons and Other Quantitative Relationships
number, except that the last number of the last series is missing. (Got all that?) Your job is 
to find the value of the missing number by using clues from the first two series.
To accomplish this task, evaluate the first two series to determine what operation belongs 
in the box. For example, examine this relationship: 2 → ❑ → 3. The operation you use to 
move from 2 to 3 is +1, so the relationship between the numbers — in other words, the stuff 
that fills the box — is +1. Most relationships you’re asked to find on the COOP aren’t as 
obvious. Here’s an example: 2 → ❑ → 6. The relationship between 2 and 6 could be +4, but 
it could also be ×3. That’s why you need another series to help you out. If the next series is 
7 → ❑ → 21, you know that the relationship in the box is ×3; if it’s 7 → ❑ → 11, you know the 
relationship is +4.
 
The COOP’s numerical relationship questions can be a little frustrating, so here’s a tip that 
should make solving them easier: If the first number in each series is smaller than the 
second, the operation is probably + or ×. If the first number in each series is larger than the 
second, the operation is probably – or ÷. Just remember that you’re not finished when you 
discover the numerical relationship. You still have to apply it to the last series to find the 
answer that fills in the blank.
Here’s what a complete COOP numerical relationship question looks like.
 
 
8 → ❑ → 4
 
4 → ❑ → 0
 
6 → ❑ → __
 
 
(A)4 (B)2 (C)3 (D)1
When you examine the first relationship, you see that you move from a larger number, 8, to 
a smaller number, 4. However, you don’t know whether the operation that gets you there is 
subtraction or division because you either subtract 4 from 8 or divide 2 into 8 to get 4. Look 
at the second relationship; it moves from 4 to 0. You subtract 4 from 4 to get 0, so the oper-
ation is –4. Apply the operation to the last series: 6 – 4 = 2, Choice (B). If you picked Choice 
(A), you were thinking of the operation rather than the missing value. If you went with 
Choice (C), you probably decided that the operation was ÷2 and failed to double-check by 
looking at the second relationship. Choice (D) is the result of a miscalculation.
Evaluating Shapes, Symbols, and Sets
The TACHS and COOP contain unique questions that test your ability to assess shapes and 
symbols. They’re all pretty easy to manage after you’re familiar with their format.
The TACHS calls the section that contains these types of questions the Ability section. One 
of the three question types in the Ability section gives you three figures; you must evaluate 
them and then choose a similar figure from among the answer options. Another question 
type in this section looks for the end result of an imaginary paper-folding exercise (pretty 
creative of those TACHS test designers, huh?). The third question type in the Ability section 
involves shape analogies. The approach to that question type is the same as for other anal-
ogy questions; we cover analogies in Chapter 4, so head there for tips.
The COOP brings shapes into the picture (so to speak) with yet another question type in its 
Quantitative Reasoning section. It shades parts of figures and expects you to determine 
what fraction of the shape is shaded.

160
Part III: Mastering Math and Conquering Quantitative Questions 
Last but not least, you may be called upon to work with sets. Sets are just groups of objects 
where the order doesn’t matter. These kinds of questions sometimes pop up on the exams’ 
Math sections, so we give you a little crash course here.
Making the connection among 
similar shapes, TACHS-style
If you’re taking the TACHS, you need to be able to recognize similarities among a series of 
three shapes. The test presents you with three shapes. Using your sharp powers of observa-
tion, you then choose an additional shape that belongs with the others. For some reason we 
can’t explain, the TACHS provides you with five answer choices rather than four, so you 
have more to choose from.
To answer similar-shapes questions correctly, you need to know what you’re looking for. 
Following are some common elements that make shapes similar. It’s not a complete list 
(those tricky test-makers can always come up with something new), but it’s a good way to 
begin your focus.
 
✓ Number of sides: The figures can be alike because they each have the same number 
of sides.
 
✓ Sharp corners and rounded edges: The shapes may all have sharp corners where the 
lines meet, or they may contain some rounded edges. Who knows? They may even con-
tain a similar combination of both.
 
✓ Direction: The shapes may point in the same direction. On the other hand, they may 
all be upside down or right side up.
 
✓ Shading: The shapes may share a common shading pattern or amount of shading.
 
After you’ve determined the element that the shapes have in common, look at the answer 
choices to find one that shares the same element. If you get stuck coming up with a similar-
ity, jump into the answer choices and eliminate shapes that are definitely different. Then 
choose from the remaining possibilities. Something in the answer choices may point you to 
the element that makes the group of shapes alike.
 The similar-shapes questions on the TACHS aren’t sequence questions. The figures don’t 
build along a pattern, so their order doesn’t matter. You’re not trying to find the next figure 
in a series; you’re just looking for one that fits in with all the others.
Try to find the similarities in the following sample question.
 
(A)
(B)
(C)
(D)
(E)
Count the sides of the three figures in the problem. Each figure has six sides, so the 
common element of the three shapes is that they all have six sides. Eliminate any answers 
that don’t have six sides, specifically Choices (B) and (D). Choice (C) looks promising, but it 
only has five sides. Choice (A) is an octagon, which means it has eight sides. The correct 
answer is Choice (E), the six-sided houselike shape.

Unveiling the approach to TACHS 
fold-and-punch questions
The TACHS’s fold-and-punch questions are some of the most unique questions we’ve ever 
seen (and we’ve seen a bunch of test questions in our lifetimes). This question type allows 
you to engage in a little mental paper folding and hole punching. Understanding the format 
of these babies takes a little getting used to. The question shows you a series of paper folds 
with arrows that point out in the direction the paper gets folded. The last figure in the series 
supplies the position where this folded paper receives a hole punch. Here’s the visual:
The answer choices give you a selection of unfolded pages, like this:
(A)
(B)
(C)

You must choose the figure that correctly reflects the position of the holes in the paper 
after it has been punched and unfolded.
 
The key to answering fold-and-punch questions correctly is to know how many holes will 
appear in the paper when it’s unfolded. The final number of holes depends on how many 
times the paper is folded.
 
✓ If the paper is folded once (two pictures in the question), the unfolded page will have 
twice the number of holes punched in the folded picture. So if the folded page is 
punched once, the unfolded page will have two holes.
 
✓ If the paper is folded twice (three pictures in the question), the unfolded page will have 
four times the number of holes punched in the folded picture. Therefore, a folded page 
with one punch will result in an unfolded page with four holes.
 
✓ A paper that’s folded three times (four pictures in the question) will have six times as 
many holes when it’s unfolded.
 
✓ We doubt you’ll see too many of these, but a paper folded four times (five pictures in 
the question) has eight times as many holes when it’s unfolded.
After you eliminate any answer choices that don’t have the proper number of holes for the 
number of folds, your next concern is placement. Where will the holes appear on the page 
when it’s unfolded? Check the position of the remaining choices and determine which is the 
most logical. Punches in the corners on the folded page will end up in the corners of the 
unfolded page. Punches closer to the fold will appear in the middle of the unfolded page.
 
If you’re having a hard time visualizing this problem, cut out some squares of paper and 
fold them and punch them as directed by the practice questions. Then unfold them to see 
what they look like.

Give this sample fold-and-punch problem a shot.
 
(A)
(B)
(C)
(D)
(E)
First things first: Observe how many times the paper is folded for a clue as to how many 
holes the unfolded paper will have. The paper in this question is folded once, which means 
the unfolded page will have twice as many holes as the folded page. The folded page has 
one hole, and 2 × 1 is 2. Eliminate answer choices that have any number of holes other than 
two (buh-bye Choices (A) and (B)!). Next, examine the positioning of the holes in the 
remaining answer choices. The original hole was punched in the bottom-right corner of the 
folded page, so the holes on the unfolded page will be in the corners. Cut Choice (D) 
because its holes are in the middle of the page. What about Choice (C)? It places the holes 
in the bottom corners, which would work if the page had been folded vertically. However, 
this page was folded down horizontally, so Choice (E) is the answer.
Finding shades of meaning in 
shaded figures on the COOP
Questions that ask you to determine the part of a figure that has been shaded appear in the 
Quantitative Reasoning section of the COOP. These questions should be pretty easy for you 
to answer. All you have to do is count the number of equal parts inside the figure, count 
how many parts are shaded, and create a fraction. The number of shaded parts is the 
numerator, and the total number of parts is the denominator. If you have a circle divided 
into four equal parts and two are shaded, the fraction is 2⁄4. When you reduce 2⁄4, you get 1⁄2. 
One half of the circle is shaded.
 
The answers to shaded-figure questions are usually presented in simplified form, so you 
have to reduce the fraction before you check the answers. For more about fractions and 
how to reduce them, flip to Chapter 10.
The only way these questions get tricky is when the shaded area cuts through one of the 
shaded portions of the shape, as you can see here.

163
 Chapter 15: Comprehending Comparisons and Other Quantitative Relationships
Just make sure you count the number of shaded and total parts correctly. The total number 
of equal parts in the circle is four. The shaded area cuts two of those parts in half, so the 
total shaded area is one part + 1⁄2 part + 1⁄2 part, which makes a total of two shaded parts out 
of four. Even though there appear to be three dividing lines, the total number of equal parts 
is not six. Here’s another shape for you to evaluate.
 
 
(A) 1⁄2
 
(B) 1⁄3
 
(C) 1⁄4
 
(D) 1
This shape has four equal parts, and only one of them is shaded. Make the number of 
shaded parts the numerator and the total number of parts the denominator to get 1⁄4. That’s 
all there is to it! Choice (C) is your answer. If you picked Choice (B), you made the shaded 
part the numerator but put the total number of unshaded parts in the denominator. Choice 
(D) takes into account only the shaded part and doesn’t consider the total number of parts. 
If you opted for Choice (A), you may have looked at only one half of the square.
Memorizing a little set terminology
None of the Catholic high school entrance exams has a separate section devoted to sets, 
but one or more of them may include questions that deal with sets in their math sections. 
For those few questions, it helps to know a little bit of set terminology.
A set is a collection of objects, numbers, or values that belong to the set and are called its 
members or elements. Here are some symbols related to sets that you should know:
 
✓  means “is a member of a set.”
 
✓  means “is not a member of a set.”
 
✓  indicates a set with nothing in it.
 
✓ , shows the union of two sets.
 
✓ + shows the intersection of two sets.
 
Union and intersection are ways of stating how two or more sets can be combined, with 
union being the most inclusive and intersection being the least inclusive. The union of 
two sets (A and B) is the set of all values that are members of either Set A or Set B or 
both. For example, the union of Sets A = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5} and B = {3, 4, 5, 6, 7} is the Set 
A , B = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7}.
The intersection of two sets (A and B, written as A + B) is the set of the values that appear in 
both sets but doesn’t include the values that are in one set but not the other. For example, 
the intersection of Sets A = {0, 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9} and B = {2, 4, 6, 8} is {2, 6, 8}.

164
Part III: Mastering Math and Conquering Quantitative Questions 
After you know all the symbols, set questions are pretty easy. Following is what one may 
look like on your entrance exam.
 
If A = {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5} and B = {2, 4, 6, 8, 10}, what is A + B?
 
(A) {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 10}
 
(B) {2, 4}
 
(C) 
 
(D) {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5}
The question is asking for the intersection of Sets A and B. Because the intersection of two 
sets includes only those members that show up in both sets, the correct answer is Choice 
(B). If you selected Choice (A), you misread the symbol and picked the answer that gave 
you the union of the two sets. Choice (D) ignores Set B altogether. If you went for Choice 
(C), you probably forgot what the intersection symbol means.

Mastering a Little Math
The following 18 questions test your knowledge of math concepts. Among other delightful 
topics, they include a little arithmetic, algebra, and geometry. In other words, they’re the 
kinds of questions you can expect to see in the math section of any Catholic high school 
entrance exam. Have fun!
 
1. What happens when you add an odd number to another odd number?
 
(A) Your answer is an odd number.
 
(B) Your answer is an even number.
 
(C) Your answer could be either odd or even depending on the value of the numbers being 
added together.
 
(D) Your answer is zero.
If you’ve memorized the rules about odds and evens presented in Chapter 10, you can just 
pick Choice (B) and move on. If you’ve forgotten them, use real numbers to figure out the answer. 
Pick two random odd numbers, say, 3 and 5. 3 + 5 = 8, and 8 is an even number. It looks like 
Choice (B) is the answer, but go ahead and try another set of odd numbers just to be sure. 
How about numbers in the name of a popular convenience store, 7 and 11? 7 + 11 = 18, an 
even number. Looks like you’re on a roll. Correct Answer: Choice (B)

Part III: Mastering Math and Conquering Quantitative Questions 
 
2. How many integers come between 22 and 11⁄2?
 
(A) 1
 
(B) 2
 
(C) 0
 
(D) 5
To ace this problem, determine the value of the first number: 22 = 2 × 2, which is 4. The 
second number equals 11 ÷ 2, which is 51⁄2. So you’re looking for the number of integers that 
come between 4 and 51⁄2. The set of integers doesn’t contain fractions, so 5 is the one and 
only integer between 4 and 51⁄2. Correct Answer: Choice (D)
 
3. If 3⁄4 = x⁄12, what does x equal?
 
(A) 9
 
(B) 3
 
(C) 12
 
(D) 10
Solving this problem is easy when you recognize that it’s a proportion. (And if you didn’t, 
we suggest you flip back to the proportion section in Chapter 10 for a quick refresher.) You 
can eliminate Choice (C) right away. If x were 12, the fraction would be 12⁄12, which is equal to 1. 
It doesn’t make sense that x⁄12 would equal 1. Cross multiply and solve for x: 4x = (3 × 12); 
4x = 36; x = 9. If you picked Choice (B), you probably figured out that you can multiply 3⁄4 by 
3⁄3 to find the value of x, but you didn’t perform the multiplication properly. Correct Answer: 
Choice (A)
 
4. 
 
(A) 
 
(B) 
 
(C) 
 
(D) 
Do you know how to subtract fractions? We hope so because that’s what this question is 
testing. If you picked Choice (A), you subtracted the numerators and the denominators to 
get 1⁄5, but you can’t subtract fractions that way. Instead, you must make the denominators 
the same and then subtract the numerators. Ask yourself what the lowest common denomi-
nator of 10 and 15 is. Both numbers go into 30; 10 goes in 3 times, and 15 goes in twice. 
Change the first fraction by multiplying it by 3⁄3: 3⁄10 × 3⁄3 = 9⁄30. Change the second fraction by 
multiplying it by 2⁄2: 4⁄15 × 2⁄2 = 8⁄30. Subtract 8 from 9 and keep the denominators the same to get 
1⁄30. Correct Answer: Choice (D)
 
5. Round 3,486,245 to the nearest million.
 
(A) 3,500,000
 
(B) 4,000,000
 
(C) 3,000,000
 
(D) 3,490,000
The millions place is the first digit of the number, so look at the number to the right of the 3 
to see whether you can round up. The digit to the right of the 3 is 4. Because 4 is less than 5, 
you don’t round up to 4, ruling out Choice (B). Keep the 3 and replace all the other digits 

167
 Chapter 16: Everything but the Kitchen Sink: A Hodgepodge of Math Practice Questions
with zeros. (If you selected Choices (A) or (B), you rounded properly but to the wrong 
place. Better luck next time.) Correct Answer: Choice (C)
 
6. What percent of 40 is 8?
 
(A) 0.2%
 
(B) 5%
 
(C) 20%
 
(D) 25%
Ah, the dreaded percentage problem. If you remember to translate it into the language of 
math, it really isn’t so bad. What is the unknown (x), percent means %, is means =, and of 
is the same as ×. Set up the equation and solve for x: x% × 40 = 8. Divide both sides by 40: 
x% = 8⁄40 (or 0.2). At this point, you’ve solved for x% not x, so don’t pick Choice (A). (It’s a 
trap!) Instead, multiply 0.2 by 100 to change it to a percentage: 8 is 20% of 40. If you picked 
Choice (B), you mistakenly divided 40 by 8; if you selected Choice (D), you probably tried 
to figure this one out by guessing. Correct Answer: Choice (C)
 
7. Evaluate 
.
 
(A) 
 
(B) 
 
(C) 
 
(D) 
To solve this problem, you have to know the order of operations (Polly Elf Makes Dolls And 
Shoes; see Chapter 10). Work with the stuff in the parentheses (P for Polly) first: 5 – 2 = 3; 
3 – 9 = –6; and 4 – 6 = –2. Now the fraction looks like this: 
. Next, solve the expo-
nents (E for Elf): 
. Then multiply (M for Makes) the stuff in the numerator and the
stuff in the denominator: 
. Add the numerator (A for And) to get 
. You may be 
tempted to pick Choice (A) at this point, but the answer isn’t negative, and 
 isn’t simplified. 
Go ahead and simplify the fraction by dividing the numerator and denominator by 8 to get 
. If you selected Choices (C) or (D), you performed the operations incorrectly or in the 
wrong order. Correct Answer: Choice (B)
 
8. Which of the following demonstrates the associative property of addition?
 
(A) (4 × 5) × 6 = 4 × (5 × 6)
 
(B) 4 + 5 + 6 = 6 + 4 + 5
 
(C) 4(5 + 6) = (4 + 5) + (4 + 6)
 
(D) (4 + 5) + 6 = 4 + (5 + 6)
Cross off Choice (A) first because it involves multiplication rather than addition. Also, 
Choice (C) is incorrect because it demonstrates the distributive property. Now remember 
the two common properties of addition: the associative property and the commutative 
property. The commutative property says that when you’re adding numbers, you can swap 
their positions and still get the same result. An example of this is Choice (B). The associa-
tive property says that when you’re adding three numbers, you can either add the first and 
second together and then add the third or you can add the second and third together and 
then add the first. An example of this is Choice (D). Correct Answer: Choice (D)

168

9. What is the square root of 196?
 
(A) 98
 
(B) 7
 
(C) 14
 
(D) 16
You’re looking for the number that equals 196 when you multiply it by itself. You know that’s 
not Choice (A) because 98 × 98 is a huge number, much bigger than 196. Choice (B) is obvi-
ously wrong because 7 × 7 is only 49. Calculate 14 × 14 on your scratch paper: 14 × 14 = 196. 
That’s it! Of course, you can also determine that 196 is the product of two perfect squares: 
4 and 49. The square root of 4 is 2, and the square root of 49 is 7. 2 × 7 is 14, so 14 is the 
square root of 196. Correct Answer: Choice (C)
 
10. What is the median of this set of numbers: 35, 42, 42, 50, 65, 65, and 65?
 
(A) 65
 
(B) 50
 
(C) 52
 
(D) 57.5
Remember that the median is the middle number of a set. This particular set is made up 
of seven numbers, which is an odd number. All you have to do is find the number that 
comes in the middle. 50 has three numbers to the left of it and three numbers to the right, 
so that’s the median of the set. If you selected Choice (A), you found the mode rather than 
the median. Choice (C) is the mean (average), not the median. Choice (D) is the average of 
50 and 65, but it’s not the median. Correct Answer: Choice (B)
 
11. If 4x + 3y = 31 and y = x +1, what does x equal?
 
(A) 5
 
(B) 3
 
(C) 10
 
(D) 4
Don’t be put off by the two different variables in this problem. Apply a little substitution, 
and this problem’s a piece of cake! You’re told that y = x + 1, so replace the y in the first 
equation with x + 1: 4x + 3(x + 1) = 31. Distribute the 3: 4x + 3x + 3 = 31. Add: 7x + 3 = 31. 
Solve for x by subtracting 3 from both sides and then dividing both sides by 7: 7x = 28; x = 4. 
Correct Answer: Choice (D)
 
If you really aren’t sure what to do, try substituting each answer for x in the equations and 
see which one works.
 
12. What kind of triangle has two angles that measure 70°?
 
(A) equilateral
 
(B) isosceles
 
(C) right
 
(D) even

169
 Chapter 16: Everything but the Kitchen Sink: A Hodgepodge of Math Practice Questions
There’s no such thing as an even triangle, so eliminate Choice (D). A triangle with two equal 
angles has two equal sides. The type of triangle that has two equal sides is an isosceles 
triangle, so the answer is Choice (B). The angles of an equilateral triangle measure 60°, 
so Choice (A) is wrong. The only way the triangle could be a right triangle is if the two 
equal angles measured 45°. This isn’t the case, so Choice (C) can’t be right. Correct Answer: 
Choice (B)
 
13. In the following figure, what is the measure of ∠a?
140˚
40˚
a
b
 
(A) 100°
 
(B) 40°
 
(C) 140°
 
(D) 60°
This problem isn’t as hard as it looks. Use what you know about triangles and lines to find 
the answer (or flip to Chapter 12 if you need some reminders). You know that Angle b 
measures 40° because it and the 140° angle are supplementary angles that add up to 180° 
(180 – 140 = 40). Because Angles a and b are two angles in a triangle with another angle that 
measures 40°, and because the sum of angles in a triangle is 180°, you can just subtract to 
find the measure of a: 180 – 40 – 40 = 100. Angle a is 100°, which is Choice (A). If you picked 
Choice (C), you forgot to subtract the third angle. Choice (B) is the measure of Angle b, and 
Choice (D) is completely unrelated. Correct Answer: Choice (A)
 
14. What is the area of a circle with a diameter of 4?
 
(A) 16π
 
(B) 2π
 
(C) 4π
 
(D) 8π
The formula for the area of a circle is πr2. Diameter is 2 times the radius, and the diameter of 
this circle is 4, so its radius is 2 (4 ÷ 2). 22 is 4, so the answer is 4π, Choice (C). If you opted 
for Choice (A), you squared the diameter of the circle rather than the radius. Choice (B) 
results from failing to square the radius, and if you got Choice (D), you incorrectly used a 
formula of 2πd. Correct Answer: Choice (C)

3
3
3
2
4
8
 
(A) 31
 
(B) 64
 
(C) 32
 
(D) 23
Find the perimeter of a polygon by adding up the values of the sides. This problem gives 
you the value of all the sides except for two: the entire left side of the figure and the small 
segment at the right side of the bottom. The left side of the figure is equal to the sum of the 
other vertical segments: 3 + 2 + 3 = 8. Mark 8 next to the left side. The small unknown seg-
ment is equal to the value of the top boundary minus the value of the sum of the rest of the 
horizontal segments: 8 – (3 + 4). 8 – 7 = 1, so write 1 next to the small unknown segment. 
Add up all the segments, and you get 32. If you picked Choice (A), you forgot about that 
little unknown segment. Choice (D) results from ignoring both unknown segments. If you 
selected Choice (B), you weren’t sure how to figure out perimeter in the first place (perhaps 
you should revisit Chapter 12). Correct Answer: Choice (C)
 
In perimeter problems, never guess the values of unknown segments by looking at them. 
Always use math to determine their values, or else you’ll fall for the trick answer the test 
preparers have inevitably included to trap you.
 
16. Emma went grocery shopping at the Colossal Supercenter. The store had a special on kum-
quats, 10 for $10, and a sale on artichokes, 2 for $5. Emma bought 6 kumquats and 5 arti-
chokes. How much did she spend?
 
(A) $18.50
 
(B) $85.00
 
(C) $15.25
 
(D) $56.00
Because kumquats are 10 for $10, they’re $1 each. Likewise, artichokes are 2 for $5, so they 
cost $2.50 a piece. Emma bought 6 kumquats at $1 each, so she spent $6 on kumquats. She 
also purchased 5 artichokes at $2.50 each, which is a total of $12.50. Add $12.50 to $6 to get 
a total purchase of $18.50. If you went with any of the other answers, you failed to correctly 
figure out the cost of each kumquat and artichoke. Correct Answer: Choice (A)

17. Dan ran the 5k Fun Run in 25 minutes. What was his average speed (in kilometers per hour)?
 
(A) 0.2 km/hr
 
(B) 2 km/hr
 
(C) 12 km/hr
 
(D) 5 km/hr
Apply Dan’s results to the distance formula (Distance = Rate × Time, as explained in 
Chapter 13) to find how fast he ran. The unknown is Dan’s speed (the rate at which he ran). 
The distance he ran is 5 kilometers, so substitute 5 for Distance in the formula. Dan’s time 
was 25 minutes, so replace Time with 25. Here’s your equation: 5 = r × 25.
To solve for r, divide both sides by 25: 5 ÷ 25 = r; 0.2 = r. This means that Dan’s rate was 
0.2 kilometers per minute. Don’t pick Choice (A), though; the question asks for the rate in 
hours, not minutes. You therefore have to convert the rate from minutes to hours. You 
know that Dan can run 0.2 kilometers in 1 minute, and 60 minutes equals 1 hour, so to find 
out how many kilometers Dan runs in 60 minutes, set up a proportion: 
. Cross multi-
ply: x = 0.2 × 60; x = 12. Dan runs an average of 12 km/hr.
If you immediately recognize that Dan’s speed is 5 kilometers in 25 minutes, or 5⁄25, you can 
quickly figure out the answer by setting up a proportion: 
. Cross multiply and solve: 
25x = 5(60); x = 12 km/hr. Correct Answer: Choice (C)
 
Always pay attention to what a question is asking. If you have to reread it two or three times 
to understand what you’re solving for, that’s okay.

Part III: Mastering Math and Conquering Quantitative Questions 
Sure, you can see just by looking at the graph that the biggest jump in price was from 2000 
to 2005, but we recommend you analyze the data just to be certain. The price in 1985 was 
about $35; it went up to $45 in 1990 (a $10 rise). It went up about $5 more to $50 in 1995. 
Five years later the price was $65, a $15 increase. But the biggest increase was from 2000 to 
2005 when the price went up $25 to $90. Correct Answer: Choice (D)
Sampling Some COOP Sequence Problems
The next six questions give you a little more exposure to the fairly unusual sequence ques-
tions found on the COOP. (Okay, so technically we threw in one practice question similar to 
the HSPT’s number sequence problems. It’s only because we have your best interests at 
heart.) See how well you do by checking the answers and reading through the explanations. 
If you find you need a little more help, check out Chapter 14.
 
1.
(A)
(B)
(C)
(D)
The sets contain four triangles in two types: One is resting on its small side, and one is 
standing on its tip. Each of the three initial sets of triangles has three of one kind and one of 
the other, so you can feel pretty good about eliminating Choice (D), which has two of each 
kind. Choice (A) has a triangle resting on its long side; it introduces a new position without 
any good reason, so you can probably eliminate it too. Now you’re left with Choices (B) and 
(C). Both duplicate one of the sets in the sequence, but the most logical choice to finish the 
sequence is Choice (C) because it provides an alternating pattern. Correct Answer: Choice (C)
 
2.
(A)
(B)
(C)
(D)
This sequence contains sets of two arrows, either shaded or unshaded. In every set, the arrows 
point in opposite directions. Choice (C) introduces a completely new shape, so you can elimi-
nate that answer. The arrows in Choices (B) and (D) point in the same direction as the one in the 
last set. Choosing either of these options would break the pattern. Correct Answer: Choice (A)

 Chapter 16: Everything but the Kitchen Sink: A Hodgepodge of Math Practice Questions
This number sequence question is the kind you can expect to see on the HSPT. Start tack-
ling it by analyzing the first two numbers in the sequence. To get from 7 to 13, you add 6. 
The next number is 19, which is 6 more than 13. Each of the following numbers is also 6 
more than the previous number, so the pattern is +6. Add 6 to the last number, 31, and you 
get the answer, 37, Choice (B). If you picked Choice (A), you probably got so excited about 
finding the pattern that you selected the amount you add by rather than the last number in 
the series. The other two choices result from addition errors. Correct Answer: Choice (B)
 
4. 2 4 16    4 8 64    5 10 100    _____ 12 144
 
(A) 6
 
(B) 10
 
(C) 7
 
(D) 8
This number sequence of the COOP variety has four sets of three numbers. Your task is to 
find the first number of the last set. Notice how the second number of the other three sets 
is twice the first number? The second number in the last set is 12, and 12 divided by 2 is 6. 
That’s all you need to know. Correct Answer: Choice (A)
 
5. X2Y1Z3    X4Y2Z5    _____    X8Y4Z9
 
(A) X3Y3Z5
 
(B) X6Y3Z7
 
(C) X3Y3Z5
 
(D) X6Y3Z8
The letters in each set of this sequence are the same, so concentrate on the numbers. The 
first and third numbers of each set are subscript, and the second is superscript. Eliminate 
Choice (C) because it doesn’t follow that pattern. The first numbers in each set increase by 
2 as you move from set to set. That means the first number of the third set should be 6, so 
Choice (A) is incorrect. Choice (D) fits the pattern with the X numbers (as well as the Y 
numbers, which increase by 1 from set to set) but not with the Z numbers, which also 
increase by 2. Correct Answer: Choice (B)
 
6. ABCD    BBEF    CBGH    _____
 
(A) DEFG
 
(B) DBJK
 
(C) DBIJ
 
(D) IJKL
Notice that the second letter in each set is B. Eliminate Choice (D) because it doesn’t 
have a B in the second position. All of the remaining choices begin with D, so concentrate 
on the pattern of the last two letters in each set. See how they move through the alphabet, 
CD EF GH? The next two letters should be IJ, which is the option provided in Choice (C). 
The other two choices don’t complete the pattern of the last two letters. Correct Answer: 
Choice (C)

Part III: Mastering Math and Conquering Quantitative Questions 
Quickening Your Quantitative Reasoning 
and Comparisons Skills
These six practice problems give you a sample of the question types that test your ability to 
use quantitative reasoning. Answers and explanations follow each question.
 
1. Based on the relationship between the numbers in the left column and the numbers in the 
right column, find the answer that completes the blank.
 
 
7 → ❑ → 12
 
3 → ❑ → 8
 
9 → ❑ → ___
 
(A) 14
 
(B) 5
 
(C) 7
 
(D) 13
To go from 7 to 12, you add 5; similarly, you get 8 when you add 5 to 3. The number that 
goes in the box is +5. Wait a minute! 5 isn’t the answer, so don’t pick Choice (B). You’re sup-
posed to find out what number fills in the blank. 9 + 5 is 14. Correct Answer: Choice (A)
 
2. Determine what portion of the shape is shaded.
 
(A) 3⁄4
 
(B) 2⁄3
 
(C) 1⁄3
 
(D) 1⁄4
The triangle contains four equal triangles. Because three of the four triangles are shaded, 3⁄4 
of the figure is shaded. If you chose any of the other answers, we’re betting you guessed. 
Don’t next time. Questions like this one are gimmies if you just take a minute to think ’em 
through. Correct Answer: Choice (A)

3. Given that the scale shows shapes that are equal in weight, choose an answer with shapes 
that are also equal in weight.
(A)
(B)
(C)
(D)
The scale shows you that two boxes equal one triangle. If two boxes equal one triangle, then 
neither three boxes nor one box can equal one triangle. Eliminate Choices (A) and (B). If 
one triangle is the same as two boxes, then two triangles are the same as four boxes. There 
aren’t enough boxes on the other side of the scale to offset the two triangles, so Choice (D) 
can’t be right. Correct Answer: Choice (C)
 
4. Study shapes (a), (b), and (c) to determine the correct answer.
(a)
(b)
(c)
 
(A) (a), (b), and (c) are shaded equally.
 
(B) (a) has more shaded area than (b) but less than (c).
 
(C) The shaded area of (a) plus (c) is less than the shaded area of (b) plus (c).
 
(D) (c) has more shaded area than either (a) or (b).
All of these equal circles are divided into eight parts. Circle (a) and Circle (b) have three 
shaded parts, and Circle (c) has four shaded parts. That means two things: The shaded 
parts of Circle (a) and Circle (b) are equal, and Circle (c) has more shaded area. Correct 
Answer: Choice (D)

176
Part III: Mastering Math and Conquering Quantitative Questions 
 
5. Study (a), (b), and (c) to determine which answer must be true.
 
 (a) 3(x + y)
 
 (b) 3xy
 
 (c) 3x + 3y
 
(A) (a), (b), and (c) have equal values.
 
(B) The value of (a) is equal to the value of (c).
 
(C) The value of (a) is equal to the value of (b).
 
(D) The value of (b) is equal to the value of (c).
Go ahead and apply the distributive property to (a). 3(x + y) can be written as 3x + 3y, so 
you can say that (a) and (c) are equal. You don’t know the value of x and y, so you can’t 
determine whether (b) is equal to either (a) or (c). This means that you can eliminate 
Choices (A), (C), and (D). Correct Answer: Choice (B)
 
6. The squares in the top row represent a piece of paper that has been folded and punched as 
shown. Select an answer that shows what the paper looks like when it is unfolded.
(A)
(B)
(C)
(D)
(E)
The page is only folded once. With one fold, you multiply the number of holes on the folded 
page by 2 to find out how many holes are on the unfolded page. The folded page has two 
holes, so the unfolded page has four. Choices (C), (D), and (E) have only two holes, so cross 
them out. The holes on the folded page are close to the fold line, so they have to end up in 
the middle of the unfolded page. Choice (B) shows the holes in the corners, so it can’t be 
right. Correct Answer: Choice (A)

Part IV
Practice Makes Perfect

In this part . . .
W
hat better way to get ready for your Catholic high 
school entrance exam than to practice answering 
questions in the test’s format? We certainly can’t think of 
one, which is why this part provides you with six com-
plete entrance exams — two for the HSPT, two for the 
TACHS, and two for the COOP. Before you sit down with 
your #2 pencil, though, make sure you have least two to 
three uninterrupted hours to devote (per test, that is) so 
you can get the full mind-numbing effect of plugging 
through a Catholic high school entrance exam.
The chapters immediately following each of the tests pro-
vide explanations of the answers for each of the questions. 
This is your chance to find out why the right answers are 
right and the wrong answers are wrong. We share a lot of 
valuable information in these explanations, so we suggest 
you read through all of them — even the ones for ques-
tions you answered correctly.

Chapter 17
HSPT Practice Test 1
T
he best way to get good at taking tests is by practicing taking them! So here’s a full-
length practice HSPT to help get you ready and raring to go on test day.
 We’ve done all we can to make this practice test as close to the real HSPT as possible, but 
you never know when the test-makers may get it in their heads to change up the test a bit. 
The HSPT you take may have a different number of questions or slightly different time 
limits, but overall it’ll be pretty much like the one in this chapter.
We strongly encourage you to make your practice test experience as much like the real 
thing as you can. Here’s how:
 
✓ Find a place where you won’t be distracted (step away from the video games!).
 
✓ Try to take this practice test at approximately the same time of day as your HSPT is 
scheduled (that means early in the morning, sorry).
 
✓ Tear out the answer sheet in this chapter and mark your answers on it by filling in the 
appropriate bubbles.
 
✓ Use the margins of the test pages to take notes and make computations (unless of 
course you’re dealing with a question that wants you to estimate the answer).
 
✓ Use a timer to time yourself on each section and stop answering questions when the 
timer goes off. At that point, you have to move on; there’s no going back to skipped 
questions.
 
✓ Give yourself a short (10- to 15-minute) break between the Reading and Mathematics 
sections, which is when you’ll probably get a break on exam day.
After you’ve completed the last section, head to Chapter 18 to check your answers and 
review the answer explanations.

Comprehension
 
Challenged by the recession, state and municipal leaders have considered somewhat 
novel methods to cut government spending in an effort to balance the annual budget. One 
of the cost-cutting ideas being bandied about involves shortening prison sentences and 
releasing nonviolent inmates to be cared for by neighborhood probation officers. Another 
cost-saving idea under debate involves teaching inmates vocational and career skills so that 
they are more likely to become gainfully employed once released, thereby reducing the rate 
of recidivism.
 
Given the financial and economic challenges currently confronting our federal, state, and 
local treasuries, many legislators are advocating for decriminalizing some current crimes 
and releasing those presently incarcerated for committing nonviolent “victimless” crimes. 
Crimes considered to be without victims commonly consist of drug possession, gambling, 
and prostitution. Studies conducted by the Federal Bureau of Prisons last year demon-
strated that the government spends an average of $256 million per state to catch, prose-
cute, and incarcerate perpetrators of victimless crimes. Legalizing some victimless crimes 
and releasing those currently serving time for those crimes would result in a significant sav-
ings for taxpayers.
 
The second legislative proposal to teach vocational skills to prisoners will lead to signifi-
cant annual tax savings along with a well-trained inmate population. Statistics demonstrate 
that an investment in vocational training saves money in the long run because inmates are 
less likely to commit crimes after they are released if they have been trained for a career. 
Contrary to those naysayers who believe that vocational programs represent a waste of tax-
payers’ money, vocational training would result in fewer criminals repeating their crimes, 
which means an overall savings in continually catching, prosecuting, and incarcerating past 
inmates.

(D) The secondary markets for repro-
cessed materials are at all-time highs.
 
It is commonly agreed that recycling is a critical step in both maintaining a clean and 
green environment and sustaining America’s quest for energy independence. The secondary 
markets for recycled paper, cardboard, aluminum, asphalt, copper, plastic, and glass are at 
all-time highs. Public education regarding the moral and ethical responsibilities to keep the 
environment clean has increased. There is now a large supply of and an increasingly strong 
demand for recycled goods. But we still have problems in one area: the ability to collect and 
sort recyclables.
 
Recycle bins have seemingly become depositories for virtually any type of trash, recycla-
ble or not, from a tattered mattress to last week’s TV dinner. The recycle bins that newspa-
per publishers, grocery stores, and big-box department stores have traditionally placed in 
their parking lots have become trash magnets that produce increasingly determined com-
plaints from patrons and neighbors. Neighbors frequently ask stores to remove their recy-
cle bins largely because they become unsightly. Part of the reason that the stores are so 
willing to remove the bins is because of the significant expense involved in having to sepa-
rate trash from newsprint and other recyclables, including aluminum, cardboard, plastic, 
and glass.
 
One solution to the problem has come from entrepreneurs who have begun charging for 
monthly pickups of recyclable materials, like paper, aluminum, plastic, and glass, from cus-
tomers’ curbsides. The monthly fee for this service usually pays for the costs associated with 
collection and separation of the materials. Additionally, these businesses sell the materials for 
a profit on the secondary recyclable market after they separate them. This practice is gener-
ally viewed as a “win-win” situation for the businesses and their contented customers, who 
have to pay only a small fee to contribute toward a cleaner, more energy-independent 
America.

 136. Which of these would be the best title for 
this passage?
 
(A) Vocational Education Should Receive 
More Funding
 
(B) Learning a Trade Is the Only Way to 
Get a Job
 
(C) A Liberal Arts Education Is Useless
 
(D) How to Earn Top Dollar in Today’s Job 
Market
 
It is becoming increasingly obvious that the preoccupation with a liberal arts curriculum 
in higher education is misplaced as the unemployment rate and student loan delinquency 
rate reach new highs. The days when college students were virtually guaranteed immediate 
placement upon graduation are rapidly disappearing as our workforce competes for gradu-
ates with vocational training skills.
 
Statistics from the U.S. Department of Labor tell us that the demand for graduates trained 
in trades, like plumbers, electricians, mechanics, and other technicians, has never been 
greater in the last century. Similarly, unemployment rates for vocational grads, who often 
attend private trade schools rather than public state universities, are also at an all-time low. 
Based upon these facts, it is time for our state legislature to allocate more funding for voca-
tional educational programs rather than schools that focus on a liberal arts curriculum.

many amendments?
 
(A) 30
 
(B) 10
 
(C) 9
 
(D) 14
 
The First Amendment to the United States Constitution provides that “Congress shall 
make no law respecting or prohibiting the free exercise thereof; or abridging the freedom of 
speech, or of the press, or the right of the people peaceably to assemble, and to petition the 
Government for a redress of grievances.” This amendment and nine others constitute the 
Bill of Rights, which is comprised of the first ten amendments to our Constitution. The Bill 
of Rights protects more than 30 liberties and rights. The Fourteenth Amendment made most 
of the Bill of Rights applicable to the states through a process called incorporation.
 
The origins of the Bill of Rights include the English Magna Carta of 1215, the English Bill 
of Rights of 1689, various other English precedents and acts, and the experience of people 
in England and America. Once our Bill of Rights was ratified by three-fourths of the fourteen 
states, virtually all opposition to the U.S. Constitution quickly disappeared.
 
The effect of the Bill of Rights is deeply embedded in our daily lives. For example, the Bill 
of Rights prohibits most attempts to censor certain types of art or music. It also protects 
speech, which means you can pretty much say whatever you want about a government offi-
cial in the editorial section of a newspaper or in a blog on the Internet. The Bill of Rights 
protects our often heated debates on abortion, school prayer, and the death penalty. And 
the speech you hear police officers give on TV shows when they tell someone who has been 
arrested that he has “the right to remain silent” is also a Bill of Rights issue. This practice is 
known as reading someone the Miranda rights. The First Amendment protection of the 
rights of extremist groups to peacefully assemble means that any group can stage a protest 
as long as it is not violent. By protecting the civil liberties of even extreme groups, the 
police and courts seek to preserve the right to freedom of expression for all Americans.

After a series of well-publicized failures by various inventors, Orville and Wilbur Wright suc-
ceeded in flying and controlling a heavier-than-air craft on December 17, 1903. The War 
Department, stung by its investment in a failed effort by Samuel Langley and troubled by the 
Wrights’ secretiveness, initially rejected the brothers’ requests for the government to buy the 
aircraft. Prevailing sentiments held that the immediate future still belonged to the balloon. In 
August 1908, the two brothers delivered the first Army aircraft to the U.S. government. That 
the U.S. government agreed to purchase an airplane was a minor miracle. For more than four 
years after the Wright brothers’ successful flight at Kitty Hawk, North Carolina, the government 
refused to accept the fact that man had flown in a heavier-than-air machine.

T
he following explanations are for HSPT Practice Test 1, which is in Chapter 17. Take 
your time reviewing them, making sure to read everything. We guarantee you’ll pick up 
valuable pointers for eliminating wrong answers and choosing the right ones if you do. 
Note: If you don’t have the time to read through each answer explanation, flip to the end of 
this chapter to check your answers using the short ’n’ sweet answer key.
Section 1: Verbal Skills
 
1. B. Conservative is the opposite of liberal. The answer that’s most opposite to pepper is 
salt, Choice (B). Seasoning and spice are more descriptive of pepper than opposites, and 
soda is unrelated.
 
2. A. The best answer is Choice (A), restaurant. All the other choices name places where 
people live. A restaurant is where they eat.
 
3. D. Choices (A), (B), and (C) are synonyms for giving in; Choice (D) isn’t.
 
4. A. If you know that a crypt is a burial chamber, you may be tempted to pick Choice (C). 
But a tomb isn’t called a crypt because it’s frightening; cryptic means “hidden, secret, or 
mysterious,” which is Choice (A).
 
5. A. Visualize this logic question by creating a line diagram that lists the cities in order of 
closest to farthest from the lake based on the information in the first two statements: 
Dillon → Sommerville → Derbyville. Dillon is the closest, which means the third statement 
is true, Choice (A).
 
6. D. Wretched, miserable, and glum are words that mean “sad.” Choice (D) is an antonym.
 
7. C. For this analogy question, tell yourself that a patient belongs in a hospital. A student 
could belong in a school or on a bus, so you need to make your sentence more specific. 
A hospital is a structure that houses patients, and a school is a structure that houses stu-
dents. A bus provides transportation for students, but it doesn’t house them; Choice (C) is 
your answer.
 
8. B. This synonym question may be a little tricky because you may think that genial sounds 
sort of like genius. But genial actually means “friendly.” Therefore, the best answer is 
Choice (B), amiable, which also means “friendly or agreeable.”
 
9. D. To be daft is to be goofy or silly. The best answer is Choice (D).
 
10. D. Advise, apprise, and instruct mean “to inform”; reprimand means “to scold,” which means 
it’s not like the other words. Pick Choice (D).
 
11. A. To incarcerate is the act of placing someone in jail. To deposit is the act of placing some-
thing in an account (not a store, apartment, or prison). Go with Choice (A).
 
12. A. Simple doesn’t belong with the other three choices, all of which mean to be determined 
or stubborn. Choice (A) is the best answer.

218
Part IV: Practice Makes Perfect 
 
13. B. Create a line diagram from youngest to oldest: Maggie → David → Stuart. Stuart is older 
than Maggie, which means the third statement is false, Choice (B).
 
14. C. Look for the word that means the same thing as actor. An actor isn’t a stage. Some 
actors can be directors, but an actor and a director don’t do the same things. Playing 
music and acting aren’t the same. The process of elimination shows you that the answer 
must be Choice (C); another word for actor is thespian.
 
15. B. Savory has to do with how something tastes; eliminate Choices (C) and (D). A savory 
taste is pleasant, so cross out Choice (A). Choice (B) is the best answer.
 
16. B. A field is a place where wildflowers grow just as a pond is a place where lily pads grow. 
You may be tempted to select Choice (C), frog, but the primary relationship involves 
plants, which makes the better answer Choice (B).
 
17. A. Something sinister is evil or threatening. The best synonym is Choice (A), menacing. 
Choice (B) may sound evil, but insipid just means “dull or bland.”
 
18. C. Tepid water is neither hot nor cold; it’s lukewarm, Choice (C). It can also describe a per-
son’s indifference. Choices (A) and (B) are antonyms, and Choice (D) is unrelated.
 
19. D. An hour is a whole made up of minutes. A year is a whole made up of days, Choice (D). 
If you picked Choice (A), you reversed the relationship. A year isn’t made up of a bunch of 
centuries; a century is made up of 100 years.
 
20. C. Choices (A), (B), and (D) are synonyms for extrovert. Choice (C) is the opposite.
 
21. B. Sensible, Choice (B), is the opposite of ludicrous, farcical, and absurd, all of which mean 
“silly or ridiculous.”
 
22. B. The line diagram from owning more trophies to fewer looks like this: Micky → Donald → 
Cal. Cal doesn’t have more trophies than Micky, so the third statement is false, Choice (B).
 
23. C. From longest to shortest, the roads are Colfax Avenue → Speer Street → Downing Drive. 
There’s no prior reference for Mitchell Road, which means the premises don’t give you the 
information you need to determine whether Downing Drive is longer than Mitchell Road. 
The statement is therefore uncertain, Choice (C).
 
24. B. A shrewd investment is a smart one, which makes Choice (B) the best answer. Choice (A) 
is opposite, and Choices (C) and (D) are unrelated.
 
25. A. Choices (B), (C), and (D) show extreme lack and devastation. You may need solace or 
comfort if you find yourself in one of these states, but Choice (A) is different.
 
26. B. Discipline is obedience or control; regulation is a synonym. The word that means the 
opposite of obedience or control is Choice (B), anarchy.
 
When an HSPT question asks you for the opposite word, remember that you’re looking for 
an antonym. Inevitably the synonym will be hiding among the answer choices; don’t pick it.
 
27. A. Draw a Venn diagram of the first two statements to solve this logic question.
Professors
Teachers
Tenure
 
 Because all professors are included with teachers, the professors are also tenured. 
Therefore, the statement is true, Choice (A).

219
 Chapter 18: Answers to HSPT Practice Test 1
 
28. A. The opposite of tension is peace or serenity, Choice (A). Choice (B), strain, is a 
 synonym, and the other options aren’t related.
 
29. C. An irrevocable agreement is one that can’t be broken, which means it’s binding, Choice (C).
 
30. B. Choice (B), meager, meaning “insignificant,” is the opposite of abundant, which means 
“plentiful.” Choice (A) also means plentiful, so it’s a synonym rather than an antonym.
 
31. A. Choices (B), (C), and (D) are words that mean enlarged. Choice (A) doesn’t belong 
because narrow conveys thinness rather than enlargement.
 
32. C. You must look for the opposite of the verb form of the word contract, which means to 
get smaller. Choice (C), enlarge, is the opposite of getting smaller.
 
If you can’t tell whether the question word is a noun or verb, try looking at the answer 
choices. If they’re all, say, verbs, then you know to use the definition of the verb form of 
the question word to solve the problem.
 
33. B. To shift is to move or change. Eliminate Choices (A) and (C) because they have the 
same meaning. Shift doesn’t mean build, so destroy isn’t its opposite. The best answer is 
Choice (B); maintain means “to stay the same or continue in the same way.”
 
34. D. Used as a verb, cloud means “to make unclear,” which means that to cloud is to bring 
about confusion. To illuminate is to bring about clarification, Choice (D).
 
35. D. The first three choices are words that mean to disagree. Choice (D) means to give in or 
agree, which means it doesn’t belong with the others.
 
36. C. The first two statements give you two possible diagrams: Green Mountain → Windy 
Peak → Smoky Hill or Windy Peak → Green Mountain → Smoky Hill. You don’t know 
whether Windy Peak is lower or higher than Green Mountain, which makes the third state-
ment uncertain, Choice (C).
 
37. D. Choices (A), (B), and (C) are ways to convey an excursion. Choice (D), a skirmish, is a 
minor battle, so it doesn’t belong with the other words.
 
38. B. The opposite of labor or work is rest, Choice (B). Choice (A) is a synonym, and the 
other options are unrelated to work.
 
39. A. A provisional government is one that has power until the permanent government is estab-
lished, which means it’s temporary, Choice (A). Provisional doesn’t have a political conno-
tation, so Choices (B), (C), and (D) can’t be right.
 
40. C. Blunt, dull, and rounded are words that describe something that’s not sharp. Choice (C) 
isn’t related to sharpness or dullness, so it doesn’t belong.
 
41. B. A seismograph is a tool to measure the strength of earthquakes, and a speedometer is a tool 
to measure the velocity of a vehicle, Choice (B).
 
42. C. To mow is to cut a lawn, and to shave is to cut a beard, Choice (C).
 
43. A. There are two ways to order the girls from the one who plays the most sports to the 
one who plays the least: Daphne → Trini → Angela → Brittany or Trini → Daphne → 
Angela → Brittany. In both cases, Trini plays more sports than Brittany, so the third state-
ment is true, Choice (A).
 
44. B. Porch, veranda, and terrace name outside sitting areas. A parlor, Choice (B), is inside, 
so it doesn’t belong.
 
45. D. To be hypocritical is to say you have feelings or qualities that you don’t really have, 
which makes the best synonym Choice (D), insincere. Although listening to a hypocritical 
person may be pretty annoying, hypocritical doesn’t mean the same thing as annoying.
 
46. A. Satiated means “full.” If you’re full, you’re satisfied, Choice (A). Choice (B) doesn’t fit, 
and Choices (C) and (D) have pretty much the same meaning.
 
You can’t have two right answers for one question, so anytime you see a pair of answer 
choices that have eerily similar definitions, you know neither can be right.

220
Part IV: Practice Makes Perfect 
 
47. D. A horse is housed in a stable, and an airplane is housed in a hangar, Choice (D). Sure, an 
airplane travels on a runway or in the sky, but housing one in either location is unsafe.
 
48. B. Choices (A) and (C) are synonyms for talkative, so cross them out. Choice (D) is unre-
lated to talkative. The word that’s most opposite is Choice (B), reserved, which means “shy.”
 
49. A. Choices (B), (C), and (D) are synonyms for self-ruling. Choice (A), subordinate, means 
“inferior,” so it’s unrelated to the other words.
 
50. A. The last three answers have similar meanings; all of them refer to strict attention to 
detail. Choice (A) is an antonym. Remiss means “careless or lax.”
 
51. C. Resist the temptation to pick Choice (B) here. To be engaged isn’t the same as being 
married. Engaged literally means “to be occupied or involved,” Choice (C). Choices (A) and 
(D) are more opposite in meaning than similar.
 
52. C. Emancipated means “liberated or freed.” The opposite of freed is restricted, Choice (C). 
Choices (A) and (B) are more similar in meaning to emancipated, and Choice (D) doesn’t 
show lack of freedom so much as lack of exposure.
 
53. B. The relationships in this logic question can’t be expressed in a straight line, so your 
 diagram will be crooked.
J

K
 
 There’s no way Marshdale can be north of Jamestown if it’s south of Hooterville. The third 
statement has to be false, Choice (B).
 
54. A. To be grounded is to be firmly fixed or established, Choice (A). Although being grounded 
means that you have your feet placed firmly on the ground, it doesn’t mean that your feet 
are dirty, Choice (B). The other choices are unrelated.
 
55. D. If something’s major, it’s important. The opposite is Choice (D), trivial. Stay away from 
Choices (A) and (B) because they’re synonyms of major.
 
56. B. Arrange the vehicles from smallest to largest like this: Economy Car → Full-Size Car → 
Luxury Car → SUV. The SUV is the largest vehicle, so saying it’s not as large as the full-size 
car is false, Choice (B).
 
57. D. An indigenous plant is one that’s native to the area where it’s growing. The best answer is 
Choice (D). Choice (A) is an antonym, and the other choices are unrelated.
 
58. D. Celebrity, star, and luminary are names for famous people. An upstart, Choice (D), is 
someone who’s unknown and therefore doesn’t fit in with the others, poor thing.
 
59. A. You top yummy ice cream with delicious caramel sauce, and you top a plump hot dog 
with thick ketchup. Buns may surround a hot dog, but they don’t top them in the way cara-
mel sauce tops ice cream. Choice (A) fits the best. (Feeling hungry yet?)
 
60. C. When you make a Venn diagram from the first two statements, you draw a circle for the 
ability to fly and a separate circle for mammals. You can put the circle for tibbles any-
where in relation to the ability to fly so long as it doesn’t intersect with the mammal circle. 
This figure shows the possibilities.

221
 Chapter 18: Answers to HSPT Practice Test 1

Ability to fly
Tibbles
Mammals
Tibbles
 
 The tibbles circle could go completely inside the fly circle, completely outside the fly 
circle, or partially inside and out. What does that tell you? That how many tibbles fly is 
uncertain, Choice (C).
Section 2: Quantitative Skills
 
61. C. The sequence progresses by +4, which means the next number is 45, Choice (C).
 
62. C. First figure out 20% of 100. 20% is the same as 0.2 and of means ×, so take 0.2 × 100 to get 
20. 5 less than 20 is the same as 20 − 5, which is 15, Choice (C).
 
63. B. 40 + 45 + 50 + 55 + 40 = 230; 230 ÷ 5 = 46. But don’t stop there and pick Choice (A)! 
Remember to subtract 10: 46 – 10 = 36, Choice (B).
 
The average is the sum of a set of numbers divided by the amount of numbers in the set.
 
64. D. Write down the shaded portion of each of the figures: (a) is 1⁄2 shaded, (b) is 3⁄4 shaded, 
and (c) is 1⁄4 shaded. Then eliminate answers. You know that (a) is less shaded than (b), so 
cross out Choice (A). Because (b) is more shaded than (a), you don’t have to read any fur-
ther to know that Choice (B) is wrong. (c) is less shaded than (a), which means so far so 
good for Choice (C). But (c) isn’t more shaded than (b), so you can eliminate it. Choice (D) 
is correct: 1⁄2 is < 3⁄4 and > 1⁄4.
 The HSPT questions that ask you to examine and evaluate aren’t usually difficult, but they 
do require you to undergo a lengthier problem-solving process because you must consider 
and compare several values. If you notice you’ve spent more than 30 seconds trying to 
solve this question (and others like it), next time mark your best guess and move on. You 
can always go back to the question if you have time at the end of the section.
 
65. B. The numbers in this sequence decrease by 6. 63 − 6 = 57, which is Choice (B).
 
66. A. Half of 32 is 16. When you add 16 to 16, you’re back at 32, Choice (A).
 
67. A. Count the circles in each picture (don’t guess!) and write down the totals: (a) has 8 cir-
cles, (b) has 10, and (c) has 15. So (a) < (b) < (c). Choice (A) is right; (a) has fewer circles 
than (b). Don’t waste your time checking the other options in this case because the 
answer’s so obvious.
 
68. A. The operation from 3 to 6 could be +3 or ×2. 6 × 2 = 12, so the operation is ×2. 24 × 2 = 48. 
The only answer that lists 48 as the next number is Choice (A).
 
69. D. The cube of 3 is 3 × 3 × 3, which equals 27. 27 ÷ 3 = 9, Choice (D).
 
70. D. 1⁄6 × 30 = 30⁄6, or 5, which is Choice (D).

222
Part IV: Practice Makes Perfect 
 
71. B. 63 – 56 = 7, which means the sequence probably increases by 7. What do you know? 
63 + 7 = 70, Choice (B).
 
72. D. (a) = $0.75, (b) = $0.75, and (c) = $0.75. Looks like (a) = (b) = (c), Choice (D).
 
73. C. (a) and (b) have the same value because 0.3 × 90 = 0.9 × 30. Both equal 27. Based on the 
information in (a) and (b), you can eliminate Choice (A) and pick Choice (C) as the correct 
answer. You don’t even have to figure out that the value of (c) is 0.3 × 0.9 = 0.27.
 
74. A. You may need to create an equation for this one. Let x stand for “what number.” Added 
means +, is means =, and of means ×. So the equation looks like this: x + 30 = 1⁄4 × 124. Solve 
for x: x + 30 = 124⁄4; x + 30 = 31; x = 1. Pick Choice (A).
 
75. C. Based on the first two numbers, the operation is either −500 or ÷2. 500 ÷ 2 = 250, 
which means the operation is ÷2. Look at the second and third numbers in the sequence. 
125 ÷ 2 = 62.5, Choice (C).
 
76. D. This sequence is a little trickier because you don’t have a third number to test the first 
operation with. 10 is either 5 more than 5 or twice 5. If the operation were +5, the third 
number would be 15, and the fourth would be 20. But the fourth number isn’t 20, which 
means the operation is ×2. The missing number is 20, Choice (D).
 
77. B. Change (b) to 1⁄2. 1⁄2 < 7⁄9, which means (a) > (b). You can eliminate Choice (A). Without com-
puting the value of (c), you can guess that 4.2 × 0.65 is > 1. So you know that (c) > (a) > (b). 
This is the answer in Choice (B).
 
78. A. Set up the equation: x ÷ 4 = 1⁄8 × 72; x ÷ 4 = 72⁄8; x ÷ 4 = 9; x = 36, which is Choice (A).
 
79. C. Because the triangle is isosceles, which means AB = BC, cross out Choice (A). AB = 6 
and AC = 2, so AB isn’t twice as long as AC; Choice (B) is wrong. Consider Choice (C). 
Because AB = BC, it makes sense that AB + AC = BC + AC (6 + 2 = 6 + 2). The answer is 
likely Choice (C), but you should check Choice (D) just to be sure: AB – BC = 0, and AC = 2, 
which means AC isn’t 1 m shorter than AB – BC.
 
80. D. The numbers decrease by 4. The next number is 271 – 4 = 267, Choice (D).
 
81. B. The equation is 1⁄3 × x = 5 × 8. Solve for x: 1⁄3 × x = 40; x = 40 × 3⁄1; x = 120. Pick Choice (B).
 
82. A. Each of the three figures has 6 boxes, which means you just have to compare the value 
of the shaded boxes. (a) has 2 shaded boxes, (b) has 1.5 shaded boxes, and (c) has 2.5 
shaded boxes. So (c) > (a) > (b), Choice (A).
 
83. A. This sequence features more than one operation. The first operation is +5 followed by −4. 
5 + 5 → 10 – 4 → 6 + 5 → 11 – 4 → 7. The missing number is 7, Choice (A).
 
84. C. Create an equation and solve for x: 50 – x = 3(36 ÷ 9); 50 – x = 3(4); 50 – x = 12; −x = −38; 
x = 38. Choice (C) is the answer.
 
85. B. The equation is 1⁄4 × x = 10 × 4. Solve: 1⁄4 × x = 40; x = 40 × 4/1; x = 160. Pick Choice (B).
 
86. D. Find the value of the three products. The value of (a) is 3, the value of (b) is 9, and the 
value of (c) is 5, which means (b) > (c) > (a). Eliminate Choices (A) and (C). Choice (D) is 
right, so you don’t have to figure out Choice (B).
 
87. D. This sequence alternates between ×2 and +8: 3 × 2 → 6 + 8 → 14 × 2 → 28 + 8 → 36 × 2 → 
72. The missing number is 36, Choice (D).
 
88. B. This sequence alternates between regular numbers and Roman numerals, which means 
the missing number isn’t a Roman numeral. Eliminate Choices (A), (C), and (D). The answer 
is Choice (B), and the operation is +5.
 
89. B. The value of (a) is 8 × 8, or 64, and the value of (b) is 16 × 16 (or 162). Without calculat-
ing the value of (b), you know that (b) > (a) and can eliminate Choices (A) and (C). That 
leaves you with Choices (B) and (D). Choice (B) states that (b) = (c). Is that true? 28 is the 
same as 2 × 2 × 2 × 2 × 2 × 2 × 2 × 2. 2 × 2 × 2 × 2 = 16, which means 28 is the same as 16 × 16. 
Therefore, (b) = (c) — Choice (B).

 Chapter 18: Answers to HSPT Practice Test 1
 
90. D. Here’s the equation: 0.40x + 0.80x = 144. Solve for x: 1.2x = 144; x = 120, Choice (D).
 
91. B. The operations for this sequence are either +4 then −1 or × 2 then −1. If you apply the 
first set of operations, the missing number would be 11 (7 + 4 = 11). But 11 – 1 doesn’t 
equal 13, which means the second set of operations must be correct. 7 × 2 = 14; 14 – 1 = 13. 
14, Choice (B), is the missing number.
 
92. C. The triangle is a right triangle because it contains a 90° angle. The line opposite the 
right angle is called the hypotenuse and is the longest of the three sides. All of that tells 
you Choice (A) is incorrect and Choice (C) is right. Based on the Pythagorean theorem, 
you know AB2 + AC2 = BC2, which isn’t the same as AB + AC = BC; Choice (B) can’t be right. 
Choice (D) isn’t right because the sum of the other two angles is equal to the right angle: 
180° – 90° = 90°.
 
93. D. The equation is: x = 43 – 7. x = 64 – 7, and x = 57. Pick Choice (D).
 
94. C. Say the pattern to yourself: −4 then −2 then 0 then +2 then +4. The pattern appears to 
decrease by even numbers and then increase by even numbers. The even number after 4 is 
6. Add 6 to 47, and you get 53. Choice (C) begins with 53, and its second number is 53 + 8 
(61). The only answer that follows the pattern is Choice (C).
 
95. A. The value of (a) is 28 + 2, or 30; (b) is 35 – 7, or 28, and (c) is 27 + 1, or 28. So (a) > (b) = 
(c). The best answer is Choice (A).
 
96. A. You know that 10 less than 7⁄8 of 112 isn’t 16 or 56 because those numbers are half of 112 
or less, and 7⁄8 is much more than half. Eliminate Choices (C) and (D). Figure out 112⁄1 × 7⁄8. You 
can factor out 8 from 112 on top and 8 on the bottom to create this problem: 14⁄1 × 7⁄1. 14 × 7 
= 98. When you subtract 10 as instructed, you get 88, Choice (A).
 
97. D. The letters progress alphabetically, so the next letter must be D. Cross out Choices (A) 
and (B). The even numbers are subscript, which means the answer is Choice (D).
 
98. C. Look through the answers to see which ones are the easiest to evaluate. You know that 
the figure is a square because its sides are equal in length. The area of a square is s2, and 
the side length is 6. That means the area of this square is 36 in2, Choice (C). Go ahead and 
check the other answers to be certain. The diagonals of a square form right angles, which 
means the four triangles formed by the diagonals are equal right triangles. Choice (A) is 
therefore wrong. CA is the hypotenuse of the right triangle, which makes it longer than the 
other sides; cross out Choice (B). ∠BAD and ∠BFC are right angles and equal, which 
means Choice (D) isn’t right.
 
99. A. First things first: Solve (a), (b), and (c). (a) is 27 × 10, or 270; (b) is 2⁄5 × 150⁄1, or 300⁄5, or 60; 
(c) is 1⁄2 of 144, or 72. You now know that (a) > (c) > (b), which means you can eliminate 
Choices (B), (C), and (D). Choice (A) is the answer because it’s true that 270 > 60 + 72 (or 
132).
 
100. C. The sequence has a set of three consecutive numbers then +15 followed by a sequence 
of three consecutive numbers and +17. The next two numbers should be 138 and 139 to 
complete the pattern of three consecutive numbers, so cut Choices (B) and (D). Choice (A) 
can’t be right because it has a fourth consecutive number. Choice (C) is the best answer.
 
101. A. Say the pattern to yourself as you read through the sequence: +15 then −14 then +18 
then −14 and so on. Hmm. That doesn’t make sense, does it? The first operation could be 
×4: 5 × 4 = 20, 6 × 4 = 24. That means the missing number is 40 because 10 × 4 = 40. Tada! 
That’s the option in Choice (A).
 
102. B. Your equation looks like this: 5 + 76 = x2. 5 + 76 = 81. 81 is 92. x = 9, Choice (B).
 
103. A. Create the equation and solve: 7x = 4 + 80; 7x = 84; x = 12. Pick Choice (A).
 
104. C. You know that the value of (b) is greater than (a) because a number squared is greater 
than that same number times 2 (unless of course that number is 2, which isn’t the case 
here). (c) has to be less than (a) because the value of twice the total of 45 and 25 is greater 
than 45 plus twice the value of 25. So, (b) > (a) > (c), and Choices (A) and (B) are wrong. 

224
Part IV: Practice Makes Perfect 
45 + 25 = 70, which means the value of (b) is 70 × 70, or 4,900. The value of (a) is 140, and 
the value of (c) is 95. 4,900 is much greater than 140 and 95, so the answer has to be 
Choice (C).
 
105. D. The sequence of letters is every other letter in the alphabet, and the numbers are all 
odd. Eliminate Choices (A) and (C) because they have even numbers. Skip O and you find 
that the next letter in the sequence is P. The answer is Choice (D).
 
106. B. The graph tells you that the value of D is probably 5, C is 20, B is 30, and A is 10. 
Choice (A) is wrong because 5 + 10 ≠ 20. Cross out Choice (C) because 10 + 20 isn’t 
greater than 30. And 10 + 30 isn’t 2(5 + 20), which means Choice (D) is wrong. 30 – 20 = 10; 
Choice (B) is the correct answer.
 
107. C. At first the numbers seem to be consecutive, but the pattern isn’t strictly consecutive. 
You may need to try plugging in the answer choices to see the pattern. The only number 
that repeats is 25, so you can cross out Choice (D). In fact, 25 seems to repeat every two 
numbers. The last number in the sequence is 25. To follow the pattern of introducing 25 
every two numbers, the correct answer must end in 25. That leaves you with Choices (B) 
and (C). Choice (B) begins with 28, 29, and Choice (C) starts with 29, 30. Choice (C) makes 
the most sense because it maintains the pattern of adding 2 to the number before 25 to get 
the number that comes after 25.
 
108. D. The next perfect cube that comes after 70 is 125. 125 – 70 = 55, which is the option in 
Choice (D). 55 + 70 = a perfect cube (125).
 
109. C. Solve this equation: x − 0.2x = 72; 0.8x = 72; x = 90. Choice (C) is the answer.
 
110. C. (a) is 27, (b) is 16, and (c) is 16. Therefore, (a) > (b) = (c). Cross out Choices (B) and (D). 
16 ≠ 2 × 16, which means Choice (A) is wrong, and Choice (C) is right.
 
111. D. The angles along a straight line equal 180°, and ∠A measures 90°. You don’t know the 
individual measurements of the other two angles, but you do know that added together 
they equal 90°. That means the answer is Choice (D).
 
112. C. The equation for this question is x = (3⁄5 × 15) – 3. Solve for x: x = 9 – 3; x = 6. Pick 
Choice (C).
Section 3: Reading
 
113. C. The author concludes the second paragraph by saying that legalizing some victimless 
crimes would save money. Consequently, you know that Choice (A) isn’t right and that 
Choice (C) is probably the right answer. The author doesn’t say anything about the ease of 
prosecuting crimes, which makes Choice (B) unlikely. The passage isn’t about society’s 
role in determining criminal behavior, so toss out Choice (D).
 
114. C. The last paragraph covers vocational training for inmates. Choice (A) is wrong because 
creating new jails isn’t related to vocational training. The passage doesn’t discuss white-
collar crimes, so eliminate Choice (B). Decriminalizing victimless crimes is a separate issue 
from vocational training, which makes Choice (D) incorrect. If inmates don’t get jobs, voca-
tional training isn’t valuable; Choice (C) is therefore the best answer.
 
115. A. Substitute the answer choices into the passage: Many legislators are advocating for 
legalizing, declaring unconstitutional, outlawing, or prosecuting some current crimes. The 
one that keeps the meaning is Choice (A), legalizing.
 
116. A. The middle paragraph says that the government spends $256 million on victimless 
crimes, which means $256 million is what could be saved, Choice (A).
 
117. B. Gainful employment would most likely reduce the rate of repeated criminal behavior 
(which is the definition of recidivism), Choice (B). The other options don’t make sense.

225
 Chapter 18: Answers to HSPT Practice Test 1
 
118. A. This passage expresses an opinion about a current topic. It’d fit best in the editorial 
 section of a newspaper, Choice (A). Clearly, it’s not about biology or sports.
 
119. C. Vocational is used throughout the passage to describe the type of training proposed for 
inmates. The last paragraph says that vocational training prepares inmates for a career, 
which makes Choice (C), job, the best answer.
 
120. D The only answer not covered in the passage is Choice (D). The author doesn’t propose a 
novel-writing program.
 
121. D. Eliminate Choices (A), (B), and (C) because they concern victimless crimes rather than 
vocational training. Choice (D) is best; if training doesn’t decrease recidivism, it’s not a 
worthwhile investment for taxpayers.
 
122. B. The passage doesn’t mention confession or specify the kinds of positions inmates would 
be trained for; eliminate Choice (A). It doesn’t compare the cost of imprisoning victimless 
criminals with other criminals, so Choice (C) is wrong. The passage does say that jobs may 
prevent repeat crimes, but that doesn’t mean the repeat criminals will never get jobs. You 
don’t have to assume too much to select Choice (B), which just so happens to be correct.
 
123. C. Determined appears in the second paragraph to describe the kinds of complaints neigh-
bors make about recycle bins. The next sentence says that the neighbors’ complaints are 
frequent. The word that fits best is Choice (C), resolute. The neighbors are unwavering in 
their complaining.
 
124. C. The last paragraph discusses successful recycling collection efforts on the behalf of 
Choice (C), entrepreneurs. The passage doesn’t mention Choices (A) or (B), and it implies 
that the efforts of grocery stores are in fact unsuccessful.
 
125. D. Contented is used in the last paragraph to describe the customers of successful recy-
cling efforts. These customers are satisfied, Choice (D).
 
126. C. The second paragraph says that the neighbors complain that the bins are unsightly, 
which means the bins are ugly, Choice (C).
 
127. B. To answer this question correctly, you need to know that a lament is a deep regret. 
Eliminate Choices (A), (C), and (D) because the author wouldn’t deeply regret these posi-
tive statements. That bins have become trash cans, Choice (B), is regrettable.
 
128. D. The second paragraph includes tattered mattresses and TV dinners in its description of 
the kinds of trash that end up in recycle bins. Because at least two of the answers are 
right, Choice (D) must be the answer. Newspapers also end up in recycle bins.
 
129. A. The author is positive about the entrepreneurs described in the last paragraph. The 
only positive answer option is Choice (A), grateful.
 
130. B. Eliminate untrue answers. The first sentence suggests that people care about the envi-
ronment, which makes Choice (A) untrue. The point of the second paragraph is that recy-
cle bins are ineffective; cross out Choice (C). There’s a monthly fee for recycle pickup, so 
Choice (D) is wrong. Given the first sentence, Choice (B) is the best answer.
 
131. A. The entrepreneurs pick up recycling; they don’t provide drop-off bins. Choice (A) isn’t 
one of their business practices and is, therefore, the correct answer.
 
132. D. Bedding, Choice (D), isn’t included in the list of recyclable materials at the end of the 
second paragraph.
 
133. B. The first sentence of the last paragraph lists examples of trades. The answer that isn’t 
included in this list is Choice (B), psychologist.
 
134. D. The last paragraph states that vocational grads often attend private trade schools, 
which makes Choice (D) the best answer.

226
Part IV: Practice Makes Perfect 
 
135. B. Eliminate Choice (C) because it contains the debatable word all. Nothing in the passage 
justifies the statement that every single plumber, electrician, and mechanic has a trade 
school degree. Likewise, Choice (D) assumes too much by completely doing away with lib-
eral arts programs. Choice (A) is wrong because there’s no rule about who can work as a 
technician. Because unemployment rates for trade positions are low, demand for trade 
positions must be high, Choice (B).
 
Debatable words (such as all, none, and so on) are often clues that the answer option in 
question is incorrect.
 
136. A. The conclusion in the last sentence is that vocational education should receive more 
funding. This is the author’s main point, so the best title is Choice (A). Choices (B) and (C) 
contain debatable language such as only and useless. Choice (D) is too broad for the topic.
 
137. A. Look at the second paragraph for the origins of the Bill of Rights. The only answer that’s 
not included in the list is Choice (A), the U.S. Constitution.
 
138. D. The first paragraph tells you that the Fourteenth Amendment, Choice (D), is what 
applied the Bill of Rights to the states.
 
139. C. Incorporation, Choice (C), is defined in the first paragraph as the name of the process 
that applied the Bill of Rights to the states.
 
140. D. You discover in the second paragraph that 75 percent of the 14 states ratified the Bill of 
Rights. Seventy-five percent of 14 is about 11 states, Choice (D). Yes, you may encounter 
math in reading questions. Oh well.
 
141. A. The last paragraph lists all the rights in the answers except the one in Choice (A). A group 
can stage a protest as long as it’s not violent.
 
142. B. In the first paragraph, you discover that the Bill of Rights consists of the first ten amend-
ments to the Constitution, Choice (B). Choice (A) refers to the 30 liberties and rights it pro-
tects, and 14, Choice (D), is the number of states in existence when the Bill of Rights was 
ratified.
 
143. B. Embedded appears in the first sentence of the paragraph that describes how big a part 
the Bill of Rights plays in daily life. Because the Bill of Rights is deeply rooted in everyday 
life, Choice (B) is your answer.
 
144. D. The purpose of the passage is to instruct about the Bill of Rights, which is a part of the 
U.S. Constitution; Choice (D) sounds best. The passage isn’t impassioned or opinionated, 
so Choices (A) and (B) can’t be right. Nor is the passage about science, which means 
Choice (C) is incorrect.
 
145. C. Choice (A) isn’t true because other inventors had tried and failed. Cut Choice (B) because 
the Wrights flew the aircraft in 1903, but the government didn’t purchase it until 1908. The 
Wrights successfully flew and controlled the aircraft in 1903, so forget Choice (D). Choice (C) 
is right; the last sentence implies that the government had been considering the Wright 
brothers’ proposals for more than four years.
 
146. C. The passage says that the first aircraft was an Army aircraft purchased by the War 
Department. The best answer is that the airplane was used by the military, Choice (C).
 
147. A. The passage uses prevailing to describe the current sentiments about the future of the 
balloon. The word that fits best is Choice (A), existing: Existing (not triumphant, crushing, or 
minority) sentiments held that the immediate future still belonged to the balloon.
 
148. D. The statement that’s not true is Choice (D). The government bought the first airplane in 
1908, which is less than six years after the first flight succeeded in 1903. If the future still 
belonged to the balloon, it must have already existed. Choice (B) is a paraphrase of the 
second sentence, and North Carolina is on the East Coast.
 
149. D. Choices (A), (B), and (C) are way too general for the one-paragraph topic. The para-
graph is about the Wrights’ aircraft, and its purchase is described as a “minor miracle.”

227
 Chapter 18: Answers to HSPT Practice Test 1
 
150. C. The paragraph recounts a bit of American history, which makes a historian, Choice (C), 
the most logical author. Pilots probably discuss flying planes, and an Army officer may talk 
about war strategies. Nothing in the paragraph relates to senators.
 
151. B. The paragraph follows its mention of the “minor miracle” with an explanation that the 
government had refused to accept that man could fly in a heavier-than-air craft. Choice (B) 
paraphrases this explanation. The paragraph states that most people thought the future 
was in balloon travel, but it doesn’t say that this was because of cost or effectiveness. The 
government wasn’t interested in Langley’s failed invention, but it must have needed an air-
plane, or else it wouldn’t have invested in Langley at all.
 
152. D. Because the government waited so long to purchase the airplane and didn’t believe a 
heavier-than-air craft could fly, its attitude must have been skeptical, Choice (D). It cer-
tainly wasn’t confident or ecstatic. And Choice (B), agitated, is too strong an emotion.
 
153. B. You’d think the vocabulary questions in the Verbal Skills section would be enough for the 
HSPT people, but apparently they’re not because the Reading section has about 20 more. 
A paltry sum is a small one. The best synonym is Choice (B), insignificant.
 
154. B. If something smells foul, it smells really gross. Another word that means “really gross” is 
repulsive, Choice (B).
 
155. A. Something tedious is boring, which means a state of tedium is a state of boredom, 
Choice (A).
 
156. A. Zealous fans are over the top, which means you can eliminate Choices (B) and (D). And 
Choice (C), continual, doesn’t begin to express the enthusiasm a zealous fan feels. The 
best answer is Choice (A), ardent.
 
157. C. A debilitating disease is one that causes great suffering and weakness. It’s devastating, 
Choice (C). Debilitating doesn’t suggest length of time, which rules out Choices (A), (B), 
and (D).
 
158. B. To mind your manners is to pay attention or put your mind to them, Choice (B). It 
doesn’t mean to ignore, object to, or worry about manners.
 
159. D. You usually hear a eulogy at a funeral where loved ones pay tribute, Choice (D), to the 
deceased.
 
160. D. Don’t be tempted by Choice (B). To propose isn’t to marry; it’s to suggest getting mar-
ried. To propose is to suggest, Choice (D).
 
161. A. A commemorative plaque is one that dedicates the memory of a person or event, which 
means the best synonym is Choice (A), dedicatory. Commemorative has nothing to do 
with how old the plaque is or what it’s made of.
 
162. C. Delightful is a positive word; eliminate words with negative connotations, such as objec-
tionable and dull. Choice (C) is an agreeable answer choice and the best synonym for 
delightful.
 
163. B. To abhor something is to hate it, and abhorrent means “hateful.” A synonym for hateful is 
Choice (B), but if you’re not familiar with the meaning of odious, you can at least eliminate 
positive choices such as likeable and pleasant.
 
164. A. A realm is the jurisdiction that those in power rule over. Its synonym is kingdom, 
Choice (A).
 
165. B. A literal interpretation is one based on the facts, Choice (B). Its opposites are symbolic 
or fictitious.
 
166. B. A person with a congenial disposition is outgoing and friendly. Sociable, Choice (B), is a 
good synonym, and it’s the only positive answer choice of the four.
 
167. C. You may not know what vilify means, but because it’s paired with enemy, it’s probably 
not a positive verb. Cross out positive answer choices, such as compliment and justify. 
The answer is Choice (C). To vilify is to criticize or disparage.

228
Part IV: Practice Makes Perfect 
 
168. C. Eliminate positive answer choices such as ally and companion because heckler is paired 
with discourteous. If you’ve seen standup comedy, you know that a heckler is an audience 
member who distracts the comedian. The answer is Choice (C), detractor.
 
169. A. Cantankerous sounds awful, and it means “crabby or grumpy,” Choice (A).
 
170. A. Cosmo refers to world, and a cosmopolitan has experienced it all. The best synonym is 
Choice (A); a sophisticate is someone with experienced taste. Choice (D), plebeian means 
“commoner” and is an antonym.
 
171. D. To discombobulate is to confuse. The word even looks confusing! A synonym for confuse 
is Choice (D), confound.
 
172. D. An obvious truth is one that’s known, which means you can eliminate Choices (A) and 
(B) because they’re opposites. Flimsy means “weak,” which isn’t the same as known. By 
process of elimination, pick Choice (D). Axiomatic means “clear and obvious.”
 
173. B. If an interloper is unwanted, he’s probably not a citizen or an affiliate. A hermit likes 
to hide from people, so she wouldn’t be around enough to make herself unwanted. The 
answer is Choice (B); an intruder and an interloper are both gatecrashers.
 
174. C. To conjure a memory is to call it up. Suppress and destroy are more opposite in meaning 
than similar. The most similar word is summon, Choice (C).
Section 4: Mathematics
 
175. B. The tenths place is the number to the right after the decimal point, which is 6 in this 
case. Round 6 to 7 because the number to the right of 6 is greater than 5. The answer is 
Choice (B), 54.7. Choice (D) improperly rounds the tenths place, and the other choices 
write the number to the incorrect place.
 
176. C. The only answer that describes a type of angle is Choice (C). An obtuse angle is one 
that’s greater than 90°. The other choices describe a type of theorem, a kind of quadrilat-
eral, and types of lines.
 
177. A. The order of operations tells you to solve the exponents first: −5 × −5 = 25. Then multi-
ply: 2 × 25 = 50, which is Choice (A).
 
178. D. The intersection sign means you look for the set of numbers that appears in both sets. 
Both sets contain 4 and 7, which is the answer in Choice (D).
 
179. B. Consecutive numbers are numbers that follow in sequence. The answer with two consec-
utive numbers is Choice (B) because 3 comes right after 2 on the number line. The num-
bers in Choice (D) are called reciprocals because one is the inverse of the other.
 
180. A. 0.23 is 23 hundredths, which means the number expressed as a fraction is 23⁄100, Choice (A).
 
181. D. Move the decimal point to the right one place for every zero. 100 has two zeros, so you 
move the decimal point to the right two places, Choice (D).
 
182. A. The radius of a circle is 1⁄2 the diameter. 6 × 1⁄2 = 3, which is Choice (A).
 
183. C. 35⁄3 written as a mixed fraction is 112⁄3. The integers between 112⁄3 and 17.4 are 12, 13, 14, 
15, 16, and 17. That’s a total of 6 numbers; the answer is Choice (C).
 
Integers don’t include decimals or fractions. Flip to Chapter 10 for a refresher on the 
 various types of numbers.
 
184. D. 95 falls between the perfect squares of 81 and 100, but don’t stop there and pick 
Choice (B). The question asks for the square root. 81 is 92, and 100 is 102. The square 
root of 95 is somewhere in between 9 and 10, Choice (D).

229

185. C. Cent means 100. A meter consists of 100 centimeters, Choice (C).
 
186. A. This question tests what you know about performing operations with negatives and 
positives. You probably know that Choices (B) and (C) are true, which means you can 
eliminate them. Choice (A), however, isn’t true. When the absolute value of the positive 
number is greater than the absolute value of the negative number, the sum is positive. For 
example, 4 + (−2) = 2, a positive number.
 
187. B. Create an equation and solve for x. Because the ratios of the two numbers is 4 to 1, you 
can express the two numbers as 1x and 4x. The equation is 1x + 4x = 60; 5x = 60; x = 12. The 
smaller number is 12, and the larger number is 4(12), or 48, Choice (B).
 
188. D. The fraction that comes between 1⁄8 and 3⁄8 is 2⁄8, which reduces to 1⁄4, Choice (D).
 
189. B. Examine each answer. Choice (A) isn’t true; 3.5 × 10 = 35. 3.2 × 103 = 3,200, which means 
Choices (C) and (D) aren’t true either. The answer must be Choice (B). Multiplying by (1⁄10)2 
means you move the decimal point two places to the left.
 
190. C. The total number of degrees in a circle is 360. 40° of 360° is 40⁄360, which reduces to 1⁄9, 
Choice (C).
 
191. A. The equation for this word problem is x = $20 × 0.30. x = $6, Choice (A).
 
192. A. Eliminate Choices (B) and (D) because they aren’t prime. The remaining choices are 5 
and 7. 7 isn’t a factor of 30, which means the correct answer is Choice (A).
 
193. B. To find the percentage of nonvoters, subtract 27 + 43 (70) from 100: 100 – 70 = 30. 30% 
means 30 per 100, or 30⁄100. Reduce to 3⁄10, Choice (B).
 
194. C. A quadrilateral has four sides. Octagons have eight sides, pentagons have five, and 
hexagons have six. The answer is Choice (C) because a rhombus has four sides.
 
195. B. Check the possible answers for the lowest number that both 3 and 5 go into evenly. 
3 doesn’t go into 5, and 5 doesn’t go into 12. Therefore, the least common multiple of 3 
and 5 is 15, Choice (B).
 
196. D. Because XYZ and XVW are similar, their corresponding sides are in the same propor-
tions. The correct answer compares corresponding sides of each triangle. The ratios in 
Choices (A), (B), and (C) compare sides of the same triangle; the ratios in Choice (D) com-
pare the sides of each triangle.
 
197. A. The associative property of addition states that you can add the same numbers in dif-
ferent orders and still get the same sum. Choice (A) demonstrates that this property is 
true. Choice (C) is straight addition, and Choices (B) and (D) aren’t true.
 
198. B. Because they make up a straight line, the 120° angle and the angle next to it equal 180°. 
That means the bottom-left angle of the triangle equals 60° (180° – 120° = 60°). The angles 
in a triangle add up to 180°, which means that 60° + 60° + x = 180°. x = 60°, Choice (B).
 
199. A. The equation for the word problem is x = (8 × $4.35) + (5 × $3.78). Solve for x: 
x = $34.80 + $18.90; x = $53.70, Choice (A).
 
200. D. A year consists of 12 months, which means Mr. Black spends an average of $630 ÷ 12. 
The average per month is $52.50, which rounds up to $53, Choice (D).
 
201. C. Subtract x and 15 from both sides: 15 + 3x = 30; 3x = 15; x = 5, Choice (C).
 
202. A. Subtract to find the difference. First, make the fractions improper: 21⁄2 = 5⁄2 and 13⁄4 = 7⁄4. 
The common denominator is 4, which makes the equation 10⁄4 – 7⁄4= x. 3⁄4 = x. Choice (A) is 
your answer.
 
203. D. (−5) + (−4) = −9, and 3 + 8 = 11. −9 + 11 = 2. The correct answer is Choice (D).
 
When you have positive and negative numbers mixed together in an addition problem, add 
the negative numbers first and then the positive numbers. Then the problem becomes 
much easier to work with.

204. C. Substitute 10 for C in the formula and solve for F: F = 9⁄5(10) + 32; F = 18 + 32; F = 50°. 
Choice (C) is the answer.
 
205. B. (−6) + (−2) + (−2) = −10; −10 + 5 = −5. Pick Choice (B).
 
206. A. Create an equation from the words. Let w = Wade’s cards: w = 3(106) – 5; w = 318 – 5; 
w = 313. Looks like Wade has 313 cards, Choice (A).
 
207. C. Change 12⁄3 to an improper fraction: 5⁄3. 5⁄3 × 1⁄2 = 5⁄6. Pick Choice (C).
 
208. D. Set up a ratio: 15⁄1 = x⁄5. Cross multiply: x = 15 × 5; x = 75. Kathy can do 75 problems in 
5 hours, Choice (D).
 
209. B. A pound is 16 ounces, which means 8 ounces is a half a pound. The cost for 1.5 pounds 
of meat is $3 × 1.5 pounds, which is $4.50. Pick Choice (B).
 
210. D. Because 3 + the other number = N, the other number = N – 3. Three times the other 
number is 3(N – 3), Choice (D).
 
211. C. First, solve for x: 2x – 3 > 5; 2x > 8; x > 4. Then square both sides: x2 > 16. The answer is 
Choice (C).
 
212. A. If a + 3 is the same number as b + 8, then a has to be greater than b. You can verify this 
by subtracting 3 and b from both sides of the equation: a – b = 5, which means that a must 
be 5 greater than b. The answer is therefore Choice (A).
 
213. D. Your equation looks like this: K = 2(48) – 6. K = 96 – 6; K = 90, Choice (D).
 
214. B. To find the price of the bike before tax, you need to figure out what number $8.60 is 4% 
of: $8.60 = 0.04 × x; 215 = x. The price of the bike is $215, Choice (B).
 
215. B. Substitute the values for x and y in the equation and solve: (4)3 + 5(1⁄2) – 7. 64 + 2.5 − 7 = 
59.5, or 591⁄2 — the answer in Choice (B).
 
216. A. The area of the carpet is length × width, which is 10 × 16, or 160 square feet. The total 
price is 160 × $5, which is $800. Choice (A) is your answer.
 
217. D. The formula for the volume of a rectangular solid is V = l × w × h. Substitute the values 
for the figure into the formula: V = 6 × 9 × 4; V = 216 cm3. The answer is Choice (D).
 
218. A. Set up an equation and solve: 0.04 × x = $47.50. The original loan amount, or x, was 
$1,187.50 — Choice (A).
 
219. B. Substitute the values and solve: 3 × 3 × 5 × 2 = 90, Choice (B).
 
220. C. The sum is 7.129, Choice (C).
 
When you’re working with decimal problems, make sure you line up the decimal points 
before adding or subtracting the numbers.
 
221. A. Substitute 16 for a in the equation and solve for b: 4b – 8 = 16; 4b = 24; b = 6, Choice (A).
 
222. D. Add x to and subtract 6 from both sides: 6x = 3; x = 3⁄6, which reduces to 1⁄2, Choice (D).
 
223. B. z is between −8 and −13. The integers between −8 and −13 are −9, −10, −11, and −12. Only 
−10 and −12 are even, and −10 isn’t an answer choice. Pick Choice (B).
 
224. B. You don’t have to completely multiply this problem to find the right answer. The number 
of places to the right of the decimal point in the product equals the total number of decimal 
places in the two multiplied values. The first number has two values after the decimal, and 
the second has three, which means the right answer will have five as long as the last 
number isn’t 0. Choice (B) has five numbers after the decimal, and its last number isn’t 0, 
so it’s the correct answer.
 
225. C. It may be obvious to you that 30 days is 3 times 10 days, so Stan loses 3 times as many 
buttons in 30 days. To be sure, though, you can set up a proportion. Stan loses 3 buttons 
in 10 days (3⁄10) and x buttons in 30 days (x⁄30): 3⁄10 = x⁄30. Cross multiply: 10x = 3(30); 10x = 90; 
x = 9. Choice (C) is your answer.

231
 Chapter 18: Answers to HSPT Practice Test 1
 
226. A. Multiply to find 30% of $40: 0.3 × $40 = $12. Jessie saves $12 per week. In four weeks, she 
saves 4 × $12, or $48 — Choice (A).
 
227. D. The fastest way to solve this problem is to substitute answer choices. Because you’re 
looking for the number that makes the left side greater than 17, start with the largest number 
in the answer choices, which is 8 in Choice (D). 3 × 8 = 24 and 24 – 5 > 17. 8 is a possible value 
for x. Choice (D) is the answer; you don’t have to try the others.
 
228. A. You know that 2.5455 goes into 4.31 at least once but not more than twice. Eliminate 
answers that are less than 1 and more than 2. The answer is Choice (A).
 
229. B. If four movies cost $23.40, the cost of two movies is half that much: $23.40 ÷ 2 = $11.70, 
Choice (B).
 
230. D. Solve for x: 
; 
. Square both sides to find that x = 25, Choice (D).
 
231. A. To divide the fraction, multiply both sides of the equation by the reciprocal: x = 40 × 2⁄1; 
x = 80. So the value of 3⁄4 x = 3⁄4 × 80; x = 60, Choice (A).
 
232. B. Carefully multiply 436 and 42 to get a product of 18,312, Choice (B).
 
233. D. Figure out what you know. If Sally is 25 today, then 10 years ago she was 15 (25 − 10 = 15). 
Sally’s mother was 3 times as old as Sally 10 years ago, meaning 10 years ago Sally’s mother 
was 45 (3 × 15 = 45). Don’t stop there and pick Choice (C), though. The question asks you 
for Sally’s mother’s age today, 10 years later. 45 + 10 = 55. Sally’s mother is 55, Choice (D). If 
you picked Choice (A), you assumed that Sally’s mother is still 3 times as old as Sally today, 
which isn’t possible.
 
234. B. To find the ratio, divide the fractions: 3⁄4 ÷ 4⁄8. Multiply by the reciprocal: 3⁄4 × 8⁄4 = 24⁄16, which 
simplifies to 3⁄2, Choice (B).
 
235. C. Square both sides of the problem and solve for x: x + 10 = 82; x + 10 = 64; x = 54, Choice (C).
 
236. D. Let N stand for the money Andrew’s sister has saved. Andrew’s savings are 2N. When 
Andrew gives his sister $5, his savings minus $5 will equal his sister’s savings plus $5. 
Therefore, 2N – 5 = N + 5. Solve for N: 2N = N + 10; N = 10. Andrew’s sister saved $10, and 
Andrew saved twice that. Andrew saved 2($10), or $20 — Choice (D).
 
237. A. Eliminate Choices (C) and (D) because they’re odd numbers. y is either 6, Choice (A), or 
8, Choice (B). y is less than 8, which means it can’t equal 8. Choice (A) is your answer.
 
238. B. Find the area of the square and add it to the area of the four semicircles. The area of the 
square is s2, which means this square is 82, or 64 m2. The formula for finding the area of a 
circle is A = πr2. The four semicircles are equal to two full circles with diameters of 8 (radii 
of 4). Figure out the area of one circle and times it by 2 to get the area of the four semicir-
cles: A = π(4)2; A = 16π. The area of two circles (four semicircles) is 2(16)π, or 32π. 
Therefore, the area of the figure is (64 + 32π) m2, Choice (B).
Section 5: Language
 
239. B. Choice (B) has a capitalization error. The complete holiday name, Valentine’s Day, 
should be capitalized.
 
240. A. The error is in the first word of Choice (A). “Him and Mary” is the subject of the sen-
tence, which means the pronoun should be in the subjective form, “He and Mary.” If you 
take “and Mary” out of the sentence, “him” doesn’t sound right.
 
241. C. Choice (C) contains a usage error. People sit down; they don’t set down.
 
242. A. The three verbs in Choice (A) are in different tenses. Were growing is past tense, so tells 
and is should also be past tense (told and was).

232
Part IV: Practice Makes Perfect 
 
243. D. None of the answers contains a problem with usage, punctuation, or capitalization. 
Select Choice (D).
 
244. A. Choice (A) has a double negative (hardly never), which is a no-no in standard English. 
Changing never to ever corrects the problem.
 
245. D. The punctuation, capitalization, and usage are all fine in this question.
 
246. B. Dates require commas between the day and the year. Choice (B) should be “October 21, 
1995.”
 
247. C. Nor follows neither. Choice (C) should be “Neither my brother nor I. . . .”
 
248. B. When you compare more than two, you use the suffix -est rather than -er. In Choice (B), 
Matt is the youngest of five, not the younger.
 
249. C. Use less for nouns that can’t be counted and fewer for nouns that are countable. You can 
count the flu cases, which means in Choice (C), there have been fewer cases, not less cases.
 
250. B. Choice (B) isn’t a question; it’s a statement that states what Gladys asked me. 
Consequently, it should end with a period rather than a question mark.
 
251. D. Nothing’s wrong with any of the answers; Choice (D) is correct.
 
252. D. Set is proper for things like books. All is well in these answers. Pick Choice (D).
 
253. A. They’re is a contraction for they are. The guys haven’t waited all of they are lives in 
Choice (A). The proper form in this sentence is their because it shows possession.
 
254. A. Adverbs describe verbs. Computers run efficiently, not efficient; Choice (A) contains the 
error.
 
255. B. Choice (B) features the improper form of to. You use too to mean more than enough: 
Paul had eaten too much for dinner.
 
256. B. Choice (B) forms the possessive of father incorrectly. I have only one father, which 
means it’s my father’s coat. Fathers’ means the coat belongs to many fathers.
 
257. C. The proper verb form in Choice (C) is would have; the phrase would of is never proper.
 
258. C. Because the dependent clause comes after the independent clause, the comma after 
chocolate in Choice (C) is incorrect.
 
259. D. The first three answer choices are constructed correctly. Go with Choice (D).
 
260. A. It’s is a contraction of it is. The puppy didn’t run with it is tail between it is legs. Use its 
to show possession.
 
261. B. Choice (B) has a capitalization error. The full name of the airport is Kennedy Airport.
 
262. C. In Choice (C), who’s is a contraction of who is. You wouldn’t say, “Do you know who is 
book this is?” The possessive form of who is whose.
 
263. B. There’s a nasty double negative in Choice (B). It should read “don’t tell anyone” or “tell 
no one” instead.
 
264. D. Effects in Choice (A) and himself in Choice (C) are used properly. Choice (B) is a ques-
tion, which means the question mark at the end is okay. Choice (D) is right.
 
265. C. A company is a single entity, which means the pronoun that refers to company should 
be singular. Their in Choice (C) should be its.
 
266. D. The three sentences in this question are clean. Pick Choice (D) and move along.
 
267. B. Choice (B)’s use of an adjective to describe a verb is improper. The cat chased the 
mouse quickly, not quick.
 
268. D. Choices (A), (B), and (C) are fine as written. Choice (D) is your answer.

233
 Chapter 18: Answers to HSPT Practice Test 1
 
269. C. The past tense of lie is lay, not lied. Choice (C) contains the error.
 
270. B. The snowboards in Choice (B) belong to Carl and Cathy, which means the snowboards 
are their snowboards. There isn’t the possessive form of they.
 
271. C. In Choice (C), me should be I. The idea is that Nellie is better than I am. So, Nellie is 
better than I.
 
272. C. Circus in Choice (C) is a general term, not a title; it shouldn’t be capitalized.
 
273. A. The verbs in Choice (A) are in different tenses. They should both be past tense or pres-
ent tense: The party ends, and they wash OR the party ended, and they washed.
 
274. A. Coney Island is the full name of the location in Choice (A). Island should be capital-
ized, too.
 
275. B. Choice (B) joins together two independent clauses with a comma and no conjunction, 
which makes it a comma splice. Changing the comma to a semicolon fixes the problem.
 
276. B. The comma separating the clauses in Choice (B) should be eliminated because the 
dependent clause “if I’m wrong” comes after the independent clause “correct me.”
 
277. D. Choices (A), (B), and (C) are properly punctuated and constructed. Pick Choice (D).
 
278. C. As it’s used in Choice (C), east is a direction and not a location. It shouldn’t be capitalized.
 
279. A. Recieved in Choice (A) violates the i-before-e-except-after-c rule.
 
280. B. The stress in examine isn’t on the last syllable, which means you don’t double the n 
before adding -ing. Choice (B) has the spelling error.
 
281. D. Tricky words such as tournament and restaurant are spelled correctly in these sen-
tences, which means the answer is Choice (D).
 
282. A. In Choice (A), you should drop the ce in science before adding tist to create scientist.
 
283. D. Traveling and humorous are spelled correctly, which means all three sentences are 
error free.
 
284. B. Immediately should have two m’s. Choice (B) contains the error.
 
285. C. Forefathers is spelled with an e, which means Choice (C) has the misspelling.
 
286. C. The problem with Choice (C) is that independent shouldn’t contain any a’s.
 
287. A. Equipment doesn’t have a t in it. Choice (A) has the error.
 
288. B. Don’t skip over the error in Choice (B). Columns is properly spelled with an mn.
 
289. B. This sentence has a beginning phrase; choose an answer that clearly demonstrates that 
I am doing the gazing out the window. Choices (A) and (C) convey that the herds of deer 
are gazing out the window. Choice (D) contains redundant language; a herd is a group. 
Choice (B) is the best option.
 
290. C. Pick the transition word that makes the most sense. The second clause conveys a con-
trasting idea, and the answer that shows contrast is Choice (C), however.
 
291. D. College didn’t graduate from high school; Sam did. Eliminate Choice (A). Then and next 
step convey similar ideas; using them both in the same sentence is redundant. Cross out 
Choices (B) and (C). Choice (D) is the best construction of the four options.
 
292. D. The paragraph is about using fantasy as a means to educate children. The last sentence, 
Choice (D), throws in science fiction stories out of the blue.
 
293. A. Find the answer that gives information that’s relevant to finding a summer job. The 
resumes and interviewing skills mentioned in Choice (A) are relevant to finding a job. 
Drinking liquids and popular vacation times aren’t.

234
Part IV: Practice Makes Perfect 
 
294. A. The idea is that because Doug has done something in the past, he’ll do the same thing 
in the future. Choose the transition word that shows a cause-and-effect relationship. 
Choice A, therefore, shows cause and effect; Choices (B) and (C) show contrast.
 
295. D. Choices (B) and (C) contain passive voice and other problems; cross them out. 
Choice (A) makes it sound like the meeting may be held on my desk. Choice (D) is clearer.
 
296. C. Eliminate Choices (A) and (B) because the “putting” and “hats and mittens” didn’t hear 
about the weather. Choice (D) contains passive voice. The clearest sentence is Choice (C).
 
297. C. Choices (A) and (B) lack clarity because they separate the verb “cross” and its object 
“the river” with the phrase “without my waders and snorkel.” Choice (D) is less clear than 
Choice (C) because it improperly makes “attempting to cross” the subject rather than “I.”
 
298. B. The statement begins with Therefore, which means it comes after the idea that gives a 
reason for the government to permit private companies to take over transportation. So, it 
definitely doesn’t work before the first sentence; you can cross out Choice (A). Eliminate 
Choice (D) also because the sentence is relevant to the paragraph. Sentences 2 and 3 talk 
about toll roads; it doesn’t make sense to split these similar ideas with a sentence that 
talks about privatization. The best place for the sentence is in between Sentence 1 and 
Sentence 2, Choice (B). Private companies do a better job; therefore, they should be 
allowed to take over.

 We did our best to make this practice test similar to the real HSPT, but the test-makers may 
have tweaked the real thing slightly. Don’t be surprised if the HSPT you take has a different 
number of questions in a section or slightly different time limits.
Your best bet when taking this practice test is to take it under conditions that are as much 
like real test conditions as possible by
 
✓ Finding a place where you won’t be distracted. (Step away from the refrigerator! 
Practice test time isn’t snack time.)
 
✓ Taking this test at approximately the same time of day as your HSPT is scheduled.
 
✓ Tearing out the answer sheet in this chapter and marking your answers on it by filling 
in the appropriate bubbles.
 
✓ Writing notes and computations in the margins of the test pages, except of course 
when you’re required to estimate the answer.
 
✓ Timing yourself on each section. When the time is up for a particular section, move on 
to the next one.
 
✓ Giving yourself a 10- to 15-minute break between the Reading and Mathematics sections, 
which is probably when the HSPT proctor will let you have a little hiatus on test day.
After you complete this test, go on to Chapter 20. There you’ll find the answers to each ques-
tion, along with valuable explanations for each answer (trust us, you want to read them).

President Andrew Jackson signed the Indian Removal Act in 1830, which appropriated 
$500,000 for the U.S. military to force the Cherokee tribes to march from their homes in 
Florida and southern Georgia to Oklahoma. In 1832, the Native Americans won a victory 
supported by most Northern leaders in the U.S. Supreme Court case of Worchester v. 
Georgia. The decision held that Native American nations were independent and not subject 
to state regulation. However, after the case decision, President Jackson provokingly 
asserted that Chief Justice John Marshall had made his decision and “now let’s see him 
enforce it.” Although Jackson professed to having “the kindest feelings” toward the 
Cherokees, his actions and subsequent statements belied his words.
 
In 1835, Jackson entered into treaty negotiations with the Cherokees that ended up in the 
relinquishment of all of their land east of the Mississippi River. Jackson gave the Cherokees 
until 1838 to leave the area. Some left voluntarily, but most did not. Those who remained 
were forced by the U.S. military to walk the 1,200 mile “Trail of Tears” from Georgia to lands 
in Oklahoma, usually with only the clothes they were wearing. The brutal journey in 1838 to 
1839 resulted in the deaths of about one-fourth of the Cherokee population from disease, 
starvation, exposure, and exhaustion.

Almost all great nations have composed myths. The Greek and Roman myths represent 
the most popular of these tales. These myths have extended their influence to virtually 
everyone from advertising agents to writers. It appears that we study myths primarily for 
four reasons.
 
First, as mentioned, Greek and Roman myths have profoundly inspired English and 
American literature. In fact, we can barely comprehend Shakespeare, Milton, Keats, or 
Lowell without familiarizing ourselves with the myths of Greece and Rome. Second, myths 
have greatly influenced our music, and many of the stories explain how musical instruments 
were first created. Many musical compositions have been inspired by the mythological 
characters, including the word “music” itself, which is derived from the Greek myth 
“Muses.” Third, we study Greek and Roman myths because the stories are both beautiful 
and entertaining. These fables still appeal to our imagination. Finally, myths provide us with 
a critical link to the past. They are often our only source of knowledge regarding how our 
distant ancestors viewed the world around them.
 
Some of the most important mythological characters are Jupiter, Juno, and Mars. At the 
top of the mythological hierarchy is Jupiter, called the father of Roman gods and mortals. 
Jupiter is the founder of all kingly power, the supreme ruler, and the creator of law, order, 
and justice. All good and evil springs from Jupiter, who assigns his earthly share of sorrow 
and prosperity to all mortals. Armed with thunder and lightning, he causes storms by shak-
ing his shield. Jupiter is the god of weather and is often associated with rain. A great eagle 
crouches before Jupiter, patiently waiting to be his messenger.
 
Sitting beside Jupiter in the heavens is his wife and consort, Juno. Juno knows all of 
Jupiter’s secrets, and he listens to her with respect. However, Juno is less powerful than 
Jupiter and must obey him. Her domain is marriage, and she appears to be a beautiful and 
majestic woman in her middle ages who commands reverence but is not openly friendly. On 
Juno’s head sits a crown with a veil hung behind her head. Iris, goddess of the rainbow is her 
constant attendant and companion.
 
Another important Roman god is Mars, the god of war and a son of Jupiter and Juno. He 
revels in conflict, and his war chariot races along at high speeds, pulled by four fiery steeds. 
Dogs and vultures follow Mars wherever he goes, and his symbols are a spear and a burning 
torch. His sons are known as Terror, Trembling, Panic, and Fear.

Many people believe that the existence of lawyers and lawsuits represent a relatively 
recent phenomenon. The opinion that many hold regarding lawyers, also known as attor-
neys, is that they are insincere and greedy. Lawyers are often referred to as “ambulance 
chasers” or other pejorative expressions.
 
Despite this negativity, lawyers are also known for their fights for civil rights, due pro-
cess of law, and equal protection. Lawyers were instrumental in desegregating the institu-
tions in our society and in cleaning up the environment. Most legislators at the local, state, 
and federal level of government are lawyers because they generally have a firm understand-
ing of justice and the proper application of statutory and case law.
 
Lawyers are traditionally articulate public speakers, or orators, too. One of the finest 
legal orators was Marcus Tullius Cicero, who was an intellectually distinguished, politically 
savvy, and incredibly successful Roman lawyer. Cicero lived from 143–106 B.C. and was one 
of only a few Roman intellectuals credited with the flowering of Latin literature that largely 
occurred during the last decades of the Roman republic.
 
Cicero’s compositions have been compared to the works of Julius Caesar. Their writings 
have customarily been included in the curriculum wherever Latin is studied. Cicero was a 
lifelong student of government and philosophy and a practicing politician. He was a suc-
cessful lawyer whose voluminous speeches, letters, and essays tend to have the same qual-
ity that people usually associate with pleading a case. His arguments are well structured, 
eloquent, and clear. Cicero perfected the complex, balanced, and majestic sentence struc-
ture called “periodic,” which was imitated by later writers from Plutarch in the Renaissance 
to Churchill in the 20th century.

Biomes are the major biological divisions of the earth. Biomes are characterized by an 
area’s climate and the particular organisms that live there. The living organisms make up 
the “biotic” components of the biome, and everything else makes up the “abiotic” compo-
nents. The density and diversity of a biome’s biotic components is called its “carrying 
capacity.” The most important abiotic aspects of a biome are the amount of rainfall it has 
and how much its temperatures vary. More rain and more stable temperatures means more 
organisms can survive. Usually, the wetter a biome is, the less its temperature changes from 
day to night or from summer to winter. Biomes include deserts, rain forests, forests, savan-
nas, tundras, freshwater environments, and oceans.
 
Deserts are areas that get less than 10 inches of rain per year. Most deserts are hot (like 
the Sahara), but some are actually cold (like parts of Antarctica). Therefore, the thing that 
distinguishes deserts is their extreme dryness. The organisms that live in a desert need to 
be able to survive drastic temperature swings along with dry conditions, so the desert’s car-
rying capacity is extremely low. Desert animals include reptiles, such as lizards and snakes, 
and some arachnids, like spiders and scorpions.
 
Conversely, tropical rain forests get lots of rain and have steady, mild temperatures, a 
combination that creates perfect living conditions for most terrestrial organisms. This means 
that the tropical rain forest has the greatest density and diversity of life. Tropical rain for-
ests, like the ones in South America and southeast Asia, contain densely packed trees, 
plants, and vines that are home to millions of insect species, along with lots of rodents, 
 reptiles, monkeys, birds, and just about every other kind of terrestrial animal there is.
 
There are two forest biomes: the temperate deciduous forest and the taiga. The first one 
exists in the eastern U.S. and in central Europe and gets more rain than the desert but less 
than the rain forest. Its temperature changes quite a bit from season to season, but not as 
dramatically as in the desert. Temperate biomes have a medium density and diversity of 
species, with big trees with leaves (that’s what “deciduous” means) and lots of mammals, 
like rodents, deer, and many types of songbirds. The taiga has mostly evergreen trees, like 

257

 Chapter 19: HSPT Practice Test 2
pine and spruce, and animals like squirrels, deer, moose, wolves, bears, and birds. The tai-
ga’s carrying capacity is a little lower than that of the temperate deciduous forest because 
the taiga is a little colder and it usually gets less rain. The forests of northwestern North 
America and northern Europe and Asia are taigas.
 
The savanna is mostly grasslands with a few trees here and there. It has one good rainy 
season with long periods of drought every year, so its carrying capacity is below average. 
Because it has so much grass, this biome supports lots of grazing mammals, such as ante-
lope, zebra, and bison, and feline predators, such as lions and cheetahs. The best-known 
savanna is in central Africa, but the central prairies of the U.S. count as well.
 
The main characteristic of the tundra is that the ground stays permanently frozen. The 
extreme tundras, like those near the North and South Poles, are too cold for almost any-
thing to live there, so the carrying capacity is really low. The less extreme tundras can sup-
port lots of mosses, grasses, and hearty mammals, like caribou and bears.
 
Freshwater environments and oceans are also biomes. The freshwater biome includes 
elements such as rivers, lakes, and ponds. These areas are affected by temperature swings, 
the amount of available oxygen, and the speed of water flowing through them. All of these 
are affected by the larger climate area the freshwater biome is in, which also affects the 
biotic components. Algae, fish, amphibians, and insects are found in freshwater biomes. 
Oceans cover about 70 percent of the earth’s surface, so they comprise the biggest biome. 
Temperature swings aren’t nearly as wide in the oceans as they are on land, and there’s 
plenty of water to go around. Therefore, the carrying capacity of the oceans is huge. The 
density and diversity of organisms isn’t quite as high as in the tropical rain forest, but the 
total number of organisms in the oceans is much bigger than all the terrestrial biomes put 
together.

The Bible is about relationships. It explores the relationships between humans and 
nature and humans and other humans. Even though the Bible portrays other important rela-
tionships, these relationships are secondary to and contingent upon its primary focus: the 
relationship between God and humans. The story portrayed by the Bible is the story of 
God’s unending desire to have an intimate relationship with the human beings He created. 
Throughout the Old and New Testaments, this message repeats itself: A good and merciful 
God reaches out to His rebellious creations in order to reconcile them to Himself.
 
The books of Genesis and Exodus embody all the pertinent information for understand-
ing and interpreting the redemption message that permeates the entire Bible and culmi-
nates in the last book of Revelation. All the elements of the story are set up in these first 
two books. Genesis provides the background for God’s desire to relate to human beings and 
the human choice to reject God’s provision. Genesis further describes the measures God 
takes to set in motion His plan for the restoration of the God/human relationship. Exodus, 
by relating the story of Israel’s physical redemption from bondage in Egypt through Moses, 
foretells God’s plan for humans’ spiritual redemption through the Messiah that is revealed 
in the New Testament.
 149. This passage answers which of these 
 questions?
 
(A) How many books are contained in the 
Bible?
 
(B) What is the Bible’s primary focus?
 
(C) What exactly happens in the book of 
Revelation?
 
(D) How was Israel released from its bond-
age to Egypt?
 150. As it is used in the passage, culminates 
most nearly means
 
(A) concludes
 
(B) commences
 
(C) disappears
 
(D) crumbles
 151. Which of these is not a relationship that the 
passage mentions the Bible explores?
 
(A) between humans and nature
 
(B) between humans and God
 
(C) between humans and other humans
 
(D) between humans and a moral code
 152. What background does the book of Genesis 
provide?
 
(A) the human choice to accept God’s 
 provision
 
(B) the story of Israel’s redemption from 
Egypt
 
(C) God’s attempt to reject rebellious 
humans
 
(D) a demonstration of God’s longing to 
have a relationship with human beings

Answers to HSPT Practice Test 2
T
he answer explanations in this chapter are full of tips and shortcuts that show you how 
to tackle HSPT questions more efficiently. We strongly encourage you to read all of 
them. Of course, if you’re tight on time, you can always skip to the end of this chapter to 
check your answers using the abbreviated answer key.
Section 1: Verbal Skills
 
1. C. Cake, pie, and cookies are desserts. You can wash them down with milk, Choice (C), but 
milk isn’t a dessert.
 
2. D. This analogy involves degrees. A boat that has extra amenities for a complete vacation 
is a cruise ship. A hotel that has extra amenities for a complete vacation is a resort. A hotel 
isn’t luggage, a vacation, or a passport. Choice (D) is best.
 
3. D. Smug, superior, and conceited describe someone who’s egotistical. Humble, Choice (D), 
is the opposite of egotistical, which means it doesn’t belong.
 
4. B. Create a line diagram to help you visualize this logic question. Based on the information 
in the first two statements, the diagram that shows the order of life spans from longest to 
shortest looks like this: cats → dogs → turtles. The third statement, that turtles live longer 
than cats, is false, Choice (B).
 
 Never answer a logic question based on information you know. Your answer should be 
based solely on what you can logically conclude from the premises.
 
5. B. Apparent means “obvious” and so does Choice (B), clear. Choices (A) and (C) are oppo-
sites, and Choice (D) is unrelated.
 
6. B. Events that are creepy, disturbing, and eerie may make you really uneasy. Something 
incorrect, Choice (B), probably doesn’t have that same effect on you, which means it’s the 
word that doesn’t belong.
 
7. A. The prefix sub- means “under or beneath.” Therefore, subordinate means “lesser or 
lower.” The best synonym is Choice (A), inferior.
 
8. C. Travel is a reason for going to the airport, and shopping is a reason for going to the 
store, Choice (C). If you’re tempted to pick Choice (A), sale, keep in mind that an airport 
and a store are both places. A sale isn’t a place.
 
9. B. Selfishness, Choice (B), doesn’t fit with the other words. Intelligence, wisdom, and 
insight relate to having knowledge. Selfishness is all about you.
 
10. C. Something that’s written in the margins probably isn’t very important. Marginal means 
“trivial or insignificant” and so does minor, Choice (C).
 
11. A. This one’s pretty easy. The job of an ambassador is to represent. The job of a physician 
is to heal, Choice (A).
 
12. A. Altruism, selflessness, and philanthropy are synonyms for self-sacrifice. Thoughtlessness, 
Choice (A), is the opposite and doesn’t belong.

276
Part IV: Practice Makes Perfect 
 
13. C. Create a line diagram from largest collection to smallest. There are two possibilities: 
Angela → Cathy → Barbara or Cathy → Angela → Barbara. You don’t know whether 
Angela’s collection is larger than Cathy’s, which makes the third statement uncertain, 
Choice (C).
 
Just because a set of premises gives you more than one possible line diagram doesn’t 
mean the third statement is automatically uncertain. You must analyze the information 
you’re presented with; don’t jump to conclusions.
 
14. C. Bigotry means “intolerance;” Choice (A) is obviously wrong. Justice and effort don’t 
mean intolerance, which means the best answer has to be Choice (C), bias.
 
15. D. Flamboyant means “really, really noticeable,” which makes showy, Choice (D), a good 
synonym. Choices (A) and (C) are opposites, and flamboyant doesn’t describe whether 
something’s attractive or not, making Choice (B) incorrect.
 
16. D. If you opted for Choices (B) or (C), you were thinking of the word forgive rather than 
forbid. To forbid is to prevent or ban something from happening, Choice (D).
 
17. A. Here’s another degree analogy. Scalding is superhot, just like diminutive is supersmall, 
Choice (A). You can eliminate Choices (B) and (D) because they mean the same thing and 
can’t both be right.
 
18. B. To throw a football is to pass, and to throw a baseball is to pitch. The best answer is 
Choice (B); the other answers don’t relate to throwing.
 
19. B. An adversary is one who opposes you. An ally, one who sticks with you, is the opposite. 
Another word for someone who’s against you is foe, Choice (B).
 
20. B. To back, support, and approve are verbs that mean to help or encourage. Lock, Choice (B) 
isn’t an opposite, but it means something different and doesn’t belong.
 
21. A. Used as verbs, cause, trigger, and produce mean to make something happen. Choice (A) 
is unrelated to creating action, which means it doesn’t belong.
 
22. C. Line up the students from great grades to good. You have two options: Phillip → Carrie → 
Patrick or Carrie → Phillip → Patrick. Whether Carrie gets better grades than Phillip depends 
on which diagram you look at. Consequently, the truth of the third statement is uncertain, 
Choice (C).
 
23. A. If Ruth is the tallest girl in music class, then no other girl in music class is taller than 
she. So, Maggie can’t be in music class with Ruth; if she were, Ruth wouldn’t be the tallest 
girl in music class. The third statement is true, Choice (A).
 
24. C. This question asks you for the opposite meaning. Be sure to choose the word that’s an 
antonym. The opposite of telling the truth is to hide the truth. The word that means the 
act of hiding the truth is Choice (C), deception.
 
25. D. The first three words have something to do with being separated or alone. Choice (D) 
means being next to, which isn’t the same as being away from something.
 
26. D. Someone who’s liberal gives freely and without restraint. Choices (A) and (B) are more 
similar in meaning than different, which means you can cut them. The opposite of giving 
freely is Choice (D), stingy, which is a good way to describe Scrooge.
 
27. C. Draw a Venn diagram of the first two statements in this logic question.
Dwaddles
Homer
Homer
Lazy

277
 Chapter 20: Answers to HSPT Practice Test 2
 
 The diagram shows two possible places for Homer’s circle. You know that Homer is lazy, 
but you don’t know whether he’s lazy just because he’s lazy or whether he’s lazy because 
he’s a dwaddle. The premises don’t give you enough information to say whether Homer is 
a dwaddle or not, so the third statement is uncertain, Choice (C).
 
28. B. Choices (C) and (D) don’t seem to relate to boss; go ahead and eliminate them. If your 
boss is glowering, you may want to get out of the way because a glowering boss is an angry 
boss, Choice (B).
 
29. A. To restore is to make something like new again. Choices (B), (C), and (D) have similar 
meanings, but you need the answer that’s opposite. Rupture, Choice (A), means “to come 
apart.”
 
30. D. A pauper is poor, and a tycoon is rich. Choice (D) is the most opposite.
 
31. A. The goal of a comic, joker, and jester is to make people laugh. A dancer, Choice (A), 
isn’t concerned with making jokes and doesn’t belong with the other choices.
 
32. C. Not sure why the answer choices have nothing to do with fancy? That’s because you’re 
thinking of the word fancy as an adjective. Because all the answer choices are verbs, the 
question is actually about the verb form of fancy. To fancy something is to want it or like it. 
The answer that’s opposite is Choice (C).
 
33. C. The scent emitted by garbage is a stench (a really bad smell). The scent emitted by 
cologne is a fragrance (a really good smell). Choice (C) is better than Choice (A) because it 
shows what type of smell is emitted, just like stench does.
 
34. D. The verb form of bloom means to blossom or grow. The opposite is to wither or fade, 
Choice (D). Choice (A) is a synonym, which means it can’t be right.
 
35. C. Squander doesn’t fit with the other answer choices because they mean to inflict injury 
or harm. Although squandering something may be harmful, it isn’t the act of causing harm.
 
36. A. Draw a line diagram of the first premise: White River → Brown River → Cool River. The 
second premise adds Deep River before White River and Slimy River before Deep River like 
this: Slimy River → Deep River → White River → Brown River → Cool River. From that, you 
know that Slimy River is the widest. The third statement is therefore true, Choice (A).
 
37. B. Corrupt means “dishonest or shady;” you can eliminate Choice (D). The word that’s most 
opposite is Choice (B), decent, which means “moral and honest.”
 
38. D. The first three words are different ways to describe a fight. Expansion doesn’t relate to 
fighting, which means Choice (D) doesn’t belong.
 
39. C. A vital decision is an important one. Another word for important is essential, Choice (C). 
Vital doesn’t have to do with time, so Choices (A) and (B) are incorrect.
 
40. B. Stout, plump, and portly are different ways of describing being heavy. Obnoxious, 
Choice (B), has nothing to do with weight, which means it doesn’t belong.
 
41. A. Biology is a type of science, and sculpture is a type of art. Sculpture isn’t a type of clay, 
fashion, or sculptor. Choice (A) is the best answer.
 
42. D. A monastery is where a monk lives, and a den is where a fox lives. Choice (D) is the only 
answer that fits the analogy.
 
43. C. Here’s another chance to draw a Venn diagram.
Squirt fruit
Sweet
Sweet
Green

278
Part IV: Practice Makes Perfect 
 
 The diagram shows that you know all squirt fruit are green, but that you don’t know 
whether all green fruit are squirt fruit. The two options for tasting sweet show that it could 
include squirt fruit, but it could also not, which means the last statement is uncertain, 
Choice (C).
 
44. C. Fedora, bonnet, and cap are names for types of hats. A wrap, Choice (C), is a large scarf 
or cape, which means it isn’t specifically meant for covering the head the way the other 
answers are.
 
45. A. A noxious fume can kill you; it’s toxic, Choice (A). Some noxious fumes (such as carbon 
monoxide) can be odorless, but noxious doesn’t mean odorless.
 
46. D. Spirited means “full of life, or lively,” Choice (D). Ghostly means like a ghost, which is 
more opposite in meaning than similar.
 
47. B. Psychology is the science that studies the mind. Zoology is the science that studies ani-
mals, Choice (B). Don’t go for zoos just because that’s part of the word zoology.
 
48. B. To capitulate is to surrender, which means Choice (A) isn’t opposite and you can elimi-
nate it. The opposite of to surrender is to resist giving in; Choice (B) is best.
 
49. A. Three words that mean important or primary are key, foremost, and main. Slight, 
Choice (A), is the opposite; it means unimportant or minor.
 
50. B. Obliging, cooperative, and accommodating show a willingness to get along. Not being 
practical is unrelated to getting along; impractical, Choice (B), doesn’t belong.
 
51. C. Something that has been fashioned has been created or styled, which means you have to 
cross out Choice (D). The opposite of created is destroyed, Choice (C).
 
52. C. To be wretched is to be miserable, Choice (C). Choice (D), exultant, is the opposite.
 
53. C. List the birthdays in order of first to last based on the first premise: Randy → Jocelyn → 
Chloe. The second premise gives you several options: Randy → Jocelyn → Frank → Chloe, 
Randy → Frank → Jocelyn → Chloe, or Frank → Randy → Jocelyn → Chloe. Clearly it’s 
uncertain whether Frank’s birthday comes before or after Jocelyn’s — Choice (C).
 
54. D. If things look bleak, the outlook is pretty much hopeless. Eliminate Choice (A) because 
it’s a synonym. The opposite of hopeless is promising, Choice (D).
 
55. B. Although nuance sounds sort of like newness, it doesn’t mean newness. It means “hint or 
slight degree of difference.” The best answer is fine distinction, Choice (B).
 
56. A. It may be obvious to you without a diagram that Chippy has blond hair because he’s a 
swirl. In case it isn’t, here’s a Venn diagram that shows you the relationship.
Swirl
Blond hair
Chippy
Swirl
Three toes
Chippy
 
 Because all swirls fit into the blond hair circle and Chippy belongs in the swirl circle, you 
must conclude that Chippy does indeed have a blond head of hair, Choice (A).
 
57. D. An aristocrat enjoys high social standing. A wealthy aristocrat has high social standing 
and lots of money and is, therefore, quite privileged, Choice (D). Wealthy aristocracy 
doesn’t guarantee youth or charm, however.

279
 Chapter 20: Answers to HSPT Practice Test 2
 
58. C. Starter, hors d’oeuvre, and appetizer are names for foods that you eat before the main 
meal. Dessert, Choice (C), comes at the end of the meal, so it doesn’t belong.
 
59. A. Chess is a type of game, and Cajun is a type of cooking. It’s not a type of Louisiana, 
bayou, or catfish; Choice (A) is the best answer.
 
60. B. Draw a line diagram of the list of cities from north to south. The first premise gives you 
this: Lochtown → Morristown. Add Noonville and Otisburg in relation to Lochtown: 
Otisburg → Noonville → Lochtown → Morristown. Morristown is south of Otisburg, which 
means the third statement is false, Choice (B).
Section 2: Quantitative Skills
 
61. D. Create a mathematical equation from the words in the problem. Let x mean “what 
number,” let is mean =, let more than mean +, and let of mean multiply. Then solve for x: 
x = 3 + (0.8 × 20); x = 3 + 16; x = 19. The answer is Choice (D).
 
62. B. Going from 4 to 8 requires an operation of either +4 or ×2. Because the next number is 
12, the operation must be +4. The next number is 12 + 4 = 16, Choice (B).
 
63. C. Write down the value of (a), (b), and (c). Three dimes and three nickels is 3(10) + 3(5), 
which means (a) is 45, (b) is 50, and (c) is 45. Go ahead and write down the relationships, 
too: (b) > (a) = (c). (b) is greater than (a), which means you can eliminate Choices (A), (B), 
and (D). Choice (C) correctly describes the relationship among the values.
 
64. C. 3x = 1⁄2 × 12. Solve for x: 3x = 6; x = 2. The answer is Choice (C).
 
65. B. The numbers in this sequence increase by 5. 55 + 5 = 60, which is Choice (B).
 
66. A. If BE bisects the rectangle, the resulting quadrilaterals are exactly the same. So, AB = EF 
and EF = ED, meaning AB = ED, Choice (A). You can’t assume the quadrilaterals are square 
because you don’t know the original line lengths. So, you don’t know whether Choice (C) is 
true. The other choices must be false.
 
67. A. Create an equation and solve: x + 42 = 8 × 6; x + 42 = 48; x = 6, Choice (A).
 
68. A. x = 42 – (3 × 4). Do the operation in parentheses first: x = 42 – 12. Then tackle the exponent: 
x = 16 – 12. So x = 4, Choice (A).
 
69. D. As you read through the sequence, say the operations to yourself: –3, +5, –3, +5. The 
next number is 3 less than 37, or 34, which means the answer is either Choice (B) or (D). 
Moving forward in the pattern, you find that 34 + 5 is 39, which is the second number in 
Choice (D).
 
70. C. The missing number is probably a Roman numeral because the sequence appears to 
alternate Roman numerals. The answer is therefore either Choice (B) or Choice (C). The 
operation is +3, and 23 + 3 is 26. Choice (C) is the Roman numeral for 26.
 
71. B. An average is the sum of the set of numbers divided by the amount of numbers in the 
set. The equation looks like this: x = 3[(20 + 5 + 25 + 10 + 10) ÷ 5)]. Follow the order of oper-
ations: x = 3(70 ÷ 5); x = 3 × 14; x = 42, Choice (B).
 
72. C. The three figures are pentagons with equal side lengths, which means the larger shaded 
triangles in (b) and (a) are equal, and the shaded areas of (b) and (c) are equal. The 
shaded area in (a) is greater than the shaded area of (b) or (c). So, (a) > (b) = (c). The only 
answer that presents the correct relationship is Choice (C).
 
73. C. Put the question into equation format: 5⁄8 × x = 5 + (4 × 5). Then solve for x: 5⁄8 × x = 5 + 20. 
5⁄8 × x = 25; x = 25 × 8⁄5. You can factor 5 from 25 and 5 to simplify the multiplication: x = 5 × 8; 
x = 40. The answer is Choice (C).

280
Part IV: Practice Makes Perfect 
 
74. D. (a) and (b) aren’t the same. 25% of 80% is less than 25% of 80. Therefore, Choices (A), 
(B), and (C) must be wrong, and the answer has to be Choice (D). You don’t have to con-
sider the value of (c) to answer this one, but if you did, you’d find that (b) and (c) are 
equal. Both of them are 20.
 
75. D. The numbers in this sequence are multiples of 3. 1⁄9 × 3 = 1⁄3, and 1⁄3 × 3 = 1. 1 × 3 = 3, which 
is the next number in the sequence.
 
76. A. Half of 66 is 33, 2⁄5 of 60 is 24, and 1⁄3 of 72 is 24. The order is (a) > (b) = (c), which is 
exactly what Choice (A) says.
 
77. B. This sequence is achieved by adding consecutive numbers. The next operation is +11, 
and 37 + 11 is 48. Only Choice (B) begins with 48.
 
Saying the operations to yourself as you move through a sequence problem can help you 
figure out (and remember) exactly what the pattern is.
 
78. A. Solve for x: x ÷ 2⁄3 = 3⁄4; x = 2⁄3 × 3⁄4; x = 6⁄12, which is 1⁄2, Choice (A).
 
79. C. Based on the graph, the sales by employee look like this: A > B > D > C. The answer that 
reflects this relationship is Choice (C). Because A’s sales are more than half the graph, the 
sales of the other three combined are less than A’s sales.
 
80. A. The operations go like this: +2, –3, +2, –3, +2, and so on. The next number is 4 – 3, which 
is 1. Cross out Choices (C) and (D) because they don’t start with 1. Now add 2 to 1 to get 
the next number, 3; the answer that fits the pattern is Choice (A).
 
81. D. Make an equation and solve: 1⁄2 × x = 7 × 8; 1⁄2 × x = 56; x = 56 × 2⁄1; x = 112, Choice (D).
 
82. D. Count the squares carefully. There are a total of 14, 4 of which are shaded. The fraction 
of the shaded area is 4⁄14, which simplifies to 2⁄7, Choice (D).
 
83. A. The equation is x = 53 ÷ 5. Dividing a cube by its cube root is like taking away one of the 
roots. So, 53 ÷ 5 is the same as 52, or 25, Choice (A).
 
84. B. The operations in the sequence alternate –2 and ×2. 5 – 2 = 3. 3 × 2 = 6. 6 – 2 = 4. 4 × 2 = 8. 
8 – 2 = 6. 6 × 2 = 12. 12 – 2 = 10. The next number is 10 × 2, which is 20 — Choice (B).
 
85. D. 70% written as a decimal is 0.7, which means (a) and (b) are equal. 70% written as a frac-
tion is 70⁄100, or 7⁄10. So, (a), (b), and (c) are equal, Choice (D).
 
86. D. Solve 3⁄4 × x = 5 × 15: 3⁄4 × x = 75; x = 75 × 4⁄3. Factor 3 from 3 and 75 to make the multiplica-
tion easier: x = 25 × 4; x = 100, Choice (D).
 
87. D. The difference between the first two numbers is either –62 or ÷2. The next operation is 
–4. The next operation is ÷2. So, the pattern is probably ÷2, –4, which makes the next oper-
ation –4. 33 – 4 = 29, Choice (D).
 
88. C. Change (b) to a base and exponent: 4 × 3 is 12, which tells you that (b) is equal to 123. 
Now that you know (b) is greater than (a), you can eliminate Choices (B) and (D). You 
know that 43 ≠ 34; you can eliminate Choice (A) and pick Choice (C) without ever figuring 
out the exact value of (c).
 
89. D. The sequence alternates fractions with decimals, which means the next number must be 
a fraction. Scrap Choices (B) and (C). The sequence decreases by 0.75, or 3⁄4. 7.75 – 0.75 = 7, 
which, when expressed as a fraction, is Choice (D). Note: Even though Choices (C) and (D) 
represent a value of 7, Choice D is the better answer because it expresses the value as a 
fraction.
 
90. A. Here’s the equation: 0.2x + 0.6x = 52; 0.8x = 52; x = 65, Choice (A).
 
91. A. The operations seem to be –3, ×2. 25 × 2 = 50, which makes Choice (A) the missing 
number.
 
92. C. The figure displays parallel lines and a couple transversals, which means the corre-
sponding and opposing angles are equal to each other. So ∠B and ∠D are equal, 

281
 Chapter 20: Answers to HSPT Practice Test 2
Choice (C). Cross out Choices (A) and (B) because you know that ∠B + ∠C = 90°, but you 
don’t know the angles’ individual measurements. Choice (D) is wrong because ∠E = ∠C + 
the angle next to ∠C, which means ∠E can’t = ∠C.
 
93. B. The operations in the sequence are +1, –2, +3, –4, +5, –6, +7, and so on. The next opera-
tion is –8. 4 – 8 = –4, Choice (B).
 
94. B. The equation is x = 2[(60 + 52 + 43 + 23 + 60 + 38) ÷ 6] – 4. Solve for x: x = 2(276 ÷ 6) – 4; 
x = 2(46) – 4; x = 92 – 4; x = 88, Choice (B). If you picked Choice (C), you didn’t multiply the 
average by 2 before you subtracted 4.
 
95. D. The number of sixths in 10 times 3 could be written like this: x × 1⁄6 = 10 × 3; x × 1⁄6 = 30; 
x = 30 × 6⁄1, or 180 — Choice (D).
 
96. C. Look at the three values. (c) has to be less than (b) or (a) because (c) is a negative 
number, and the others are positive. Eliminate Choices (A), (B), and (D). You know the 
answer has to be Choice (C) without actually calculating the values.
 
97. D. The numbers in each set increase by 11, which means the next number ends in 66; elimi-
nate Choice (C). Each set skips two letters in the alphabet, so the next set begins with the 
letter L because L is the third letter after I (I, J, K, L). Choice (D) is correct.
 
98. C. Without doing calculations, you know that the value of (b) is less than (a), which means 
you can cross out Choice (D). You also know that 1⁄6 is less than 1⁄5, which means (c) > (b) 
and you can eliminate Choice (A). (a) > (b); pick Choice (C). 5⁄6 = 25⁄30, which is greater than 
6⁄30 (the equivalent of 1⁄5).
 
99. A. The circumference is 2πr, or 24π, which rules out Choice (C). The radius of the circle is 
12 m, which means its diameter is 24 m, Choice (A).
 
100. A. The pattern is +1, +6. 92 + 1 = 93. Toss out Choices (B) and (C) because they don’t start 
with 93. The next operation in Choice (D) is +1 rather than +6, which means Choice (A) 
must be right.
 
101. A. Say the operations as you move along the sequence: –4, ÷2, –4, ÷2. . . . The missing 
number is 16 – 4 = 12, Choice (A).
 
102. C. 25 + 191 = x3. Solve for x: 216 = x3. The cube root of 216 is 6, Choice (C).
 
103. B. (17 + 32)(17 + 32) and (17 + 32)2 are two ways of saying the same thing, which means (a) = 
(b). The only number that has a squared value that’s not greater than twice its value is 2; 
so, (c) has to be < (a) or (b). The relationship of the values is (a) = (b) > (c). Choice (B) is 
your answer.
 
104. D. Create an equation and solve for x: x ÷ 4 = 4 + 32; x ÷ 4 = 36; x = 144, Choice (D).
 
105. B. The numbers seem to repeat twice and then decrease by 9. The next three numbers 
after 18 should be 18, 9, 9, which is Choice (B).
 
106. C. The circles are divided into 16 equal sections. (a) is shaded 4⁄16, (b) is shaded 6⁄16, and (c) 
is shaded 5⁄16. The relationship is (b) > (c) > (a). Eliminate Choices (A), (B), and (D). 
Choice (C) has to be right: 4⁄16 + 6⁄16 is 10⁄16. Half of 10⁄16 = 5⁄16, which is the value of (c).
 
107. C. 33 appears as every other number in the sequence, which means you can cut Choices (B) 
and (D). The other numbers increase by 3, proving Choice (C) to be the answer.
 
108. D. x = a perfect square – 23. Add 23 to each of the answer choices to see which one pro-
duces a perfect square. 98 + 23 = 121, which is 112. The answer is Choice (D).
 
109. D. Write out the equation and solve: x + 0.3x = 65; 1.3x = 65; x = 50 — Choice (D).
 
110. A. Multiply the values to compare them. (a) = 125; (b) = 81; (c) = 81. The correct answer is 
Choice (A); 81 = 81.
 
111. D. Create the equation and solve for x: x = (33 ÷ 9) – 5; x = (27 ÷ 9) – 5; x = 3 – 5; x = –2, 
Choice (D).

282
Part IV: Practice Makes Perfect 
 
112. A. You know the figure is a square because its length and width are the same number. 
Therefore, its diagonals form right angles where they cross, and the triangles they form 
are equal to each other (which makes Choice (D) wrong). The diagonals cut the square in 
half and therefore bisect the right angles at the corners of the square, making Choice (A) 
correct. The measure of the angle created by the diagonal is half that of the original angle. 
The diagonal isn’t equal to 2 times the side length, so toss out Choice (B). The angles in 
Choice (C) are equal; cut Choice (C).
Section 3: Reading
 
113. C. The case is mentioned in the first paragraph, where it tells you that the Native 
Americans, Choice (C), won.
 
114. C. This passage is about Jackson’s treatment of Native Americans, specifically Cherokees, 
in the early 19th century. Choices (A) and (D) have nothing to do with that topic. Choice 
(B) relates to the topic, but it refers to the wrong century. The best answer is Choice (C).
 
Title questions ask you to identify the main point of the passage.
 
115. A. The last sentence of the first paragraph says that Jackson professed to having “the kind-
est feelings” toward the Cherokees, Choice (A).
 
116. B. The beginning of the second paragraph informs you that Jackson negotiated with the 
Cherokee, Choice (B). The other answers aren’t mentioned in the passage at all.
 
117. A. In the first paragraph, you discover that the decision “held that Native Americans were 
independent and not subject to state regulation.” Choice (B) provides a contradictory 
statement, and Choices (C) and (D) are unrelated. Choice (A) is best.
 
118. B. Belied is in the last sentence of the first paragraph. The sentence begins with although, 
which shows contrast. Substitute the answers into the sentence to see which one 
expresses the contrasting idea: Although Jackson said he had kind feelings, his actions 
contradicted his words. His actions didn’t exaggerate, support, or carry his words.
 
119. A. This passage talks about Jupiter in the third paragraph. The last sentence says that a 
great eagle is his messenger. A messenger carries words to others, so the answer must be 
Choice (A). Thunder and lightning are Jupiter’s weapons, not his message carriers.
 
120. D. Choose a title that expresses the main idea of the passage and is neither too specific 
nor so general as to be off topic. Terror, Trembling, Panic, and Fear are mentioned only in 
the last sentence, which means Choice (A) can’t be right. The passage doesn’t talk about 
Mars’s family; Choice (B) is wrong too. It doesn’t mention the fall of Rome, so Choice (C) 
isn’t the main point. The passage begins by explaining why people study myths and 
focuses on their impact on society. Although you can probably think of a better title, 
Choice (D) is the best answer out of the four.
 
121. D. The second paragraph refers to myths as fables, Choice (D).
 
122. B. Consort appears in the fourth paragraph to describe the role of Juno, Jupiter’s wife. The 
paragraph states that Jupiter respects Juno and tells her his secrets. Therefore, she is his 
companion, Choice (B).You can cross out Choices (C) and (D) because they mean pretty 
much the same thing.
 
A question can’t have two right answers. When you see more than one answer choice that 
means the same thing, toss those aside and zero in on the remaining choices.
 
123. D. Critical has several meanings; make sure you pick the definition that fits in the passage. 
You find critical in the second paragraph, where it describes what type of link myths give 
to the past. The last sentence in the paragraph states that myths may be the only source 
of information about how people in the past saw their world, which means that myths

 Chapter 20: Answers to HSPT Practice Test 2
 provide an important link to the past, Choice (D). Choices (A) and (C) are other definitions of 
critical, but they don’t make good replacements for the way critical is used in the passage.
 
124. C. The sixth paragraph states that steeds pull the chariot. Steeds is a name for horses, 
Choice (C).
 
125. A. Majestic is used in the second-to-last paragraph to describe Juno, the wife of Jupiter. 
The paragraph says that Juno commands reverence, or respect. The adjective that best 
fits the quality of gaining respect is Choice (A), magnificent.
 
126. C. The third paragraph mentions all the answer choices in relation to Jupiter, but it specifi-
cally states that Jupiter is known as the god of weather, Choice (C).
 
127. D. Cross out reasons that appear in the passage. The fourth reason expressed in the second 
paragraph is that myth links us to the past. The first reason is about references in modern 
literature. The second reason points out the link to musical instruments. Choice (D) must 
be the answer. Although the passage says that myths are entertaining, it doesn’t state that 
they’re hilariously funny.
 
128. C. The fourth paragraph says that Juno’s domain is marriage. Iris is Juno’s companion and 
goddess of the rainbow, and the passage doesn’t mention marriage in relation to Jupiter or 
Mars. Go with Choice (C).
 
129. D. The only activity that the passage doesn’t tell you that Cicero engaged in is carpentry, 
Choice (D). He was a politician, lawyer, and public speaker.
 
130. A. The last paragraph touches on the comparison of Cicero’s writings to those of Caesar, 
Choice (A). The other choices aren’t mentioned in the passage.
 
131. C. The second paragraph states that Roman intellectuals created Latin literature in the 
Roman republic, which makes the most logical answer Choice (C).
 
132. B. Caesar’s works are compared to Cicero’s compositions, and the next sentence refer-
ences “their writings.” “Caesar’s works” refers to writings, Choice (B).
 
133. B. In the first sentence, the passage tells you that attorney, Choice (B), is another name for 
lawyer.
 
134. D. An example of a pejorative expression in the first paragraph is “ambulance chaser,” and 
the author refers to pejorative expressions as “this negativity.” Therefore, pejorative must 
have a negative connotation. The most negative of the answers is Choice (D). Pejorative 
expressions are uncomplimentary expressions.
 
135. A. The author is very complimentary toward Cicero and praises his accomplishments. The 
best answer is Choice (A). None of the other choices conveys the author’s positivity.
 
136. C. Examine each answer to determine its truth. The last paragraph says that Plutarch imi-
tated Cicero’s sentence structure, but it doesn’t say he used Cicero’s arguments. Cicero’s 
works have been compared to Caesar’s, but the passage doesn’t say they knew each other. 
The author says that some people think lawyers in general are insincere and greedy, but 
that view isn’t attributed specifically to Cicero. The only true answer is Choice (C). The 
last paragraph states that Churchill imitated Cicero’s sentence structure.
 
137. D. The author covers the positive attributes of lawyers in the second paragraph, which 
mentions their contributions to cleaning up the environment and promoting integration. 
Nothing is said about making “ambulance chasing” illegal or teaching public speaking, 
which means you can cut Choices (B) and (C). Choice (A) is a little tricky if you don’t read 
it carefully. Because Choice (A) says that attorneys have fought rather than promoted 
cleaning up the environment, the best answer has to be Choice (D).
 
138. B. The second paragraph says that most legislators (who are politicians) are lawyers 
because they understand justice and the application of the law. Choice (B) is the only 
answer that supports the author’s statement.

Part IV: Practice Makes Perfect 
 
139. A. The first paragraph defines carrying capacity as “the density and diversity of a biome’s 
components.” Choice (A) paraphrases this definition as number and variety of organisms. 
The other answers refer to other characteristics of a biome.
 
140. D. The passage covers forest biomes in the fourth paragraph. The two kinds of forest 
biomes are the temperate deciduous forest and the taiga, which is Choice (D).
 
141. B. The parentheses in the fourth paragraph tell you that deciduous trees have leaves, 
Choice (B).
 
142. A. The tropical rain forest has the greatest carrying capacity; scrap Choice (B). The 
second paragraph says that deserts have “extremely low” carrying capacities. The capac-
ity of the taiga is medium, and the savanna is below average. Therefore, among the answer 
choices, the desert, Choice (A), has the lowest carrying capacity.
 
143. B. The tundra paragraph tells you that the main characteristic of the tundra is that the 
ground stays frozen. It has a low carrying capacity, extreme temperatures, and a few 
hearty mammals. Choice (B) is the best answer.
 
144. D. The last paragraph says that freshwater biomes are affected by temperature swings, the 
amount of available oxygen, and the speed of water flowing through them, which means 
you can eliminate Choices (A), (B), and (C). The passage doesn’t cover issues that are 
unrelated to the natural environment; Choice (D)’s your answer.
 
145. D. The passage says that the tropical rainforest has the greatest carrying capacity, which 
makes Choices (A) and (C) wrong because they list the rainforest after the ocean. Choice (D) 
is better than Choice (B) because it lists the extremely low desert after the below-average 
savanna. The desert has a lower carrying capacity than the savanna. Choice (D) is best.
 
146. A. Because biotic components are living organisms, you can eliminate Choices (B) and (C). 
The taiga is a forest biome and has evergreen trees and forest animals. Choice (D) lists 
 caribou, which live in the tundra rather than the taiga. Choice (A) is the best answer.
 
147. B. The second paragraph mentions Antarctica, Choice (B), as a place to find a desert.
 
148. C. Refer to the fifth paragraph. The savanna has a good rainy season, which means 
Choice (A) isn’t right. It’s known for its grasslands rather than its trees, and it has a below-
average carrying capacity. Toss out Choices (B) and (D). The grasslands of the savanna 
provide food for lots of grazing animals, Choice (C).
 
149. B. The first paragraph says that the primary purpose of the Bible is to explore the relation-
ship between God and humans, which suggests that Choice (B) is the right answer. You 
can eliminate Choice (A) because nowhere does the passage reveal the number of books in 
the Bible. Although the passage mentions the book of Revelation and Israel’s exit from 
Egypt, it doesn’t go into detail on either subject. Choice (B) is the best answer.
 
150. A. Because the passage says that the message culminates in the last book of the Bible, the 
best definition of culminates is Choice (A), concludes.
 
151. D. The first paragraph mentions the relationships between humans and nature, humans 
and other humans, and God and humans. It doesn’t say anything about the relationship 
between humans and a moral code. Pick Choice (D).
 
152. D. The passage discusses Genesis in the second paragraph. It says that the book provides 
the background for God’s desire to relate to humans and humans’ choice to reject God’s 
provision. Choices (A) and (C) are contrary to the statement in the passage, and Choice (B) 
isn’t related to what the passage says is the background provided by Genesis. The best 
answer is Choice (D), which paraphrases part of the statement in the first paragraph.
 
153. B. For this question and the rest of the section, you have to switch gears a bit and focus on 
vocabulary. To excel at an activity is to be excellent at it, to be a star. Stars shine, so the 
best synonym for excel is Choice (B), shine.

154. D. You’d probably be happy to receive an early dismissal from school. It means to be let 
out early. Another word that means to be let go is Choice (D), discharge.
 
155. A. A frivolous excuse for being late probably wouldn’t convince your parents. Frivolous 
means “trivial or silly,” Choice (A).
 
156. A. When you introduce a topic, you bring it up or initiate it, Choice (A). Evade means “to 
avoid,” which is more opposite than similar.
 
157. D. To relish an opportunity is to delight in it. Thus, the best answer is Choice (D), enjoy. 
You may have picked Choice (B) because you were thinking that pickle relish embellishes 
a hot dog, but now you know that relish means to really, really, really like something.
 
158. B. A legacy is something that’s passed down for generations. An inheritance, Choice (B), is 
also passed down from one generation to another.
 
159. C. If you don’t know for sure that insolent means “rude,” you may be familiar enough with it 
to know that it has a negative connotation, which means you can eliminate positive answer 
choices such as reverential and caring. The best answer is Choice (C).
 
160. A. Nirvana is another name for utopia or paradise, Choice (A).
 
161. B. Unparalleled genius has no parallel; there’s nothing like it. It’s unusually remarkable or 
extraordinary, Choice (B).
 
162. C. A subtle hint isn’t obvious; it’s understated, Choice (C).
 
163. C. You probably know that oppression isn’t a positive word, which means you can elimi-
nate Choices (A) and (D) because they’re positive. Choices (B) and (C) are similar in mean-
ing, but oppression is more than just power; it’s total domination, Choice (C).
 
164. D. Having the quality of indifference means to be unconcerned, Choice (D).
 
165. A. A pessimistic outlook is a negative one. The best synonym for pessimistic is gloomy, 
Choice (A).
 
166. A. To wallow in self-pity is sort of like wallowing in mud. It means “to immerse yourself or 
get caught up in a feeling or state of mind.” The best synonym is Choice (A), bask. The 
other choices aren’t related to getting caught up in something.
 
167. C. Tenure is a period of time or term, Choice (C).
 
168. B. A phenomenon is something that happens. Occurrence, Choice (B), is a synonym.
 
169. D. A consuming interest is one that involves every part of your life. It’s overwhelming. 
Choices (A) and (B) have more opposite meanings. The best synonym is intense, Choice (D).
 
170. B. To hoard is to (sometimes obsessively) save or accumulate stuff, Choice (B). A hoarder 
may guard what she has, but the act of hoarding is in the accumulating, not the guarding.
 
171. C. Miscreant just sounds negative, and it is. The most negative word in the bunch is 
Choice (C), troublemaker, and it fits; a miscreant is a wrongdoer.
 
172. A. A palpable silence is a silence you can feel. Something that’s palpable is easily experi-
enced using your senses. Palpable doesn’t have a negative connotation, which means 
Choices (C) and (D) are incorrect. The best answer is Choice (A), noticeable.
 
173. D. A totalitarian government is a dictatorship. The best synonym is Choice (D), despotic, 
which also refers to authoritarian and dictatorial rule.
 
174. A. Spendthrift is a confusing word. It has spend in it, but it also contains thrift. You may 
think it means a thrifty spender, but it doesn’t. The spend part of the word rules. A spend-
thrift is one who spends money to the point of wasting it, a squanderer — Choice (A).

Section 4: Mathematics
 
175. A. The tenths place is the number to the right of the decimal point, which is the second 4. 
Round the 4 to 5 because the number to the right of the 4 is greater than 5. The answer is 
Choice (A), 34.5. Choice (D) improperly rounds the tenths place, and the other choices 
write the number to the incorrect place.
 
176. D. All three are types of angles, Choice (D).
 
A right angle is 90°, an obtuse angle is greater than 90°, and an acute angle is less than 90°.
 
177. D. When you divide a number by a multiple of 10, you move the decimal point one place to 
the left for every zero in the multiple. 100,000 has five zeros, which means you move the 
decimal point five places to the left, Choice (D).
 
178. C. The intersection sign means you must look for the set of numbers that appears in both 
sets. Both sets contain 2, 4, 5, and 6, which is the answer in Choice (C).
 
179. B. The value of the angle next to the 160° angle is 20°. You know that because the angles 
along a straight line add up to 180° (180 – 160 = 20). The angles inside a triangle also add 
up to 180 degrees. Subtract the sum of the other two angles in the triangle to find the mea-
sure of ∠B: ∠B = 180 – (20 + 80); ∠B = 180 – 100; ∠B = 80°, Choice (B).
 
180. A. The cube of a negative number is negative, which means the final answer is negative. 
Eliminate Choices (B) and (C). –2 × –2 × –2 = –8. 5 × –8 = –40, Choice (A).
 
181. C. 0.55 is 55 hundredths, which looks like 55⁄100 when expressed as a fraction. Simplified, that 
reduces to 11⁄20, Choice (C).
 
182. D. The formula for the area of a circle is π × r 2. The radius of this circle is half of 8, or 4. 
42 = 16, which means the area of the circle is 16π m2, Choice (D).
 
The radius of a circle is half the diameter.
 
183. B. You have to know what a reciprocal is to answer this question correctly. Fortunately, 
you’re aware that a reciprocal is the inverse of a fraction; in other words, it’s the numera-
tor and denominator flipped. An example is Choice (B).
 
184. B. 15⁄8 as a mixed number is 17⁄8. The two integers between 17⁄8 and 3.5 are 2 and 3, which 
makes Choice (B) the answer.
 
185. C. The only perfect square among the choices is 121, Choice (C); it’s 112.
 
186. A. To find the number of hundreds, create a fraction; 4,575 hundreds is 4575⁄100. Divide to get 
45.75, Choice (A).
 
187. C. Answer this question by adding multiples of 5 and 7 to see which ones equal 24; 5 + 7 ≠ 
24, but 10 + 14 = 24. If you prefer an algebra approach, you can set up an equation like this 
one to find what multiplier results in the sum of 24: 5x + 7x = 24; 12x = 24; x = 2. Take 2 × 
the smaller value in the ratio to find the smaller number: 2 × 5 = 10. In either case, the 
smaller number is 10, which is Choice (C). Choice (A) is the larger number.
 
188. B. Convert the values so that you’re comparing like units of measure. 36 inches is the same 
as 1 yard. The ratio is 1 to 3, Choice (B).
 
189. D. The first value must be written with only one digit to the left of the decimal point, which 
means Choice (C) can’t be right. The exponent is the number of places you move the deci-
mal point to the right to produce the complete number. The scientific notation that actu-
ally equals 245 is Choice (D). Choice (A) equals 245,000, and Choice (B) equals 24,500.
 
190. D. One gallon equals 4 quarts, which means that 4 gallons is 16 quarts. A quart is 32 ounces, 
so each quart of milk produces four 8-ounce cups. If there are 16 quarts, then 16 × 4 = 64 
8-ounce cups of milk, Choice (D).

191. B. This question is a memory exercise, plain and simple. To find the area of a rectangle, 
you multiply its length by its width, Choice (B).
 
192. A. Let x = the number of boxes of sugar cookies and create an equation: x + x + 4 = 44; 
2x + 4 = 44; 2x = 40; x = 20 boxes of sugar cookies, Choice (A).
 
193. C. An isosceles right triangle has a 90° angle, and the other two angles are equal to each 
other. Because the other two angles add up to 90°, each one is 45° — Choice (C).
 
194. A. The lowest number that both 4 and 8 go into evenly is 8, Choice (A).
 
195. A. Eliminate Choice (D) because 4 isn’t a prime number. Then toss out answers that don’t 
equal 8; 25 is 32, and 2 × 2 is 4, which means Choices (B) and (C) are wrong. The answer is 
Choice (A).
 
196. B. 251⁄2% is equal to 25.5⁄100, which is 0.255. If 0.255 is equal to 251⁄2%, then 25.5 can’t be equal to 
0.255. The correct answer is Choice (B).
 
197. D. The side lengths of similar triangles are proportional, which means the ratio of AC to BC 
is equal to the ratio of XZ to YZ. You know the value of AC, XZ, and YZ, so you can set up a 
proportion and solve for x: 6⁄x = 3⁄5. Cross multiply: 3x = 30; x = 10. The length of BC is 10 
units, Choice (D).
 
198. A. Choice (A) is an example of the distributive property and is correct. Because the dis-
tributive property doesn’t apply to division, Choice (C) can’t be right. Addition and multi-
plication aren’t the same, so Choice (B) is wrong too. Choice (D) would be correct if the 
variables in the parentheses were added rather than multiplied.
 
199. D. –3 + 2 = –1. –1 + (–5) = –6. –6 + (–7) = –13. The answer is Choice (D).
 
200. B. Set up a proportion of the heights to the shadows, cross multiply, and solve for x: 3⁄x = 2⁄14; 
2x = 3 × 14; 2x = 42; x = 21. The shadow is 21 feet tall, Choice (B).
 
201. A. Let x equal the total amount spent and set up an equation: x = (5 × $3.75) + (4 × $2.25); 
x = $18.75 + 9; x = $27.75, which is Choice (A).
 
202. D. First things first: Change the mixed numbers to improper fractions: 34⁄6 = 22⁄6, and 23⁄4 = 11⁄4. 
Then find the least common denominator: 4 and 6 go evenly into 12. 22⁄6 = 44⁄12, and 11⁄4 = 33⁄12. 
Finally, subtract: 44⁄12 – 33⁄12 = 11⁄12, Choice (D).
 
203. D. Subtract x and 7 from both sides: 2x + 7 = x + 12; x = 5 — Choice (D).
 
204. A. Set up an equation for $600 is 6% of what number and solve: $600 = 0.06x; 10,000 = x. 
The price of the car before tax was $10,000, Choice (A).
 
205. C. 1,525 ÷ 7 = 217.857; the answer becomes 218 miles, Choice (C), when you round to the 
nearest mile.
 
206. B. Find the value of a: 3a + 2 > 14; 3a > 12; a > 4. Square both sides to find that a2 > 16, 
Choice (B).
 
207. C. Let x equal Alicia’s dollars and create an equation: x = (3 × 40) – 15; x = 120 – 15; x = 105. 
Alicia has $105, Choice (C).
 
208. A. The saleswoman earns 6% of $60 for each tool set, which means she earns $3.60 per tool 
set (0.06 × $60 = $3.60). For 5 tool sets, she earns $18 (5 × $3.60), Choice (A).
 
209. C. A pound is 16 ounces, which added to 8 ounces is a total of 24 ounces of candy. The 
candy costs $2 per ounce, and $2 × 24 is $48, Choice (C).
 
210. C. Subtract y and 6 from both sides of the equation: x – y = 5. If x – y is a positive number, 
x must be greater than y, which is what’s stated in Choice (C).
 
211. B. If the sum of two numbers is x and one of the numbers is 6, then the other number has 
to be x – 6. So, 4 times the other number is 4(x – 6), which is Choice (B).

212. D. Convert the mixed fractions to improper fractions: 12⁄3 = 5⁄3, and 32⁄6 = 20⁄6. The lowest 
common denominator of the fractions is 6; the resulting equation is 10⁄6 + 3⁄6 + 20⁄6 = 33⁄6. Convert 
to a mixed fraction and simplify: 51⁄2, Choice (D). Another way to solve is to reduce 32⁄6 to 
31⁄3. 12⁄3 + 31⁄3 = 5. Add 1⁄2 to 5 to get 51⁄2.
 
213. C. Substitute the values for x and y in the equation and solve: 2(1⁄2)2 + 3(3) – 1 = ?; 
2(1⁄4) + 9 – 1 = ?; 1⁄2 + 8 = 81⁄2, Choice (C).
 
214. D. N% × 70 = 14; N% = 0.2; N = 20, Choice (D).
 
215. A. 0.05x = $525; x = $10,500. Miguel borrowed $10,500, Choice (A).
 
216. B. Line up the decimal points and add to get 7.603, Choice (B).
 
217. B. Isolate the x on the left side: 4x > 12; x > 3. The answer choices are cubed, so cube both 
sides: x3 > 27. The answer is Choice (B).
 
218. D. Because the multiplied values have a total of four digits to the right of their decimal 
points, the answer should have four digits to the right of the decimal point. The answer is 
either Choice (C) or (D). You know that the last number is a 5 because the last numbers of 
the multiplied values are 1 and 5 and 1 × 5 = 5. Choice (D) is therefore your answer.
 
219. C. Recall the formula for the volume of a cube: s3. s = 6, and s3 is 63, or 216 m3, Choice (C).
 
220. B. Per 100 is another way of saying percent, which means the tax is 2.76%. 0.0276 × $40,000 
= $1,104. The taxes on $40,000 are $1,104, Choice (B).
 
221. A. Per month, Danielle makes $48,000 ÷ 12, or $4,000. 6% of $4,000 is 0.06 × $4,000, or $240. 
Danielle saves $240 per month, Choice (A).
 
222. C. The answer to this basic multiplication problem is 11,484, Choice (C).
 
223. D. The equation is (5 × 6) = 10 + x. So, 30 = 10 + x, and 20 = x, Choice (D).
 
224. C. Square both sides of the equation to eliminate the square root sign: y – 4 = 32. Solve for 
y: y = 9 + 4; y = 13. Choice (C)’s your answer.
 
225. B. A ratio is really just a division problem, which means the question is 1⁄2 ÷ 6⁄8 = x. Multiply 
by the reciprocal: 1⁄2 × 8⁄6 = x; 8⁄12 = x; 2⁄3 = x. Choice (B) wins!
 
226. D. The operation for the sequence is +0.02. 15.06 + 0.02 = 15.08, Choice (D).
 
227. D. Find the areas of each of the three figures and add them together to find the total area. 
The area of the square is easy: s2 = 62, or 36. The area of one triangle is 1⁄2 bh. The base is 6, 
and the height is 4. So, A = 1⁄2(6)(4), which is 12. Add the areas: 36 + 12 + 12 = 60, Choice (D). 
The other answers give you the partial area.
 
228. A. Create a right triangle with a base of 5 ft and a hypotenuse of 13 ft, like this one.
13
5

289
 Chapter 20: Answers to HSPT Practice Test 2
 
 Because one side measures 5 and the hypotenuse measures 13, this is one of those special 
right triangles with proportionate side lengths of 5-12-13. That makes the height 12 ft. Note: 
If you didn’t remember the proportion, you could use the Pythagorean theorem to calcu-
late the length of the other side instead: a2 + b2 = c2; 52 + b2 = 132; 25 + b2 = 169; b2 = 144; b = 
12. Either way, go with Choice (A).
 
229. D. Apply the formula for the area of a rectangle (A = lw). A = 6 × 14, or 84 in2 — Choice (D).
 
230. D. The lowest common denominator for the fractions is 12. Convert each fraction and 
solve: (4⁄12 + 9⁄12) – (4⁄12 + 9⁄12) = x; 13⁄12 – 13⁄12 = x; 0 = x, which is Choice (D).
 
231. C. You can multiply both sides by 10 to eliminate the decimal points: 6x + 49 = 103; 6x = 54; 
x = 9. Pick Choice (C).
 
232. B. First, set up an equation to figure out how many total miles Tyler planned to drive that 
day: 0.2x = 80; x = 400 total miles. You’re not finished, so don’t pick Choice (C). Tyler drove 
80 miles of the 400, which means the number of miles he has left to drive to reach his 
planned total miles is 400 – 80, or 320, which is Choice (B).
 
233. B. A multiple of 50 must end in a zero; the only answer that ends in zero is 250, Choice (B).
 
234. D. Because the angles in a right triangle total 180°, and one angle is 90°, the sum of the 
remaining two acute angles must be 90°. Set up an equation given the ratio of the unknown 
angles: 5x +1x = 90; 6x = 90; x = 15. The smaller angle is 15°, but the question asks for the 
larger angle. Multiply 15 by 5. The larger angle is 75°, Choice (D).
 
235. A. Solve for P: P% × 80 = 4; P% = 4⁄80; P% = 0.05; P% = 5.
 
236. B. Add the numbers, making sure you line up the decimal points: 0.897 + 0.0092 + 5.7 = 
6.6062, Choice (B).
 
237. C. Subtract 5 from both sides: 4x = 44; x = 11, Choice (C). Not too shabby!
 
238. A. For fractions, the word divide means multiply by the reciprocal: 4⁄5 ÷ 5⁄6 = 4⁄5 × 6⁄5, which is 
24⁄25 — Choice (A).

239. C. Choice (C) has a verb tense error. Stays is present tense, and got is past tense. The verbs 
should both be past or both be present, but not one of each.
 
240. B. In Choice (B), the pronoun I is the object of the preposition for, which means it should 
be in objective form rather than subjective form: . . . for my brother and me. If you elimi-
nate my brother from the sentence, the correct form is obvious: My mom bought a new 
hamster for me.
 
241. D. The sentences in this question are all properly constructed, punctuated, and capital-
ized; pick Choice (D).
 
242. B. Choice (B) contains a word usage error. Affect is a verb, not a noun. The wording should 
be that the plan had no effect on the budget.
 
243. C. Choice (C) uses accept to mean except. It closes every night except Sunday.
 
244. C. To in Choice (C) is supposed to mean more than enough. The proper form is too, as in 
there were too many dogs.
 
245. A. Choice (A) lacks punctuation in its sequence. There should be two commas: tennis, 
track, and wrestling.
 
246. A. The first word in Choice (A) uses a possessive form for a plural noun. The apostrophe is 
incorrect. The sentence should say that “monkeys are fun to watch.”

290
Part IV: Practice Makes Perfect 
 
247. C. Choice (C) is a question. The proper ending punctuation for questions is a question 
mark, not an exclamation point.
 
248. D. These sentences are great just the way they’re written; opt for Choice (D).
 
249. D. All is well in these sentences. The pronoun us in Choice (C) is proper. It’s used as an 
object, and the objective form is right: They invited us. Pick Choice (D).
 
250. A. Choice (A) has a subject-verb agreement error. Its subject is number, and number is sin-
gular. The verb have increased is plural. The proper wording is “the number has 
increased.”
 
251. C. The complete title of the contest in Choice (C) should be capitalized: Greater Denver 
Area Spelling Bee.
 
252. B. The two descriptive adjectives (lovely and talented) that precede young lady in 
Choice (B) should be separated by a comma, as in “lovely, talented young lady.”
 
253. B. In Choice (B), the claws belong to the cats, which means you must use the possessive 
form of they (their) before claws.
 
254. C. One and won sound alike, but they mean very different things. The recipe in Choice (C) 
should have won first place.
 
255. A. Grandma in Choice (A) should be capitalized because it’s used as a proper name.
 
256. C. In Choice (C), uncle isn’t used as a name, which means it should be lowercase.
 
257. D. The sentences in these answers are fine as written; go with Choice (D).
 
258. C. The office in Choice (C) belongs to the one governor, which means governors needs an 
apostrophe to be in the possessive form (as in governor’s).
 
259. B. Could of in Choice (B) is never proper. The verb form is could have.
 
260. A. Because Naomi’s note-taking occurred yesterday, the verb in Choice (A) should be in 
the past tense: Naomi took notes yesterday.
 
261. D. The sentences are fine as is. The use of were in Choice (A) is okay because it’s con-
tained in an if-clause that conveys an idea that’s contrary to fact. There’s no comma 
between talented and lacrosse in Choice (C) because talented describes lacrosse player, not 
just player alone.
 
262. A. The colon in Choice (A) incorrectly separates the verb are from the rest of the sentence. 
The clause before the colon should be a complete sentence, something like “I like 
Cleveland for three reasons: it has the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, . . .”
 
263. B. Choice (B) is an incomplete sentence. It’s a dependent clause and needs to include 
another idea in order to form a complete thought. For instance, “We are cold because it’s 
snowing outside.”
 
264. D. The sentences in this question are constructed properly. Choice (D)’s the winner!
 
265. D. All three sentences are error free; select Choice (D).
 
266. A. The subject of Choice (A) is sustaining, which is singular. The verb have decreased is 
plural. It should be changed to has decreased.
 
267. C. Days of the week, including Sunday, are always capitalized. Choice (C) contains the 
problem.
 
268. C. The home in Choice (C) belongs to Mark and Mindy, which means you use the posses-
sive form of they. It’s their home. They’re is a contraction of they are.
 
269. C. Women is a plural noun that’s formed without an ending s. To properly form the posses-
sive of women in Choice (C), you’d add ’s to get women’s.
 
270. D. There are no problems with the sentences in this question. Pick Choice (D).

291
 Chapter 20: Answers to HSPT Practice Test 2
 
271. B. Dissidents is the subject of the sentence in Choice (B) and, therefore, shouldn’t be in 
possessive form.
 
272. C. “Her and I” is the subject of the sentence in Choice (C). So, both pronouns should be in 
the subjective form: She and I ride the bus. . . .
 
273. C. Contrary to what Choice (C) thinks, the construction its’ never appears in the English 
language. The way to express it is as a contraction is it’s.
 
274. D. The usage, punctuation, and construction are proper in these sentences. The pronoun 
me in Choice (C) is a direct object, which means the objective form is correct.
 
275. A. The proper way to express the possessive in Choice (A) is “the novels of Charles 
Dickens.” The apostrophe after Dickens is unnecessary and incorrect.
 
276. B. The colon in Choice (B) is used improperly and should be eliminated.
 
277. C. The subject of the sentence in Choice (C), each, is singular and should have a singular 
verb. Have visited is plural and should be changed to has visited.
 
278. B. Choice (B) has no verb and is therefore an incomplete sentence. Simply adding were 
before flying fixes the problem.
 
279. C. In Choice (C), the word separate should be spelled with an a in the second syllable 
rather than an e.
 
280. D. None of these sentences contains a misspelled word; select Choice (D).
 
281. A. In Choice (A), relevant should be spelled with an a in the last syllable.
 
282. A. Choice (A) incorrectly spells courtesy without a u.
 
283. B. The last word of Choice (B) has temper in it; it’s spelled temperatures.
 
284. C. In Choice (C), conscious should be spelled with an s after the n.
 
285. D. Hygiene, dominant, offense, exaggerate, and accomplishments are all spelled correctly. 
Pick Choice (D).
 
286. B. Strangely enough, sacrilegious in Choice (B) doesn’t have the word religious in it.
 
287. D. All the words in this question are spelled correctly. Choice (D) it is!
 
288. C. In Choice (C), prevalent should have an a in the second syllable rather than an e.
 
289. C. This sentence has a beginning phrase; choose an answer that clearly demonstrates that 
he is the one sitting down to write. Eliminate Choices (A) and (B) because they say that 
“clearing and outlining” are sitting down to write, and they use passive voice. Choice (D) 
lacks parallel construction and just sounds really weird. Choice (C) is the best answer.
 
290. B. Pick the transition word that makes the most sense. The second clause conveys a con-
trasting idea, and the answer that shows contrast is Choice (B). Choice (C) changes the 
meaning of the sentence, and Choice (A) incorrectly conveys a cause-and-effect relation-
ship between the two ideas in the sentence.
 
291. D. The choice that expresses the idea using parallel construction is Choice (D). Choices (A) 
and (B) lack parallel construction, and Choice (C) uses improper comparison language. 
More better is redundant; it should simply be better.
 
292. A. The clearest answer is Choice (A). The other choices use passive rather than active 
voice or employ awkward sentence construction.
 
293. B. The topic sentence describes how a black hole is created. Pick sentences that continue 
this idea. Choice (A) is about astronomy and is too general for the topic. Choices (C) 
and (D) discuss unrelated topics. The best answer is Choice (B) because it builds on the 
information in the topic sentence.

292
Part IV: Practice Makes Perfect 
 
294. C. The only answer that says that the people in the courtroom heard the verdict is 
Choice (C). Choices (A) and (B) have shouting hearing the verdict, and Choice (D) implies 
that began heard the verdict.
 
295. A. Choice (B) doesn’t make clear who she is. Choices (C) and (D) are awkward and use too 
many words to convey simple ideas. The clearest sentence is Choice (A).
 
296. C. The paragraph is about military customs and courtesies. That the Air Force and Navy 
are part of the military is irrelevant to the purpose of the paragraph. Therefore, Sentence 
3, Choice (C), doesn’t belong. All the other sentences supply information about the topic.
 
297. D. Choice (A) would be good for introducing an essay on the country of Panama but not 
for a piece on the Panama Canal. Choice (B) about ships is far too broad to relate to the 
Panama Canal. Both Choices (C) and (D) discuss the Panama Canal, but Choice (C) just 
describes it. Because Choice (D) provides information about the canal’s history, it’s the 
best answer.
 
298. C. Choice (C) states the idea in the clearest way. In simple terms, it describes what he did 
and why. The beginning phrase in Choice (A) doesn’t properly describe the subject of the 
sentence, which is he. Choice (B) separates prepositional phrases from the verbs they 
describe, and Choice (D) is wordy and awkward.

TACHS Practice Test 1
H
ere’s a chance to show what you know! The following practice test features the kinds 
of reading, language, math, and ability questions you can expect to find on the 
TACHS. Completing all the questions takes about two hours with breaks.
 This test is very similar to the real TACHS, but the test-makers always have the option of 
changing the test slightly, so the one you take could have a different number of questions, 
different time limits, or even slightly different question formats.
To make the most of this practice test, make your practice time as similar to real test condi-
tions as possible by doing the following:
 
✓ Find a place where you won’t be distracted (preferably as far as possible from your 
neighbor’s drum practice).
 
✓ Try to take this test at approximately the same time of day your actual TACHS test is 
scheduled (probably early morning).
 
✓ Rip out the answer sheet and mark your answers on it by filling in the appropriate 
 bubbles.
 
✓ Use the margins of the test pages to scribble down notes and calculations, unless of 
course a particular question wants you to estimate the answer.
 
✓ Use a timer to time each section. When your time is up, stop answering questions in 
that section and move on. If you finish a section early, go back and check your work, 
but don’t work ahead.
 
✓ Give yourself a short break between each of the sections. On test day, you’ll probably 
receive at least one 10- to 15-minute break midway into the exam.
When you’re finished with this practice test, go ahead and check your answers by flipping 
to Chapter 22. It features answer explanations to help you identify why right answers are 
right and wrong answers are wrong so you can understand the strategy for answering each 
question type when you take your exam.

The present level of sugar consumption in America is a historically new phenomenon 
that rivals the increasing rise in drug dependency in our society. In 1821, Americans annu-
ally consumed an average of 10 pounds of sugar per person. In the years since then, annual 
per person sugar consumption has risen at least thirteen-fold, reaching 126 pounds in 2006, 
the last full year for which data is available. In fact, the 2006 figure reveals an increase of 13 
percent just since 1990, when the corresponding figure was 111.2 pounds. The Department 
of Agriculture’s estimate for 2009 was that annual per capita consumption of sugar rose 
another 2 pounds since 2006 to a new high of 128.1 pounds. At this rate, Americans pres-
ently consume in excess of 130 pounds of sugar per person annually.
 
These figures may sound implausible to anyone who still thinks of sugar as a commodity 
that is bought in bags at the grocery store and then added to foods in one’s own home. As 
recently as 1920, 65 percent of the sugar used in this country was consumed in that fashion. 
But by 1976, only 24 percent of the sugar consumed in the country was sold for home use. 
Over 70 percent of it went into manufactured or processed foods and beverages. Added 
sugar now appears in a wide range of foods not commonly thought of as being sweet or 
sweetened, such as bouillon cubes, frozen vegetables, and bologna.

(J) Judges should always reverse the deci-

(K) Judges have more power than juries do.
 
(L) Juries have the power to reverse a

 15. Which of the following is not a judicial tool 
that the author says judges use to change 
jury decisions?
 
(A) remittitur
 
(B) additur
 
(C) omnipotence
 
(D) motion for judgment notwithstanding 
the verdict
 16. The author’s purpose in writing this 
 passage is to
 
(J) thoroughly explain the elements of the 
American jury system
 
(K) confirm that the American jury system 
is the fairest system in the world
 
(L) prove that the jury system should be 
abolished
 
(M) show that judges have the power to 
overturn decisions made by juries
Questions 15–18 pertain to the following passage.
 
Persons accused of crimes have an absolute right to be tried by a jury of their peers, 
and parties to a civil lawsuit may choose to have their cases decided by a jury. In the end, 
though, it’s the judge who decides the fate of the accused and the verdict in a civil dispute. 
Judges have numerous tools at their disposal to reverse the decisions of juries.
 
To begin with, in most states, the jury’s decision to convict someone of a crime must be 
unanimous. If the jury has reasonable doubt to believe that the accused committed the 
crime, then the jury must acquit, which means it finds the accused not guilty of the alleged 
charges. But no matter what the jury’s decision, the judge can overrule the verdict by grant-
ing the losing party’s motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict, which essentially 
throws out the jury’s decision. Or the judge can exercise discretion in giving out a sentence.
 
The judge’s omnipotence rules in civil cases, too. The judge can decide that a jury’s 
award to a plaintiff is either too high or too low and decrease it by granting the defendant’s 
motion for remittitur or increase it by granting the plaintiff’s motion for additur.

To white rest, and a place of rest
Invisible at dawn,
And yet with neither love nor hate,
Those stars like some snow-white
Minerva’s snow-white marble eyes
Without the gift of sight.

farming and industry
 
(C) recognized the need for new and more 
complex manufacturing procedures
 
(D) taught other slaves skills to give them 
greater freedom
Questions 22–26 pertain to the following passage.
 
One important facet of colonial America’s early development was the role played by 
slave artisans from Africa. Slave art rose from slavery as a skilled handicraft, an art that 
descended from African imagery and later became a functional aesthetic in the form of 
wrought-iron balconies in New Orleans and magnificent ornamentation on the mansions of 
Charleston, South Carolina. Although they received little credit for their labor, slave arti-
sans accomplished necessary work in preindustrial America and became one of the first 
classes of technical experts in the New World.
 
Afro-American arts and crafts originated on the west coast of Africa. Many Africans were 
master artisans, demonstrating various skills and great proficiency in the fashioning of 
ivory, wood, and bone in weaving, pottery making, and the creation of clothes, tools, and 
other implements. There is also strong evidence that some African groups were skilled in 
the building trades, while others proved skillful in developing exquisite sculptured objects 
of bronze through new casting techniques.
 
As producers of goods, contributors to the building trades, manufacturers of furniture, 
and designers of household objects and décor, slave artisans also aided America in its aes-
thetic development. Their creativity and cleverness laid the foundation for furthering the 
development of the African American artist.

 passage most nearly means
Questions 27–30 pertain to the following passage.
 
It’s seven in the morning, and I reach over to hit the snooze button on my alarm clock for 
the last time. Climbing out of bed, I turn on the TV to see that an early episode of a popular 
sitcom is on. I doodle around and put myself together while periodically glancing at the TV 
and laughing. On the elevator, I make small talk with some of my friends who live on the 
floor above. Getting on the bus, I sit next to the girl from my Spanish class, and we talk 
about our weekend. When I finally get to class, the teacher starts to lecture . . . another 
boring Monday. This seems like a normal Monday morning, right? For a blue-eyed white girl 
like me, it is. At no point in the morning do I notice that all the main characters in the popu-
lar sitcom are white. I never feel out of place on the elevator because everyone I come in 
contact with looks like me. I do not think twice about talking to my friend from class on the 
bus because I am afraid of her judging me. My teacher does not intimidate me because of 
his skin color. These are just some examples of white privilege that I experience living in 
America, and it is not yet eight in the morning.

Answers to TACHS Practice Test 1
You may have finished taking TACHS Practice Test 1 in Chapter 21, but you’re not done 
yet. Now it’s time to review your answers. Read through all the explanations contained 
in this chapter, even the ones for the questions you answered correctly. You may just find 
enlightening information that’ll help you answer similar questions on the real TACHS. (Note: 
If you don’t have the time to read the answer explanations, check your work using the 
abbreviated answer key found at the end of this chapter.)
Reading Section
 
1. D. You probably know that dejected means “sad or down,” so look for words that mean the 
same thing. You can eliminate Choice (C) right away because having an awkward spirit just 
doesn’t make sense. Supportive and cheerful are positive words, so cross out Choices (A) 
and (B). The best answer is Choice (D); gloomy means “down in the dumps.”
 
2. L. You may not know that onerous means “difficult,” and it isn’t a word that’s easily broken 
down. You do have at least one clue, though. Onerous is paired with task, so you can prob-
ably eliminate Choice (J), effortless. Tasks aren’t likely to be effortless. Arduous also means 
“difficult,” so Choice (L) is the best answer.
 
3. A. Eliminate Choices (B) and (C) because it doesn’t make sense to console or communi-
cate about a problem. To brood is to dwell on or worry. To fret also means “to worry,” so 
the best answer is Choice (A).
 
4. J. When you aspire toward something, you hope to achieve it. Aspirations are hopes, so 
the answer is Choice (J). Choice (M) is more opposite in meaning than similar. Choice (K), 
ascents, means “climb or rise,” and views, Choice (L), doesn’t relate to hopes at all.
 
5. C. A big clue to this one is that Choice (C) has the same root, heart, as the given word. The 
suffix -y means “full of.” Whole also means full or complete, so you can deduce that heartily 
and wholeheartedly have similar meanings; they both mean to do something with a full 
heart. Softly and angrily don’t have anything to do with heart (except that getting angry too 
often may harm your heart!), and there’s nothing in sympathy to convey fullness of heart.
 
6. J. A reckless driver drives irresponsibly. The correct answer is Choice (J). Although reck-
less driving may be exciting for some, being reckless doesn’t necessarily mean being excit-
ing; Choice (K) is wrong. Choices (L) and (M) have opposite meanings, so they’re not right 
either.
 
7. C. Someone who squanders money wastes it, so Choice (C) is the correct answer. 
Choices (A) and (B) are opposites, and Choice (D) is pretty irrelevant.
 
8. M. If you’ve ever studied Spanish, you may recognize the root ami in the words amor, which 
translates to love, and amigo, which translates to friend. So an amicable agreement would be 
a positive or friendly one, Choice (M). The other choices don’t convey love or friendship.
 
9. B. To foresee literally means “to see something before it happens.” If you see that some-
thing is going to happen, you anticipate it. Choice (B) is the best answer. The other answer 
choices don’t relate to seeing, so they can’t be correct.

326
Part IV: Practice Makes Perfect 
 
10 L. Serenity means “peacefulness or calmness,” and so does tranquility. Choice (L) is there-
fore the best answer. The other choices don’t have anything to do with peace or calm, so 
you can have the serenity of mind to eliminate Choices (J), (K), and (M).
 
11. C. The first sentence of the passage tells you that the main point is that sugar consump-
tion has risen greatly in the last several years. Choice (C) conveys that message best. The 
information in Choices (A) and (D) is covered only in the last paragraph, and Choice (B)’s 
point is found only in the first paragraph.
 
 The answers to main-point questions should include information covered in most of the 
passage, not just one part of it.
 
12. K. The answer to this details question comes from the second paragraph. In 1920, 65 percent 
of sugar was consumed from home use (not processed foods). In 1976, only 24 percent of 
sugar was consumed from home use. Because home use consumption decreased, sugar con-
sumption from processed foods must have risen a bunch (from 35 percent to more than 70 
percent), which is the answer in Choice (K). Choices (J) and (L) present exaggerations that 
aren’t stated in the passage, and Choice (M) contradicts the passage, which says that sugar 
is present in foods that don’t taste sweet.
 
13. A. You know Choice (A) is the answer because the author uses both per capita and per 
person in the same way throughout the passage. Nothing in the passage talks about how 
much sugar each country or state capital consumes. And if Choice (D) were correct, 
the second-to-last sentence of the first paragraph would be silly and repetitive. It’d read, 
“. . . the annual consumption per year. . . .”
 
14. M. Well, the author definitely isn’t positive about rising sugar consumption, so you can 
eliminate Choices (J) and (L). In the first sentence, the author compares the rise in sugar 
consumption to the rise in drug dependency, which tells you that the author is concerned 
and not indifferent about increased sugar consumption, so Choice (M) is the best answer.
 
15. C. The passage says that the judge’s omnipotence (exclusive power) rules in civil cases, but 
omnipotence isn’t an actual judicial tool, so Choice (C) is the answer. All the other answer 
choices are actual tools (or ways) that the passage says a judge can use to change decisions.
 
16. M. Although the author explains one aspect of the jury system, he or she doesn’t give a 
thorough explanation, so Choice (J) is wrong. Choices (K) and (L) exaggerate with phrases 
such as “fairest system in the world” and words such as abolished. Choice (M) expresses 
the author’s purpose the best without resorting to exaggeration.
 
17. A. The correct answer is right there in the first sentence of the passage, which says that 
persons accused of crimes have an absolute right to a jury trial, Choice (A). Choice (B) 
contradicts this statement, and Choices (C) and (D) deal with elements of a civil trial 
rather than a criminal trial.
 
18. K. The author doesn’t seem too pleased with the power judges have to change jury deci-
sions, so Choices (J) and (M) are out. The passage doesn’t talk about whether juries can 
change judges’ decisions, so Choice (L)’s no good. The best answer is Choice (K).
 
19. A. First off, the poem doesn’t even mention people, so you can cut Choice (D) right away. 
Also, the poem only brings up trees to let you know what the snow shapes look like, which 
means Choice (C) can’t be right either. Now you have to decide whether they in the first 
line refers to stars or snowflakes. The poem doesn’t mention snowflakes, but it does talk 
about stars in the third stanza and refers to them as those stars. This language indicates 
that the author has alluded to stars before the third stanza, probably in the first line where 
he talks about they. Another clue is the poem’s title, “Stars,” which means it’s all about the 
twinkling lights. Pick Choice (A).
 
20. K. A simile tells you what something is like. Check out the third stanza. It tells you that 
stars are like something, and the only answers that compare stars to something else are 
Choices (K) and (M). The poem says that stars are like “some snow-white Minerva’s snow-
white marble eyes.” When you cut through all of those adjectives, you discover that stars 

327
 Chapter 22: Answers to TACHS Practice Test 1
are like eyes (rather than snow). “Without the gift of sight” tells you the eyes don’t see. So, 
stars are like eyes that can’t see, Choice (K).
 
21. B. Rhyming schemes usually involve the last word of each line, so focus on the last words. 
Snow and blow rhyme in the first stanza, on and dawn rhyme in the second, and sight and 
white rhyme in the last. The last words of the second and fourth lines of each stanza defi-
nitely rhyme, so you may be tempted to pick Choice (C). But watch out for the debatable 
word only. Is this really the only rhyming pattern in the poem? Look at the last words of the 
first lines of each stanza. Congregate, fate, and hate also rhyme, which means Choice (C) is 
wrong because the poem has two rhyming patterns, and Choice (A) is wrong because the 
last words of the first and third lines of each stanza don’t rhyme. Choice (D) is wrong too 
because the poem definitely has some sort of rhyming scheme. Choice (B) is your best bet 
because it mentions a correct rhyming scheme, but it doesn’t tell you that it’s the only one.
 
22. K. From the first sentence of the passage, you know that the topic is the role slave artisans 
played in colonial America. Choice (K) expresses this idea best. Choices (L) and (M) are 
obviously wrong because the passage isn’t primarily about African art. Also, the passage 
states that slaves did indeed express their creativity, so Choice (J) is incorrect.
 
23. A. The last sentence of the first paragraph states that “slave artisans accomplished neces-
sary work in preindustrial America.” Choice (A) paraphrases this statement, so it’s the 
best answer. The passage doesn’t talk about farming, complex manufacturing processes, 
or slaves teaching other slaves, so Choices (B), (C), and (D) are out.
 
24. J. The first paragraph mentions that slave artisans created wrought-iron balconies, so the 
best answer is Choice (J). Choices (K), (L), and (M) all describe work done by African art-
ists rather than slave artisans.
 
25. D. The passage states in the first paragraph that the artisans received little credit for their 
labor, so you can eliminate Choices (A) and (B), which imply that slave artisans received 
respect and reward for their efforts. The passage suggests that artisans manufactured fur-
niture, but it doesn’t say that manufactured goods were their primary products; Choice (C) 
is wrong. The best answer is Choice (D).
 
26. K. The first sentence of the second paragraph states that American slave crafts originated 
on the west coast of Africa, which is the answer in Choice (K). It doesn’t mention mansion 
builders or colonial aristocrats, so Choices (J) and (M) don’t work. Modern African 
Americans can’t really influence those who came before them, so Choice (L) is also out.
 
27. D. The concluding sentence explains that the passage contains examples of white privi-
lege, so the passage is probably about white privilege. Consequently, the answer that best 
states the author’s purpose is Choice (D). All the other choices mention specific parts of 
the passage but not the overall point.
 
 The main point or objective of a reading comprehension passage usually appears in its 
first or last few sentences.
 
28. K. The author says she rides the bus with a fellow student and then goes to class, so you 
can reasonably assume she rides the bus to class, Choice (K). The author says she has 
blue eyes but doesn’t mention her hair color, so Choice (M) is wrong. Also, the author 
gives no indication that she was late for the bus, and the concluding sentence shows that 
she’s aware of her privileges, so Choices (J) and (L) are incorrect as well.
 
29. B. To answer this question, just substitute the answer choices for intimidate in the passage 
and see which one makes the most sense. Indulge and analyze don’t bear out the meaning 
of the sentence, and banish is too strong a word for the subject. The best answer is 
Choice (B): My teacher does not frighten me because of his skin color.
 
30. J. Because the passage is written in the first person and has a casual tone, it isn’t likely 
an article in a professional trade magazine; eliminate Choice (K). The message definitely 
doesn’t address the author’s qualifications for employment, so cross out Choice (M). 
The subject matter isn’t quite what you’d expect in a letter from a friend, so forget about 
Choice (L). The best answer is Choice (J); the passage is likely part of a class assignment.

328
Part IV: Practice Makes Perfect 
Language Section
 
1. C. The error is in the third part, Choice (C). This sentence has two pronouns, the singular 
it and the plural their. Both rename “human resources department,” which is a singular 
noun because there’s only one department. You need to use the singular pronoun it to 
refer to the singular noun department. Choice (C) should read “its new policy on employee 
uniforms.”
 
2. K. The problem in this sentence is a word-choice issue. Heavy is used as an adverb; it 
shows how the essay borrowed. But heavy is an adjective, not an adverb. The adverb form 
is heavily. So the second part of the sentence should be “borrowed heavily from.”
 
3. C. A descriptive series like the one in this sentence should maintain the same form for 
each element. Aggressively and emotionally are both properly stated as adverbs that show 
how the team played. Reckless is an adjective; the part of speech is wrong, and the series 
lacks parallel structure. Reckless should be recklessly in Choice (C).
 
4. M. No problems here. The verb tenses are just fine. The present tense is used for now, the 
past tense for back in June, and the past perfect for showing an action that happened 
before another in the past (summer had begun before). Pick Choice (M).
 
5. A. Choice (A) uses improper language. Use between for two entities and among for three or 
more. So Jane actually chooses among four items, not between them.
 
6. K. There’s a subject-verb agreement problem in this sentence. Look at the second part. 
The cost of staples does (not do) escalate. Cost is a singular subject that needs a singular 
verb. Choice (K) should read “so does the cost of basic staples.”
 
7. A. Did you recognize the repetitive language in this sentence? It’s kind of tricky to spot. A 
biography, by definition, is a story of one’s life. So saying “biography of the life” is redun-
dant. The phrase “of the life” should be eliminated from Choice (A).
 
8. L. Which refers to people in this sentence, specifically the people who are unemployed. 
You use who to refer to people, not which. Choice (L) should read “who are unemployed.”
 
9. B. You probably noticed the word-choice error in Choice (B). Leon wouldn’t want to be 
excepted at his college choices. After all, to except is to exclude! Leon would hope to be 
accepted instead.
 
10. M. Here’s another question that’s perfectly fine as is. Pick Choice (M) and move on.
 
11. A. You only capitalize family relationships when you use them like a proper name. So 
you’d capitalize Uncle Jack because Uncle is part of your uncle’s name. When you simply 
refer to the relationship, like “my uncle is the” in Choice (A), you don’t capitalize it.
 
12. K. University in Choice (K) is part of the proper name of Colgate University, so it must 
be capitalized. When you make a general reference to a university, you don’t capitalize 
the word.
 
13. D. Everything in this sentence is capitalized perfectly. The main words in a book title are 
capitalized just like they’re presented in this question. Go with Choice (D).
 
14. K. The only time you capitalize directions is when you use them as proper names for areas 
of the country. Choice (K) should be written as “travels east to New York to visit.”
 
15. C. Because the word river in Choice (C) is part of the name of Walden River, it should be 
capitalized. North is properly presented in lowercase because it’s a direction, not the name 
of a location.
 
16. J. Degrees and distinctions are capitalized, and MD stands for a medical degree. So 
Choice (J) should read “Percy Graves, MD, is.”

329
 Chapter 22: Answers to TACHS Practice Test 1
 
17. B. You always capitalize the first word of a quote that’s a full sentence. So, where in 
Choice (B) should really be Where.
 
18. M. This sentence is free of capitalization errors. Halloween is a properly capitalized holi-
day, and the family relationships here aren’t used as proper names, so they’re correctly 
placed in lowercase. The phrase pumpkin carols is a general description of a type of song 
and not an actual song title, so it shouldn’t be capitalized either.
 
19. B. Languages, like Spanish and English, are capitalized. Most other course names, like 
 history and philosophy, aren’t capitalized. Choice (B) has the error.
 
20. J. In this sentence, Timothy Mouse is the name of a character, so the name should be 
 completely capitalized in Choice (J).
 
21. D. This sentence is punctuated perfectly. The only punctuation present is the semicolon, 
which joins two independent clauses. It’s doing its job just fine!
 
22. K. Focus on the comma in Choice (K). You only use a comma to separate a dependent 
clause from the rest of the sentence when the dependent clause comes at the beginning. 
So the comma in this sentence is entirely unnecessary and should be eliminated.
 
23. B. This sentence has four punctuation marks. The commas in Choices (B) and (C) properly 
separate the items in a series, but Choice (B) also contains a colon that’s used incorrectly. 
You don’t have to fix the sentence for the test, but if you did make a change, you’d either 
eliminate the colon altogether or add something (like “and bought these items:”) to make a 
complete sentence before the colon.
 
 The words that lead up to a colon should be a complete sentence.
 
24. J. That period in Choice (J) creates a sentence fragment, and fragments just won’t do. “When 
Jacob comes home” contains a subject (Jacob) and a verb (comes), but it doesn’t express a 
complete thought because you don’t know what happens when Jacob comes home.
 
25. B. This sentence has no punctuation marks, which means you need to evaluate it to make 
sure nothing’s missing. The sentence contains the conjunction and, and the groups of 
words on either side of and are complete sentences (or independent clauses), which 
means you need a comma to separate them. Choice (B) should read “months, and now she 
is ready. . . .”
 
26. J. For example is an expression that isn’t necessary for the sentence to make sense, which 
means it should be set apart from the rest of the sentence with a comma before and after 
it. The second comma is there in Choice (K), but the first one between plan and for is miss-
ing in Choice (J).
 
27. C. This sentence has two punctuation problems, and both are contained in Choice (C). 
The abbreviation etc should end with a period and be enclosed in commas. That means 
Choice (C) should look like this: “etc., to get the poster to stick to the wall.”
 
28. L. The proper way to punctuate a complete date is to enclose the year in commas. You 
don’t use a comma to separate the month and day. Therefore, the date in Choice (L) 
should be punctuated like this: May 25, 2010. The comma in Choice (K) is proper because 
it separates two independent clauses joined by the conjunction but.
 
29. D. The commas in Choice (B) are placed correctly. They surround the nonrestrictive 
clause “which is on Third Street.” This clause provides additional info that isn’t essential 
to the meaning of the sentence, which is why you put commas before and after it.
 
30. K. A comma appears in Choice (J), but the problem is actually with the part of the sentence 
in Choice (K). When you list a city and a state name, you should set off the state name 
with commas. That means you need one comma after Iowa and one before it. If the part in 
Choice (K) were punctuated properly, it’d look like this: Iowa, was not included.
 
31. B. Ironically, the misspelled word in this sentence is mispelled in Choice (B). It should have 
two s’s.

330
Part IV: Practice Makes Perfect 
 
32. J. Calendar is spelled with a final a rather than e. 
 
33. C. To create the possessive form of it, you simply add an s without an apostrophe. It with 
an apostrophe s is the contraction of it is. So Choice (C) really says that the puppy was 
“chasing it is tail.” That just doesn’t make sense! The tail belongs to it, so the proper con-
struction of Choice (C) is “chasing its tail.”
 
34. J. Did this error slip past you? Greatful in Choice (J) should be spelled grateful. Choice (L) 
is just fine. Foreign is one of those words that’s an exception to the i-before-e rule.
 
35. C. Kernel in Choice (C) refers to a seed, like a kernel of corn. Because the sentence deals 
with soldiers, the correct spelling is colonel.
 
36. M. The proper spelling for the head administrator of a school is principal. (You can remem-
ber this fact by telling yourself that the principal of your school is your pal — even though 
you may not truly believe it.) Choice (M) is your answer because none of the words are 
misspelled.
 
37. A. Here’s another tricky one. The proper spelling of preceed is really precede, which means 
Choice (A) contains the misspelled word. In the word precede, the d precedes the e just 
like it does in the alphabet.
 
38. L. Choice (L) contains the classic violation of the i-before-e-except-after-c rule. Receive has 
a c before the long e sound, which must be followed by an e, not an i.
 
39. C. The error in this sentence may have been pretty obvious to you. Their is an exception to 
the i-before-e rule, and Choice (C) misspells it.
 
40. M. If you couldn’t find an error anywhere in this sentence, that’s because there isn’t one! 
Choice (M) is correct.
 
41. B. The underlined word in Sentence 1 is lawyers; because it’s preceded by a, you know the 
noun is singular. Therefore, that s on the end can’t mean the noun’s plural, so Choice (D) 
must be wrong. The noun must be possessive, and the proper construction of a singular 
possessive noun is ’s. Choice (A) is the possessive of a plural noun, so it’s wrong. 
Choice (B) is the proper construction.
 
42. L. Basically doesn’t add anything relevant to the sentence, so it doesn’t belong anywhere. 
Choice (L) is the best answer.
 
43. D. Sentence 5 simply provides another description of the painting. It doesn’t contradict the 
information that precedes it, so Choices (A) and (C) aren’t correct. There’s no cause-and-
effect relationship between Sentences 5 and 4, so Choice (B) is wrong too. Sentence 5 is 
fine the way it is; pick Choice (D).
 
44. K. This one’s tricky because the plural subject of the sentence (inhabitants) comes after 
the verb. Therefore, noticing that the singular verb hovers doesn’t match it is tough. Try 
rearranging the sentence: Inhabitants hover above the scene. Now you can tell that the 
verb form is wrong. It should be hover, not hovers.
 
45. A. You only put a comma before a conjunction if the words before and after the conjunction 
are complete sentences. The phrase “like Laurie, dreamed that I could join their club” isn’t a 
complete sentence, which means the comma after girls is unnecessary. “Like Laurie” is a non-
restrictive clause, so you need the comma before like and after Laurie. Choice (A) is correct.
 
46. K. Adverbs answer the questions “how,” “when,” “where,” and “why” in a sentence. 
Quickly, Choice (K), addresses how the author was swept, so it’s an adverb. (By the way, 
Choice (J) is a verb, Choice (L) is an adjective, and Choice (M) is a noun.)
 
47. B. The underlined part of the last sentence is phrased in passive voice, which is rarely the 
best option, and it pairs a plural subject (strength and importance) with a singular verb 
(is). Choice (C) corrects the subject-verb agreement issues but keeps the problem of pas-
sive voice. Choice (A) doesn’t correct either error. The best answer is Choice (B), which 
makes the underlined part active voice and doesn’t introduce a new error.

331
 Chapter 22: Answers to TACHS Practice Test 1
 
48. K. The subject of Sentence 4 (knowledge, insight, and judgment) is plural. Results is a 
 singular verb. The plural form is result, so Choice (K) is the problem word. Choice (J), 
 judgment, is spelled correctly, and there’s nothing wrong with the other two words.
 
49. A. Philosophers in Sentence 2 shouldn’t be capitalized because it’s not a proper name. 
None of the other sentences have words that are improperly capitalized, so the answer is 
Choice (A).
 
50. M. Sentence 5 is fine; go with Choice (M). The series is presented with parallel construc-
tion and is punctuated properly, so you can say bye-bye to Choices (J) and (K). Choice (L) 
is out because the sentence doesn’t contain a bunch of independent clauses running on 
and on without proper punctuation.
Math Section
 
1. A. A prime number has two and only two factors, itself and 1. The only even prime number 
is 2, so you can eliminate Choice (B) right away. The only prime number that ends with a 5 
is the number 5, so Choice (C) isn’t prime. Choice (D) can’t be prime because it has factors 
of 7 and 9. Choice (A) is the only answer divisible by only 1 and itself.
 
2. K. Dividing fractions is simple. You just invert the second fraction from 3⁄4 to 4⁄3 and multiply: 1⁄2 
× 4⁄3 = 4⁄6. To simplify, divide the numerator and denominator by 2: 4⁄6 = 2⁄3, which is Choice (K).
 
3. A. The answer will be a mixed number because 1.3 is greater than 1. You’d read 1.3 as “one 
and three tenths.” That means the whole number is 1 and the fraction is 3⁄10, as in Choice (A). 
If you picked Choice (B), you mistakenly figured that the 3 was in the hundredths place 
rather than the tenths place.
 
4. K. Each hat takes 6 pieces of cloth, so Bryan needs a total of 30 pieces of cloth to make 5 
hats (6 × 5 = 30). But Bryan already has 10 pieces of cloth, so you need to subtract what he 
already has to find out what he still needs: 30 − 10 = 20, Choice (K).
 
5. A. The least common denominator is the smallest number that each of the denominators 
(2, 8, and 4) divides evenly into in this problem. Find the multiples of the largest number, 
8, until you land on one that’s divisible by 2 and 4. Start with 8. Because both 2 and 4 go 
into 8, Choice (A) is the least common denominator. 2 and 4 go into 12, Choice (B), but 8 
doesn’t. Choices (C) and (D) are common denominators of all three fractions but not the 
smallest denominator possible.
 
6. M. A glance at the answer choices lets you know that you’re looking for the fraction that’s 
the same as 35%. Percent means per 100, so put the 35 over 100 and reduce: 35⁄100 = 7⁄20.
 
7. D. This word problem is a division problem. You can get 6 jerseys on a hanger, and there’s 
a total of 138 jerseys. Divide 138 by 6 to find out the number of hangers you need: 138 ÷ 6 = 
23, Choice (D).
 
8. L. 142 is the same thing as 14 × 14, which equals 196, Choice (L). If you picked Choice (J), 
you added instead of multiplying.
 
9. A. First, you need to figure out how much Joe earned without the tip: $60 − $10 is $50. $50 
was Joe’s total wage for the night. Joe worked 5 hours for $50, so divide $50 by 5 to get 
$10. Joe made $10 per hour, Choice (A). If you selected Choice (B), you forgot to subtract 
the tip.
 
10. L. List out all the factors for 14 and 21 and find the largest number that they have in 
common. The factors of 14 are 1, 2, 7, and 14; the factors of 21 are 1, 3, 7, and 21. You can 
eliminate Choices (J) and (K) immediately because neither goes into 14. The greatest 
common factor is 7, Choice (L).
 
 The greatest common factor of two whole numbers is the largest whole number that goes 
evenly into both numbers.

332

11. B. To change a fraction into a decimal, you divide the numerator by the dominator: 3 ÷ 8 = 
0.375, Choice (B). If you picked Choice (C), you incorrectly divided the denominator by the 
numerator.
 
12. J. Subtracting a negative number is easy. Change the negative to a positive and add: 1 + 6 = 7, 
which is Choice (J). If you picked Choice (M), you changed 6 to a positive but subtracted 
rather than added. Choice (L) results from ( −6 − 1), which is a totally different problem.
 
13. D. The normal route is longer than the shortcut, so you need to add 4.38 to the number of 
miles that the shortcut spans: 19.75 + 4.38 = 24.13 miles, which is Choice (D). If you sub-
tracted 4.38 instead of adding it, you got Choice (C).
 
14. L. To find Becca’s total allowance, you must calculate what number $10.50 is 20% of. The 
equation looks like this: n × 20% = $10.50. Divide both sides by 0.2 (which is the same as 
20%): n = $10.50 ÷ 0.2; n = $52.50, Choice (L). If you picked Choice (M), you added $10.50 
to $52.50; Choice (K) subtracts $10.50 from $52.50.
 
15. D. To solve this problem, you move the decimal point until it lands before the tenths place 
(3.5). Then you count the number of spaces you moved to determine the exponent (6). 
Because you moved to the right, the exponent is negative. To express the number in scien-
tific notation, show the new decimal number multiplied by 10 to the exponent, like this: 
3.5 × 10–6, which is the answer in Choice (D).
 
16. L. If one case costs $6.95 and the total price is $15.50, all you have to do is subtract the one 
case from the total price to find the price of the second case: $15.50 − 6.95 = $8.55, the 
answer in Choice (L). Choice (M) results from adding $6.95 to $15.50.
 
17. A. First, multiply $40 by 1⁄4 to see how much money Stacey puts into savings: 1⁄4 × $40 = $10. 
Then subtract the savings from the total amount of money she made: $40 – $10 = $30, 
Choice (A). If you added the savings instead of subtracting them, you wound up with 
Choice (D).
 
18. M. To determine the discount, multiply $85 by 40%: 0.4 × $85 = 34. Don’t pick Choice (J) 
yet, though; $34 is just the discount, not the new price. Subtract $34 from $85 to find the 
new price: $85 – $34 = $51, Choice (M).
 
19. C. Figure the total cost by multiplying the price per pound ($1.75) by the total weight (3.4): 
$1.75 × 3.4 = $5.95, Choice (C).
 
20. M. Amy worked problems for 4 hours (from 3 p.m. to 7 p.m.). To find the number of prob-
lems she worked per hour, divide the number of hours by the number of problems: 120 ÷ 4 = 
30, Choice (M). You got Choice (L) if you miscalculated the number of hours Amy worked.
 
21. C. You know from the chart that a full chicken burrito costs $6.25. Each extra ingredient 
costs $0.65 extra, so add two extra ingredients (guacamole and hot sauce) to the cost of 
the burrito: $0.65 + $0.65 + $6.25 = $7.55, Choice (C).
 
22. K. A half pork burrito costs $4.65. Add the queso dip, which costs $0.65, and you get a total 
cost of $5.30: $4.65 + $0.65 = $5.30. The answer is Choice (K).
 
23. A. The graph shows that Alan made $4,000 in sales and Diane made $3,000. Subtract to find 
out how much more Alan made: $4,000 – $3,000 = $1,000, Choice (A).
 
24. K. Use the legend to determine which line corresponds with which team. Analyze the 
lines to discover that Team 3 has more goals than Team 1 in all months except February, 
Choice (K).
 
25. D. Add up John and Jill’s percentages to find what percentage they’d win together: 14% + 
11% = 25%. To change the decimal to a fraction, use 25 as the numerator and 100 as the 
denominator: 25⁄100. Reduce the fraction by dividing the numerator and denominator by 25 to 
get 1⁄4, Choice (D). (If you combined Dan and Mike’s winnings, you got Choice (A).)
 
26. J. Examine the data to find a trend. You can eliminate Choice (M) because pie charts aren’t 
good for showing trends. The number of students with lower scores is small and slowly 

333
 Chapter 22: Answers to TACHS Practice Test 1
increases as scores increase to a peak in the 71–80 range. Then the numbers start drop-
ping off as scores get higher. Look for a chart that shows a steady increase to a peak and 
then a gradual decrease. The only option is Choice (J). Choices (K) and (L) show a series 
of peaks and valleys that aren’t justified by the data.
 
27. B. The legend tells you that the darkest area shows the figures for the 19+ age group. The 
black area for all high schools is on the top of each graph. Focus on only this section of the 
graph to answer the question. The two schools with the biggest dark sections are North 
and West, Choice (B). If you selected Choice (A), you focused on the wrong age group.
 
28. M. To find out how many more home runs Jennifer hit in November than October, find the 
value for November (8) and the value for October (which is 3 because the value falls 
directly between 2 and 4). Subtract the two values to get your answer: 8 − 3 = 5, Choice (M).
 
29. C. First, find the values of each mold on Day 6 and Day 8. Then subtract Day 6 from Day 8 
to see which mold grew the most. The chart gives you everything you need to accomplish 
this, so eliminate Choice (D) right off the bat. Mold A grew 2 cm (5 − 3), Mold B grew 
3 cm (8 − 5), and Mold C grew 4 cm (12 − 8). Obviously Mold C, Choice (C), grew the most.
 
30. K. Look at the first column on the chart, which represents the period from 1980–1989. The 
values for Stores C and B show you that Store C had 48 employees and Store B had 27 
during this time frame. Subtract the two values to find the difference: 48 – 27 = 21 employ-
ees, Choice (K). If you chose any other answer, you looked at the wrong column.
 
31. A. Determine which students have higher bars for the second test than they do for the 
first. The chart shows that Bob and Susie are the only two students who received higher 
scores on the second test, Choice (A).
 
32. K. To find the combined total revenue for Brockton and Carelton, add the values you see 
on the chart: $5 million + $4 million = $9 million. The chart shows that Appleton had $11 
million in revenue. Subtract to find the difference: $11 million − $9 million = $2 million, 
Choice (K).
 
33. B. Because you can’t use scratch paper on this part of the Math section, look at the answer 
choices to see what place you should round to. All the options are rounded to the hun-
dreds place. To round 561 to the hundreds place, look at the number to the right of the 
hundreds place, 6. Because 6 is greater than 5, you round the number in the hundreds 
place up one value and add zeros to get 600. The number to the right of the hundreds 
place in 420 is 2. 2 is less than 5, so round down to 400. Add 600 and 400 to get 1,000, 
Choice (B). If you chose any other answer, you rounded incorrectly.
 
34. K. Round 723 to a number you can divide in your head by 9 with no remainder. Thanks to that 
mean ol’ teacher who made you memorize multiplication tables, you know that 72 ÷ 9 = 8. 
Round 723 to 720; 9 goes into 720 80 times, so the answer is Choice (K).
 
35. C. Round each number to the nearest tens place. 31 rounds to 30 (because 1 < 5), 34 
becomes 30 (because 4 < 5), and 42 rounds to 40 (because 2 < 5). Add the rounded num-
bers together (30 + 30 + 40 = 100) to get Choice (C).
  For TACHS estimation questions, round the numbers before you perform the operation 
instead of rounding the final answer. The idea is to make the problem easy enough to do in 
your head, and it’s much easier to perform operations with rounded numbers.
 
36. J. The answer choices are whole numbers, so round the two numbers in the problem to 
the nearest whole number. 5.43 rounds to 5 because the number to the right of the decimal 
(4) is less than 5. 6.52 rounds up to 7 because the number to the right of the decimal (5) is 
5 or greater. Multiply the rounded whole numbers 5 and 7 to get 35, Choice (J). Rounding 
errors lead to picking either Choice (K) or Choice (L).
 
37. A. Round each number to the nearest thousands place. 26,828 rounds up to 27,000 (8 ≥ 5), 
and 20,420 becomes 20,000 (4 < 5). 27,000 – 20,000 = 7,000, Choice (A). Rounding errors, 
such as rounding up both numbers, gets you Choice (B).

334
Part IV: Practice Makes Perfect 
 
38. L. The tenths place is the number directly to the right of the decimal, which is the second 5 
in the number 5.543. The number to the right of the second 5 (4) is less than 5, so the 
number is properly rounded to 5.5. Choice (M) is incorrectly rounded to the ones place.
 
39. B. Round $12.38 to the nearest dollar without any cents. The number to the right of the 
decimal is 3, which is less than 5. $12.38 rounds to $12. $15 is already in whole dollars, so 
just subtract: $15 – $12 = $3, Choice (B). Incorrectly rounding $12.38 to $13 would result in 
Choice (A).
 
40. M. Look at the number directly to the right of the decimal to round each value to the near-
est dollar. $4.73 rounds up to $5 (7 ≥ 5), $3.43 rounds to $3 (4 < 5), and $5.34 rounds to $5 
(3 < 5). Add the new amounts together ($5 + $3 + $5 = $13) to get Choice (M). Choices (K) 
and (L) result from improper rounding.
 
41. A. First, round the numbers inside the parentheses to the hundreds place. 592 rounds up 
to 600 (9 ≥ 5), and 933 rounds to 900 (3 < 5). Add the rounded numbers: 600 + 900 = 1,500. 
Then divide by 30 to get Choice (A): 1,500 ÷ 30 = 50.
 
42. L. Round each number. 49 becomes 50 because 9 ≥ 5; 42 becomes 40 because 2 < 5. Now 
multiply the rounded numbers: 50 × 40 = 2,000 (to do this in your head, calculate 5 × 4 = 20 
and add two zeros). The answer is Choice (L).
 
43. B. The number to the right of the tenths place is 0, which means the number in the tenths 
place doesn’t change. Fill the rest of the decimal places with zeros and delete the numbers 
to the right of the tenths place. The answer is 35.0, Choice (B). Choice (A) is rounded to 
the hundredths place, and Choice (C) is incorrectly rounded up.
 
44. J. Start this problem by rounding each number to the nearest thousands place, which is 
the number directly to the right of the comma. 6,434 rounds to 6,000 because 4 < 5, and 
3,942 rounds up to 4,000 because 9 ≥ 5. Now subtract the rounded numbers to get the 
answer: 6,000 − 4,000 = 2,000. Choice (J) is your answer.
 
45. D. 7 goes into 35 evenly, and if you round 34,544 to the nearest thousand, you get 35,000 
because 5 ≥ 5. Divide 35,000 by 7 in your head by dividing 35 by 7 to get 5 and adding three 
zeros. The answer is Choice (D), 5,000.
 
46. M. The number in the hundredths place in this problem is 6, and the number to the right of 
the hundredths place is 6, which is greater than 5. This means the number is rounded up 
to 122.57, which is Choice (M). If you chose any other answer, you rounded to the wrong 
decimal place.
 
 The hundredths place is the second number to the right of the decimal point. Don’t confuse 
it with the hundreds place, which is three places to the left of the decimal point.
 
47. B. Round each number to the nearest whole number. 20.93 rounds up to 21 (9 ≥ 5), and 
4.43 rounds to 4 (4 < 5). Subtract the rounded numbers: 21 − 4 = 17, Choice (B).
 
48. L. The number in the hundreds place is 7. The number directly to the right of 7 is 0, which 
means the number is rounded to 3,700, Choice (L). The other answer choices are rounded 
to the wrong decimal place.
 
49. C. To solve this one, round each number to the nearest hundreds place. 222 rounds to 200 
because 2 < 5, and 253 rounds up to 300 because 5 ≥ 5. Multiply the two rounded numbers. 
To do that in your head, just take 2 × 3 to get 6 and add four zeros. Choice (C), 60,000, is 
correct.
 
50. J. First, round $7.74 to the nearest dollar. $7.74 rounds up to $8. Subtract this amount from 
$20 to get the answer: $20 − $8 = $12, Choice (J).

 Chapter 22: Answers to TACHS Practice Test 1
Ability Section
 
1. D. Each of the three given figures is two-dimensional and has four sides. The diamond in 
Choice (D) is the only two-dimensional figure with four sides.
 
2. J. Examine the given figures. They all have two lines, so you can cross out Choices (K), (L), 
and (N) because they don’t have two lines. The lines in Choice (M) cross, but the lines in 
the given figures are all parallel. Choice (J) is the best answer.
 
3. B. These weird-looking figures have something in common, but what? Start by counting the 
sides. Each figure has eight sides. Even though Choice (B) doesn’t look much like the given 
figures, it too has eight sides, so it’s the right answer. The other choices have neither eight 
sides nor another feature that’s like those of the given figures.
 
4. J. If this question seems tricky at first, focus on what makes the three figures similar. Each 
of the three figures has a curved portion, so eliminate answers that don’t contain a curve, 
specifically Choices (K) and (M). Each of the three figures also contains a right angle. 
Choices (L) and (N) don’t have right angles. Choice (J) has both a curved part and a right 
angle, so it’s the best answer.
 
5. C. The feature that all three figures share is a straight bottom line. Choices (A), (D), and 
(E) have straight lines on their tops, but they lack straight lines on their bottoms. All of 
these choices also contain an inner line, which isn’t a feature of the three figures in the 
question set. Choice (B) contains no straight lines at all, so it can’t be right. This leaves 
Choice (C) as the only answer with a straight line on its bottom.
 
6. N. Each given figure is 1⁄3 shaded. Choice (N) is the only figure with 1⁄3 shaded. Choices (K) 
and (L) are 1⁄2 shaded, Choice (M) is 1⁄8 shaded, and Choice (J) is 1⁄6 shaded.
 
7. A. The shading isn’t similar on the given figures, but the shape within a shape is. Each figure 
contains another shape that’s the same as the outside shape. Choice (C) has no shape within 
a shape, so it’s wrong. The remaining choices, except for Choice (A), have different shapes 
inside and outside.
 
8. L. The big triangle in the first set of figures becomes a smaller triangle that faces the other 
direction. To complete the analogy, find the smaller rounded-side figure that faces the 
opposite direction. Choices (J), (K), and (M) aren’t the right shape, and Choice (N) faces 
the wrong direction. Choice (L) is best.
 
9. B. The stretched rectangle becomes a smaller, nonstretched rectangle, so the stretched 
circle should become a smaller, nonstretched circle, like Choice (B).
 
10. M. The second figure halves the first and adds a triangle. Choice (M) also halves the figure 
and adds a triangle. None of the other choices follows the pattern.
 
11. E. The unshaded rectangle becomes a rectangle shaded with diagonal lines. The unshaded 
triangle should become a triangle shaded with diagonal lines. Choices (A), (C), and (D) 
aren’t the same shape, and Choice (B) shades the triangle with vertical lines.
 
12. K. The right triangle becomes a shaded right triangle with another right triangle inside, so 
you’re looking for a shaded circle with another circle inside. Only Choice (K) gives you this 
option. The other choices are the wrong shape or the wrong shading.
 
13. D. This tricky analogy gives you a figure with crossed lines and then relates it to the shape 
that those lines create at the bottom of the figure. The shape that the crossed lines create 
at the bottom of the third figure in the question appears to be an equilateral triangle that 
points up. The triangles in Choices (A) and (E) are positioned incorrectly, so the triangle 
you’re looking for is the one that points up — Choice (D).
 
14. K. The first square has two vertical lines; the second square has one horizontal line. To 
move from one to the other, you must eliminate a line and make the remaining line hori-
zontal. Find the answer that does the same for the circle with three vertical lines. Remove 
one line, leaving two, and make them horizontal, Choice (K).

336
Part IV: Practice Makes Perfect 
 
15. A. The number of holes in the correct answer will be twice the number of original holes if 
the paper is folded once. Therefore, the right answer will have only two holes; eliminate 
Choices (B) and (E). The hole is at the bottom and the fold is vertical, so when you open 
the paper, both holes will appear at the bottom, like in Choice (A).
 
16. J. You can cross out Choice (L) because the answer must have four holes. Notice that the 
paper is folded horizontally. When you unfold it, you’ll have a hole in the top-right corner 
and the bottom-right corner. Choice (J) is the only option with holes in both right corners.
 
17. C. Your answer must have four holes, so toss out Choices (D) and (E). There isn’t a hole in 
the corner of the folded paper, so Choices (A) and (B) can’t be right. Choice (C) is the best 
answer.
 
18. N. This paper is folded twice, so you end up with four times the number of holes (eight 
total). Choices (K), (L), and (M) don’t have eight holes. The difference between the two 
remaining choices is that Choice (N) has four holes in the middle of the unfolded page and 
Choice (J) has holes that line its right and left side. The hole in the lower-right corner of 
the original folded page would result in four center holes in the unfolded page, which is 
what you see in Choice (N).
 
19. E. The answer will have 12 holes (3 holes × 4 = 12). Only Choices (B) and (E) have 12 holes. 
Choice (B) has holes in the corners, though, and there are no corner holes in the folded 
paper. Choice (E) has to be right because its holes appear in the middle of the page.
 
20. L. The paper has one fold and five holes, so the answer must have ten holes. The only 
choice with ten holes is Choice (L). You can cross out all the other options.

TACHS Practice Test 2
T
he TACHS really isn’t so bad if you take the time to prepare. That’s why we include a 
second practice test that’s chock-full of the kinds of reading, language, math, and ability 
questions you can expect to see on the real TACHS test.
 This practice test is quite similar to the real TACHS, but the test-makers always have the 
option of changing the test slightly, so the one you take may have slightly different question 
formats, a different number of questions, and/or different time limits.
Completing this practice test takes about two hours, with a break. We suggest you make 
your practice time as similar to actual test conditions as possible by
 
✓ Setting yourself up somewhere you won’t be distracted (preferably as far as possible 
from your little brother who’s watching cartoons like they’re oxygen).
 
✓ Trying to take the practice test at approximately the same time of day as the time your 
TACHS is scheduled (that’s probably early morning).
 
✓ Removing the answer sheet from this chapter and marking your answers on it by filling 
in the appropriate bubbles.
 
✓ Writing notes and calculations on the test pages, except where you’re supposed to esti-
mate answers.
 
✓ Using a timer to time yourself on each section. Stop when time is up and move on — 
even if you’re not done yet. (You won’t get the luxury of finishing a section past the 
allotted time on test day.)
 
✓ Giving yourself a 10- to 15-minute break. On exam day, you’ll probably be given a quick 
break between the Language and Math sections.
After completing the practice test, mosey on over to Chapter 24 to check your answers.

Part 2
Time: 25 minutes
Directions: The following four passages ask questions that pertain to their respective content. 
Choose the best answer for each of the questions and mark it on the answer sheet.
Questions 11–15 pertain to the following passage.
 
Elizabeth awaited the gathering of her followers for the bimonthly get-together in her 
exclusive London Arms flat. Elizabeth, or “Liz” as her friends commonly called her, was 
awaiting her guests in the parlor, which she preferred to her master suite, and she hoped 
that each would bring a monetary gift to fill her dwindling campaign chest.
 
Her constituents were seemingly visiting for social reasons, but Liz had other intentions. 
Her popularity was waning, and her hold on the general electorate was loosening. Never 
before had she worried about elections, but now the climate had changed. How she wished 
that the peasants could vote! Only they realized the agony of having only a few thousand 
pounds with which to dine. The days of caviar, nectar, and roses may be all but over, and 
she dreaded the thought of having to trade her wealth for votes.
 
Once the session began in Liz’s glorious living chamber, the guests received some tea 
and crumpets — but without sugar. Sugar was too precious a commodity to serve to such a 
large group. Liz’s speech was condescending as she appealed for votes with the promise of 
reward in exchange. She aimed to maintain the status quo as long as that boosted her own 
power and pocketbook. Liz took pleasure in her presentation. As her captive audience 
looked on and their contributions increased, she bathed in the glory of the moment. If the 
election were held tomorrow, surely she would prevail.

 Chapter 23: TACHS Practice Test 2
 
One aspect of high school that freshmen find challenging and confusing is the abundance 
of facts they must sort through for each class. Incoming students are flooded with countless 
facts about history, psychology, biology, economics, and so on. Many students unquestion-
ably accept these facts to be true; others do not. The question becomes how a student 
determines whether information is true or not.
 
Determining truth is the goal of scientific research, which attempts to establish laws of 
cause and effect to help students predict and explain facts. Students usually depend on 
authority, instruction, and logic to establish facts. However, since each of these methods 
can lead to subjective or false conclusions, scientists have developed their own method for 
establishing facts called the scientific method. When applied correctly, the scientific 
method validates facts and attempts to establish a clear cause-and-effect relationship 
between events.
 
It is not always easy to find out the exact causes of events. The elements of establishing 
cause and effect include association, time priority, rationale, and nonspurious (or genuine) 
relationship. First, there must be an association, or relationship, between two variables. For 
instance, if there is no relationship between levels of education and crime, one cannot say 
that a lack of education causes one to commit a crime.
 
Time priority is also important. This means that if one event happens before another, 
there may be reason to deduce that the first event had something to do with the other one. 
For example, smoking may cause cancer because it happens before the cancer occurs.
 
Another factor to consider in establishing cause and effect is rationale. Rationale comes 
from observation and experimentation. One proposes a hypothesis that one event causes 
another and then sets up a series of measureable experiments to test the validity of the 
hypothesis.
 
Finally, the association between two events should not be able to be explained by 
another variable. If another variable is not responsible, one can say that the relationship 
between the cause and the effect is nonspurious, or genuine. This step is hard to accom-
plish because one cannot always control other variables well enough to determine whether 
they are part of the relationship or not.
Questions 16–20 pertain to the following passage.
 16. What method do students usually use if 
they do not use the scientific method?
 
(J) association
 
(K) time priority
 
(L) rationale
 
(M) logic
 17. The tone of the passage is
 
(A) objective
 
(B) disapproving
 
(C) aggressive
 
(D) depressing
 18. What is the test of a nonspurious 
 relationship?
 
(J) One event happens before another.
 
(K) There is no other variable that could 
cause the event.
 
(L) The relationship does not relate to 
 history or biology.
 
(M) One determines the relationship by 
relying on authority.

I get in my car and drive 70 mph down the interstate to “Lee’s Studio.” I get out of my car, 
walk to the garage, and open it. I already know the code. I open the front door and proceed 
to walk through the kitchen and down the stairs to the band room. I am greeted with warm 
hellos from my fellow band members. We chat for a while about our day. Then, about 15 
minutes later, we set up our instruments.
 
All I have to do is tune my drums by tightening the heads until I get the sound I want. 
While I involve myself in this task, Jake extracts his Shecter Red Sunburst from its case, 
plugs the custom-made cord into his Crate Amplifier, flips up the on switch, and proceeds 
to tune his guitar. Mark opens up his case and takes out his BC Rich bass and begins the 
tuning process. Meanwhile, Bryan removes his Les Paul guitar from its case and proceeds to 
add the sounds of his tuning to the mix. When we complete our warmup, the rest of us plug 
ourselves in and set up the microphones.
 
After a little discussion about the practice list, we decide to go with our favorites: 
“Impatient Love,” “Let’s Change the World,” and “Valentine’s Day.” Lately, we have been 
playing some of our newer material and practicing for our May 6th performance in front of 
three judges representing three different record labels, including Columbia Records! This 
opportunity presents us with a new level of commitment to our nightly practice session.

(A) large professional music studio in a 
downtown office building
 
(B) room in the basement of a private 
home

At the conclusion of the Seven Years’ War, England’s national debt doubled, and the need 
for new revenue became extremely important for maintaining England’s position as a world 
superpower. A statesman named George Greenville sought to solve this problem through 
taxation on American colonists. Greenville initially tested the success of taxation in 1764 by 
creating a bill that would increase English revenue through enforcement of customs duties. 
The revenue and success that came through this initial bill opened the door for Greenville’s 
next piece of legislation that would later be called the Sugar Act.
 
The Sugar Act was designed to lower the duty on foreign molasses to threepence while 
raising the penalties for smuggling. The Sugar Act accomplished Greenville’s goals of raising 
money for England, but the money raised was not enough. The most significant aspect of 
the Sugar Act is that reactions from American colonists raised questions about Britain’s 
right to tax America.
 
American colonists argued that taxation was a way of taking property without consent. 
Edmund S. Morgan claimed that whatever threatened the security of property threatened 
liberty. So, liberty was directly threatened by England’s decision to tax colonists without 
American representation in Parliament. The Connecticut Assembly came to the conclusion 
that Parliament’s authority in America was limited to legislation, and therefore Parliament 
had no right to tax the colonists.
Questions 26–30 pertain to the following passage.
 26. Who was George Greenville?
 
(J) an English politician
 
(K) an American colonist
 
(L) a British explorer
 
(M) a member of the Connecticut Assembly
 27. What motivated England to implement the 
Sugar Tax?
 
(A) It wanted to protest the creation of the 
Connecticut Assembly.
 
(B) It wanted to increase the smuggling of 
foreign molasses.
 
(C) It wanted to lower the national debt 
caused by the Seven Years’ War.
 
(D) It wanted America to become a world 
superpower.

 30. What conclusion did the Connecticut 
Assembly come to?
 
(J) Parliament did not have the right to tax 
American colonists.
 
(K) Parliament did not have the right to 
pass any legislation that would affect 
the American colonists.
 
(L) The American colonists had no choice 
but to declare war on England.
 
(M) The American colonists would no 
longer export molasses to England.
 28. According to the passage, what was 
the most important consequence of the 
Sugar Act?
 
(J) England raised sufficient funds to take 
care of the national debt.
 
(K) The French no longer exported 
 molasses.
 
(L) The American colonists questioned 
England’s right to tax them.
 
(M) America was given representation in

(C) The colonists thought the Act would 
secure their representation in

fees have gone up more than the rate of inflation 
for every year since 1982. (4)Throughout the past 
generation, tuition fees have risen faster than 
family incomes, a situation that is not maintain-
able on a long-term basis. (5)Federal financial 
assistance in higher education during this period 
has increased. (6)In the 1983–1984 school year, 
American college students received $28.4 billion 
in financial assistance from all sources. (7)Twenty 
years later, that aid had grown to $122 billion. 
(8)However, two-thirds of this was provided by 
the federal government.

Answers to TACHS Practice Test 2
G
et ready to dive into detailed answer explanations for every question featured on the 
second TACHS practice test (found in Chapter 23). Reading the explanations will help 
reinforce what you’ve discovered about answering TACHS questions and help you become 
even more familiar with how to approach the typical and not-so-typical question types. 
(Don’t have time for more reading? Head to the end of this chapter for a list of question 
numbers and answers — nothing more, nothing less.)
Reading Section
 
1. B. When you think of something dissolving, you may picture a sugary substance that melts 
in water. How does this picture relate to a partnership? Well, a melted partnership is one 
that breaks up, Choice (B). Choices (C) and (D) have more opposite meanings, and you 
can soften your skin, but you can’t soften a partnership.
 
2. J. Chasm isn’t easily broken down, so you really need to know that it means “a deep crack 
in the earth.” The word with the closest meaning to crack is Choice (J), gap. The other 
three choices don’t relate to characteristics of the earth, so cross them out.
 
3. C. A diplomat is an international negotiator; an ambassador, Choice (C), is also an international 
negotiator. Problem solved! Choices (A) and (B) don’t relate to negotiation. A nonentity, 
Choice (D), is a nobody, and there’s no such thing as an important nobody.
 
4. J. Resolution, Choice (J), actually has the word solution in it. Both words describe what 
happens when you solve a problem. Choice (K) is an opposite, and Choices (L) and (M) are 
completely unrelated.
 
5. D. You can break up eccentric into its prefix, ec-, which means “outside,” and root, cent, 
which relates to center. So, generally, you’re looking for an answer that means the same 
thing as being outside of the center. The best answer is Choice (D), unusual.
 
6. K. Augment means “to add to,” so the best answer is Choice (K), increase. Choice (M) is an 
opposite, and Choice (L), adjust, doesn’t tell you that the change in supply is an addition.
 
7. B. A somber mood is a serious or sad one. You wouldn’t describe a mood as boring, so elim-
inate Choice (A). Choice (C) is the opposite of somber. Finally, a mercurial mood is one 
that changes frequently; like mercury in a thermometer, it goes up and down. Eliminate 
Choice (D). The best answer is Choice (B), solemn, which also means “serious or sad.”
 
8. L. If you do something impromptu, you do it at the spur of the moment. Choice (L), spontaneous, 
also means “without a plan.” Impromptu has nothing to do with length of time, so eliminate 
Choices (K) and (M). Choice (J) is more of an antonym than a synonym.
 
9. D. Perhaps you don’t know what innocuous means, but you notice it sounds a little bit like 
innocent. The answer choice that’s most like innocent is Choice (D), harmless, which is a 
good synonym for innocuous. Choice (A) has the opposite meaning, and the other two 
choices aren’t related at all.

368
Part IV: Practice Makes Perfect 
 
10. M. A fleeting moment doesn’t last very long, so eliminate Choice (J). Choices (K) and (L) 
don’t have anything to do with length of time, so they aren’t right. The best answer is 
Choice (M), passing. A passing moment is there and gone quickly, just like a fleeting one.
 
11. B. The first paragraph of this passage tells you that Elizabeth is in her flat (the British 
name for an apartment). Later the passage comments on her “glorious living chamber.” 
These clues tell you that the passage most likely takes place in a luxury apartment, 
Choice (B). Nothing in the passage suggests any of the other choices are appropriate.
 
 When it comes to reading comprehension passages, always look for clues in the passages 
to answer the questions.
 
12. L. You know the author isn’t admiring because the passage describes Elizabeth as conde-
scending, so eliminate Choice (M). The author isn’t serious, Choice (J), or objective, 
Choice (K); he or she has a definite opinion about Elizabeth that’s presented in a sort of 
goofy way. The best answer is Choice (L); the author uses sarcasm in the second para-
graph when discussing how “Liz” relates to peasants because she can no longer afford 
caviar.
 
13. A. Find the answer to this question through the process of elimination. Elizabeth doesn’t 
have enough compassion to be a community volunteer, so Choice (D) is out. The passage 
doesn’t talk about employees, so she’s not a small business owner, Choice (C). Nor does it 
mention students, so cut Choice (B), a professor. Elizabeth is likely a politician, Choice (A).
 
14. K. The third paragraph says that sugar is a precious commodity, which means it’s either 
scarce or expensive, Choice (K). The passage doesn’t give you enough detail to choose any 
of the other answers.
 
15. D. You can eliminate Choice (C) right off the bat because the passage says that peasants 
can’t vote. Elizabeth isn’t really concerned about the needs of others, so Choice (A) can’t 
be right. And the passage says that sugar is precious but not more precious than caviar 
and roses. In every paragraph, the passage mentions that Elizabeth is either worried about 
losing her position of power or losing her money, Choice (D).
 
16. M. The second paragraph of the passage states that “students usually depend on author-
ity, instruction, and logic to establish facts.” Choice (M), logic, is the best answer. The 
other choices present elements of the scientific method.
 
17. A. The author of this passage states facts without emotion, which means the tone of the 
passage is objective, Choice (A). The other three choices convey strong emotion that isn’t 
present in the passage.
 
18. K. The passage talks about a nonspurious relationship in the last paragraph. The main 
point of the paragraph is that you have to show that no other variables caused a result to 
happen. This point is summarized in Choice (K).
 
19. A. The author discusses rationale in the second-to-last paragraph. In the second sentence 
of the paragraph, he or she states that “rationale comes from observation and experimen-
tation,” which is the exact wording of Choice (A).
 
20. K. The first sentence of the second paragraph clearly states that “determining truth is the 
goal of scientific research,” which is Choice (K).
 
21. B. Because the author describes entering through a garage and going down a flight of stairs, 
you can reasonably conclude that the studio is in the basement of a home, Choice (B). 
Nothing in the passage suggests that it’s in a professional building, automotive dealership, 
or restaurant.
 
22. M. In the second paragraph, Jake takes the Shecter Red Sunburst from a case. You don’t 
take a drum set out of a case, so Choice (K) is wrong. The author then describes Jake plug-
ging a cord into an amplifier, suggesting that the cord and amplifier are different from the 
Sunburst. Toss Choices (J) and (L). The Sunburst has to be a guitar, Choice (M).

23 B. The band plays music, and “Impatient Love” is on its practice list, so it must be a song 
title, Choice (B).
 
24. L. In the first sentence of the second paragraph, the author refers to “my drums,” which 
tells you that the drums, Choice (L), are the author’s instrument.
 
25. D. In the last paragraph, the author mentions that the band will soon be playing before 
representatives from record labels and states that this gives the band a “new level of com-
mitment” to its practice session. Consequently, the best answer is Choice (D).
 
26. J. You may have to look at several clues to answer this question. The first paragraph 
describes Greenville as a statesman, so he’s probably a political figure. Eliminate Choice (L) 
right away. Next, find out whether Greenville is American or English. The second paragraph 
says that Greenville wanted to raise money for England, so he’s probably English. Forget 
Choice (K). He wanted to tax colonists, so he wasn’t a member of the Connecticut Assembly, 
Choice (M). Choice (J) is the best answer.
 
27. C. The passage says that England wanted to remain a superpower, but it doesn’t say that 
England wanted the American colonies to be a superpower; cross out Choice (D). In the 
second paragraph, you discover that England raised the penalty for smuggling, so Choice (B) 
doesn’t make sense. The passage doesn’t discuss how England felt about the Connecticut 
Assembly, so Choice (A) is wrong. The best answer is Choice (C). The war increased 
England’s national debt, and it needed to raise money through taxes.
 
28. L. You can find the answer to this question in the last sentence of the second paragraph, 
which says that the Sugar Act “raised questions about Britain’s right to tax America” — the 
idea stated in Choice (L). The second paragraph directly states that the Sugar Act didn’t 
raise enough revenue, so Choice (J) is wrong. The third paragraph tells you that American 
colonists didn’t have representation in Parliament, which eliminates Choice (M). Choice (K) 
isn’t even covered in the passage, so it can’t possibly be right.
 
29. D. American colonists had a negative reaction to the Sugar Act, so toss out all the answer 
choices that suggest a positive reaction. The only option left is Choice (D).
 
30. J. The last sentence of the passage clearly states that the conclusion of the Connecticut 
Assembly was that “Parliament had no right to tax the colonists.” This is the answer in 
Choice (J). Choices (L) and (M) aren’t dealt with in the passage, and you know Choice (K) 
can’t be right because the passage says the assembly saw that Parliament had a role in 
 legislation.
Language Section
 
1. B. Don’t be embarrassed if you didn’t know that embarrass has a double r. Choice (B) is 
misspelled; effort and excellent are spelled properly.
 
2. J. Guarantee and warranty have similar-sounding endings, but they’re spelled differently. 
Warranty, Choice (K), is spelled correctly, but guaranty, Choice (J), ends with ee, not y.
 
3. C. Experience ends with ence rather than ance, so Choice (C) is the misspelled word. 
Popular and explode are fine just as they appear in Choices (A) and (B).
 
4. K. Noticing that begining, Choice (K), is misspelled may be difficult at first glance, but it 
should have a double n before the ing. You may have picked Choice (L) thinking that disap-
pear has a double s, but just one s does the trick in disappear.
 
5. D. All the words in this question are spelled correctly. Pick Choice (D) and move along.
 
6. L. You may have been tempted to pick Choice (J) here, but remember that the rule is 
“i before e except after c.” The ei in receipt comes after a c, so it’s spelled correctly. 
Choice (L) is the problem; restarant should contain a silent u after the first a.

370
Part IV: Practice Makes Perfect 
 
7. A. Although category sounds like it’s spelled with an a in the second syllable, the proper 
spelling is with an e, so Choice (A) is misspelled. The ei in neighbor, Choice (C), is an 
exception to the i-before-e rule because the ei makes a long a sound.
 
8. M. None of the words is misspelled. The f in twelfth, Choice (J), is proper even though you 
can’t really hear it. You toss out the e in judge when you add on ment to make judgment, 
so Choice (K) is okay. Intelligence has a double l and ends in ence, just like it appears in 
Choice (L). Choice (M) is the right answer!
 
9. A. The problem word in this question is Choice (A), relevent. It should end with ant, not 
ent. Even though you don’t really hear the a in miniature, Choice (C), including it is proper. 
To keep the short i sound in spin, Choice (B), you must double the n before adding ing.
 
10. L. License is hard to spell for many people. The first s sound is made with a c, and the 
second s sound is made with an s, so it’s not spelled right in Choice (L). The ei combina-
tion in leisure, Choice (K), is proper (it’s one of those tricky exceptions to the rule). 
Choice (J), library, is just fine the way it appears.
 
11. B. In Choice (B), The Eternal Flames is the name of the band, so every important word in 
the name should be capitalized.
 
12. M. This sentence is free of capitalization problems, so you can safely pick Choice (M).
 
13. A. Titles that follow proper names are capitalized, which means Choice (A) should be writ-
ten like this: Jill Thomas, PhD.
 
14. L. The phrase corn flakes in this sentence isn’t the proper name of a cereal. You know that 
because it talks about “some corn flakes.” Even if it were the proper name, both words in 
the name would have to be capitalized. Choice (L) is capitalized incorrectly.
 
15. B. In Choice (B), father isn’t used as a proper name, so it shouldn’t be capitalized. You 
know this because the sentence refers to “my father” rather than “Father.”
 
16. J. South in Choice (J) refers to an area of the country rather than a direction, so it should 
be capitalized: Rachel was raised in the South. Rocky Mountains in Choice (L) is the name 
of a region, so it’s properly capitalized.
 
17. B. High school isn’t the proper name of the school that Sister Margaret administers, so 
Choice (B) should be written as “of the high school.”
 
18. L. Lent is the name of a specific religious period; it should be capitalized in Choice (L).
 
19. D. Hooray! No capitalization errors in this sentence.
 
20. J. Aunt in Choice (J) is part of Aunt Eleanor’s proper name, so it needs to be capitalized. 
The art museum in Choice (L) is a general term rather than the name of a place, which 
means writing it in lowercase is correct.
 
21. B. A sentence formed by two independent clauses (in this case, “Agnes and Andy have 
lived on my street for many years” and “in fact, they were my first friends”) joined only 
by a comma and no conjunction is a comma splice. The two clauses need to be punctuated 
differently in Choice (B). Something like this would be more appropriate: Agnes and Andy 
have lived on my street for many years. In fact, they were my first friends.
 
22. K. “Can we get ice cream” is a question, so Choice (K) should have a question mark after 
cream rather than a period.
 
23. C. A comma separates a city name from a state name. Choice (C) should be “is Orlando, 
Florida.” The comma in Choice (B) properly separates two independent clauses with a 
 conjunction.
 
24. K. You don’t place a comma after a conjunction, so the ending comma in Choice (K) is 
wrong. Choice (J) properly puts a comma after walk to separate a beginning dependent 
clause (before you take a walk) from an independent clause (take out the trash and lock 
the back door.) Choice (K) is your answer.

371
 Chapter 24: Answers to TACHS Practice Test 2
 
25. B. There should be a comma after jog to separate the beginning dependent clause (If I 
don’t get enough sleep, eat a good breakfast, or take a quick jog) from the independent 
clause (I cannot function well at school). The other commas in this sentence properly 
punctuate the series. Choice (B) is the right answer.
 
26. J. Two or more adjectives that come before and refer to the same noun should be sepa-
rated by commas, which means Choice (J) should be written like this: Jenny took a long, 
hard look.
 
27. D. There’s no need for any punctuation marks in this sentence other than the ending 
period. The correct answer is Choice (D).
 
28. K. The conjunction but joins two independent clauses (“Mary Anne and Emily went shop-
ping” and “neither girl made a purchase”). Because a comma is necessary before a con-
junction in order to join two independent clauses, Choice (K) is the obvious answer.
 
29. C. “Although the Bulldogs faced their opponents with determination, grit, and persistence” 
is a beginning dependent clause, so you need a comma after persistence in Choice (C) to 
separate the clause from the remaining independent clause. The other commas are proper 
for the series.
 
30. K. Which is used to begin nonrestrictive clauses, and nonrestrictive clauses provide nones-
sential information, so there should be a comma after building in Choice (K).
 
31. B. This sentence incorrectly switches between second person (you) and third person 
(one) throughout. Because you appears in both Choice (A) and Choice (C), you must 
change one to you and the verb has to have in Choice (B) so that it reads like “you have to 
read through all of the directions.”
 
32. J. Most of the pronouns in this sentence are objects of the preposition for. Therefore, you 
need to use the objective form (me, him, her, them, us). Choice (J) should be written like 
this: It is easier for him and me to go.
 
 Figuring out which form of pronoun to use is easier if you consider each pronoun sepa-
rately. For instance, in the phrase “It is easier for him and I to go,” if you take away him, 
you clearly see that me is better than I.
 
33. D. This sentence is a-okay as is. Pick Choice (D) and move on.
 
34. J. The proper word for showing a reduction of countable items (such as songs) is fewer. 
Choice (J) should be written like this: The band played fewer songs.
 
35. C. The first part of the sentence is in past tense, so the verb in Choice (C) should be in 
past tense also (meaning results should be resulted).
 
36. L. Choice (J) is a sentence fragment because it doesn’t have a verb, Choice (K) is in pas-
sive voice, and Choice (M) puts the main subject (forest) in the predicate of the sentence 
rather than the subject. Choice (L) is the best way to phrase the idea. It’s a complete sen-
tence, it’s in active voice, and it puts the subject in its proper place in the sentence.
 
37. D. Choices (A) and (C) make it seem like I is flying through the windy March skies, which is 
downright silly! Choice (B) has the kite flying through the March skies, but it uses passive 
voice. Choice (D) makes sense and is in active voice.
 
38. M. The only answer that applies the proper form of the ending pronoun is Choice (M). The 
full thought is that they’re much more conniving than we are. Therefore, we rather than us 
is the proper form of the pronoun in this sentence.
 
39. A. When you compare two things or people, you use better rather than best. The only sen-
tence that suggests Andie is the better qualified candidate is Choice (A). All the other 
options improperly use best to compare the two candidates.
 
40. K. The constructions of Choices (J), (L), and (M) suggest that either a glimpse or view 
crosses the bridge. Now that’d be an unusual sight! Choice (K) is the only sentence that 
has people crossing the bridge.

372
Part IV: Practice Makes Perfect 
 
41. A. Sentence 4 presents an idea that’s opposite to the idea expressed in Sentence 3, so you 
need a transition word that shows contrast. Choice (B), and, shows similarity rather than 
contrast, so it’s wrong. Choices (C) and (D), excepting that and but that, are improper con-
structions. However, Choice (A), is a proper way of showing contrast.
 
42. L. Consider each of the answer choices to determine which one repeats an idea that’s 
already stated in the paragraph. Sentence 2 isn’t the same as Sentence 1, so Choice (J) is 
wrong. Sentence 4, Choice (K), provides a contrasting idea to Sentence 3, so it’s not repeti-
tive. Sentence 8 introduces using fantasy in stories, which is completely new. Therefore 
Choice (M) isn’t right. The idea that it’s immoral to show that there’s no solution to evil is 
stated in both Sentence 3 and Sentence 5. Choice (L) is correct.
 
43. D. You need the possessive form of hip-hop in this sentence because it’s talking about the 
commercialization of hip-hop, or hip-hop’s commercialization. Eliminate Choices (B) and 
(C). And although you put a hyphen between hip and hop, you can’t connect hip-hop’s as 
an adjective to the noun commercialization with a hyphen like Choice (A) does. Choice (D) 
is correct.
 
44. J. Clear writing expresses an idea in the simplest way possible. To in Choice (J) states in 
one word what all the other answer choices do with a confusing mumbo jumbo of too 
many words.
 
45. C. The underlined part of Sentence 1 has two problems. First, there’s no reason to put a 
comma after rate, so you can cross out Choices (B) and (D). Second, the proper compari-
son word is than, not then. Choice (C) is the best answer.
 
46. L. Saying that rising college tuition fees have gone up is redundant. If fees are rising, then 
they’re going up. Choose the answer that states the idea of rising fees only once. Because 
going up isn’t underlined, you have to find the answer that eliminates rising, which is 
Choice (L). Choice (K) still has rising in it, and Choice (J) just changes rising to a different 
word.
 
47. C. Sentence 8 emphasizes the idea that federal financial assistance is increasing, so words 
that show contrast rather than continuation aren’t appropriate. But in Choice (A) and how-
ever in Choice (D) show contrast, so they can’t be right. Because shows cause and effect, 
not continuation, so Choice (B) isn’t right either. The best answer is Choice (C), which 
continues the thought without a transition word.
 
48. K. The subject of the verb takes in the underlined part of Sentence 1 is plural, and a plural 
subject needs a plural verb. The plural form of takes is take. Eliminate Choices (J), (L), and 
(M) because they contain takes rather than take. Choice (K) is the only answer that has 
the plural form of the verb.
 
 Compare answer choices to see what makes each one different. If only one out of four possi-
ble answers uses, say, take rather than takes, that may be a clue that the verb is the problem.
 
49. B. The underlined part uses the wrong form of to to mean also. The proper construction is 
Choice (B), too.
 
50. K. Inventory manager isn’t a proper name, so it shouldn’t be capitalized. The answer that 
properly presents both words in lowercase is Choice (K).
Math Section
 
1. D. You’re looking for the answer that isn’t a prime number, so all you have to do is find the 
answer that has more factors than 1 and itself. Choice (D) should stand out because it 
ends in a 5. Any two-digit number that ends in a 5 has a factor of 5 and can’t be prime. 
Choice (D) is the answer.
 
2. K. Follow the order of operations (PEMDAS). You don’t have any operations in parentheses, 
so solve the exponent first: 33 = 27. The next step is to multiply: 2 × 3 = 6. Then subtract: 
27 − 6 = 21, Choice (K).

3. A. Find the least common denominator: 4 goes into 8 twice, so 8 works. Change the second 
fraction from 1⁄4 to 2⁄8 by multiplying the numerator and denominator by 2. Now that the 
denominators are the same, add the numerators and place the sum over 8: 3⁄8 + 2⁄8 = 5⁄8. The 
answer is Choice (A).
 
 You can only add fractions together when they have the same denominator.
 
4. M. Believe it or not, you don’t need to make any calculations to figure this one out. If Bob 
has already put his savings in the bank and still has $70 left, he must have received more 
than $70 for Christmas. Guess what. You can safely eliminate the first three choices 
because none is greater than $70. (If you really want to calculate Bob’s gift, consider that 
because Bob saved 65%, the part he didn’t save, $70, must be 35% of the total. Just divide 
$70 by 35%: $70 ÷ 0.35 = $200.)
 
5. B. This is a simple multiplication problem. 20 limo riders × $12 each is $240, Choice (B). 
What a deal!
 
6. L. To discover the original amount of money Brittney had, just add what she spent to what 
she had left: $23.46 + $8.34 = $31.80. Choice (L) is the answer. If you subtracted rather than 
added, you got Choice (J).
 
7. B. You can figure out what Jane spent on lunch by first calculating how much she spent on 
two basic tacos: $13 × 2 = $26. Then add on the cost of the two extra ingredients she 
bought for the second taco: $26 + $0.50 + $0.50 = $27.00, Choice (B).
 
8. M. To solve for x, subtract 23 from both sides of the equation: x = −53 − 23. When you sub-
tract a number from a negative number, you add the numbers and keep the negative sign: 
−53 − 23 = −76. The answer is Choice (M). If you picked any of the other answers, you sub-
tracted the numbers incorrectly.
 
9. A. You know Choices (B) and (C) are wrong because 10 and 20 are only factors of numbers 
that end in 0. So the factor is either 5 or 25. Because 25 doesn’t go into 65 or 110, Choice (A) 
must be the answer.
 
10. K. To multiply by 100, just move the decimal point two places to the right. 100 sodas at 
$0.76 each cost $76.00, Choice (K). If you picked Choices (L) or (M), you moved the deci-
mal the wrong number of places.
 
11. D. A multiplication problem with an even number of negative signs has a positive answer. 
This problem has two negative signs, so eliminate any negative answer options, namely 
Choices (B) and (C). 4 × 2 × 2 = 16, Choice (D).
 
12. K. Multiply the number of crates (4) by the number of cups per crate (14) to find out the 
total number of cups consumed at the party: 4 × 14 = 56, which is Choice (K).
 
13. B. This problem requires simple addition. Add how much Amy has to the amount her mom 
gives her: $34.57 + $7.87 = $42.44. Choice (B) is the answer.
 
14. M. Of means multiply, so multiply 60 by 1⁄4. 60⁄1 × 1⁄4 = 60⁄4. 60 ÷ 4 = 15, Choice (M).
 
15. C. Sure, you can solve this problem by changing each fraction to a decimal and then plac-
ing them in order — but you don’t need to. You already know that 2⁄4 is the same as 1⁄2. Tell 
yourself that 4⁄9 is less than 1⁄2 because half of 9 is 4.5 and 4 is less than 4.5. 3⁄5 is more than 1⁄2 
because 2.5 is half of 5 and 3 is more than 2.5. The order is 4⁄9, 2⁄4, 3⁄5, Choice (C).
 
16. J. Add up Michelle’s purchase. Two shirts at $15 each cost $30 total. Add to that another 
$30 for a pair of pants to get $60. Subtract $60 from $70 to find out how much change she 
gets: $70 − $60 is $10. Mark Choice (J) on your answer sheet.
 
17. C. Apply the rule for dividing fractions to this problem and you get this equation: 3⁄8 × 3⁄2. 
Multiply the numerators, 3 × 3 = 9, and the denominators, 8 × 2 = 16. The answer is 9⁄16, 
Choice (C).
 
 When you divide fractions, flip the numerator and denominator of the second fraction and 
multiply.

18. M. To solve this problem, just substitute the values for x and y into the equation, like this: 
. Those parallel lines on either side of the −3 mean absolute value. Absolute 
value is always positive, so now you have 3 + 3(2). 3 × 2 = 6, and 3 + 6 = 9. The answer is 
Choice (M). If you went with Choice (K), you forgot that absolute value is positive.
 
19. A. You figure out the perimeter of a polygon by adding up the length of each side. This 
octagon has a perimeter of 40 meters, so you can set up an equation that looks like this: 
40 = 5 + 3 + 3 + 6 + 5 + 7 + 7 + x. Now solve: 40 = 36 + x; subtract 36 from both sides: 4 = x. 
The answer is Choice (A).
 
20. J. On the chart, find the colors with the largest numbers to determine the most popular 
ones. The most popular color is black with 27 shirts. Next is blue with 21 shirts, and third 
is red with 20 shirts. The answer that lists these top three colors is Choice (J).
 
21. C. The pie chart displays Welch’s rent expense as 20 percent of total expenses, but all the 
answer choices are fractions. To convert 20 percent to a fraction, put 20 over 100 and sim-
plify. Divide both the numerator and denominator by 20: 20⁄100 = 1⁄5. The answer is Choice (C).
 
22. K. A total of 5 percent (or 5⁄100) of Welch’s expenses goes to miscellaneous goods and 
expenses. Reduce the fraction by dividing the numerator and denominator by 5: 5⁄100 = 1⁄20. 
Choice (K) is the correct answer.
 
23. D. You may be tempted to pick Choice (A), but 25 is the number of mint ice cream cones 
sold, not the percentage of mint cones sold. To find the percentage, you first have to figure 
out the total number of ice cream cones sold. 15 chocolate cones, 10 vanilla cones, and 25 
mint cones were sold; that’s 50 total cones (15 + 10 + 25 = 50). The fraction of mint cones 
sold is 25⁄50, or 1⁄2. You probably know that 1⁄2 is the same as 50%, Choice (D), but if you don’t, 
you can find the answer by dividing: 1 ÷ 2 = 0.50, and 0.50 is 50%.
 
24. K. Use the chart to compare the students’ first scores to their last. Jack’s score decreased 
from 79 to 71, so Choice (J) isn’t right. Compare Don and Matt’s scores. Matt’s score went 
from 75 to 82, a change of 7. Don’s score increased from 70 to 79, an improvement of 9. The 
student who improved the most is Choice (K), Don.
 
25. B. The chart shows that September is the only month when the Dawgs hit more home runs 
than the other two teams did, so Choice (B) is probably the answer. The Dawgs hit about 
28 home runs in September. The Hawks hit 15 home runs, and the Cougars hit around 12. 
12 + 15 = 27, which is fewer than the 28 home runs hit by the Dawgs.
 
26. M. The chart shows that there are 5 solid red marbles in the bag of 15 marbles, so Luke 
has a 5 in 15 (5⁄15) chance of pulling out a solid red marble. 5⁄15 reduces to 1⁄3, Choice (M).
 
27. D. The bar for Sarah goes up to the 8 mark. The bar for Bre ends between 2 and 4, which 
means 3 girls were named Bre. 8 − 3 = 5; there are 5 more girls named Sarah than girls 
named Bre in the class. The answer is Choice (D).
 
28. L. According to the table, a steak costs $12.75. A baked potato on the side would be an 
extra $0.75. The total cost is $13.50 ($12.75 + $0.75 = $13.50), Choice (L).
 
29. C. An entree salad costs $4.00. Two small side bowls of soup cost a total of $1.50 ($0.75 + 
$0.75). Add to find the total of all three purchases: $4.00 + $1.50 = $5.50, Choice (C).
 
30. J. To find the fraction of students who like black cars, you must first know the total 
number of students in the survey. Using the information in the chart, add up the number of 
students who like blue, black, red, and white cars: 3 + 4 + 8 + 5 = 20. Four students prefer 
black cars, so the fraction of students whose favorite car color is black is 4 out of 20, or 4⁄20. 
Reduce the fraction by dividing the numerator and denominator by 4: 4⁄20 = 1⁄5, Choice (J).
 
31. B. This problem requires you to do a little multiplication and addition. The chart states 
that minivans sell for $28,000 each. Three of them would cost $84,000: 3 × $28,000 = 
$84,000. A sports car is $50,000. Add $50,000 to $84,000 to find the total cost of all four 
cars: $50,000 + $84,000 = $134,000, Choice (B).

32. L. Use the chart to determine how many students like dogs and how many students like 
fish. The bar for dogs goes up to 12, so 12 students prefer dogs. The bar for fish ends 
exactly between 6 and 8, so 7 students prefer fish. To find out the difference, subtract 7 
from 12: 12 − 7 = 5. The answer is Choice (L).
 
33. B. The most obvious way to estimate the answer to this problem in your head is to get rid 
of the decimal points for both numbers by rounding to the nearest whole number. Because 
the numbers to the right of the decimal points in both numbers are greater than 5, you 
round up for each number. 11.7 rounds up to 12, and 99.8 rounds up to 100. The problem 
then becomes 12 × 100. To multiply 12 × 100, multiply 12 × 1 and add two zeros to get 
1,200. You can eliminate Choices (C) and (D) because the product of 12 and 1 doesn’t 
begin with a 2! The difference between Choice (A) and Choice (B) is the number of zeros. 
Choice (B) is the correct answer.
 
34. M. All of the choices provided are rounded to the thousands place, which means you 
round the original numbers to the thousands place to estimate the difference. The number 
to the right of the thousands place in each number is less than 5, so you keep the existing 
number in the thousands place and add three zeros to get 8,000 − 7,000. Subtracting is 
easy now; the answer is Choice (M).
 
 You can use the given answer choices to determine what place you should round to.
 
35. C. The answer choices are whole numbers, so round each number to the nearest whole 
number. The number to the right of the decimal point in each number is less than 5, so 
6.32 rounds to 6, and 10.44 rounds to 10. 6 × 10 = 60, which is Choice (C).
 
36. J. The answer choices are rounded to the hundreds place. 433 rounded to the nearest hun-
dred is 400 because the number to the right of the 4 is 3, which is less than 5. The number 
578 rounds up to 600 because the number to the right of the 5 is greater than 5. Add the 
rounded numbers: 400 + 600 = 1,000, Choice (J).
 
37. C. Round each number to the nearest ten. 42 rounds to 40 (2 < 5), 56 becomes 60 (6 ≥ 5), 
47 rounds up to 50 (7 ≥ 5), and 63 becomes 60 (3 < 5). 40 + 60 = 100, 100 + 50 = 150, and 
150 + 60 = 210. Choice (C) is correct.
 
38. J. Round to whole dollars. $16.32 rounds to $16 because 3 < 5. $3.43 rounds to $3 because 
4 < 5. $16 – $3 is $13, Choice (J). If you picked Choices (K) or (L), you incorrectly rounded up.
 
39. B. Round the numbers to something that’s easy to work in your head. You can only round 
54 to the tens place; 4 < 5, so 54 rounds to 50. 2,356 rounds to 2,000. Now do the division in 
your head. Eliminate one zero from both 50 and 2,000; when you do that, the problem 
becomes 200 ÷ 5. You know that 20 ÷ 5 is 4, so just add a zero to get 40, Choice (B). If you 
selected Choice (A), you rounded improperly. Choices (C) and (D) result from dividing 
incorrectly.
 
40. L. You can eliminate Choices (J) and (K) because neither is rounded to the hundredths 
place. Choice (M) rounds the 4 up to 5, but the digit next to the 4 is 3, which is less than 5. 
That means the 4 in the hundredths place stays a 4; the answer is Choice (L).
 
41. D. Choice (C) is rounded to the hundreds place, so it’s wrong. The 2 is in the thousands 
place. The number to the right of the 2 is 5, which is ≥ 5, so round up to 3,000, Choice (D).
 
42. K. You find the tenths place directly to the right of the decimal point. In this large number 
(34,574.361), that number is a 3. The number to the right of that 3 is a 6. Because 6 ≥ 5, 
you round the 3 up to 4, just like Choice (K). All the other choices are rounded to the 
wrong place.
 
43. A. Choice (C) isn’t a whole number, so it’s wrong. Because the number to the right of the 
decimal point is 5, you round up. The number therefore becomes 345, Choice (A).
 
44. L. The order of operations tells you to add the parentheses first. 10 + 1 is 11. 11 rounds to 
10, and 20 is already rounded. Multiply: 20 × 10 = 200, Choice (L).

376

45. A. The race car’s estimated rate is 200 mph; the remote car travels at an estimated rate 
of 20 mph. The race car is about 10 times faster than the remote control car: 200 ÷ 20 is 10. 
Choice (A) is your answer.
 
46. K. Choices (J) and (M) are rounded to the nearest thousand. Choice (L) is rounded to the 
nearest ten. The only answer rounded to the nearest hundred is Choice (K).
 
47. C. You can round the dollar amount to the nearest whole dollar, which is $8. Ashleigh 
therefore makes about $8 an hour. In 12 hours, Ashleigh makes about $96, Choice (C), 
because 8 × 12 is 96. If you picked Choice (A), you rounded the number of hours too. The 
question specifically asks for the amount of money Ashleigh makes in 12 hours, which 
means you don’t round the hours. Choice (C) is the best answer.
 
48. J. The answer choices are rounded to the nearest hundred, so round each mileage number 
to the nearest 100. 1,344 rounds to 1,300 because 4 < 5; 1,566 rounds to 1,600 because 6 ≥ 5. 
Subtract: 1,600 – 1,300 = 300. Vance rode about 300 more miles last year than this year, 
Choice (J).
 
49. D. Round the prices to the nearest whole dollar. Bananas are about $1 per pound, and 
soda is about $3 a case. Five pounds of bananas are about $5 (5 × $1). Add $5 to the 
$3 case of soda to find the total spent. Choice (D), $8, is correct.
 
50. K. Round the numbers in parentheses to the nearest thousand. 3,534 rounds up to 4,000, 
and 1,422 rounds to 1,000. Subtract: 4,000 − 1,000 = 3,000. To divide 3,000 by 30 in your 
head, eliminate a zero from both numbers to get 300 ÷ 3. You know that 3 ÷ 3 is 1, so add 
two zeros to get Choice (K), 100.
Ability Section
 
1. E. The common characteristic among the three figures is that each is shaded. Choices (A), 
(B), (C), and (D) aren’t shaded, so Choice (E) must be the answer.
 
2. M. The three figures are half shaded with diagonal lines. Choices (K) and (N) aren’t 
half shaded; Choices (J) and (L) are half shaded with vertical lines. The best answer is 
Choice (M).
 
3. D. Examine the three figures. Each has a shaded outer figure with an inner unshaded 
figure. Choices (B) and (C) don’t have a shaded outer figure, and Choice (E) doesn’t have 
an unshaded inner figure. Eliminate them. All of the given figures have different inner and 
outer figures, but the inner figure in Choice (A) is the same shape as the outer figure, so it 
can’t be right. The best answer is Choice (D).
 
4. K. The similarities among the three figures may escape you at first. But notice that all of 
them have a different-shaped and -shaded inner figure stuck to the left side of the outer 
figure. The only answer with an inner figure stuck to the left side of its outer figure is 
Choice (K). All the other choices have floating inner figures.
 
5. E. Each given figure contains a shaded black triangle. The only answer with a shaded black 
triangle is Choice (E).
 
6. L. The given figures are different shapes, but each one has inner lines that connect each of 
its angles. The only figure in the answer choices that has lines attaching all of its angles is 
Choice (L). What a tangled web that figure weaves!
 
7. C. Although the given figures are different shapes, each of them has a convex left side that 
curves out and a concave right side that curves in. The figure with this similar characteris-
tic is the arrow in Choice (C). None of the other figures have the same curved sides.
 
8. M. The second figure in the first set bisects the first figure with a vertical line that extends 
past the figure on either end. Because the first figure of the second set is a circle, the 
answer should be a circle with a vertical line that bisects it and extends in both directions. 
You find that figure in Choice (M).

377
 Chapter 24: Answers to TACHS Practice Test 2
 
9. C. The figures in the first set are exactly the same! The answer must be the figure that’s 
exactly the same as the hexagon in the second set — Choice (C).
 
10. J. The second figure in the first set of figures adds an inner figure that’s the same shape as 
the first. The only answers that add a similar inner figure to the diamond in the second set 
of figures are Choices (J) and (M). However, Choice (J) is the better answer because its 
inner figure is flush to the left, just like the one in the first set of given figures.
 
11. E. The second figure in the first set of figures is the same shape as the first but it’s tipped 
90 degrees to the right. Eliminate Choices (B) and (C) because they aren’t the same shape 
as the first figure in the second set. The answer that tips the quadrilateral 90 degrees to 
the right is Choice (E).
 
12. K. The second figure in the first set shades the top half of the first figure with vertical lines. 
The first figure of the second set is a diamond, so look for the answer that’s a diamond 
with a top half shaded in vertical lines. Only Choice (K) meets this requirement.
 
13. C. You may be tempted to pick Choice (A) for this analogy, but although the shape in 
Choice (A) is a quadrilateral like the first figure in the second set, it doesn’t have the same 
dimensions. Go back and examine the first set of figures carefully. The second figure 
results from removing the inner circle from the outer circle. The answer that removes one 
of the inner squares from the outer square is Choice (C).
 
14. J. Examine the first set of figures; the first one is a shaded triangle, and the second is an 
unshaded triangle with a shaded square inside. To make the first figure into the second, 
you must change the shading (but not the shape) and add an inner figure that’s shaded dif-
ferently from the outer figure. Apply this pattern to the next figure, an unshaded circle. 
Choices (K) and (L) change the third figure’s shape, so forget about ’em. The remaining 
choices keep the circle’s shape, but Choices (M) and (N) don’t change the shading; both 
have unshaded outer circles just like the unshaded circle in the question. The answer has 
to be Choice (J). It has a circle with different shading, and (wonder of wonders!) that circle 
contains the required unshaded square.
 
15. D. You know the number of holes in the unfolded paper will be twice the number of origi-
nal holes if the paper is folded once. Therefore, the right answer can’t be Choice (B) or 
Choice (C). Choice (A) puts the holes in the corner, which can’t be right either because the 
original hole is in the middle of the fold. Both of the resulting holes in Choice (E) appear 
below the fold line, but one of the holes should be above the line, and the other should be 
below it. Choice (D) is the answer you’re looking for.
 
16. N. Eliminate Choices (J) and (L) because the answer must have four holes. When you 
unfold the paper, there’s a hole in the upper- and bottom-left corners. The only answer 
with this configuration is Choice (N).
 
17. B. When you eliminate any answer choices that don’t have six holes, you’re left with 
Choices (A), (B), and (C). Choice (A) would result if the paper were folded vertically, 
but Choice (C) isn’t even possible because all the holes must be on the same side. The 
answer is Choice (B).
 
18. J. When a paper is folded twice, the end result has four times the number of holes, so the 
answer will have four holes (which means you can toss out Choices (K) and (M)). The hole 
is in the middle of the page, and Choice (J) is the only remaining answer with holes in the 
middle.
 
19. D. Look for an answer with four holes; Choices (A) and (E) obviously don’t fit the bill. The 
original holes aren’t in the middle of the page, so Choice (C) is out. And two holes have to 
appear on either side of the diagonal fold, so Choice (B) doesn’t work. Choice (D) is correct.
 
20. L. The paper has two folds and 4 holes, so the answer must have 16 holes. The only option 
with 16 holes is Choice (L). That was pretty easy for the last question!

COOP Practice Test 1
T
aking the COOP? Here’s your chance to practice. This test gets you ready for all seven 
sections of the exam so you won’t be surprised on test day.
 We’ve designed this practice test to be similar to the actual COOP, but the exam you take 
may be a little different because the test-makers like to periodically change things up (such 
as the numbers of questions in each section and the time limits).
Try to take this practice test under conditions that are as close to the real thing as possible. 
Here are our suggestions:
 
✓ Find a place where you won’t be distracted. (Hide your cellphone in the closet!)
 
✓ Take this test at approximately the same time of day as the time your COOP is sched-
uled (which means you have to start around 8 or 9 a.m.).
 
✓ Remove the answer sheet and mark your answers on it by filling in the appropriate 
bubbles.
 
✓ Use the space in the margins around the test questions for notes and computations.
 
✓ Use a timer to time yourself on each section. When your time is up, stop answering 
questions in that section and move on.
 
✓ Take a short (10- to 15-minute) break between the fourth and fifth tests; this is likely 
when you’ll receive a break on the day of the COOP.
After you finish the test, review the answer explanations in Chapter 26 (yes, even if you got 
every question right; you just might pick up something you didn’t know).

Test 6: Reading and Language Arts
Time: 40 minutes
Directions: Read this passage about photosynthesis and answer Questions 1–7.
 
Photosynthesis is the process that plants go through to use light and water to make glu-
cose, which is sugar. Photosynthesis creates sugar in the green parts of plants, which is a 
substance that every animal on earth depends on. The process also causes plants to give off 
the oxygen that animals need to survive.
 
The “photo” in photosynthesis means that this process uses light as its energy source. 
“Synthesis” refers to how the process synthesizes, or creates, glucose. Plants absorb an 
ordinary gas from the air called carbon dioxide. This, combined with the water they pull up 
through their roots and the light from the sun, makes sugar. Plants use the sugar to grow, 
and the green parts of plants make the sugar and oxygen. Without plants, humans would 
have no food to eat or oxygen to breathe.
 
Here is what the photosynthesis reaction looks like: 6 CO2 (carbon dioxide) + 6 H2O 
(water) + light energy → C6H12O6 (glucose) + 6 O2 (oxygen).
 
The overall reaction in photosynthesis is accomplished in many small steps. The leaves 
of plants act like big solar panels, soaking up as much light energy as they can. Leaves con-
tain something called chlorophyll, which is the molecule that actually absorbs the incoming 
energy. Have you ever asked yourself why grass is green? Plants are green because of chlo-
rophyll. Perhaps you learned in science class that the white light from the sun is actually a 
blend of many different colors of light like you see in a rainbow. Chlorophyll absorbs all 
colors of light except green. Since it isn’t absorbed, the green light bounces off of the leaves 
and enters our eyes, making us see green.
 
The light energy that is absorbed by the chlorophyll is used to break apart the water 
molecules, and some electrons from the H2O are fed into an electron transport chain. The 
electrons get passed down the chain, and this ends up breaking up the H2O molecules, 
which results in the production of O2. The oxygen is released into the atmosphere so that 
creatures like us can breathe it in and use it for ourselves.
 1. 
The O2 produced in photosynthesis results 
from the breakup of which molecules?
 
(A) glucose molecules
 
(B) CO2 molecules
 
(C) chlorophyll molecules
 
(D) H2O molecules
 2. 
Which color of light would be least likely to 
help a plant perform photosynthesis?
 
(F) blue
 
(G) red
 
(H) white
 
(J) green
 3. 
Which substance is created by 
 photosynthesis?
 
(A) carbon dioxide
 
(B) water
 
(C) sugar
 
(D) chlorophyll
 4. 
What is the probable definition of “photo” 
in the word “photosynthesis”?
 
(F) picture
 
(G) light
 
(H) camera
 
(J) creation

 11. What is the author’s attitude toward 
Frederick Douglass?
 
(A) Douglass was a great person, but he 
had little influence on American history.
 
(B) Douglass could have influenced the 
course of slavery more if he had

institution of slavery.
 
(C) Douglass was a great leader who was a 
major contributor to the end of slavery 
in America.
 
(D) Douglass used his experience as a 
slaveholder to change Northerners’ 
opinions about slavery.
 12. The information in this essay could help 
you answer which of these questions?
 
(F) When did the Civil War end?
 
(G) In what year did slavery end in 
America?
 
(H) What newspapers did Douglass use to 
express his views about slavery?
 
(J) What are the names of several influen-
tial Northern abolitionists?
 
Frederick Douglass was an African American abolitionist and civil rights leader in the 
1800s. Although Frederick Douglass had a negative view of slaveholders, he blamed the 
system of slavery rather than the individuals. In his autobiography, Douglass talked about 
his first slaveholder, Captain Anthony. He stated that the system of slavery affected slave-
holders as well as slaves. Douglass believed that slaveholders would not have acted in such 
cruel ways if they had not been influenced by the slavery system.
 
The way that Douglass portrayed slaveholders helped gain support for the abolitionist 
movement. Since Douglass placed blame on the system of slavery rather than on slavehold-
ers, it was easier for white Americans to become attracted to the abolitionist movement. It 
was easier to justify the abolition of a system than the abolition of persons. White abolition-
ists were able to identify the system of slavery rather than individual slaveholders as the 
problem. If Douglass were to condemn whites and argue that whites were the problem, he 
probably would not have gained as much support from white abolitionists. Therefore, 
Douglass’s portrayal of slaveholders opened up the issue of abolition to whites in America.
 
Douglass was able to express his ideas of abolition to a larger audience when he founded 
the newspaper North Star in December of 1847, which by 1851 became Frederick Douglass’s 
Paper. Douglass had 3,000 subscriptions and a large audience in the North to voice his opin-
ions to about slavery and abolition. Douglass’s willingness to work with whites showed that 
he was committed to ending slavery without blaming whites. Douglass’s ability to recognize 
slavery as the main problem encouraged Northerners and allowed them to feel more com-
fortable to join the struggle to end slavery.
 
Douglass was able to cement a place in history as the voice of the abolitionist movement 
through his carefully argued views on slavery. His work in the fight against slavery and 
racism allowed for support from Northerners and paved the way for emancipation after 
the Civil War. One of the most progressive persons of his era and perhaps of all time, 
Douglass served as an inspiration to many and helped fuel later civil rights thinkers such 
as W.E.B. Dubois.

Directions: Read the following article about ice hockey and answer Questions 21–26.
 
Ah, the coolness of the ice rink, the hum of the Zamboni . . . it can mean only one thing; 
it’s hockey time! And all signs point toward a successful season for the Clement Cougars.
 
Clement’s hockey team is not just made up of Clement players. Rounding out the team 
are players from St. Thomas High School and Our Lady High School, too. Though three 
schools are represented, the vast majority of the players are from Clement. Returning to 
Clement for his senior year is goalie Brendan Sanchez. For the past two years Brendan has 
been playing hockey in a special league in Washington State. Sanchez’s unmatched skills 
will be an excellent addition to an already great Clement team. Sanchez is surrounded by a 
great supporting cast that includes such star players as Clement center Taylor Poldale, St. 
Thomas senior Don Silver, Our Lady senior Nick Woodson, and Clement junior Justin Frank. 
Look for the upperclassmen to step up and take over the roles vacated by graduated play-
ers Brad Hunt and Steve Wilson.
 
Some of the players have been preparing for the rigorous season by joining fall hockey 
teams. Poldale and Sanchez are currently playing for local AA league teams. It is hoped that 
this extra practice will give the team the edge to overcome its rival, Apple River High 
School. Last year, the Clement Cougars went 9-5 and were good enough to make the play-
offs. Unfortunately, they were dealt a devastating 2-1 loss in the final seconds at the hands 
of coach Jim Quinlan and the Apple River team. The Cougars hope to rebound this season 
and take home the state championship.
 
This year will be an exciting one. So grab your jackets, buy your tickets, and come sup-
port the Cougars on their way to high school hockey stardom.

Directions: Read this essay on El Greco and Beuys and answer Questions 30–36.
 
El Greco painted The Burial of Conde Orgaz in Toledo, Spain, between the years of 1586–
88. Almost 400 years later, Joseph Beuys, a post-World War II German artist, began his artis-
tic creations of mixed media drawings, one of which he entitled Kadmon. Although the two 
artists painted different subjects, in different time periods, in different countries, with differ-
ent media, and in different styles, they convey a common meaning. Both works demonstrate 
the relationship between the spiritual and material world and explore the human position 
within these worlds.
 
The backgrounds of both El Greco and Beuys prepared them for expressing the links and 
divisions between the spiritual world and the material world. Their personal experiences 
and formal art training promoted their interest in mysticism and earthliness, and their art 
attempted to portray the qualities of both.
 
El Greco received his formal art training in Crete and Italy, but he created his master-
works in Spain, a country known for both spirituality and reality. His formal training was a 
blend of Byzantine mysticism and Italian Mannerism. Not only did El Greco receive varied 
artistic training, but he also received a well-rounded spiritual, historical, literary, and scien-
tific education from his early schooling and his diverse group of friends in cosmopolitan 
Toledo. His paintings combined his artistic and intellectual influences to portray the inter-
action between the spiritual world and the material world.
 
Like El Greco, Joseph Beuys experienced a variety of personal and artistic influences that 
inspired him to portray spiritual and material themes in his works. Beuys grew up in the 
tiny German town of Kleve, and his youth was influenced by the small community’s predom-
inant Catholicism and its rural natural setting. According to Christopher Lyon, Beuys’s art 
came from his attempts to deal with the chaotic aftermath of World War II, and his early 
drawings portray both the personal and political disruption created by the war’s devasta-
tion. Kadmon, one of Beuys’s earliest works, portrays his fascination with the relationship 
between the spiritual and the material.
 
El Greco and Beuys chose different subjects to portray the relationship between the 
heavens and the earth. Because his art was commissioned by churches and because art 
before the advent of photography served not only aesthetic purposes but also as a record 
of history, El Greco most often recreated specific religious events. Unobstructed by the limi-
tations of church sponsorship and freed by modern artistic exploration, Beuys chose more 
primitive subject matter for his interpretations.
 31. In what century did Beuys begin creating 
works of art?
 
(A) the 1500s
 
(B) the 1800s
 
(C) the 1900s
 
(D) the 2000s
 30. How are the works of El Greco and Beuys 
similar?
 
(F) They both use mixed media.
 
(G) They both explore the interplay 
between the spiritual and the material 
worlds.
 
(H) Both artists have German influences in 
their works.
 
(J) The artists painted the same subjects.

Answers to COOP Practice Test 1
T
his chapter not only gives you the answers to COOP Practice Test 1 (in Chapter 25) but 
it also explains why those answers are what they are. Try to read through each explana-
tion. After all, figuring out which answers are wrong (and why) can be just as important as 
determining which answers are correct. Note: If you don’t have time for this, skip ahead a 
few pages to check your work against the short ’n’ sweet answer key.
Test 1: Sequences
 
1. B. The sequence is made up of a series of ?s and !s. The first set in the sequence is two ?s, 
a !, and a ?. The next set is the same basic pattern with the sequence of the two symbols 
reversed. The third set is a different pattern: three ?s and a !. The next set is likely the 
same pattern with the symbols reversed because it begins that way. All you have to do is 
add two more ! and a ? — Choice (B). The other choices don’t complete a pattern with the 
other sets in the sequence.
 
2. H. The four symbols that appear in this sequence are a small shaded circle (SS), a small 
unshaded circle (SU), a large shaded circle (LS), and a large unshaded circle (LU). The 
second set is merely the reverse of the first set. The third is similar to the first except that 
the circles demonstrate a pattern of reverse shading. Rather than LS, SU, SS, the pattern 
in the third set is LU, SS, SU. You can reasonably assume that the fourth set is a reverse of 
the third, especially because the first two circles demonstrate that pattern. The reverse 
of LU, SS, SU is SU, SS, LU — Choice (H).
 
3. A. Note the consistencies. Each set begins with a heart (h). Additionally, no set contains 
more than one of the same symbol. Each set also has a diamond (d), but the diamond 
appears only in either the second or last place. The club (c) appears in two sets, but the 
spade (s) appears only once. Therefore, you can safely assume that the last symbol in the 
last set is a spade, Choice (A), because that completes the pattern. (The first two sets are 
the same except the spade takes the place of the club. The addition of the spade in the 
fourth set makes the last two sets the same except the spade takes the place of the club.)
 
4. J. The pattern in this sequence of four sets of four symbols contains only two different 
symbol types. Each set decreases the number of squares at the beginning of the set by one 
and adds a circle to the end of the set. To create the fourth set, you take away a square 
from the beginning of the third set and add a circle to the end to get a square and three 
 circles. The last three symbols in the set should be three circles, Choice (J).
 
5. C. Focus on a pattern. The third set reverses the pattern of the second: Smile, frown, smile, 
frown becomes frown, smile, frown, smile. Because set reversal occurs in the sequence, it’s 
possible that the fourth set reverses the first. The first set is two frowns followed by two 
smiles, which would mean the fourth set is two smiles followed by two frowns, Choice (C). 
Every other choice introduces new patterns that aren’t justified by the rest of the sets in 
the sequence.
 
6. G. This sequence appears random, but consistencies do exist. The arrows alternate up and 
down, and the two consecutive arrows display the same shading before a new shading is 
introduced. Because the direction of the arrows alternates, the last arrow in the last set 

418
Part IV: Practice Makes Perfect 
must be pointing up, so cross out Choices (F) and (J). The first two arrows in the last set 
exhibit the same shading, so the next arrow in the set should have a new type of shading. 
The shading type of the arrow in Choice (H) has already appeared in the third set. There’s 
nothing in the pattern to suggest that a shading type should repeat, which means 
Choice (G) is the best answer because it introduces a new shading type.
 
7. A. The numbers in this sequence increase by 4. 22 + 4 is 26, which is Choice (A).
 
8. G. This sequence diminishes by 5 each time, so the last number is 15, Choice (G).
 
9. C. Each set contains three numbers that increase by 3. The last number of the last set 
should be 3 more than 83, which is 86 — Choice (C).
 
10. H. At first you may think the numbers in each set increase by 2 because 2 + 2 = 4. However, 
4 + 2 ≠ 8. Turns out you find the next number in each set by multiplying by 2, not adding. 
Multiply 7 by 2 to get 14, Choice (H).
 
11. C. You may assume the pattern is to multiply by 3, which would make the last number in 
the sequence 90. However, 90 isn’t an answer choice. Perhaps the pattern is to increase by 
6: 3 + 6 is 9, and 9 + 6 is 15. Sounds good, but if you look at the last set of numbers, you see 
10 followed by 30, and 30 isn’t 6 more than 10. To find the pattern, examine the second set. 
Yes, 15 is 3 times 5, but 21 is only 6 more than 15. You must have to multiply the first 
number in the set by 3 to get the second number and then add 6 to get the third, which 
means you add 6 to 30 to get 36, Choice (C).
 
12. J. The numbers in each set of this sequence decrease, and you’re looking for the number 
that fits into the beginning of the last set. Concentrate on the relationship between the first 
two numbers in the first two sets to find it. The difference between 60 and 56 is 4, and 14 is 4 
less than 18. So the number that begins the last set is 4 more than 21, which is 25, Choice (J).
 
 When the missing number is the first one in a set, don’t waste your time determining how 
the last two numbers in each set are related. Just focus on the first two.
 
13. D. Based on the first set, the pattern in this sequence seems to be dividing the previous 
number by 3. 27 ÷ 3 = 9; 9 ÷ 3 = 3. But when you look at the second set, you find that 3 
doesn’t figure into the pattern at all. Examine the sets again. In both cases the last two 
numbers of the sets are factors of the first number in each set. 9 × 3 = 27; 5 × 25 = 125. So 
the correct answer is the number that equals 48 when it’s multiplied by 8. 8 × 6 = 48; 
Choice (D) is right.
 
14. F. This sequence adds a few letters to the mix. Notice that each set begins with an X, not a 
Z; eliminate Choice (J). The numbers in each set are consecutive and start with a number 
that’s 1 more than the beginning number in the previous set. The first number in the set 
that comes before the missing set is a 4. 5 is 1 more than 4, and the only remaining option 
with a first number of 5 is Choice (F).
 
15. B. This sequence is a little different from the ones in the previous questions. It doesn’t 
have separate sets, and all of the components are letters. Keep the order of the alphabet in 
mind for letter sequences. If you’ve written out the alphabet in your test booklet as we sug-
gest in Chapter 14, you can see that C is the third letter. You jump over two letters to get 
to F and another two letters to reach I. The pattern consists of every third letter of the 
alphabet. When you skip two letters from R, you land on U, so Choice (B) is the answer.
 
16. G. For this question, you must find the third set of four. To determine the pattern in each 
set, concentrate on the sets that appear before and after the blank. Referring to your 
alphabet, you see that F is the letter right after E and that D comes before E. The same is 
true for the last set: LKJ is the reverse of the alphabetical order of JKL. Eliminate Choices 
(F) and (H) because they don’t reverse the order of the alphabet. Each set in the original 
sequence begins with a letter that’s three letters from the first letter in the previous set. 
The letter that’s three from F is I, so the third set must begin with I. The answer must be 
Choice (G) because it’s the only one that begins with I.

419
 Chapter 26: Answers to COOP Practice Test 1
 
17. C. The three letters in each set of this sequence are in consecutive alphabetical order, as 
are the sets themselves. The three letters that come after uvw are xyz, Choice (C), which 
ends the alphabet. The last set begins the alphabet again.
 
18. H. Focus on what you know when looking at this tricky pattern. Each set ends with a B, 
which means Choice (F) is wrong because it ends with an H. The first letter of each of the 
given sets is A, C, E. You skip one letter to get from A to C, and you skip one letter to get 
from C to E. When you skip the letter after E, you get G, which means the first letter of 
the last set must be G. Cross out Choice (J). The only difference between the remaining 
choices is the third letter of the set. The pattern of the third letters of each set is B, D, F. 
Again, the letters skip a letter in alphabetical order. The next letter in this pattern would 
be H (B, D, F, H). Choice (H) has an H in the third spot and is the right answer.
 
19. A. The first three letters of each set are in consecutive order, but that doesn’t help you 
much because all the answer choices begin with consecutive letters. Focus your attention 
on the last letter of each set. The last letters are E, F, __, and H. To maintain the consecu-
tive pattern of the last letter in each set, the missing set should end with G, which means 
you can cut Choices (B) and (D). You can also eliminate Choice (C) because the first let-
ters of each set progress in consecutive alphabetical order (A, B, __, D), which means the 
first letter of the third set should be a C. The answer is Choice (A).
 
20. F. The first, third, and fifth sets are in strict alphabetical order: ABC DEF GHI. The second 
set interjects letters from the end of the alphabet. The only answer choice that maintains 
the pattern is Choice (F).
Test 2: Analogies
 
1. A. The relationship between a baby chick and an egg is probably physical development. 
Baby chicks come from eggs. Apply the relationship to a plant sprout. A plant sprout 
comes from a seed, Choice (A), not a rooster, large tree, or fried egg.
 
2. G. Snow boots are what you wear on your feet when there are snowflakes. Apply this sen-
tence for the second relationship: Sandals are what you wear on your feet when. . . . You 
know the answer isn’t Choice (F) or Choice (H) because neither a snow shovel nor a tennis 
shoe is a reason to wear sandals. The remaining options depict the weather, but sandals 
are more appropriate for a sunny day, Choice (G), than a rain shower.
 
3. B. A kitten grows into a cat, and a tadpole grows into a frog, Choice (B). Easy, huh?
 
4. H. The question shows you a picture of a convict and a jail cell. A convict lives in a jail cell. 
Apply this relationship to the second picture. A farmer doesn’t live on a pitchfork, horse, 
or tree. He does, however, live on a farm, Choice (H).
 
5. D. The relationship between milk and cheese is that milk is the chief ingredient in cheese. 
Flour isn’t the chief ingredient in a wheat stalk, cow, or field, but it is the main ingredient in 
bread, Choice (D).
 
6. F. A rook is one part of a chess game, so find the answer that’s a part of a tool chest. 
Neither a domino nor a jackhammer belongs in a tool chest. A board doesn’t belong there 
either. Choice (F), screwdriver, is the best answer.
 
7. C. This is a way that the COOP may portray a degree relationship. The first picture shows 
a full pail of water, and the second picture shows a pail that’s overflowing. Overflowing is a 
greater degree of fullness. The third picture shows a table with an adequate amount of 
food. The picture that shows a table with a greater abundance of food than the original 
table is Choice (C). Choices (A) and (D) can’t be right because they show lesser rather 
than greater amounts of food.

8. J. What does a sandbox have in common with the beach? Sand! The beach has a lot more 
sand than a sandbox does, though. Likewise, a mountain has a lot more height than a hill 
does, so Choice (J) is the best answer.
 
9. B. The toy train is the toy version of the real locomotive. A doll is a toy version of a real 
person. The only choice that shows a real person is Choice (B), the woman.
 
10. F. A kayak and a motorboat are both vessels for moving along the water, but the motor-
boat has a motor, and the kayak doesn’t. The motorized version of a bicycle is the motor-
cycle in Choice (F).
 
11. C. A doghouse houses a dog, and a birdcage houses a bird, Choice (C).
 
12. H. A rocket and a paper airplane both fly in the air, but the rocket is a much more techno-
logically advanced version of the paper airplane. Similarly, a computer is a much more 
technologically advanced version of an adding machine. Choice (H) is the best answer.
 
13. D. You use a knife to get peanut butter out of a jar, and you use a ladle to get soup out of a 
tureen, the object pictured in Choice (D).
 
14. G. A bracelet is worn on a wrist, but a sock isn’t worn on a ring. Just because Choice (F) is 
a piece of jewelry doesn’t mean it’s the right answer. Choice (G), foot, is correct here.
 
15. C. A cow and a pig are mammals. See whether this relationship works for the second set of 
images. A tiger is a mammal, but so are sheep and rhinos. Look at the primary relationship 
again to see whether you can narrow your options. Cows and pigs usually live together on 
farms. Tigers live in the wild. Sheep are domesticated mammals. The better answer is 
Choice (C), rhino, because rhinos, like tigers, are wild animals.
 
16. J. A paintbrush is a tool used to create a painting. Likewise, you use a pen to handwrite a 
letter, making Choice (J) the best answer. A piece of paper is also involved in creating a 
letter, but it’s not the tool for creating the letter.
 
17. A. A desk and a blackboard are both items that belong in a classroom. Both a stove and a 
refrigerator are appliances that belong in a kitchen. Choice (A) is your answer.
 
18. F. To score points in football, you propel a football through goal posts. To score points in 
basketball, you propel a basketball, Choice (F), through a net.
 
19. B. A car is powered by fuel, and a person is powered by food, Choice (B).
 
20. G. You wear a hat to protect your head during a snow shower, and you use an umbrella, 
Choice (G), to protect your head during a rain shower. See? These COOP analogies aren’t 
too tough!
Test 3: Quantitative Reasoning
 
1. B. Examine the first line. The operation that takes you from 4 to 2 could be −2, but that 
operation doesn’t apply to the second line. 2 − 2 ≠ 1, which means there must be another 
operation that fits into the boxes. Another way to go from 4 to 2 is by dividing by 2, 
an operation that also works for the second line. 2 ÷ 2 = 1. Apply the operation of ÷2 to 
the third line: 6 ÷ 2 = 3, Choice (B).
 
2. H. You get from 5 to 8 by adding 3. +3 also works for moving from 7 to 10 in the second 
line. Add 3 to 10 in the third line, and you get 13, Choice (H). Easy as pie!
 
3. C. The operation for the box in the first line could be +4 or ×5. When you consider the 
second line, you realize it has to be ×5 because 3 × 5 = 15. Apply ×5 to the third line, and 
you get Choice (C), 25.
 
4. G. The possible operations for the first line are −14 or ÷8. ÷8 works for the second line: 
32 ÷ 8 = 4. The answer is Choice (G), 7, because 56 ÷ 8 = 7.

421
 Chapter 26: Answers to COOP Practice Test 1
 
5. A. Figuring out the operation for this question may be a little trickier because you’re deal-
ing with decimals. Notice that the decimal point moves two spaces to the left when you go 
from 0.01 to 0.0001. It does the same on the second line. Move the decimal point two 
places to the left for 10 in the third line to get 0.1, Choice (A).
 
6. J. Consider the first line of this fraction-focused question. The operations that change 1⁄3 to 
2⁄3 are ×2 or +1⁄3. Which one works for the second line? 2⁄3 × 2 = 4⁄3, not 1. So the operation has 
to be +1⁄3. Add 1⁄3 to 3 to get Choice (J), 31⁄3.
 
7. D. This question is similar to the last one. 1⁄2 is the result of either 2 × 1⁄4 or 1⁄4 + 1⁄4. 2⁄3 is 2 times 
greater than 1⁄3, so the operation must be ×2. 3⁄8 × 2 is 6⁄8, which becomes 3⁄4, Choice (D), when 
reduced.
 
8. F. This square has a total of four boxes. Two of the boxes are shaded, which means the 
shaded area is 2⁄4. When you reduce 2⁄4 you get 1⁄2, Choice (F).
 
9. C. This figure is made up of six equal boxes; four of them are shaded. The shaded area is 
therefore 4⁄6, or 2⁄3 — Choice (C).
 
10. G. This figure has a total of eight equal-sized boxes. Two full boxes and two half boxes are 
shaded, which equals three fully shaded boxes. The shaded area is therefore 3⁄8, Choice (G).
 
 Recall that two half-shaded boxes equal one fully shaded box. Be sure not to count each 
individual half-shaded box as a fully shaded box on these types of questions.
 
11. B. This figure also has eight equal-sized boxes. Three of them are fully shaded, and two are 
half shaded. So you have up to four fully shaded boxes out of eight for a ratio of 4⁄8, which 
reduces to 1⁄2, Choice (B).
 
12. J. You can count nine equal-sized boxes in this figure. Four are fully shaded, and two are 
half shaded, totaling five fully shaded boxes. The shaded area is therefore 5⁄9, Choice (J).
 
13. A. This figure contains ten equal-sized boxes, five of which are shaded. The proportion of 
shaded boxes to total boxes is 5⁄10, or 1⁄2 — Choice (A).
 
14. H. This figure has ten equal-sized boxes, just like the one in the previous question. Six of 
these boxes are fully shaded, and two of ’em are half shaded, which means there are seven 
fully shaded boxes. The answer is Choice (H), 7⁄10. Don’t you wish all the COOP questions 
were this easy?
 
15. C. At first the scale questions may seem foreign to you, but the more you practice them, 
the easier they’ll become. This one tells you that the value of a square equals the value of a 
triangle. For every square on one side of the answer choices, there must be the equivalent 
of a triangle on the other side. Eliminate Choices (A), (B), and (D) because each of these 
has more figures on one side than the other. The only answer with an equal number of 
squares and triangles on both sides is Choice (C).
 
16. G. The figure tells you that for every square you must have two triangles. Choices (F) and 
(J) violate this rule. Two triangles equal one square, not four squares, so Choice (H) is 
clearly wrong. The answer is Choice (G): Two squares equal four triangles.
 
17. D. Every time you see a triangle on one side of the scale, you must see three squares on 
the other side. The two triangles on a side in Choices (A) and (B) aren’t balanced by six 
squares on the other side, so they’re not right. And just because one triangle equals three 
squares doesn’t mean one square equals three triangles. Cross out Choice (C) and pick 
Choice (D), where both sides have an equal number of squares and triangles.
 
18. H. A triangle on one side means there must be four squares on the other side. So to bal-
ance the two triangles in Choice (F), you need eight squares on the other side, not just 
one. The four triangles in Choice (G) need 16 squares to balance them! Choice (J) is wrong 
too, because it provides only six squares rather than eight to balance out the two trian-
gles. Choice (H) is correct because it balances one triangle with four squares and the other 
triangle with one triangle.

422
Part IV: Practice Makes Perfect 
 
19. A. Four squares equaling two triangles is really the same as two squares equaling one tri-
angle. So for every triangle on one side, there must be two squares on the other, which 
makes Choice (B) obviously wrong because two triangles equal four squares, not three. 
Choice (C) doesn’t balance the one triangle on one side with two squares on the other. 
Choice (D) balances the triangle with two squares but doesn’t compensate for the addi-
tional three squares next to the triangle. The answer is Choice (A): The first triangle is bal-
anced by another triangle, and the second triangle is balanced by two squares.
 
20. H. If two squares equal two triangles, then one square equals one triangle. Each shape is 
equal, so pick the answer that has equal numbers of either shape on both sides. The only 
answer that matches this qualification is Choice (H), which has two shapes on both sides.
Test 4: Verbal Reasoning—Words
 
1. A. What makes a sink a sink? Well, sinks are primarily designed to catch the water that 
comes out of the faucet, which means the best answer is Choice (A). Cold is a necessary 
element of a refrigerator, not a sink, and you don’t need food or a cloth to use a sink.
 
2. G. The purpose of skin is to protect the inside of the body from the outside elements, 
which means the best answer is Choice (G). Skin may be clean, pale, or hot, but it doesn’t 
have to be any of those three things to be skin.
 
3. B. Not all holidays are Christmas, only a few are commemorated with fireworks, and cake 
isn’t always on the holiday menu. But the purpose of holidays is always to celebrate an 
event. The best answer is Choice (B).
 
4. J. Examine each answer choice and ask yourself whether spaghetti would be spaghetti 
without it. You can have spaghetti with clam sauce, so tomatoes, Choice (F), aren’t essen-
tial. Cheese and meatballs aren’t necessary either, so Choices (G) and (H) are out. 
Spaghetti is a type of noodle, and noodles, Choice (J), are absolutely essential to the idea 
of spaghetti.
 
5. A. The three words in the question are synonyms for extreme dislike. Eliminate answers 
that are opposites — Choices (B) and (D). Condemn is a negative term, but it isn’t as simi-
lar to hate as abhor is. Pick Choice (A).
 
6. G. Narrow, slender, and thin suggest slimness. The perfect answer, also known as Choice (G), 
is right in front of you. Choices (F) and (H), broad and spacious, are opposites, and Choice (J), 
varied, is unrelated to slimness.
 
7. C. The given words are other names for long, straight objects. Choice (D), a ball, is neither 
long nor straight. Glue, Choice (B), has nothing to do with sticks. A flag may hang on a 
pole, but it’s not a pole; Choice (A) is wrong. Choice (C), staff, is the only choice that’s 
another word for stick.
 
8. J. Each of the words in the question is the name of a flower. Every answer choice is some-
what related to a flower, but only Choice (J), pansy, is the name of a flower. A leaf and a 
stem, Choices (F) and (G), are parts of a flower but not the specific names of flowers. You 
can find flowers in a garden, Choice (H), but, again, garden isn’t the name of a flower.
 
9. D. Pick out the word that isn’t the same as the others. Choices (A), (B), and (C) are words 
that mean to give in or give up. Choice (D) means to stick it out; it doesn’t belong.
 
10. J. Choices (F), (G), and (H) mean tired. Choice (J) is the opposite (and correct!) answer.
 
 You can sometimes find the word that doesn’t belong even if you don’t know what one of 
the words means. Just look at the words you do know the meaning of. If three of ’em mean 
roughly the same thing, you’ve found your answer.

 Chapter 26: Answers to COOP Practice Test 1
 
11. B. Choices (A), (C), and (D) are related to the game of baseball. Baseball doesn’t have 
goals, which means Choice (B) is your answer.
 
12. F. Choices (G), (H), and (J) are all kitchen appliances. The oddball is Choice (F); a com-
puter isn’t considered a kitchen appliance.
 
13. B. Take a few seconds to think about how the words in the first row are related. The first 
word, house, is a structure covered by the second word, roof, and for which the third 
word, wall, is a side. The first and second word in the second row name a structure, box, 
and its top, cover. Which answer choice names the side of a box? Hmm, Choice (B), per-
haps? Yes, a side is indeed a side of a box.
 
14. H. The top row names some relatives. An aunt is a female, an uncle is a male, and the 
cousin is their child. The second row begins with a female, mother, and ends with sibling. 
The answer choice that completes the group is the male counterpart to mother and the 
parent of the sibling. That’d be a father, Choice (H).
 
15. A. The three words in the top row describe degrees of flavor. Sour is the opposite of sweet, 
and cloying is excessively sweet. The last two words in the second row are varying degrees 
of spiciness, from spicy to excessively spicy. The word that begins the row should be the 
opposite of spicy. The best answer is Choice (A), mild. Choice (B) isn’t related to spici-
ness, and Choices (C) and (D) aren’t opposites of spicy (they actually provide unwarranted 
judgments about whether spicy is good or bad).
 
16. G. A purse is used to carry things, a suitcase is a larger carrying case, and a trunk is a 
really big way to carry things. The related words increase in size as they move from left to 
right. An armchair is smaller than a loveseat, which is smaller than a sofa, Choice (G). 
Choices (F) and (J) may be larger than a loveseat, but they’re not similar to a loveseat, 
which makes Choice (G) the best answer.
Test 5: Verbal Reasoning—Context
 
1. B. The first premise tells you that snowing all day equals skiing. Because the second prem-
ise says it has snowed all day, you know that we will go skiing, Choice (B). There isn’t 
enough information in the premises to make the assumptions in Choices (A), (C), or (D).
 
2. H. Because Mickey has two pets and neither pet is a dog, you can conclude that Rover the 
dog doesn’t belong to Mickey, Choice (H). You can’t make judgments about Mickey’s likes 
or wishes or whether his cat chases mice; eliminate the other answers.
 
3. C. The premises don’t tell you whether Eric’s illustration is in the book of illustrations, so 
you can’t draw the conclusions in Choices (A) and (B). You don’t know anything about the 
quality of Eric’s work either, so cross out Choice (D). The best answer is Choice (C). Because 
Eric has drawn an illustration, he must know how to draw.
 
4. J. You can safely conclude that Betsy will watch the game between the Iguanas and 
Salamanders on Sunday because Betsy watches the Iguanas every Sunday. Choice (J) is 
the best answer. You don’t know future game schedules, who’ll win the game, or how 
Betsy feels about the Salamanders, so the rest of the options are wrong.
 
5. D. Because Fenn has earned at least $5, you can conclude that he buys a plastic animal, 
Choice (D). You don’t know anything about Fenn’s earning history or the size of his collec-
tion. Whether or not the animals are expensive is a value judgment that isn’t supported by 
the statements.
 
6. F. Twins share the same parents, which means Chrissy and Ellen have the same parents, 
Choice (F). You have no information about who was born first, so Choices (G) and (J) are 
definitely wrong. The twins could have other siblings, so forget about Choice (H) too.

7. B. The premises tell you that Sean has milk and a banana with his cereal in the morning. 
They don’t tell you that he eats cereal every morning; cross out Choice (A). Nor do the 
premises tell you what Sean does and doesn’t like. Choice (B) is the only possible correct 
answer.
 
 When you’re dealing with logic questions, you can’t make conclusions about someone’s 
likes or dislikes based on his or her actions. You can only go by the information stated in 
the premises.
 
8. H. As far as you know, Mavis went to China without visiting the Great Wall; Choice (F) is 
wrong. Choices (G) and (J) make unsupported judgments about what Mavis likes and 
wants, so cross them out too. Because the Great Wall is in China, Mavis has to travel to 
China if she wants to see the Great Wall, Choice (H).
 
9. B. The premises tell you what’s stated in Choice (B) — that Neil engages in three different 
types of physical activity (jogging, walking, and biking). They don’t say what his prefer-
ences are, and they don’t compare his miles jogged to his miles biked; cut Choices (A) and 
(D). Choice (C) is unrelated to Neil, so eliminate that one too.
 
10. G. Bridget bought clothing at Greenmart, which means she must have gone there. Because 
Greenmart is downtown, Bridget must have gone downtown, Choice (G). You don’t know 
whether Greenmart sells food, what Bridget paid for the clothing, or whether Bridget has a 
job, which means you can toss out Choices (F), (H), and (J).
 
11. C. If Peggy finished four puzzles last week, she must have had spare time, Choice (C). You 
can’t assume that puzzles are Peggy’s favorite pastime, Choice (A), just because she does 
them in her spare time; the premises don’t tell you that. Given more spare time, Peggy may 
be able to finish more than four puzzles in a week; cross out Choice (D). And because you 
don’t know why Peggy has spare time, you can’t assume Choice (B).
 
12. J. You know that the bee entered one quilt in a contest, but you don’t know whether it 
entered all of its quilts. Choices (F) and (G) require you to know more about making quilts 
than is given by the premises. Elizabeth is a member of the bee, and all members work 
on each quilt. Therefore Elizabeth must have worked on the quilt that won first place, 
Choice (J).
 
 An answer choice containing a debatable word (such as all, every, none, and so on) is 
rarely correct.
 
13. A. The premises tell you that Molly’s mother picks up her mail when Molly goes on vacation, 
but they don’t indicate that’s the only time her mother picks up her mail; toss Choice (B). 
You don’t know how often Molly goes on vacation or her mother’s feelings, so eliminate 
Choices (C) and (D). If Molly’s mother can get into her house to put her mail in the kitchen, 
she must have access to the house, Choice (A).
 
14. H. You know the flowers were eaten, but you can’t conclude from the premises that the 
deer did it. Neither Choice (F) nor Choice (G) can logically be true. You don’t know what 
Mr. McDonald will do next year, so the best answer is Choice (H).
 
15. D. The most you can say is that Clayton and Courtney have been to Scandinavia, Choice (D). 
You don’t know anything that allows you to compare travel speed among types of transpor-
tation between Stockholm and Oslo. Nor do you know what time of day the train travels. 
Chuck the other answer options.
 
16. G. You know that Paula is on the Madison track team and that she has won five javelin 
throws this season. You don’t know whether those five wins occurred in the five consecu-
tive meets that Madison won; toss Choice (F). Other teams may have won more meets than 
Madison, and Paula may compete in more than just the javelin throw, which means 
Choices (J) and (H) are also wrong. Stick with Choice (G).

17. A. You may need to draw a chart like this one to keep track of Brad’s activities:
 
S 
M 
T 
W 
T 
F 
S
 
Choir 
Com Ctr 
Tennis 
Tennis 
Piano 
Tennis 
Com Ctr
 
 The premises don’t tell you that Brad plays tennis on Tuesdays, Wednesdays, and Fridays, 
but that has to be true because Brad plays three times a week and doesn’t participate in 
more than one activity per day. Choices (B), (C), and (D) require you to make unwarranted 
and subjective judgments about how Brad spends his time.
 
18. F. The ranking of length of employment from longest to shortest is Andy, Lynn, and Becky. 
Because Andy has worked longer than Becky and Becky has worked for three months, you 
know that Andy has worked longer than three months, Choice (F). Choice (G) simply isn’t 
true, and Choice (H) is an unfounded value judgment. Although you know that Lynn has 
worked longer than Becky, you don’t know exactly how much longer; consequently, 
Choice (J) is also wrong.
 
19. C. According to the premises, Larry is the first person to spot a wolf in Colorado in 60 years. 
If Larry saw the wolf, the wolf must exist; Choice (C) is the answer. Just because people 
haven’t seen wolves in Colorado for 60 years doesn’t mean wolves haven’t existed in 
Colorado during that time. Likewise, there could be other wolves in Colorado that nobody 
has spotted. None of the other answer choices work.
 
20. J. Just because Mr. Wilson coaches and teaches doesn’t mean that all coaches have to 
teach; eliminate Choice (H). You don’t know how long Mr. Wilson has coached soccer, so 
cross out Choice (G). Choice (F) has to be wrong because the time Mr. Wilson spends on 
each activity is never mentioned. If Mr. Wilson currently coaches the soccer team and that 
soccer team just completed a winning season, then Mr. Wilson has coached the soccer 
team during a winning season, Choice (J).
Test 6: Reading and Language Arts
 
1. D. The last paragraph tells you that H2O is broken up in photosynthesis to produce O2, 
which makes Choice (D) correct. Photosynthesis produces glucose, but it doesn’t break 
it up. Therefore, the answer can’t be Choice (A). Chlorophyll and CO2 are involved in the 
process of photosynthesis, but they’re not broken up to produce O2.
 
2. J. This inference question may seem a little tricky at first. The fourth paragraph covers 
light absorption, so focus your attention there. It tells you that leaves appear green 
because all the colors in white light are being absorbed by the plant except green, which 
bounces off the leaves and makes it to your eyes. Because plants are bouncing off green 
light rather than absorbing it, you can assume that they don’t use green light as an energy 
source for photosynthesis. The best answer is Choice (J).
 
3. C. The first sentence states that photosynthesis creates glucose, which is sugar. The right 
answer is Choice (C). The other choices are substances used in the process of photosyn-
thesis to create sugar.
 
4. G. The first sentence of the second paragraph states that photo means that the process 
uses light as its energy source. The only answer choice that appears in this explanation is 
Choice (G), light. Therefore, you can infer that photo means light.
 
5. C. The equation in the question paraphrases the equation in the middle of the passage. 
The third element in the equation is Choice (C), light energy. Choices (A) and (B) are 
already listed in the equation, and Choice (D) isn’t part of the photosynthesis process.

426
Part IV: Practice Makes Perfect 
 
6. J. To answer this question correctly, you must read through all the answer choices and 
cut those that aren’t true. Choice (H) doesn’t make sense because a plant’s roots aren’t 
exposed to light. The photosynthesis equation shows that the process is opposite to that 
stated in Choice (G); it uses CO2 and gives off O2. According to the end of the fourth para-
graph, the only color chlorophyll doesn’t absorb is green, which means Choice (F) is 
wrong. According to the second paragraph, the green parts of the plant make sugar. 
Photosynthesis produces sugar, Choice (J).
 
7. B. Title questions ask for the passage’s main point. The primary purpose of this passage is 
to describe the process of photosynthesis, which makes the best answer Choice (B). The 
passage isn’t about plants or glucose in general, so Choices (A) and (C) are obviously 
wrong. The debatable word everything in Choice (D) should prompt you to cross it out, too.
 
8. F. The subject of Sentence 2 is “me and my mom.” Me is an objective form and can’t be 
used in the subject of a sentence. The proper form is I. (You wouldn’t say “Me went to the 
nursery,” so you can’t say “Me and my mom went to the nursery.”) Choice (J) is wrong, 
and Choice (G) doesn’t change me to I. That leaves Choices (F) and (H). Putting another 
before yourself is standard English, which means it’s better to say “My mom and I” than 
“I and my mom.” Choice (F) is the best answer.
 
9. A. Sentence 4 contains a usage problem. You use less for nouns that can’t be counted and 
fewer for nouns that can. Because you can count flowers, scratch Choices (B), (C), and (D).
 
10. G. Using two qualifiers, such as “more lovelier,” is improper word usage. Both more and 
the suffix -er demonstrate the idea of greater just like both most and the suffix -est demon-
strate greatest. Cross out Choices (F) and (J). Choice (H) eliminates one of the qualifiers, 
but it has an improper comparison construction. You don’t say that something is more 
lovely as something else; it’s more lovely than. Choice (G) is the only answer that corrects 
the qualifier problem without adding a new issue.
 
11. C. You need to know the author’s tone in order to answer this question. In the last sen-
tence, the author describes Douglass as “a true American hero, whose vision and views 
live on today.” From that statement, you know the author admires Douglass and his influ-
ence. The answer that best reflects this admiration is Choice (C). Choice (A) is partially 
right; the author does think Douglass is a great person, but he or she wouldn’t agree that 
Douglass had little influence. Choice (B) contradicts information in the second paragraph, 
and Choice (D) is wrong because although it’s true that Douglass changed opinions about 
slavery, he wasn’t a slaveholder.
 
12. H. The passage doesn’t give ending dates for the Civil War or slavery. Nor does it provide 
the names of abolitionists other than Douglass. The best answer is Choice (H). The third 
paragraph provides the names of the newspapers.
 
13. D. The first sentence of the passage states that Douglass was an abolitionist in the 1800s. 
The 1800s made up the 19th century, Choice (D).
 
14. F. The passage makes a point of stating that Douglass attacked the institution of slavery 
rather than the people involved in it. Knowing this fact allows you to eliminate Choices (G), 
(H), and (J). The second paragraph supports Choice (F); it states that Douglass used his 
newspaper to express his ideas about slavery to a large audience.
 
15. B. The first paragraph mentions Douglass’s slaveholder. If Douglass had a slaveholder, 
he must have been a slave, Choice (B). You know Choice (D) is wrong because the third 
paragraph says that the newspaper had a large audience. Choice (A) is wrong because the 
answer doesn’t define “long time,” and the passage doesn’t suggest that the movement was 
slow. The second paragraph seems to suggest that Douglass’s influence paved the way for 
a quicker Northern response to the abolitionist movement. Choice (C) contains one of 
those pesky debatable words. Although Douglass was a major influence on the North, the 
passage doesn’t suggest that he was the only influence.

427
 Chapter 26: Answers to COOP Practice Test 1
 
16. J. This vocabulary-in-context question asks for a synonym of cement. Substitute each 
answer choice for cement in the sentence to see which one fits best. Douglass didn’t sepa-
rate, cover, or weaken a place in history. The best answer is Choice (J); Douglass did secure 
a place in history.
 
17. D. This written composition question wants to see how well you combine sentences. The 
best way to join the two sentences is Choice (D), which mentions Douglass just once and 
clearly includes all the information about him that appears in both sentences. The other 
choices either construct the combined sentence in a way that lacks parallel construction, 
Choices (A) and (C), or changes the meaning, Choice (B).
 
18. H. Eliminate sentences that are poorly constructed. Choice (F) is an incomplete sentence 
without a verb, Choice (G) uses passive voice, and Choice (J) has an improper qualifier 
(more fairer). The best answer is Choice (H); it’s constructed clearly and contains no 
usage errors.
 
19. A. Choose a sentence that leads into the specific topic of abolitionist leader Frederick 
Douglass. Choice (D) is way too general. Choice (B) is off topic; the paragraph doesn’t talk 
about the practice of slavery in other cultures. Choice (C) doesn’t work because it sug-
gests that the paragraph will discuss abolitionists who weren’t former slaves, but the para-
graph’s topic is Douglass, who was in fact a former slave. The best answer is Choice (A) 
because it leads into the topic of a particular abolitionist leader.
 
20. G. The points of the last sentence are that Douglass gives a unique portrayal of slavehold-
ers and that this portrayal attracted Northerners. Choice (G) addresses one of these 
issues, Douglass’s portrayal of slaveholders; it’s probably the best answer. The rest of the 
answers are off topic and way too general.
 
 The last sentence of a paragraph often contains clues as to what could or should come 
after it. Read it carefully, and you’ll have an easier time answering questions that want to 
know what happens next.
 
21. A. The passage mentions hockey and high school players, which makes it pretty likely that 
the Cougars are a high school hockey team, Choice (A).
 
22. J. The second paragraph describes the Clement players. The only school not mentioned in 
this paragraph is Apple River, Choice (J), which is the name of a rival team mentioned in 
the third paragraph.
 
23. C. The second paragraph contains the answer to this straightforward details question. It 
states that the goalie is Brendan Sanchez, Choice (C).
 
24. H. The third paragraph lists last year’s team record. Because the Cougars’ record was 9-5 
(9 wins and 5 losses), the team must have played 14 games, Choice (H).
 
25. B. The subject matter (hockey at Clement High School) and casual tone of this passage 
suggest that it was probably written for a high school newspaper, Choice (B).
 
26. F. You can tell the author is excited about the hockey season in the opening paragraph. 
The use of exclamation points and the positive language support picking Choice (F) as the 
best description of the author’s tone. The other choices are too negative.
 
27. A. Sentence 1 lacks parallel construction; eliminate Choice (D). Choice (B) doesn’t correct 
the problem. Although Choice (C) repairs the parallel construction problem, it introduces 
a new error by incorrectly separating objects from their prepositions. Choice (A) fixes the 
parallel construction problem without creating additional errors.
 
28. J. Sentence 2 seems fine as is, but check the other answers just to be sure. Choice (F) is an 
incomplete sentence, and Choice (G) contains improper usage (the phrase should be bene-
fits of, not benefits on). The proper construction for Choice (H) is if . . . , then, not if . . . , 
than. Choice (J) is the best answer.

428
Part IV: Practice Makes Perfect 
 
29. C. Sentence 4 contains improper usage; more healthier should be just plain healthier. 
Choice (A) doesn’t help. It contains the same improper usage issues, punctuation errors, 
and construction problems. Choice (B) is a comma splice; the comma after school should 
be a semicolon. The best answer is Choice (C).
 
30. G. The last sentence of the first paragraph says that both works “demonstrate the relation-
ship between the spiritual and material world.” The answer that paraphrases this idea is 
Choice (G). Only Beuys used mixed media and had German influences, and the first para-
graph states that the artists’ subject matters were different.
 
31. C. The first paragraph says that Beuys painted almost 400 years after El Greco painted The 
Burial of Conde Orgaz in the late 1500s, which means Beuys began painting in the 1900s. 
Choice (C) is your answer.
 
32. F. The third paragraph tells you that El Greco painted his masterworks in Spain, Choice (F). 
He trained in Crete and Italy but apparently didn’t paint his masterworks there.
 
33. A. The main point of the passage is to compare El Greco and Beuys, which makes Choice (A) 
the winning answer. Choice (D) is too general a title for the passage. Choice (B) is wrong 
because the author doesn’t make judgments about which artist is better, and Choice (C) is 
absurd because the two artists lived in completely different centuries and therefore couldn’t 
have been friends.
 
34. J. The fourth paragraph tells you that World War II, Choice (J), greatly influenced Beuys. 
None of the other choices is even mentioned in the passage.
 
35. D. In the last paragraph, you read that El Greco “most often recreated specific religious 
events.” Choice (D) is therefore the best answer. Choice (C) was the subject matter of Beuys.
 
36. F. You’re looking for what’s not true, so eliminate true statements. El Greco’s work was com-
missioned by churches (see Paragraph 5), his art recorded history (also in Paragraph 5), 
and his painting portrayed interaction between the spiritual and material (Paragraphs 1, 2, 
and 5). He received formal training in Crete and Italy, which means Choice (F) isn’t true and 
is therefore the right answer.
 
37. B. Choice (B) combines the sentences in the clearest way. Choice (A) is awkward, Choice 
(C) is a comma splice, and Choice (D) lacks parallel construction.
 
38. H. You can’t use which to refer to people, so Choice (F) is wrong. Also, you choose 
between two things and among three or more, so throw out Choice (G). The verb emerges 
in Choice (J) should be plural because the subject (themes) is plural. The sentence with-
out any errors is Choice (H).
 
39. D. The paragraph describes a specific painting, which means the topic sentence should 
introduce that painting. Choices (A) and (B) introduce painting in general and are too 
broad for this paragraph. With Choice (C), you’d expect a paragraph on the city of Toledo 
rather than a painting. Choice (D) introduces the painting and provides its name, which is 
missing from the rest of the paragraph; it’s the best answer.
 
40. G. Because the paragraph ends by stating that the painting has two main settings, it makes 
sense that the next paragraph would talk more about those settings. The other answer 
choices reference topics that aren’t justified by the end of the paragraph.
Test 7: Mathematics
 
1. A. This subtraction problem is pretty easy. Just make sure you line up the decimal points 
before you subtract: 
 
  

429
 Chapter 26: Answers to COOP Practice Test 1
 
2. H. Percent is equivalent to per 100, which means you show 0.03% as a fraction by placing 
0.03 over 100, like this: 0.03⁄100. To get rid of the decimal point, move it to the right two places 
for both the numerator and the denominator. The fraction then becomes 3⁄10,000, which is 
Choice (H).
 
3. D. To multiply like numbers with exponents, you keep the base the same and add the 
exponents. The base in this problem is 2, and the sum of the exponents is 5. Therefore 
your answer is 25, Choice (D). 
 
4. H. Look carefully at all the answer choices. A couple of ’em are easy to eliminate because 3⁄8 
shares the same denominator with Choices (F) and (J). You know that 7⁄8 and 5⁄8 are greater 
than 3⁄8, which means you can eliminate both of those choices. 4⁄8 is equal to 1⁄2, which means 
3⁄8 is less than 1⁄2; Choice (G) is wrong. The answer is Choice (H).
 
5. D. The number 1 in this problem is in the ten thousand’s place, which means its value is 
10,000, Choice (D).
 
6. J. All the answer choices are decimals. 2⁄8 simplifies to 1⁄4, which you know is 0.25. 
Therefore, 4.75 + 0.25 is 5, Choice (J).
 
 Adding a fraction to a decimal (or vice versa) is easier if both values are in the same form. 
See Chapter 10 for help converting one to the other.
 
7. A. Multiply the two numbers and make sure you put the decimal point in the proper place. 
Because there are three total digits to the right of the decimal points in the numbers being 
multiplied, the product must have three digits to the right of the decimal point: 
 
  
 
 
 Dropping the zero gives you Choice (A). If you picked Choice (C), you probably thought it 
was correct because it had three digits to the right of the decimal, but you didn’t take into 
consideration that the original answer had an ending zero that took one of the places to 
the right of the decimal.
 
8. G. The fraction of two pieces of pizza in an eight-piece pizza is 2⁄8, or 1⁄4. 1⁄4 expressed as a 
percentage is 25%, Choice (G).
 
9. D. Line up the decimals and subtract: 
 
  
 
 
 The answer is 0.512, Choice (D).
 
10. H. The formula for finding distance is Rate × Time = Distance. The rate is 65 miles per 
hour, and 30 minutes is a half hour, or 0.5. To find the distance, multiply 65 × 0.5, which is 
32.5 miles — Choice (H).
 
11. A. Follow the order of operations (PEMDAS). Parentheses are first, but there are two oper-
ations in the parentheses — subtraction and multiplication. The order of operations dictates 
that you multiply before you subtract. Do that to get 2 × 6 = 12. Now subtract 12 from 4: 
4 − 12 = −8. The remaining operation is to multiply −5 and −8: −5 × −8 = 40, Choice (A). If 
you picked Choice (C), you subtracted within the parentheses before you multiplied. If you 
went with Choice (B) or Choice (D), you mixed up your positives and negatives.
 
12. G. Figure out what percentage of the budget goes to research and product development 
(R&D) by adding up the percentages of the other expenditures and subtracting that number 
from 100% (total expenditures): R&D = 100% − (40% + 30% + 15%). R&D = 100% − 85%, so 
R&D = 15%. To change that percentage to a fraction, put 15 over 100 and reduce: 15⁄100 = 3⁄20, 
Choice (G).

13. D. Zoe’s total earnings consist of her salary of $200/week + her commission. Here’s how 
you can set up the equation: E = $200 + ($3,500 × 5%). $3,500 × 5% is $175. $175 + $200 is 
$375. Zoe earns a total of $375 for the week, Choice (D).
 
14. F. Four hundred twenty five thousand looks like this: 425,000. Add 45 and the answer is 
425,045, Choice (F).
 
15. D. There are 20 total games (5 + 13 + 2). Don’t stop there and pick Choice (A), though. 1⁄5 of 
20 is 4. The answer is Choice (D).
 
16. H. This question asks you to find 9⁄12 of 48. Of means multiply, so the equation is x = 9⁄12 × 48. 
If multiplying 9 by 48 and dividing by 12 takes too long, you can make the problem easier 
by dividing 12 and 48 by the common factor of 12. Doing so leaves you with 9⁄1 × 4⁄1 = 36, 
Choice (H).
 
17. D. The correct answer must be a set of numbers that’s less than 3 and greater than −1. 
Choice (D) is the only option that doesn’t contain either of these numbers.
 
18. F. Solve for x: 3(4x) + 7 = 43; 12x + 7 = 43; 12x = 36; x = 3. The answer is Choice (F).
 
19. A. Twelve inches are in a foot, so an inch is 1⁄12 of a foot, Choice (A).
 
20. F. This one’s easy as long as you know that the formula for the area of a triangle is 1⁄2bh. 
Start plugging away: A = 1⁄2 × 14 × 8. A = 7 × 8, which is 56 inches square, Choice (F).
 
21. B. 10 doesn’t go into 125, so eliminate Choices (A), (C), and (D). You want Choice (B).
 
22. H. If three of the salespeople made 50 percent of the sales, the other two made the other 
50 percent. Just find out what 50% of $96,520 is, and you’re home free! You don’t have to 
fully divide $96,520 by 2 to choose the right answer; just estimate: $96,520 rounds up to 
$100,000. Half of $100,000 is $50,000, so scratch Choices (F) and (G) because they’re way 
under that amount. Given that you rounded up, you know the answer must be less than 
$50,000, which means the answer is Choice (H).
 
23. B. This one’s more like a vocabulary question than a math question. A pentagon is a five-
sided figure, Choice (B).
 
24. J. You know that x is any number between −2 and 2. It’s less than 2, so Choice (F) is true. 
Choices (G) and (H) could be true, so forget about ’em. The false statement is Choice (J); 
x can’t be less than −2.
 
 When faced with an exception question (one that asks what’s not true), rephrase the ques-
tion so you know for sure you’re looking for an answer that must be false.
 
25. B. For this question, you create an equation, but you don’t have to solve it. And means 
add, so a hat is y + x. 4 hats would be 4 times that: 4(y + x). Choice (B) is the answer.
 
26. H. A negative times a negative is always positive; Choice (H) is correct.
 
27. B. 102 = 10 × 10, which = 100. 4 × 100 is 400, Choice (B).
 
28. G. Because of means multiply, 200% of the price Pat pays ($20) is the same as 2 × 20. Pat 
sells each pair for $40, Choice (G).
 
29. C. Put your finger on Bluebird Mall on the map. Move your finger to the left to determine 
that the mall’s vertical coordinate is D. Move your finger up to find that 4 is the horizontal 
coordinate. The coordinate pair is D4, Choice (C).
 
30. G. Jill follows the proper order of operations (PEMDAS) by solving the information in the 
parentheses first, multiplying next, and adding last. Pick Choice (G).
 
31. D. Right angles are always 90°. The answer is Choice (D).
 
32. F. First, distribute the 3: 3x + 9 = 36. Then subtract 9 from both sides of the equation. 
Finally, solve for x: 3x = 27, and x = 9, Choice (F).

 Chapter 26: Answers to COOP Practice Test 1
 
33. C. A quadrilateral has four sides. The only answer choice with four sides is Choice (C), 
a square. A pentagon has five sides, a triangle has three, and an octagon has eight.
 
34. H. The formula for circumference is 2rπ. So a circle with a radius of 3 has a circumference 
of 2(3)π, or 6π units — Choice (H).
 
35. C. To solve this problem you have to figure out what numbers meet all the possible values 
for both x and y. Possible values for x are −1, 0, 1, 2, 3, and so on. Possible values for y 
are 2, 1, 0, −1, −2, and so on. The values in common are −1, 0, 1, and 2. Choices (B) and (D) 
contain some of these possible values, but the best answer option is Choice (C) because it 
contains all the possible values. Choice (A) contains a value that’s incorrect.
 
36. J. The total amount Alexis owes is the original loan amount plus the interest: x = $13,000 + 
($13,000 × 10%). First, figure out the interest: $13,000 × 0.1 = $1,300. Then add that to 
$13,000: $13,000 + $1,300 = $14,300, which is Choice (J).
 
37. B. The question asks only about average inches grown this year, so the fact that Bob grew 
more this year than last is irrelevant. Bob grew 6 inches this year, and there are 12 months 
in a year. Consequently, the average number of inches Bob grew per month was 6⁄12, or 1⁄2, 
Choice (B).
 
38. F. The factors of 45 are 5 and 9. The number 5 is already prime, so you should list it as one 
of the prime factors. Eliminate Choices (G) and (H) because they don’t contain 5. The 
other factor, 9, contains the factors of 3 × 3. Because 3 is prime, the prime factors of 45 are 
5 × 3 × 3, or 5 × 32 — Choice (F). Eliminate Choice (J) because 9 isn’t prime.
 
39. A. Figure out the point on the x-axis first. Start at the point where the x-axis and y-axis 
cross and count the spaces to the right until you reach Point A. Point A is 2 spaces to the 
right, which means it’s a +2. Point A on the y-axis is 1 space below the x-axis, which means 
it’s −1. Thus, the correct answer is Choice (A). Choice (B) would be above the x-axis, and 
Choices (C) and (D) would be to the left of the y-axis and above the x-axis.
 
40. F. The chart that gives the best visual of the relationship among fractions of a whole is the 
pie chart, Choice (F). If you didn’t get this one right, refer to Chapter 13 for a refresher on 
which charts are best for showing specific types of information.

ust what you always wanted — another opportunity to practice for the COOP. Contain 
your excitement, please.
 This practice test is very similar to the actual COOP, but the exam you take on test day may 
have a different number of questions or slightly different time limits. Blame the discrepancy 
on those dastardly test-makers.
You’ll get the most out of this practice experience if you try to make it as much like the real 
thing as you can. Following are some suggestions for doing just that:
 
✓ Find a place where you won’t be distracted (which means you may want to tell your 
friends you won’t be available for a few hours).
 
✓ Aim to take this test at about the same time of day — likely pretty early in the morning — 
as the time of your scheduled COOP.
 
✓ Tear out the answer sheet in this chapter and mark your answers on it by filling in the 
appropriate bubbles.
 
✓ Scribble notes and computations in the margins of the test questions.
 
✓ Time yourself on each section. When the time is up, move on to the next section. 
(Remember: As much as you may want to, you can’t go back to a section to answer 
any skipped questions.)
 
✓ Give yourself about 10 to 15 minutes to relax between the fourth and fifth tests. You’ll 
probably be given a similar break on test day.
When you’re all done with this practice test, head to Chapter 28 to check your answers.

Test 6: Reading and Language Arts
Time: 40 minutes
Directions: Read this passage about a story in the Old Testament and answer Questions 1–7.
 
The Old Testament book of Ruth follows the book of Judges and is generally considered 
to take place during the time of Judges, which was a low point in Israel’s moral, political, 
and religious history. As opposed to the largely dark and pessimistic tone of the historical 
book of Judges, the tone of Ruth’s story is uplifting and bright. Its unknown author has fash-
ioned a remarkably balanced and beautifully written Hebrew short story that provides an 
intimate look into the private life of a young Moabite girl and the Israelite family she 
chooses to adopt as her own.
 
During a period of famine in Judah, an Israelite family travels to Moab to find provisions. 
Moabites and Israelites have had a history of hostility toward each other, and the Moabites 
worship gods other than Yahweh. However, the two sons in the family find Moabite wives, 
and all goes well until all the male members of the family die, leaving the mother, Naomi, 
alone with her two Moabite daughters-in-law, named Ruth and Orpah. Embittered and deso-
late because of the death of her husband and sons, Naomi decides to return to Judah. Ruth 
chooses to devote herself to Naomi and Naomi’s God, the God of Israel, and accompanies 
Naomi back to Bethlehem to live with and care for her there.
 
It is the spring harvest in Bethlehem, and Ruth gleans the fields to provide food for her 
and her mother-in-law. Boaz, a goodly owner of one of the fields and a relative of Naomi’s 
late husband, sees Ruth and encourages her to pick only from his fields so that she might 
avoid the harassment of men at the other fields.
 
According to Hebrew custom, the nearest relative of a deceased husband is required to 
marry his widow to provide the deceased with an heir. Naomi encourages Ruth to approach 
Boaz on the threshing floor in the traditional manner to show that she is willing to be his 
bride. Trusting Naomi and her God, Ruth does so. Boaz honors Ruth’s request by covering 
her with his cloth, but he must first make sure that another, closer relative does not wish to 
use his right to marry Ruth. The other relative refuses his right. Boaz marries Ruth, and 
they have a son. Therefore, Naomi’s fullness is restored; she is well cared for, and her family 
line is reestablished through the obedience and loyalty of Ruth.

Directions: Read this story and answer Questions 11–18.
 
Zoe and her friends enjoyed figure skating on ponds close to their homes in Winthrop, 
Maine. They all dreamed of becoming good enough skaters that they would be able to com-
pete in the junior division preliminaries in Portland during next month’s winter break.
 
The junior division tryouts brought skaters from around New England to compete on an 
indoor ice skating rink. Zoe and her friends had never skated on an indoor rink, and they 
were very uneasy. The competition on the indoor rink was fierce, but after three full days of 
competitive routines, Zoe was one of the top six finalists, which entitled her to compete one 
month later at the regionals in Albany, New York.
 
During the days leading up to the event in Albany, Zoe practiced her routines on the local 
pond and got some help from a coach at an indoor rink in Augusta about a half hour away. 
Every afternoon when the school bell rang, Zoe ran out to the parking lot and hopped in the 
passenger side of the family’s 1992 pickup truck to drive to the rink. Her younger brother 
was squeezed in between her father and her. Zoe drowned out his nonstop chattering to 
concentrate on what she would be working on with her coach that day.
 
Her brother was still jabbering incessantly when he, Zoe, and their father set out for the 
six-hour drive to the competition in Albany. During the entire drive, Zoe had butterflies in 
her stomach. Then waiting for her turn on the ice was excruciating. She was so nervous 
when she stepped out onto the ice that she tripped a bit as she was striking her initial pose. 
She regained her composure, though, and felt more and more exhilarated as she completed 
each jump and turn. She felt that she should have won the skating competition, but the 
judges chose otherwise. “You have to earn your stripes,” her father told her as they left the 
rink. “Judges don’t usually place first-timers.” On the long road home, Zoe’s disappointment 
slowly changed to excited anticipation as she realized that next year she wouldn’t be a 
“first-timer” anymore.

Directions: Read this paragraph that relates to the essay and answer Questions 19 and 20.
 
Their daily practice routines consisted of an hour of practice at the local pond that Zoe’s 
father cleared after significant snowfall accumulations. Zoe’s father wasn’t able to clear the 
ice until he returned home from work. He usually ended his workday at 3 p.m., and it took him 
about an hour to clear the ice. Therefore, on days that it snowed, Zoe and her friends were 
not able to skate on the pond until 4 p.m. It became dark at 5 p.m., and, because Zoe wasn’t 
allowed to skate after dark, on days that it snowed heavily, Zoe only skated for one hour.

that silent films use to communicate their 
stories?
 
(F) larger-than-life gestures
 
(G) constant action
 
(H) dialogue
 
(J) stereotypical characters
Directions: Read the following passage about silent films and answer Questions 21–26.
 
What silent films lack in subtlety, they make up for in exaggeration. Without assistance 
from dialogue, silent films have to use other means to get their points across. One-
dimensional characters, exaggerated movements, ceaseless action, and expressive musical 
scores compensate for the lack of words.
 
Because characters cannot be developed through conversation, silent film personalities 
are essentially one-dimensional. Bad guys are all bad, and good guys are all good. 
Supporting characters are often stereotypes included just to show the theme or add humor.
 
Silent film characters cannot tell the audience what they are thinking, so they must show 
it. Therefore, physical actions and gestures are exaggerated far beyond normal movement. 
For example, a character could demonstrate puzzlement by aggressively scratching his 
head. Without the use of words, silent film stars must talk with their bodies.
 
To maintain the attention of its audience, the silent film is a frenzy of perpetual activity. 
Scenes change by the second, and the transition between them is choppy. Silent films may 
contain car chases, foot chases, jail breaks, roller skating escapades, and dance numbers, 
all occurring in a matter of minutes. When action cannot clarify the story, placards express-
ing dialogue, thoughts, and the passage of time fill the void.
 
Complementing this frenetic motion is an expressive musical score. Unlike modern film, 
the musical score provides much more than background accompaniment. The music plays 
as large a role in the silent film as dialogue does in the “talkies.” Ominous chords signal 
danger, fast-paced jingles heighten chase scenes, and singing violins encourage romance. 
In the absence of words, silent films employ creativity and ingenuity to tell their stories.

(B) a bird
 
(C) a dinosaur
 
(D) an herbivore
Directions: Read this essay on the digestive system and answer Questions 30–38.
 
The purpose of the digestive system is to break down food into nutrients and absorb 
nutrients. This process starts with the mouth. Some animals suck in their food whole and 
send it right to the stomach. Others use their teeth to slice, grind, or crush their food before 
they swallow. Teeth are specialized for the typical diet of the animal, so if teeth are wide 
and flat, the animal is probably an herbivore that needs to grind up leaves and other plant 
material. On the other hand, if an animal’s teeth are sharp and pointy, it is probably a carni-
vore that needs to kill its food and slice it up into manageable chunks.
 
After coming in through the mouth, food goes down a tube called the esophagus and 
ends up in the stomach. Muscles lining the esophagus help push the food down to the stom-
ach. Most animals have a very acidic stomach that starts breaking down food and kills off 
some of the bacteria that the food could contain. Stomach acid is very good at breaking 
down proteins and dissolving minerals and sugars.
 
After the stomach, the food goes to the small intestine, which is where most of the break-
down occurs. The longer the food stays in the small intestine, the more time it has for diges-
tion. That’s why the small intestine in humans is about six feet long! Digestive enzymes are 
produced in the pancreas and then sent to the small intestine where they systematically 
break down all the proteins, carbohydrates, lipids, and nucleic acids. The liver also helps 
out by producing a nasty green substance called bile that is sent to the small intestine. Bile 
helps to break up fats and oils. The lining of the small intestine absorbs nutrients and sends 
them into the bloodstream where they are delivered to the rest of the body.
 
After the small intestine comes the large intestine, which is mostly just a storage area. 
Whatever is left over after digestion in the small intestine is kept in the large intestine until 
the animal can find a convenient time to eliminate it.

results which means you have to get it 
fixed right away.
 
(J) If the appendix ruptures, then it would

(D) The large intestine has a peculiar 
 feature.
Directions: Read this paragraph related to the essay and answer Questions 39 and 40.
 
The large intestine has a little dead-end area called the vermiform appendix. This part of 
the organ does not appear to serve any function at all. Sometimes excess bacteria builds up 
inside the appendix, which makes it swell up and causes appendicitis. A ruptured appendix 
may be deadly if it is not treated properly.

Answers to COOP Practice Test 2
You’ve finished taking the second COOP practice test, but you’re not done yet. Now it’s 
time to check your answers. We strongly encourage you to read through all the answer 
explanations, even for those questions you answered correctly. You may pick up an addi-
tional helpful tidbit that’ll help you on the real test. Of course, if you don’t have the time or 
just plain aren’t interested in reading delightful explanations, you can check your work 
using the abbreviated answer key at the end of this chapter.
Test 1: Sequences
 
1. C. Notice that the shaded star in Choice (C) appears in each of the first three sets. It’s 
likely that the last set needs a shaded star, too. Examine the pattern of the sequence to see 
whether putting the shaded star at the end makes sense. The second set in the sequence is 
the reverse of the first. With Choice (C) placed at the end, the fourth set is the reverse of 
the third. Choice (C) is correct.
 
2. H. The sets add a figure as they progress. Each set alternates unshaded right-facing right 
triangles with shaded left-facing right triangles. The third set has four symbols ending with 
a shaded triangle, so it makes sense that the last set would contain five symbols and end 
with an unshaded triangle, much like the set in Choice (H).
 
3. B. All three of the full sets contain four of the same symbol. To complete the pattern, the 
last set should contain four of the same symbol. Choice (B) completes the set.
 
4. J. The second set is the reverse of the pattern in the first set: three of one symbol and one 
of the other. The pattern of the third set is one symbol, two of the other symbol, and one 
of the first symbol. The answer that creates the same pattern with the symbols switched in 
the fourth set is Choice (J): ❑❑.
 
5. D. The last symbol of the first set is the same as the first symbol of the second set. To 
maintain that pattern, find an answer with a first symbol that’s the same as the last symbol 
of the second set and a last symbol that’s the same as the first symbol of the last set. 
Choice (D) begins with the second set’s diamond and ends with the last set’s triangle.
 
6. G. All the answer choices are double-pointed arrows, so focus on the shading. The shading 
pattern in the first two sets is the same: three unshaded arrows and one shaded arrow. 
The shading of the arrows in the fourth set begins in the same way as the arrows in the 
third set. So you can choose the answer with the arrows that are shaded in the same way 
as the last two arrows in the third set (which are unshaded). Therefore, the option with 
two unshaded arrows, Choice (G), is the answer that completes the pattern.
 
7. C. The numbers in this sequence increase by 3. 15 + 3 = 18, Choice (C).
 
8. F. The numbers in this sequence decrease by 20. The last number is 20 less than 20, which 
is 0 — Choice (F).
 
9. B. Each set contains three numbers that increase by 2. The last number of the last set 
should be 2 more than 42, which is 44 — Choice (B).
 
10. H. The second number in each set is twice the first number. To find the first number in the 
last set, divide 12 by 2 to get 6, Choice (H).

472
Part IV: Practice Makes Perfect 
 
11. A. The last number in each set is the product of the first two numbers in the set. 12 ÷ 6 = 2. 
The second number in the last set must be 2, Choice (A).
 
12. G. The third number in each set is the sum of the first two numbers. Because 6 + 3 = 9, the 
answer that completes the pattern is 3, Choice (G).
 
13. D. The numbers in each set decrease in value, so Choices (A) and (B) are wrong because 
they’re greater than 9. Focus on the last two numbers in each set. 5 – 5 = 0, and 10 – 5 = 5. 
Because the last number is 5 less than the second number, the answer is 9 – 5 = 4, 
Choice (D).
 
14. F. Each set contains the letters ABC; eliminate Choice (J) because it doesn’t contain ABC. 
The first number in each set increases by 1 as the sets progress. Choice (G) doesn’t follow 
this pattern, so it’s wrong. The numbers within each set decrease rather than increase, 
which means the correct answer is Choice (F).
 
15. A. Here’s where knowing your alphabet (and jotting it down in your test booklet) comes in 
handy. Each set lists the letters of the alphabet in reverse order, and the last letter of the 
following set is the letter that comes alphabetically right after the first letter in the preced-
ing set. What does this mean to you? That the last letter in the missing set should be J 
because J comes after I (which is the first letter in the third set). Confused? Hang in there! 
Eliminate Choices (B) and (C) because their last letters aren’t Js. Now focus on the num-
bers. All the even numbers in the sets are superscript, and the odds are subscript. Choice 
(D) has subscript even numbers and superscript odds, which means it can’t be the right 
answer. Choice (A) follows the pattern properly all the way around.
 
16. H. This sequence skips every other letter in the alphabet. Refer to the alphabet you’ve 
written in your test booklet. Start at T, skip over U, and select V — Choice (H).
 
17. D. These letters are in reverse alphabetical order. Choice (D), i, comes before j.
 
18. G. The first three letters in each set are in alphabetical order. Then you skip a letter to get 
the fourth. Toss out Choice (F) because it doesn’t begin with letters that are in alphabeti-
cal order. Cut Choices (H) and (J) too because they don’t skip a letter to get to the fourth 
letter in their sets. Choice (G) is the only set that follows the pattern.
 
19. B. The first and third letters in each set follow the order of the alphabet. The second and 
fourth letters move in reverse order from the end of the alphabet. The third set should 
begin with an E; Choices (A) and (C) are wrong. The letter that comes before W is V, so the 
second letter of the third set should be V, as in Choice (B).
 
20. J. The first and third sets follow reverse alphabetical order. The fifth set should maintain 
that reverse order. The letter that comes before U is T, which means the fifth set should 
begin with T. The only answer that begins with T is Choice (J).
Test 2: Analogies
 
1. A. A bird lives in a nest. A bat lives in a cave, Choice (A), not your house (we hope!).
 
2. H. A bow is used to shoot an arrow in the same way that a slingshot is used to shoot a 
stone, Choice (H).
 
3. C. The fruit of an apple tree is an apple. The fruit of a coconut palm tree is a coconut, 
Choice (C). Palm trees grow palm leaves, but the leaves aren’t their fruit.
 
4. G. A pew belongs in a church just as a desk belongs in a school, Choice (G).
 
5. B. A pebble is a smaller version of a boulder; a cottage is a smaller version of a mansion. 
The answer is Choice (B).

6. J. Create a sentence out of the relationship between cloud and rain: A cloud produces rain. 
Apply that sentence to chicken: A chicken produces eggs, Choice (J).
 
7. D. A ring belongs on a finger, and an ornament belongs on a Christmas tree, Choice (D). 
However, using that sentence you may have logically thought an ornament belongs on a 
hook, Choice (B). Try making your sentence as specific as possible: A ring adorns a finger 
like an ornament adorns a Christmas tree. Tada! No confusion with that one.
 
8. J. A toy soldier is the toy version of a real soldier. The rubber ducky in Choice (J) is the 
toy version of a real duck (but not a chicken, so you can’t pick Choice (F)).
 
9. A. The purpose of a library is to house books. The purpose of a garage is to house a car. 
Choice (A) is the best answer.
 
10. H. The shaded circle is the opposite of the unshaded circle, and the sun is the opposite of 
the moon (because they appear in the sky at different times). Choice (H) is correct.
 
11. B. A piece of wood is a component of a house like thread is a component of a shirt, 
Choice (B).
 
12. H. A scuba diver belongs in the ocean, and a rabbit belongs in a hole, Choice (H).
 
13. C. A cat chases a mouse, and a dog chases a rabbit, Choice (C). You may have been tempted 
to pick Choice (A), but a dog doesn’t chase a bone the way a cat chases a mouse.
 
14. G. You use soap and a cloth to wash, and you use skis and poles, Choice (G), to ski.
 
15. D. In the city, you use a car for transportation. On a farm, you use a horse for transporta-
tion. The best answer is Choice (D).
 
16. F. A deck of cards is a group that one card is a member of. A month is a group of days that 
one day is a member of. Choice (F) is your answer.
 
17. C. A necessary part of an angel is its wings, and a necessary part of a bicycle is its handle-
bars, Choice (C). A basket can be a part of a bicycle, but it’s not a necessary part.
 
18. F. Dynamite is used to break up a mountanside like a wrecking ball is used to break up an 
old building, Choice (F).
 
19. D. An apple and an orange are fruits that grow on trees. A potato and a carrot, Choice (D), 
are foods from the root of a plant (called tubers). A tomato is a fruit, and broccoli is the 
stem and flower; neither is a root. Also, a seed may be underground, but it isn’t a tuber.
 
20. F. A small part of a daisy is a petal, and a small part of a rain shower is a raindrop, Choice (F).
Test 3: Quantitative Reasoning
 
1. C. The operation that takes you from 4 to 2 could be either –2 or ÷2. To go from 8 to 6, 
though, you must subtract 2. 6 – 2 = 4, Choice (C).
 
2. F. The operation in the first line could be either +2 or ×2. A glance at the second line tells 
you it’s +2: 8 + 2 = 10, Choice (F).
 
3. A. The operation could be +6 or ×3. When you consider the second line, you realize it must 
be ×3 because 4 × 3 = 12. Apply ×3 to the third line, and you get Choice (A), 15.
 
4. G. The possible operations for the first line are –20 or ÷5. The second option, ÷5, works for 
the second line. The answer is Choice (G) because 100 ÷ 5 = 20.
 
5. D. The operation in the first line could be ×2 or +1⁄2. However, you know it’s ×2 when you 
look at the second line. 2⁄3 × 2 = 4⁄3, which simplifies to 11⁄3, Choice (D).
 
6. G. To go from 0.3 to 3, move the decimal point one place to the right. This move works for 
the second line, too. Move the decimal point in the same way for 0.25, and you wind up 
with 2.5, Choice (G).

474
Part IV: Practice Makes Perfect 
 
7. B. Figuring out the operation in this problem is easier if you just look at the second line. 
Going from 1 to 11⁄8 means the operation must be +1⁄8. 3⁄8 + 1⁄8 = 4⁄8, or 1⁄2 — Choice (B).
 
8. H. This square has a total of four boxes. One box is shaded, which means the shaded area 
is 1⁄4, Choice (H).
 
9. A. This figure is made up of six equal-sized boxes, three of which are shaded. The shaded 
area is therefore 3⁄6, or 1⁄2 — Choice (A).
 
10. H. This figure has a total of six equal-sized boxes. Two full boxes and two half boxes are 
shaded, which equals three fully shaded boxes altogether. The shaded area is therefore 3⁄6, 
or 1⁄2, which is Choice (H). If you picked Choice (G), you incorrectly counted each half-
shaded box as a fully shaded box.
  Don’t fall for the COOP’s dirty tricks in the Quantitative Reasoning section. Keep in mind 
that two half-shaded boxes equal one fully shaded box, and you’re set.
 
11. B. This figure has eight equal-sized boxes. One of them is fully shaded, and two are half 
shaded. This adds up to two fully shaded boxes out of eight, or 2⁄8, which reduces to 1⁄4 — 
Choice (B).
 
12. F. This figure has eight equal-sized boxes. Two are fully shaded, and two are half shaded, 
creating three fully shaded boxes. The shaded area is therefore 3⁄8, Choice (F).
 
13. C. This figure contains nine equal-sized boxes, three of which are fully shaded and two of 
which are half shaded. That means you have four shaded boxes out of nine total boxes. 
The answer is 4⁄9, Choice (C).
 
14. F. Looks like you have eight equal-sized boxes, three of which are fully shaded and two of 
which are half shaded. You therefore have four fully shaded boxes, which makes the 
answer 4⁄8, or 1⁄2 — Choice (F).
 
15. C. This scale question tells you that the value of a square equals the value of a triangle. For 
every square on one side of the answer choices, there must be a triangle on the other side. 
Eliminate Choices (A), (B), and (D) because each of these has more figures on one side 
than the other. The only answer with an equal number of squares and triangles on both 
sides is Choice (C).
 
16. G. You must have three triangles or one square on one side of the scale for every square 
on the other side. The answer that meets this requirement is Choice (G); it balances the 
two squares on the left side with one square and three triangles on the right side.
 
17. D. This is the same scale you see in Question 16, which means every square has to be bal-
anced by another square or three triangles. Choice (D) balances the two squares on the 
right side with six triangles on the left side.
 
18. J. Four squares equaling two triangles is the same thing as two squares equaling one trian-
gle. So, for every triangle on one side, there has to be the equivalent of two squares on the 
other side. Choice (F) is wrong because a triangle and a square aren’t equal. Also, two 
squares equal one triangle, not the other way around, so Choice (G) is wrong too. To bal-
ance the triangle and square in Choice (H), you’d need three squares on the other side, 
which is what you see in Choice (J), the correct answer.
 
19. C. For every triangle, there must be three squares or another triangle on the other side of 
the scale. The square and triangle on the left side of Choice (C) are nicely balanced by the 
four squares on the right side.
 
20. F. This scale may seem a bit complicated at first, but think about it for a moment. If two 
squares equal one square and one triangle, then one square equals one triangle. You just 
need to find the answer that has the same number of symbols on each side. The answer 
that meets this requirement is Choice (F), with a total of three symbols on each side.

1. A. Without water, Choice (A), there’d be no ocean. Period.
 
2. H. You can have a pizza without anchovy, pepperoni, or tomato, but not without a crust, 
Choice (H).
 
3. B. If you were expecting trees to be among the options, get over your shock that they 
aren’t and start cutting any answers that aren’t necessary. Sun isn’t a requirement for a 
forest; consider the rain forest. Picnics are fun, but they’re not a necessary element to a 
forest. A forest may have grass, but it doesn’t have to have grass to be a forest. It does 
have to contain some plant life, though. Foliage, Choice (B), is the best answer.
 
4. F. One of the traits that makes mammals mammals is hair/fur, Choice (F). Mammals don’t 
typically lay eggs or have scales, and animals other than mammals have legs.
 
5. B. The last two words are tools used by the first word, carpenter. Wood, Choice (B), 
is another element carpenters use in their trade. They don’t need paper, puppies, or 
 jackhammers.
 
6. H. The three words in the question are different kinds of sciences, and Choice (H) is 
another kind of science. Choices (F) and (J) are courses but not science courses. Finally, 
rocks relate to geology but not to the other listed sciences.
 
7. C. Cuff, sleeve, and collar are parts of a shirt. The answer that’s also a part of a shirt is 
Choice (C). Choices (A) and (D) are items of clothing that contain cuffs, sleeves, and col-
lars, but they don’t name parts of a shirt.
 
8. J. The given words list different names for a fire. Inferno, Choice (J), is another name for a 
fire. Choices (G) and (H) are related to fire, but they aren’t synonyms for fire.
 
9. D. Pick out the word that’s different from the others. Choices (A), (B), and (C) are all planets. 
The moon isn’t a planet, which makes Choice (D) your answer.
 
10. J. A sedan, a truck, and a car are all four-wheeled vehicles. Choice (J), a motorcycle, is 
 different because it’s a two-wheeled vehicle.
 
11. C. Choices (A), (B), and (D) are names of particular animals. Choice (C) is a general category 
of animal; therefore, it’s the one that doesn’t belong.
 
12. G. A ruler, yardstick, and compass are concrete tools you use to measure length or direc-
tion. A mile, Choice (G), is an intangible term for a measurement.
 
13. A. You can make a sentence with the words in the top row: Paint is what an artist uses to 
create a painting. Try it with the second row: Clay is what a potter uses to create _____. 
Potters create pots, Choice (A). They use kilns, but they don’t create them.
 
14. G. The morning is the start of the day, noon is the middle, and night is the end. Need we 
say more? Choice (G) completes the theme of beginning, middle, and end.
 
15. B. The words in the top row show stages of human development: An infant becomes an 
adolescent who becomes an adult. Keep the development process in mind as you examine 
the second row. A boulder eventually breaks down to become gravel. The answer choice 
that best describes the stage in between a boulder and gravel is Choice (B). A boulder 
breaks down into smaller pieces such as pebbles, which break down into gravel.
 
16. H. A planet is a smaller part of the larger solar system, which is a part of the entire galaxy. 
A stem is a part of _____, which is a part of a garden. A stem isn’t part of a root, soil, or 
rake. The answer has to be Choice (H); a stem is a part of a flower.

Test 5: Verbal Reasoning—Context
 
1. C. Because Jeffrey likes to eat soup and Steve likes to eat soup, you can conclude that both 
guys like to eat soup, Choice (C). You know what they like, but you don’t know what they 
don’t like; eliminate Choices (A) and (B). Choice (D) is completely off topic.
 
2. G. You can draw a line diagram to show the relationship from oldest to youngest: Jenny → 
Sammy Jo → Dave. Choice (F) isn’t true, and nothing in the premises gives you enough 
information to pick Choices (H) or (J). Choice (G) is right.
 
3. D. The best answer here is Choice (D). Because Karen and Melanie ride to school, you can 
conclude that they go to school. You don’t know anything about what Melanie doesn’t own 
or what Karen doesn’t like, so Choices (B) and (C) are wrong. And just because they use 
different types of transportation doesn’t mean they go to different schools.
 
4. G. Because Pauline’s team scored nine runs on Saturday, the most you know is that her 
team had a score of nine. You don’t know that nine runs were enough to win the game or 
who scored the nine runs. Choice (G) is the best answer.
 
5. A. The store sells apples, and apples are fruit; therefore, the store sells fruit, Choice (A). 
You know nothing about the size of the store, what else it sells, or who shops there.
 
6. G. The first premise tells you that Agnes walks her dog every day. That means the weather 
doesn’t affect whether she walks her dog. Because the dog doesn’t like to be in the rain, 
you can conclude that the dog isn’t fond of walks on rainy days. You don’t know what 
Agnes likes or whether she dresses her dog. Choice (G) is the best answer.
 
7. D. You can’t assume that Mama Tina owns the restaurant based on its name. Heck, you 
don’t even know that Mama Tina is a real person! Scrap Choices (A) and (B). You don’t 
know how may Italian restaurants exist other than Mama Tina’s. All you know is that 
there’s at least one Italian restaurant in the city, which means people there can get Italian 
food, Choice (D).
 
8. J. Mary must have taken a course on biology in college, Choice (J), because she works as a 
biologist and is using what she learned in college in her career as a biologist.
 
9. C. Because Rob sings in the choir and the choir sings in the musical, you can logically con-
clude that Rob sings in the spring musical, Choice (C).
 
 In the face of logic questions, avoid answer choices that require you to make value judg-
ments about a person’s abilities or assumptions about what a person likes or dislikes.
 
10. H. Choices (G) and (J) are personal judgments; eliminate them. You don’t know how much 
silver coins are worth, so you can’t assume that Choice (F) is true. Because you know that 
Greg has a gold coin worth $100 and some silver coins of some value, you can conclude 
that Greg’s collection is worth more than $100, Choice (H).
 
11. B. Eight seats are available, and one isn’t taken, which means there’s room for one more 
person to sit in the waiting room, Choice (B). You can’t assume that everyone sitting in the 
waiting room is a patient; they could be friends and/or family members of patients. Forget 
about Choices (A) and (D). And just because the waiting room has seats for only eight 
people doesn’t mean that the dentist never sees more than eight patients at one time. The 
presence of the debatable word never is a good clue that Choice (C) is wrong.
 
12. H. If aspen trees don’t grow at low altitudes and Sherry has aspen trees in her yard, then 
Sherry must not live at sea level, Choice (H), because that’s a low altitude.
 
13. D. Don’t be tempted by Choice (A). The premise says that Morgan wants to travel to San 
Francisco on Monday, but it doesn’t say she has to travel by train. Maybe if she travels by 
car, she won’t have to leave until the afternoon. Choice (D) is more precise; if Morgan trav-
els by train, she’ll have to leave early in the morning. Choices (B) and (C) make unjustified 
judgments about Morgan’s likes and the best way to travel, so they’re wrong.

14. J. You can’t assume that Joe works every hour the deli’s open, nor can you assume that 
working at the deli is Joe’s only job. Cross out Choices (F) and (H). Because the premises 
tell you that the deli isn’t open during the hours when dinner would be served, you can 
safely pick Choice (J).
 
15. A. Because Dave isn’t on a health insurance plan and employees of large corporations must 
be on a health insurance plan, Dave must not work for a large corporation, Choice (A). He 
doesn’t have to be unemployed; maybe he just works for a small company.
 
16. F. Eliminate Choice (H) because it contradicts the premise that no player plays both defense 
and offense. You can’t make the assumption that half the players play offense and half play 
defense, nor can you assume that Josh plays in every game. The best answer is Choice (F): 
The members of the team that play offense don’t play defense.
 
17. A. The premises don’t give information about other zoos or the zoo’s housing policies, 
which means you can cut Choices (B) and (D). Because the premises mention four animal 
families and tell you that each family has at least one infant, you know for sure that the zoo 
has at least four infants, Choice (A).
 
18. H. The premises don’t tell you how much time Dan spends on the lawn, which means you 
can cross out Choices (F) and (G). Choice (J) requires you to make assumptions about 
what Dan likes. If Dan mows every day, he has at least four customers in addition to the 
Petersons, Davidsons, and Stevensons. Choice (H) is the logical answer.
 
19. B. The premises tell you that the Pacific is the largest ocean, but they don’t tell you how 
big it is or anything about the relative sizes of the other oceans; cross out Choices (A) and 
(C). You also don’t know about other oceans that lap up on Australia’s shores; eliminate 
Choice (D). You know that oceans cover about 71 percent of the earth, which is less than 
75 percent. There’s no way the Indian Ocean could cover more of the earth than all the 
oceans combined; it has to cover less than 75 percent of the earth. Choice (B) is right.
 
 Don’t use your knowledge about a subject to answer logic questions. Rely only on the 
information in the premises (if you don’t, you may miss a relatively easy question).
 
20. F. You can conclude from the premises that Julie has the qualifications to go to Costa Rica 
and Rhiannon doesn’t; Choice (F) is therefore the best answer.
Test 6: Reading and Language Arts
 
1. A. The answer is in the second paragraph. Naomi meets Ruth while she is in Moab, and 
Ruth is referred to as a Moabite. The answer is Choice (A).
 
2. F. The second paragraph tells you that Ruth is Naomi’s daughter-in-law, which means 
Naomi must be Ruth’s mother-in-law, Choice (F).
 
3. D. Substitute the answers for gleans in the passage. The sentence is: It is the spring harvest 
in Bethlehem, and Ruth gleans the fields to provide food for her and her mother-in-law. Ruth 
doesn’t glow from or shine on the fields. Nor does she burn up the fields to provide food. The 
best answer is Choice (D). She picks from the fields to provide food.
 
4. J. The third paragraph describes Boaz as goodly and tells how he’s kind to Ruth, which 
means you can eliminate Choices (F), (G), and (H). The answer is Choice (J), kind.
 
5. A. The third paragraph states that Boaz is related to Naomi’s late husband, Choice (A).
 
6. G. In the last paragraph, you discover that Boaz makes sure another relative doesn’t want 
to exercise his right to marry Ruth, Choice (G). Don’t be fooled by Choice (H); Boaz tells 
Ruth to gather grain in his field, not the fields of others.
 
7. D. The last paragraph says that Naomi is well cared for. Although she was bitter before 
Ruth and Boaz marry, she’s content and cared for at the end of the passage. Toss out the 
first three answers and pick Choice (D).

478
Part IV: Practice Makes Perfect 
 
8. G. Sentence 1 has two problems. The subject is person, which is singular, but the verb make 
is plural, and the pronoun their that refers to person is also plural. Toss any choices that 
don’t correct the subject-verb agreement — specifically Choices (F) and (J). Choice (G) 
makes the subject plural so that the plural verb is okay; it’s better than Choice (H) because 
Choice (H) doesn’t correct the problem with the pronoun their.
 
9. B. In Sentence 4, the comma between happiness and she is used to join two independent 
clauses without a conjunction. Choice (A) just changes the first verb without correcting 
the punctuation problem. Choice (C) corrects the comma splice by introducing a conjunc-
tion, but it creates needless repetition with the use of also and too. The best answer is 
Choice (B); it eliminates the problem comma without creating a new error.
 
10. J. The sentence seems fine as is, but check the answers to be sure. Choice (F) adds an 
improper comma between hopeful and depiction, Choice (G) improperly capitalizes the 
story of Ruth, and Choice (H) features improper punctuation. Choice (J) it is!
 
11. C. The second paragraph says that Zoe and her friends were “very uneasy.” Choice (C), 
anxious, is a synonym for very uneasy. The other choices are antonyms.
 
12. J. Paragraph 2 tells you that the regionals are held in the city of Albany, Choice (J).
 
13. B. The passage mentions Zoe’s brother in the last two paragraphs. It refers to him as her 
“younger” brother, so you know that Choice (B) is correct.
 
14. J. The regionals are touched on in the last paragraph, which says that Zoe had butterflies 
in her stomach (meaning she was nervous, Choice (J)).
 
15. A. The reasoning you use to answer this question is similar to the logic you use to answer 
questions in the Verbal Reasoning—Context section. You can’t assume Zoe will win next 
year, and just because the passage doesn’t mention other siblings doesn’t mean they don’t 
exist. The passage implies that Zoe’s friends skated on the indoor rink, so Choice (C) is 
wrong. The best answer is Choice (A): Zoe skates on frozen ponds in Maine.
 
16. H. Zoe’s dad’s comments in the last paragraph suggest that he thought she didn’t win 
because it was her first time in the regional competition, Choice (H). He didn’t mention any 
of the reasons offered by the other options.
 
17. C. The answer that joins the two ideas best is Choice (C). Choices (A) and (B) are comma 
splices, and Choice (D) contains improper punctuation. You can’t place a comma before a 
restrictive clause such as “that she did not win.”
 
18. G. The objective form of the pronoun him is improper in Choices (F) and (H); it should be 
“he and Zoe’s brother were able to see Zoe compete.” Choice (J) contains an unclear pro-
noun reference because him could refer to either Zoe’s dad or her brother.
 
19. D. Find the sentence that transitions well into the first sentence and that addresses the spe-
cific topic of the paragraph. The first word of the first sentence is their; it’d be good to know 
who that refers to. Choice (C) talks about one person, so their doesn’t make sense. 
Choice (A) is all about ponds, and ponds don’t have daily practice routines that we know 
about. Their could refer to “some figure skaters” in Choice (B), but the rest of the paragraph 
is about Zoe and her friends, not skaters in general. Choice (D) fits best.
 
20. H. Pick Choice (H) because it talks more about Zoe, who’s the main character in the para-
graph, and builds on information provided in the paragraph.
 
21. B. As you discover in the first paragraph, the purpose of the passage is to describe the 
means silent films use to get their points across. Choice (B) paraphrases this purpose. 
Choice (A) is too specific; the musical score is just one element of silent films that the 
author describes. Choices (C) and (D) are too general. The main purpose of the passage 
isn’t to show how film in general has changed over a century, nor is it mostly concerned 
with explaining why all types of films have car chases.

479
 Chapter 28: Answers to COOP Practice Test 2
 
22. H. Eliminate the answers that are covered in the passage. Paragraphs 2 and 3 mention 
exaggerated gestures and stereotypical characters, and Paragraph 4 references perpetual 
activity, which means you can cross out Choices (F), (G), and (J). Silent films don’t contain 
dialogue, so it makes sense that the answer is Choice (H).
 
23. B. Paragraph 3 explains that actors in silent films must show their feelings with exaggerated 
gestures because they can’t say how they feel, Choice (B).
 
24. F. According to the last line of the fourth paragraph, placards express dialogue, thoughts, 
and passage of time. The answer that isn’t included is Choice (F).
 
25. C. The first sentence of the last paragraph refers to the descriptions of car chases, jail breaks, 
and skating scenes in the prior paragraph as “frenetic motion.” These antics aren’t mellow or 
calm, and muggy motion doesn’t make sense. The best answer is lively, Choice (C).
 
26. G. The answer is stated clearly in the last paragraph: Ominous chords signal danger, 
Choice (G).
 
27. D. Nothing’s wrong with Sentence 3, but you should check the other answer choices just to 
make sure another one isn’t better. Choice (A) is a comma splice. Choice (B) incorrectly 
puts a comma between its subject (actors) and verb (expressed). Choice (C) uses inconsis-
tent verb tenses; changed is past tense, and grow is present tense. The best answer is still 
Choice (D).
 
28. H. The verbs in Sentence 5 are in different tenses; were is past tense, and are is present. 
The rest of the paragraph is in the past tense, so the present tense are is incorrect. 
Choices (F) and (G) don’t solve the problem. The best answer is Choice (H).
 
29. C. Sentence 6 looks pretty good at first glance, but it contains an error that you may miss if 
you read it too quickly. In Sentence 6, the attention belongs to the audience; it’s the audi-
ence’s attention. Choice (A) incorrectly puts the apostrophe after the s, which implies there’s 
more than one audience. Choice (B) really messes things up by putting the apostrophe after 
the s and adding another s. Choice (C) correctly places the apostrophe before the s.
 
30. F. The first line of the passage describes the purposes of the digestive system as breaking 
down food and absorbing nutrients. Choice (F) states one of these purposes, breaking 
down food. The other choices describe purposes of other bodily systems.
 
31. D. The first paragraph explains that wide, flat teeth belong to herbivores, Choice (D).
 
32. J. According to Paragraph 2, food goes down the esophagus, Choice (J), after it passes 
through the mouth. It hits the esophagus before it reaches the rest of the organs involved 
in the digestion process.
 
33. C. The question asks you to choose something the small intestine doesn’t do, so you need 
to find where the passage describes what it does do. Paragraph 3 suggests that the small 
intestine breaks down food, absorbs nutrients, and receives bile from the liver. It doesn’t 
claim that it uses acids to kill bacteria, Choice (C).
 
34. G. The liver produces bile, so you can cross out Choice (F). Choices (H) and (J) are wrong 
because muscles, not acid, work to move food down the esophagus and the stomach isn’t 
designed to store food. Its purpose is to break down food, Choice (G).
 
35. D. The passage only mentions the pancreas once, and it’s to say that it produces and 
sends digestive enzymes, Choice (D).
 
36. F. Paragraph 3 explains that bile is produced in the liver, Choice (F).
 
37. B. Both sentences contain the idea of using the digestive system, so pick the answer that 
best gets rid of that duplication. Choice (A) is a comma splice that doesn’t eliminate the 
duplication of animals and they, which refers to animals. Choice (C) alters the meaning, 
and Choice (D) changes the sentence’s focus. Choice (B) is best.

Part IV: Practice Makes Perfect 
 
38. G. Choice (F) is a comma splice; cut it. Choice (H) is awkward and contains an unclear pro-
noun reference; you don’t know what it refers to. Choice (J) is a mess; it has unclear and 
faulty pronoun references and punctuation problems. Choice (G) is your best bet because 
it clearly states what’s dangerous and, using proper punctuation and construction, tells 
you what to do about the dangerous situation.
 
39. D. The paragraph describes the appendix and what causes it to rupture. Choose a topic 
sentence that introduces the primary characteristic of an appendix. Choices (A) and (C) 
are wrong because the appendix isn’t useful. Choice (B) addresses the whole body and 
would be good for introducing a discussion of bacteria. Choice (D) is the best answer 
because it focuses on the peculiar nature of the appendix.
 
40. F. The question paragraph ends by telling you that appendicitis is dangerous if it’s not 
treated properly. It wouldn’t be fair to you if the next paragraph didn’t then tell you how to 
treat appendicitis properly to avoid this danger. The best answer is therefore Choice (F). 
Choices (G) and (H) bring up unrelated topics, and Choice (J) is far too general to follow 
the specific topic of appendicitis.
Test 7: Mathematics
 
1. C. 4% is 4 per (or divided by) 100. You can express this number as either a decimal or a 
fraction, but all the answer are fractions, which means you must create a fraction: 4⁄100, 
Choice (C).
 
2. F. Multiply before you subtract: 3 × –2 = –6; –6 – 2 = –8, Choice (F).
 
 Don’t forget to follow the order of operations (PEMDAS) when faced with problems involv-
ing multiple operations.
 
3. D. The best way to simplify a square root problem is to consider a number’s factors and 
look for perfect squares. 100 is a factor of 1,300 (100 × 13 = 1,300), and 100 is a perfect 
square. So, 
, which is Choice (D).
 
4. J. You can simplify your approach to this problem by canceling out common factors in the 
numerator and denominator. Strike through 5 and 10 on both the top and bottom, and you 
get 13⁄2, which simplifies to 61⁄2 — Choice (J).
 
5. C. Follow the order of operations. Parentheses go first: –33(– 1)2 + (–3)2. Exponents next: 
–27 × 1 + 9. Then multiply and add to get –18, Choice (C).
 
 The value of a negative number with an odd-numbered exponent is negative; one with an 
even-numbered exponent is positive.
 
6. G. The 7 is in the thousands place, which means its value is 7,000, Choice (G).
 
7. C. Line up the decimal points and subtract: 
 
  
 
8. J. Because the bases are the same, you can just add the exponents. 3 + 5 = 8, which means 
the answer is 38, which is the same as Choice (J).
 
9. B. To find 3⁄5 of 15, multiply. Note: This is easier if you eliminate the common factors before 
you begin. Because 5 goes into both 15 and 5, 15⁄1 × 3⁄5 = 3⁄1 × 3⁄1. The answer is 9, Choice (B).
 
10. H. The easiest way to solve this problem is to count the zeros in the number. The number 
of zeros is the value of the exponent. 10,000 has 4 zeros, so the answer is 104, Choice (H).

481
 Chapter 28: Answers to COOP Practice Test 2
 
11. B. To find the percentage of people who didn’t answer the poll, add the percentages of 
those who did and subtract from 100: x = 100% – (13% + 37% + 12%); x = 100% – 62%; 
x = 38%. The ratio of those who answered to those who didn’t is 62:38, or 62⁄38, which 
reduces to 31⁄19, Choice (B).
 
12. H. The intersection symbol tells you that you’re looking for the numbers that are common 
to both sets of numbers. Both sets have 4 and 12 in common, Choice (H).
 
13. B. This question is really just asking for the percentage that 4⁄9 represents. 4⁄9 of the pieces is 
0.4444 . . . , or approximately 44%, which is Choice (B).
 
14. G. This problem looks for how fast the train traveled, which is the rate. Use the distance 
formula: Distance = Rate × Time. The distance was 142 miles, and the time was 2 hours. 
Plug that into the equation: 142 = r × 2; 71 = r. The train traveled 71 mph, Choice (G).
 
15. D. The numbers that appear in both sets are 10 and 11, Choice (D).
 
16. J. An equilateral triangle is a triangle with equal sides and equal angles, and the angles of 
all triangles add up to 180°. Because the first three options are true, the answer must be 
Choice (J).
 
17. C. All of the integers that are less than 9 and greater than 4 are 5, 6, 7, and 8 — Choice (C).
 
18. F. Two million is 2,000,000; five hundred-forty-five thousand looks like 545,000; and twenty-
two is 22. Add them together, and you get 2,545,022 — Choice (F).
 
19. B. 10 isn’t prime, so scratch Choice (D). Now all you have to do is figure out whether 3 and 
11 are factors of 222. 3 × 74 = 222, which means 3 is a factor; cross out Choice (A). 11, how-
ever, isn’t a factor of 222. The answer is Choice (B).
 
20. H. The other way to phrase the question is “$500 is 8% of what,” which looks like this when 
expressed as an equation: $500 = 0.08 × x. Looks like x = $6,250, Choice (H).
 
21. A. Both numbers are even, so 2 must be a common factor. Cut Choices (C) and (D) because 
they don’t include 2. Choices (A) and (B) are the same except that Choice (A) includes 4 
and Choice (B) includes 6. Choice (A) is the answer because 6 isn’t a factor of 64.
 
22. H. You can substitute x for the missing number: 4(2x) + 12 = 2,012. Now solve for x: 
8x + 12 = 2,012; 8x = 2,000; x = 250, Choice (H).
 
23. B. The formula for the area of a triangle is A = 1⁄2bh. Substitute the base and height measure-
ments into the formula: A = 1⁄2 × 15 × 12 = 90 m2, Choice (B).
 
24. G. The other five friends raised 15% of the money (100% – 85% = 15%). 15% of $1,200 means 
0.15 × 1,200, which equals $180, Choice (G).
 
25. C. The perimeter is the sum of the sides. Two of the sides are 15 yards, which is a total of 
30 yards. The other two sides are 25 yards each, which totals 50 yards. The answer is 
Choice (C) because 30 + 50 = 80.
 
26. F. Create an equation for the problem and make x the number of hours worked: 
$290 = $125 + $55x. Solve for x: $165 = $55x; 3 = x. Choice (F), 3 hours, is your answer.
 
27. B. 103 = 1,000, and 3 × 1,000 is 3,000, which is Point B on the line.
 
28. J. According to the parameters, x can be any value that’s greater than –5 and less than –3. 
Only –4, Choice (J), meets these requirements.
 
29. C. There are 2.2 pounds in a kilogram, which means you divide 25 by 2.2 to find out how 
many kilograms are in 25 pounds. 25 ÷ 2.2 = 11.3636 . . . , which rounds to 11 kg, Choice (C).
 
30. H. First, eliminate obviously incorrect answers. You know that Choice (F) is wrong 
because 5⁄6 is greater than 3⁄6. 1⁄4 is 25%, which means Choice (G) isn’t ordered properly. The 
values in Choice (J) are equal, so they can’t be arranged in ascending order. The correct 
answer is Choice (H).

482
Part IV: Practice Makes Perfect 
 
31. D. If a 6-ounce steak costs $4 less than a 12-ounce steak, which is x dollars, the price of a 
6-ounce steak is x – 4. Two of them would cost twice that, 2(x – 4), which is Choice (D).
 
32. G. Choice (G) demonstrates the distributive property because it multiplies a by both b and 
c to get ab – ac.
 
 The distributive property states that the value being multiplied by values within parenthe-
ses must be distributed to each of the values inside the parentheses.
 
33. D. The number of games the team won and tied is 20 (16 + 4 = 20). 20 games make up 40% 
of the team’s season. Therefore, 20 games = 0.4 × all games played (x). 20 ÷ 0.4 = x, 
which means x equals 50. If the team played a total of 50 games, then it lost 30 games 
(50 – 20 = 30), Choice (D).
 
34. F. One shirt costs $15 + (6% × $15), which is $15.90. $15.90 rounds up to $16. Rico has $50, 
which divided by $16 is 3.125. That means Rico can buy three shirts and have a few dollars 
left over. The correct answer is Choice (F).
 
35. C. The formula for finding the circumference of a circle is 2rπ. The spokes coming out from 
the center of a wheel are its radii. So the radius of the wheel is 20 inches. Apply this value 
to the formula, and you have your answer: C = 2(20)π, or 40π — Choice (C).
 
36. H. To answer this question, you have to know that 1 meter equals 100 centimeters. This 
means that 2 meters contain 200 centimeters. Therefore, 1 centimeter is 1⁄200 of 2 meters, 
which is Choice (H).
 
37. B. Use the information in the chart to calculate the total dollar amount of T-shirt sales: 
$125 + $130 + $140 + $105 = $500. Maria sold $125 of the $500 in T-shirt sales, or 125⁄500, which 
reduces to 1⁄4, or 25%, Choice (B).
 
38. J. The average price of the jeans is their total cost divided by the number sold. You know 
how many were sold; you just need to figure out the total cost. Add up the information in 
the jeans column of the chart: $400 + $325 + $775 + $1,100 = $2,600. $2,600 ÷ 26 = $100. The 
average price of the jeans is $100, Choice (J).
 
39. D. The pie chart, Choice (D), is the best chart to show fractions of a whole. (For the full 
scoop on how to use charts, head to Chapter 13.)
 
40. F. A Venn diagram, Choice (F), is the best way to display the desired data because it shows 
the intersection of students who play more than one sport. The other charts don’t reveal 
any information about how many students are involved in more than one sport.

Part V
The Part of Tens

In this part . . .
T
his part summarizes in a nice, neat list some of the pit-
falls to avoid as you prepare for and take your Catholic 
high school entrance exam. It also outlines ways your par-
ents can participate in your exam-preparation efforts to 
help you do your best on test day. Share Chapter 30 with 
them and take some of the pressure off of yourself.

Chapter 29
Ten Test-Taking Traps to Avoid
In This Chapter
▶ Summarizing the ways you can hurt your exam performance
▶ Recognizing how to avoid common pitfalls
T
he majority of this book focuses on what you should do to perform your best on test 
day, but this chapter highlights ten equally helpful don’ts you ought to know about.
Don’t Try to Cram the Night Before
All three Catholic high school entrance exams test you on skills you’ve learned throughout 
your life. Pulling an all-nighter doesn’t give you ample study time. Start studying at least two 
weeks before exam day so you can sleep well the night before.
Don’t Lose Your Focus
Shock of shocks, but tackling 300 multiple-choice questions can get a little boring. Don’t use 
test boredom as an excuse to let your mind wander. Keep your perspective, focus on the 
task at hand, and reward yourself when it’s all over.
Don’t Stew Over Questions on Prior Sections
Focus on doing your best in the current moment. Don’t let what you think may have been a 
poor performance on an earlier section affect the rest of your test.
Don’t Pay Attention to Other Test-Takers
Seeing others put down their pencils while you’re still slaving away can be alarming. Just 
remember that some people work more quickly than others and that speed doesn’t equal 
stellar performance. If you compare yourself to those around you, you can psych yourself 
into thinking that you’re a loser, and feeling like a loser doesn’t do much for your test score.

488
Part V: The Part of Tens 
Don’t Waste Your Time on Hard Questions
An easy question is worth the same amount of points as a hard one. So, discipline yourself 
to know when to move on. You may miss out on a simple question at the end of the test 
because you’ve stubbornly tried to answer an earlier difficult one.
Don’t Read Questions Too Quickly
You shouldn’t be so concerned about answering some 200 or 300 questions in a couple 
hours that you fly through the test. You don’t get points if you don’t answer questions 
 correctly. Reading carefully makes you more likely to mark the correct answers.
Don’t Lose Track of the Answers on Your Sheet
Keep the sections straight on your answer sheet and make sure you mark the answer to 
Question 6 in the bubble for Question 6 and not the bubble for Question 5. If you mess up 
one question, you could mess up your answer sheet from that point forward.
 
Get in the habit of checking your answer sheet about every fifth question to make sure 
you’re on track. It helps to transfer your answers to the sheet five at a time. Also, always 
circle the right answer in your test booklet so that if you discover you’ve messed up your 
answer sheet, you won’t have to reread the questions to figure out the right answers.
Don’t Blow Off Extra Time
If you finish your exam before the time is up, use those last few minutes wisely instead of 
twiddling your thumbs. Return to tough questions and double-check your answers.
Don’t Bring Electronic Devices with You
Cellphones, calculators, watches that contain calculators, and MP3 players aren’t allowed in 
the testing room. Having any of these devices on you (even if they’re in your pocket or 
purse) is grounds for dismissal from the test. Make sure you leave all electronic devices at 
home so you don’t accidentally forget you have one on you and risk getting kicked out of 
the testing site.
Don’t Cheat, Duh
It’s a no-brainer, but we still have to say it: Cheating isn’t the right thing to do, and it’s also 
just plain illogical. Your hand isn’t big enough to hold all the info you need to master the 
entrance exam, and the person next to you may know less than you do. This book gives you 
everything you need to do your best on the exam, so don’t risk messing things up by cheating.

Chapter 30
Attention, Parents! Ten Ways You Can 
Help Your Child Succeed on the Exam
In This Chapter
▶ Discovering constructive ways to help your son or daughter prepare for the HSPT, TACHS, or COOP
▶ Pointing out your role the day of the test
A
s a parent, you’re probably wondering what you can do to help your child study for 
his or her Catholic high school entrance exam. Well, wonder no longer! This chapter 
has ten action steps you can take to help your student do his or her best.
Give Him Awesome Test Prep Materials
If you bought this book for your child, you did him a huge favor. Reading this book and 
taking the practice tests within it will give your child an edge over other eighth-graders who 
haven’t prepared. Nicely done!
Encourage Her to Study
Possessing this book is one thing; actually using it is another. Help your child work out a 
study schedule and give her incentives to stick to it, such as picking out the family’s dinner 
menu for one week or allotting her a larger share of the family’s cellphone minutes.
Supply Him with a Good Study Environment
Make sure your student has a quiet study area where he can concentrate without being dis-
turbed by siblings, pets, friends, TV, the computer, or his cellphone. Quality study time is 
time spent without distractions.
Take Practice Tests with Her
You’ll be better able to discuss the questions and answers with your child if you take 
the practice tests, too. Pretend you’re a test proctor and be the official timer for your stu-
dent when she takes the full-length practice tests. Afterward, read through the answer 

490
Part V: The Part of Tens 
explanation chapters with her and help her discover which question types she may need to 
focus on improving. Then look up those particular topics earlier in the book for a refresher 
on the rules that govern them.
Model Good Grammar for Him
Help your child recognize mistakes in English-usage questions by speaking properly with 
him and gently correcting his grammar mistakes in your conversations. Before you know it, 
he’ll be correcting you!
Quiz Her on Spelling Words
Assist your student in developing a list of commonly misspelled words (see Chapter 6 for 
tips on how) and encourage her to spell them for you. In fact, why not hold a spelling bee 
for family game night?
Help Him Memorize Math Formulas
The online Cheat Sheet for this book has a list of formulas your student should memorize 
for the test. Quiz him to make sure he remembers them.
Flash Her Vocabulary Notecards
Encourage your student to write unfamiliar words from the practice tests on index cards. 
Have her look up their definitions and write them on the backs of the cards. Then work with 
her for several minutes each day to help improve her vocabulary. Also, use the words in 
your conversations with her; repetition aids word retention.
Get Him to the Test Site on Time
Take a test drive a day or two before the exam date to make sure you don’t get lost on the 
way there or encounter unexpected roadwork on the morning of the test. That day, make 
sure your kid’s alarm is set properly so he rises with plenty of time to get dressed, eat a 
healthy breakfast, and make sure he has the items he needs to take with him to the exam.
Help Her Keep a Proper Perspective
Remind your student that, although the entrance exam is important, it isn’t more important 
than her schoolwork or being good to her family. Her exam score isn’t a reflection of her 
worth (or your parenting skills). It’s just a tool Catholic high schools use to assess students’ 
skills and place them in classes.
