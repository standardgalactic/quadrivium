EDITORIAL POLICY
The Visual Dictionary takes an inventory of the physical
environment of a person who is part of today's technological age
and who knows and uses a large number of specialized terms in a
wide variety of fields.
Designed for the general public, it responds to the needs of
anyone seeking the precise, correct terms for a wide range of
personal or professional reasons: finding an unknown term,
checking the meaning of a word, translation, advertising, teaching
material, etc.
The target user has guided the choice of contents for The Visual
Dictionary, which aims to bring together in 12 thematic books the
technical terms required to express the contemporary world, in the
specialized fields that shape our daily experience.
STRUCTURE
Each tome has three sections: the preliminary pages, including the
table of contents; the body of the text (i.e. the detailed treatment
of the theme); the index.
Information is presented moving from the most abstract to the
most concrete: sub-theme, title, subtitle, illustration, terminology.
TERMINOLOGY
Each word in The Visual Dictionary has been carefully selected
following examination of high-quality documentation, at the
required level of specialization.
There may be cases where different terms are used to name the
same item. In such instances, the word most frequently used by
the most highly regarded authors has been chosen.
Words are usually referred to in the singular, even if the illustration
shows a number of individual examples. The word designates the
concept, not the actual illustration.
DEFINITIONS
Within the hierarchical format of The Visual Dictionary's
presentation, the definitions fit together like a Russian doll. For
example, the information within the definition for the term insect
at the top of the page does not have to be repeated for each of the
insects illustrated. Instead, the text concentrates on defining the
distinguishing characteristics of each insect (the louse is a
parasite, the female yellow jacket stings, and so forth). 
Since the definition leaves out what is obvious from the
illustration, the illustrations and definitions complement one
another.
The vast majority of the terms in the Visual Dictionary are defined.
Terms are not defined when the illustration makes the meaning
absolutely clear, or when the illustration suggests the usual
meaning of the word (for example, the numerous handles).
METHODS OF CONSULTATION
Users may gain access to the contents of The Visual Dictionary in
a variety of ways:
• From the TABLE OF CONTENTS at the end of the preliminary
pages, the user can locate by title the section that is of interest.
• With the INDEX, the user can consult The Visual Dictionary from
a word, so as to see what it corresponds to, or to verify accuracy
by examining the illustration that depicts it.
• The most original aspect of The Visual Dictionary is the fact that
the illustrations enable the user to ﬁnd a word even if he or she
only has a vague idea of what it is. The dictionary is unique in this
feature, as consultation of any other dictionary requires the user
ﬁrst to know the word.
